       This Report has been prepared by a team led by Millard F. Long and comprising Yoon Je Cho,
     Warren L. Coats, Jr., Eirik Evenhouse, Barbara Kafka, Catherine Mann, Gerhard PohI, Dimitri Vittas,
     Robert Vogel, and Robert Wieland. The team was assisted by Anastasios Filippides, Lynn Steckelberg

     graphical note). The International Economics Department prepared the data and projections pre-
     sented in Chapter 1 and the statistical appendix. It is also responsible for the World Development
     Indicators. The production staff of the Report included Les Barker, Pensri Kimpitak, Cathe Kocak,
     Victoria Lee, Walton Rosenquist, Nancy Snyder, and Brian J. Svikhart. Library assistance was pro-
     vided by Iris Anderson. The support staff was headed by Rhoda Blade-Charest and included Trinidad

Note: Real interest rates were calculated from nominal rates according to the following formula: 1(1 + r) 1(1 + p) - 11 x 100, where r is the deposit
rate and p is the inflation rate. Inflation is the percentage change in the consumer price index (CPI). M3 is currency plus the sum of nonbank
deposits of the public at all identified deposit-taking institutions. Real saving is gross domestic savings deflated by the average annual CPI rate.
Volatility of inflation is the absolute deviation of the inflation rate from its level the year before.

5             The current account balance (on goods, services, income, and all unrequited transfers)
              represents transactions that add to or subtract from an economy's stock of foreign financial
              items. For some purposes, however, official unrequited transfers (mainly foreign aid grants,
6             food aid, and technical assistance) are treated as being closely akin to official capital move-
              ments. A measure of the current account balance before official transfers, sometimes re-
              ferred to as "total to be financed," is then appropriate. For further information, see the
7             technical note for Table 18 but note that the table reports dollar values for each measure in
              1970 and 1987, whereas the chart traces period averages relative to GDP throughout the
              period.

Development strategies in the 1960s and 1970s influenced the shape of
financial systems in developing countries. In many countries the growth of
robust and efficient financial structures was retarded by government inter-
vention that was designed to direct credit to priority sectors and to keep
interest rates artificially low. Today, as many countries revise their ap-
proach to development to rely more on the private sector and on market
forces, the need for financial reform has become clear. The necessary
changes in policies and in financial institutions, instruments, and
marketschanges that offer countries an opportunity to fashion financial
systems capable of providing the services their economies will need in the
futureare the subject of this twelfth annual World Development Report.
  The Report reviews the financial history of both high-income and devel-
oping countries, including the policies and events leading to the present
distress of so many financial intermediaries. It then considers the prereq-
uisites for the development of more efficient financial systems: [11 Restruc-
turing troubled banks and the unprofitable firms that have borrowed from
them       Restoring macroeconomic stability       Strengthening the legal,
accounting, and regulatory frameworks of finance LI Improving the man-
agement of institutions LII Developing a more diverse set of institutions
and markets. The Report also reviews the attempts at financial liberaliza-
tion made by some countries.
  Like its predecessors, the Report contains an overview of recent develop-
ments in the world economy and a World Development Indicators annex
with comprehensive, up-to-date data on social and economic development
                                                                                         1
in more than 120 countries. These data are also available on diskette for
use with personal computers.

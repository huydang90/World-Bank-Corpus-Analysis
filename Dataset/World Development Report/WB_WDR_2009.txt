Foreword



Production concentrates in big cities, leading provinces, and wealthy nations. Half the world's
production fits onto 1.5 percent of its land. Cairo produces more than half of Egypt's GDP,
using just 0.5 percent of its area. Brazil's three south-central states comprise 15 percent of
its land, but more than half its production. And North America, the European Union, and
Japan--with fewer than a billion people--account for three-quarters of the world's wealth.
    But economic concentration leaves out some populations. In Brazil, China, and India,
for example, lagging states have poverty rates more than twice those in dynamic states.
More than two-thirds of the developing world's poor live in villages. A billion people, liv-
ing in the poorest and most isolated nations, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and
Central Asia, survive on less than 2 percent of the world's wealth.
    These geographically disadvantaged people cope every day with the reality that develop-
ment does not bring economic prosperity everywhere at once; markets favor some places
over others. But dispersing production more broadly does not necessarily foster prosperity.
Economically successful nations both facilitate the concentration of production and insti-
tute policies that make people's living standards--in terms of nutrition, education, health,
and sanitation--more uniform across space. Getting the benefits of both economic concen-
tration and social convergence requires policy actions aimed at economic integration.
    Integration should begin with institutions that ensure access to basic services such as
primary education, primary health care, adequate sanitation, and clean drinking water for
everyone. As integration becomes more difficult, adaptive policies should include roads, rail-
ways, airports, harbors, and communication systems that facilitate the movement of goods,
services, people, and ideas locally, nationally, and internationally. For places where integration
is hardest, for social or political reasons, the response should be commensurately comprehen-
sive, with institutions that unite, infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target,
such as slum upgrading programs or incentives for producers to locate in certain areas.
    Using these principles, World Development Report 2009, the 31st in the series, reframes
the policy debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration. The
report analyzes the early experience of developed countries and draws practical implications
for urbanization policies in today's developing countries. For the poorest countries in Africa
and Asia that are landlocked or otherwise isolated from world markets, the Report discusses
promising approaches to regional integration that combine institutional cooperation, shared
infrastructure, and special incentives. In growing middle-income economies, general pros-
perity can camouflage areas of persistent poverty. For such countries, the Report outlines
strategies to foster domestic integration and help the poor in the least fortunate places.
    I expect that Reshaping Economic Geography will stimulate a much-needed discussion
on the desirability of "balanced growth," which has proved elusive. And by informing
some important policy debates, it will point the way toward more inclusive and sustain-
able development.

This Report has been prepared by a team led by Indermit S. Gill, comprising Souleymane
Coulibaly, Uwe Deichmann, Maria Emilia Freire, Chorching Goh, Andreas Kopp, Somik
V. Lall, Claudio E. Montenegro, Truman Packard, and Hirotsugu Uchida. Important con-
tributions were made by Homi Kharas, Marisela Montoliu Munoz, Andrew Nelson, Mark
Roberts, Sebastian Vollmer, and Fang Xu. The team was assisted by Eduardo S.F. Alves,
Brian Blankespoor, Maximilian Hirn, Siobhan Murray, and Catalina Tejada.
   Bruce Ross-Larson was the principal editor.
   The maps were created by the World Bank's Map Design Unit under the direction of Jeff
Lecksell. Book production and printing were coordinated by the World Bank's Office of
the Publisher, under the supervision of Stephen McGroarty, Susan Graham, Rick Ludwick,
and Andres Ménèses.
   World Development Report 2009 is co-sponsored by the Development Economics Vice
Presidency (DEC) and the Sustainable Development Network (SDN). The work was conducted
under the joint guidance of François Bourguignon, Alan H. Gelb, and Justin Yifu Lin, DEC
Senior Vice Presidents at various stages of the production and dissemination of this Report,
and Katherine Sierra, SDN Vice President. Jean-Jacques Dethier, Jeffrey Lewis, Claudia Paz
Sepulveda, Laszlo Lovei, and Antonio Estache also provided valuable comments.
   World Bank Presidents Robert B. Zoellick and Paul D. Wolfowitz provided guidance
and advice, and Managing Directors Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Graeme Wheeler have been
invaluable sources of encouragement to the team.
   Two panels of advisers provided excellent advice at all stages of the Report. The Aca-
demic Panel was chaired by the Chief Economist and DEC Senior Vice President and con-
sisted of François Bourguignon, Paul Collier, Masahisa Fujita, Vernon Henderson, Philippe
Martin, Ravi Kanbur, Lord Nicholas Stern, and Anthony Venables. The Policymaker Panel
was chaired by the SDN Vice President and consisted of Lobna Abdellatif Ahmed, Newai
Gebreab, Jerzy Kwiecinski, Shantong Li, Katharina Mathernova, Charbel Nahas, Enrique
Peñalosa, Carolina Renteria, Kamal Siddiqui, Jorge Wilheim, and Natalia Zubarevich.
   Many others outside and inside the World Bank contributed with comments and sug-
gestions. The team benefited greatly from many consultations, meetings, and regional
workshops held locally and in Côte d'Ivoire, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Nor-
way, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Tanzania, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. The team
wishes to thank participants in these and other workshops, videoconferences, and on-line
discussions, which included academics, policy researchers, government officials, and staff
of nongovernmental, civil society, and private sector organizations.
   The team would like to acknowledge the generous support of the United Kingdom's
Department for International Development, the multi-donor Knowledge for Change Pro-
gram, the Government of Norway, the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development
Trust Fund, the Institute for Environment and Sustainability in the Joint Research Centre
of the European Commission, Germany's Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.
   Rebecca Sugui served as senior executive assistant to the team, Ofelia Valladolid as pro-
gram assistant, and Jason Victor and Maria Hazel Macadangdang as team assistants. Evan-
geline Santo Domingo served as resource management assistant.                                   xv

Data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the
Classification of Economies table at the beginning of the Selected World Development
Indicators. Income classifications are based on gross national income (GNP) per capita;
thresholds for income classifications in this edition may be found in the Introduction to
Selected World Development Indicators. Group averages reported in the figures and tables
are unweighted averages of the countries in the group, unless noted to the contrary.
   The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes
low- and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from
central planning, as a matter of convenience. The terms industrialized countries or devel-
oped countries may be used as a matter of convenience to denote high-income economies.
   Dollar figures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified. Billion means 1,000
million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

Growing cities, ever more mobile people, and increasingly specialized products are integral to development. These changes have
been most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Northeast Asia. But countries in East and South Asia and Eastern
Europe are now experiencing changes that are similar in their scope and speed. World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Eco-
nomic Geography concludes that such transformations will remain essential for economic success in other parts of the developing
world and should be encouraged.

    One thing is common to the policy debates on urbanization, area development, and globalization. In their current form, they over-
emphasize geographic targeting--what to do in rural areas or in slums, what to do in lagging states or remote areas, and what to do
in the most poor or landlocked countries. The Report reframes these debates in a way that better conforms to the reality of growth and
development. The reality is that the interaction between leading and lagging places is the key to economic development. The reality is
that spatially targeted interventions are just a small part of what governments can do to help places that are not doing well. The reality
is that, besides place-based incentives, governments have far more potent instruments for integration. They can build institutions that
unify all places and put in place infrastructure that connects some places to others.
    The Report calls for rebalancing these policy discussions to include all the instruments of integration--institutions that unify,
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target. And it shows how to use the three dimensions of density, distance, and
division to tailor the use of these policy instruments to address integration challenges that range from the relatively straightforward
to the most complicated.


Overview




Economic growth will be unbalanced, but development still can be inclusive--that is the mes-
sage of this year's World Development Report. As economies grow from low to high income,
production becomes more concentrated spatially. Some places--cities, coastal areas, and con-
nected countries--are favored by producers. As countries develop, the most successful ones also
institute policies that make living standards of people more uniform across space. The way to get
both the immediate benefits of the concentration of production and the long-term benefits of a
convergence in living standards is economic integration.
   Although the problems of economic integration defy simple solutions, the guiding principle
does not have to be complex. The policy mix should be calibrated to match the difficulty of the
development challenge, determined by the economic geography of places. Today, policy discus-
sions about geographic disparities in development often start and end with a consideration of
spatially targeted interventions. The Report reframes these debates to include all instruments for
economic integration--institutions, infrastructure, and incentives. The bedrock of integration
efforts should be spatially blind institutions. As the challenges posed by geography become more
difficult, the response should include connective infrastructure. In places where integration is
hardest, the policy response should be commensurately comprehensive: institutions that unite,
infrastructure that connects, and interventions that target.

When Europeans began to colonize beyond their shores, the prospects for economic growth in North America seemed remote. Dur-
ing the Seven Years' War (1756­63), as the French and British battled over Canada, Voltaire wondered why they should fight over
"a few acres of snow." They should have been more interested in the economic potential of the Caribbean, where climate and soil
were good for growing sugarcane, and they were. Manhattan was famously traded away by the Dutch in exchange for land around
Suriname. But over time, it has been the few acres of snow and the rocky landscape of Plymouth (Massachusetts) that gave birth to
the "reversal of fortune" between frigid northeastern America and the warmer south.1

                    Seeing Development in 3-D




As the world's economy grows, people and production are concentrating, pulled as if by

gravity to prosperous places--growing cities, leading areas, and connected countries. As it

did decades ago in today's high-income countries, the drive to density in low- and middle-

income countries can increase the sense of deprivation as the economic distance between

prosperous areas and those left behind widens. And although rapid advances in transport

and communication increasingly bind together geographically distant communities around

the world and open new opportunities for exchange, political divisions that obstruct

the ow of people, capital, and goods remain. Part one of this Report de nes the spatial

dimensions--density, distance, and division--and describes their evolution with economic

development. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 show how the economic geography at the local, national,

and international scales is changing, and how the scope and pace of these changes

compare with transformations in the economic geography of North America, Europe, and

Japan when they were at similar stages of development. This broad sweep of stylized facts

informs the analysis in part two and the policy discussions in part three of the Report.

        shaping economic geography




In the past generation, there has been a slow revolution in economic thought, brought

about by the recognition of imperfectly competitive markets, due mainly to increasing

returns to scale, spillovers, and circular causation. A new way of thinking has transformed

the classical analysis of industrial organization, economic growth, and international

trade, and has delivered what were at rst controversial, but now widely accepted,

implications for the progress of developing countries. Part two of the Report illustrates

the interplay between scale economies, factor mobility, and transport costs to explain

the formidable forces that shape the spatial transformation described in part one.

Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are the stops in a tour of the"engine room,"each spotlighting a

di erent facet of the interactions among agglomeration, migration, and specialization.

   Note: To compute foreign market potential, each country is assigned a score for the size of international markets with which it can trade. This is computed by weighting
   the GDP of other countries by the inverse of a measure that combines physical distance, transport costs, and barriers to trade to show how difficult it is to access these
   markets. The measure, which is expressed relative to the foreign market potential of the United States, essentially combines the two spatial dimensions of distance and
   division into a composite of potential market access that does not include the effect of the home market (density). This map is a complement to map 9.2 showing Real
   Market Access.

When Admiral Zheng He brought a giraffe to Nanjing in 1415, it was believed to be a heavenly beast, associated with great peace
and prosperity. It also marked the heyday of Chinese influence in East Asia and the region's wealth relative to the rest of the world.
China at the time was probably the world's largest economy, enjoying the highest standard of material, living with flourishing art
and education and advances in a range of technologies. Its naval skills had enabled voyages to places as far away as Africa.

in remote and underserved areas, and the"bottom billion"? Part three of the Report

provides the answer: economic integration. How? By using spatially blind institutions,

spatially connective infrastructure, and spatially targeted incentives and calibrating the

response to the di culty of integration. Chapter 7 explains what economic integration

means for metropolises, cities, towns, and villages. Chapter 8 proposes how integration

between economically leading and lagging areas can bene t everyone. Chapter 9

lays out the di cult steps needed to successfully integrate the world's most isolated

countries. In doing so, the chapters in part three revisit and reframe long-standing policy

debates on urbanization, territorial development, and international integration.

Note: To compute potential market access: Each country is assigned a score for the size of its own market (real GDP) and the size of international markets with which it can trade.
This is computed by weighting the GDP of other countries by the inverse of a measure that combines physical distance, transport costs, and barriers to trade to show how difficult
it is to access these markets. The measure, which is expressed relative to the market access of the United States, essentially combines all three spatial dimensions of density,
distance, and division into a composite of potential market access. This map is a complement to the map showing foreign market access in box 6.6.

a. The distinction between official aid, for countries on the Part II list of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), and official development assistance was dropped in
2005. Regional aggregates include data for economies not listed in the table. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by country or region. b. Total for the 5-year
period. c. Includes Luxembourg. d. Data are from debt sustainability analysis undertaken as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. e. Includes re-exports. f.
Data on total exports and imports refer to South Africa only. Data on export commodity shares refer to the South African Customs Union (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and South
Africa). g. GNI refers to mainland Tanzania only. h. World total computed by the UN sums to zero, but because the aggregates shown here refer to World Bank definitions, regional
and income group totals do not equal zero.

reshaping
economic
geography

Places do well when they promote transformations along the dimensions
of economic geography: higher densities as cities grow; shorter
distances as workers and businesses migrate closer to density; and
fewer divisions as nations lower their economic borders and enter
world markets to take advantage of scale and trade in specialized
products. World Development Report 2009 concludes that the
transformations along these three dimensions--density, distance, and
division--are essential for development and should be encouraged.

The conclusion is controversial. Slum-dwellers now number a billion,
but the rush to cities continues. A billion people live in lagging areas of
developing nations, remote from globalization's many benefits. And poverty
and high mortality persist among the world's "bottom billion," trapped
without access to global markets, even as others grow more prosperous
and live ever longer lives. Concern for these three intersecting billions often
comes with the prescription that growth must be spatially balanced.

This report has a different message: economic growth will be unbalanced.
To try to spread it out is to discourage it--to fight prosperity, not
poverty. But development can still be inclusive, even for people who
start their lives distant from dense economic activity. For growth to be
rapid and shared, governments must promote economic integration,
the pivotal concept, as this report argues, in the policy debates on
urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration. Instead,
all three debates overemphasize place-based interventions.

Reshaping Economic Geography reframes these debates to include
all the instruments of integration--spatially blind institutions, spatially
connective infrastructure, and spatially targeted interventions. By
calibrating the blend of these instruments, today's developers can
reshape their economic geography. If they do this well, their growth
will still be unbalanced, but their development will be inclusive.

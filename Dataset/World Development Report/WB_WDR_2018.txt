 57	Part II: The learning crisis
 58	Chapter 2: The great schooling expansion—and those it has left
     behind
 58	 Most children have access to basic education
 60	Poverty, gender, ethnicity, disability, and location explain most remaining schooling
     disparities
 63	 For poor parents, schooling requires trade-offs

 68	    Spotlight 1: The biology of learning

 71	    Chapter 3: The many faces of the learning crisis
 71	    For too many, learning isn’t happening
 78	    Poor children learn the least, which hurts them the most
 78	    What is causing the learning crisis?

 88	Spotlight 2: Poverty hinders biological development and
     undermines learning

 91	 Chapter 4: To take learning seriously, start by measuring it
 91	 The learning crisis is often hidden—but measurement makes it visible
 92	Measures for learning guide action
 93	Measures of learning spur action

                                                                                             v

                    112	Chapter 5: There is no learning without prepared, motivated
                         learners
                    112	 Investing in their early years prepares children for school
                    116	 Providing demand-side support can get kids to school, but not necessarily to learn
                    119	 Remedial education can prepare learners for further education and training

                    131	Chapter 6: Teacher skills and motivation both matter (though many
                         education systems act like they don’t)
                    131	 Most teacher training is ineffective, but some approaches work
                    133	 Helping teachers teach to the level of the student has proven effective
                    136	 Teacher motivation and incentives make a difference, even with few inputs

                    145	Chapter 7: Everything else should strengthen the teacher-learner
                         interaction
                    145	Technological interventions increase learning—but only if they enhance the
                         teacher-learner relationship
                    147	Other inputs bring learners to school—but promote learning only if they target
                         teaching and learning
                    148	School management and governance are crucial, and involving communities
                         can help overcome incentive problems and information failures—but only if
                         communities have capacity

                    154	 Chapter 8: Build on foundations by linking skills training to jobs
                    154	 Workplace training can help young people develop skills, yet few benefit from it
                    156	 Short-term job training offers opportunities, but most programs fail to deliver
                    156	TVET can prepare young people for work, but early sorting into TVET can limit
                         career growth
                    157	 Successful job training programs share several features

                    164	Spotlight 5: Technology is changing the world of work: What does
                         that mean for learning?

Foreword

Education and learning raise aspirations, set values, and ultimately enrich lives. The coun-
try where I was born, the Republic of Korea, is a good example of how education can play
these important roles. After the Korean War, the population was largely illiterate and deeply
impoverished. The World Bank said that, without constant foreign aid, Korea would find it
difficult to provide its people with more than the bare necessities of life. The World Bank
considered even the lowest interest rate loans to the country too risky.
    Korea understood that education was the best way to pull itself out of economic misery,
so it focused on overhauling schools and committed itself to educating every child—and
educating them well. Coupled with smart, innovative government policies and a vibrant
private sector, the focus on education paid off. Today, not only has Korea achieved universal
literacy, but its students also perform at the highest levels in international learning assess-
ments. It’s a high-income country and a model of successful economic development.
    Korea is a particularly striking example, but we can see the salutary effects of education
in many countries. Delivered well, education—and the human capital it creates—has many
benefits for economies, and for societies as a whole. For individuals, education promotes
employment, earnings, and health. It raises pride and opens new horizons. For societies, it
drives long-term economic growth, reduces poverty, spurs innovation, strengthens institu-
tions, and fosters social cohesion.
    In short, education powerfully advances the World Bank Group’s twin strategic goals:
ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity. Given that today’s students will be
tomorrow’s citizens, leaders, workers, and parents, a good education is an investment with
enduring benefits.
    But providing education is not enough. What is important, and what generates a real
return on investment, is learning and acquiring skills. This is what truly builds human
capital. As this year’s World Development Report documents, in many countries and commu-
nities learning isn’t happening. Schooling without learning is a terrible waste of precious
resources and of human potential.
    Worse, it is an injustice. Without learning, students will be locked into lives of poverty
and exclusion, and the children whom societies fail the most are those most in need of
a good education to succeed in life. Learning conditions are almost always much worse
for the disadvantaged, and so are learning outcomes. Moreover, far too many children still
aren’t even attending school. This is a moral and economic crisis that must be addressed
immediately.
    This year’s Report provides a path to address this economic and moral failure. The
detailed analysis in this Report shows that these problems are driven not only by service
delivery failings in schools but also by deeper systemic problems. The human capital lost


                                                                                                  xi
                     because of these shortcomings threatens development and jeopardizes the future of peo-
                     ple and their societies. At the same time, rapid technological change raises the stakes: to
                     compete in the economy of the future, workers need strong basic skills and foundations for
                     adaptability, creativity, and lifelong learning.
                        To realize education’s promise, we need to prioritize learning, not just schooling. This
                     Report argues that achieving learning for all will require three complementary strategies:

                        • First, assess learning to make it a serious goal. Information itself creates incentives
                           for reform, but many countries lack the right metrics to measure learning.

                        • Second, act on evidence to make schools work for learning. Great schools build
                           strong teacher-learner relationships in classrooms. As brain science has advanced
                           and educators have innovated, the knowledge of how students learn most
                           effectively has greatly expanded. But the way many countries, communities,
                           and schools approach education often differs greatly from the most promising,
                           evidence-based approaches.

                        • Third, align actors to make the entire system work for learning. Innovation in
                           classrooms won’t have much impact if technical and political barriers at the sys-
                           tem level prevent a focus on learning at the school level. This is the case in many
                           countries stuck in low-learning traps; extricating them requires focused attention
                           on the deeper causes.

                         The World Bank Group is already incorporating the key findings of this Report into our
                     operations. We will continue to seek new ways to scale up our commitment to education
                     and apply our knowledge to serve those children whose untapped potential is wasted. For
                     example, we are developing more useful measures of learning and its determinants. We
                     are ensuring that evidence guides operational practice to improve learning in areas such as
                     early-years interventions, teacher training, and educational technology. We are making
                     sure that our project analysis and strategic country diagnoses take into account the full
                     range of system-level opportunities and limitations—including political constraints. And
                     we will continue to emphasize operational approaches that allow greater innovation and
                     agility.
                         Underlying these efforts is the World Bank Group’s commitment to ensuring that all of
                     the world’s students have the opportunity to learn. Realizing education’s promise means
                     giving them the chance not only to compete in tomorrow’s economy, but also to improve
                     their communities, build stronger countries, and move closer to a world that is finally free
                     of poverty.

together with the Chief Economist, cochaired the panel), Michelle Bachelet, Rukmini
Banerji, Julia Gillard, Eric Hanushek, Olli-Pekka Heinonen, Ju-Ho Lee, and Serigne Mbaye
Thiam. Although the team valued their advice and found it very useful, the views expressed
in the Report do not necessarily reflect those of the panel members.
    The team also benefited at an early stage from consultations on emerging themes with
the Chief Economist’s Council of Eminent Persons. Council members providing comments
were Montek Singh Ahluwalia, François Bourguignon, Heba Handoussa, Justin Yifu Lin,
Ory Okolloh, Pepi Patrón, Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz, Finn Tarp, and Maria Hermínia
Tavares de Almeida.
    Paul Holtz was the principal editor of the Report. Bruce Ross-Larson provided editorial
guidance, and Sabra Ledent and Gwenda Larsen copyedited and proofread the Report. Kurt
Niedermeier was the principal graphic designer. Alejandra Bustamante and Surekha Mohan
provided resource management support for the team. Phillip Hay, Mikael Reventar, Anushka
Thewarapperuma, and Roula Yazigi, together with Patricia da Camara and Kavita Watsa,
provided guidance and support on communication and dissemination. Special thanks are
extended to Mary Fisk, Patricia Katayama, Stephen Pazdan, and the World Bank’s Formal
Publishing Program. The team would also like to thank Maria Alyanak, Laverne Cook, Maria
del Camino Hurtado, Chorching Goh, Vivian Hon, Elena Chi-Lin Lee, Nancy Tee Lim, David
Rosenblatt, and Bintao Wang for their coordinating roles.

 Learning to realize

“Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world.”
 NELSON MANDELA (2003)

 If your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.”

for lack of data. Minimum proficiency in mathematics is benchmarked to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) assessment and in reading to the Progress in
International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) assessment. Minimum proficiency in mathematics means that students have some basic mathematical knowledge such as adding or subtracting
whole numbers, recognizing familiar geometric shapes, and reading simple graphs and tables (Mullis and others 2016). Minimum proficiency in reading means that students can locate and
retrieve explicitly stated detail when reading literary texts and can locate and reproduce explicitly stated information from the beginning of informational texts (Mullis and others 2012).

Note: The Perry Preschool experiment was an intensive effort to enroll children from low-income families in preschool in Ypsilanti, Michigan. The “I Have
a Dream” scholarships were high school scholarships targeted to fifth-grade students who qualified (because of their family’s poverty status) for free or
reduced-price lunch in Lafayette, Colorado. The STAR Experiment assigned some students in kindergarten through grade 3 in Tennessee to smaller class sizes.
The measure of voting differs across the studies, but corresponds to a time between 2000 and 2004 when the participants would have already graduated from
high school.

 Note: Years of schooling in Singapore are the same as learning-adjusted years because Singapore, which scored highest on the Trends in International
 Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) mathematics assessment in 2015, serves as the basis for comparison in this illustration. For the purposes of this
 illustration, data for years of education in the United Kingdom are adjusted using the TIMSS score for England. Note that for all countries and economies,
 the size of the adjustment will reflect the scale of the metric used to make it.

interventions can yield significant benefits.21 Breast-

    Programs that build caregivers’ capacity to sup-

children’s outcomes. Interventions include coaching
caregivers at home on positive discipline, as well as
promoting increased frequency of quality interven-
tions through nurturing, protection, and stimulating
activities (storytelling, singing, playing with house-
hold objects). Such interventions have been delivered
in diverse ways, including home visits, community
meetings, and health checkups.24 The most effective
programs have systematic training and curriculums,
as well as opportunities for caregivers to practice

Education systems are often poorly aligned with learning goals. These
misalignments are driven in part by technical complexities: education systems
simultaneously pursue many (often conflicting) goals, with the many system actors
continually interacting in complex ways. Compounding these technical challenges
is the limited policy implementation capacity of the many government agencies
responsible for learning.

Politics can intensify misalignments in education systems, when the vested interests
of stakeholders divert systems away from learning. This can happen at various stages,
from setting policy goals to designing, implementing, evaluating, and sustaining
reforms. Even when many individual actors are committed to learning, a system can
remain stuck in a low-learning trap.

     Note: Level of democracy is measured by the polity score, which consists of an evaluation of the competitiveness and openness of elections, the nature of
     political participation in general, and the extent of checks on executive authority. A high positive score corresponds to strong democratic institutions; negative
     scores indicate more autocratic systems. Trade openness is measured by the inverted Hiscox Kastner score, which gauges the degree to which a country
     deviates from an optimal level of imports from a hypothetical protection-free environment. Higher scores indicate greater openness.

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint. In
support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and print-on-
demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide. Together, these
initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping distances decreased, resulting
in reduced paper consumption, chemical use, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.
    We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)–certified paper, with nearly all containing 50–100 percent recycled content.
The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached using totally
chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine–free (PCF), or enhanced elemental chlorine–
free (EECF) processes.

Every year, the World Bank’s World Development Report (WDR) features
a topic of central importance to global development. The 2018 WDR—
LEARNING to Realize Education’s Promise—is the first ever devoted entirely
to education. And the time is right: education has long been critical to
human welfare, but it is even more so in a time of rapid economic and social
change. The best way to equip children and youth for the future is to make
their learning the center of all efforts to promote education.




The 2018 WDR explores four main themes:

First, education’s promise: education is a powerful instrument for eradicating
poverty and promoting shared prosperity, but fulfilling its potential requires
better policies—both within and outside the education system.

Second, the need to shine a light on learning: despite gains in access to
education, recent learning assessments reveal that many young people around
the world, especially those who are poor or marginalized, are leaving school
unequipped with even the foundational skills they need for life. At the same
time, internationally comparable learning assessments show that skills in
many middle-income countries lag far behind what those countries aspire
to. And too often these shortcomings are hidden—so as a first step to
tackling this learning crisis, it is essential to shine a light on it by assessing
student learning better.

Third, how to make schools work for all learners: research on areas such
as brain science, pedagogical innovations, and school management has
identified interventions that promote learning by ensuring that learners
are prepared, teachers are both skilled and motivated, and other inputs
support the teacher-learner relationship.

Fourth, how to make systems work for learning: achieving learning
throughout an education system requires more than just scaling up
effective interventions. Countries must also overcome technical and
political barriers by deploying salient metrics for mobilizing actors and
tracking progress, building coalitions for learning, and taking an adaptive
approach to reform.

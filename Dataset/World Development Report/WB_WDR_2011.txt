Foreword


In 1944, delegates from 45 countries gathered at Bretton Woods to consider the economic
causes of the World War that was then still raging, and how to secure the peace. They agreed
to create the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the original
institution of what has become the World Bank Group. As the delegates noted, “Programs of
reconstruction and development will speed economic progress everywhere, will aid political
stability and foster peace.” The IBRD approved its ﬁrst loan to France in 1947 to aid in the
rebuilding of that country.
    Over 60 years later, the “R” in IBRD has a new meaning: reconstructing Afghanistan, Bos-
nia, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Southern Sudan, and other lands of conﬂict or
broken states. Paul Collier’s book, The Bottom Billion, highlighted the recurrent cycles of weak
governance, poverty, and violence that have plagued these lands. Not one low-income coun-
try coping with these problems has yet achieved a single Millennium Development Goal.
And the problems of fragile states spread easily: They drag down neighbors with violence
that overﬂows borders, because conﬂicts feed on narcotics, piracy, and gender violence, and
leave refugees and broken infrastructure in their wake. Their territories can become breeding
grounds for far-reaching networks of violent radicals and organized crime.
    In 2008, I gave a speech on “Securing Development” to the International Institute for Stra-
tegic Studies. I chose the forum to emphasize the interconnections among security, gover-
nance, and development, and to make the point that the separate disciplines are not well
integrated to address the inter-related problems. I outlined the challenge: bringing security
and development together to put down roots deep enough to break the cycles of fragility and
conﬂict.
    As we are now seeing again in the Middle East and North Africa, violence in the 21st cen-
tury differs from 20th-century patterns of interstate conﬂict and methods of addressing them.
Stove-piped government agencies have been ill-suited to cope, even when national interests or
values prompt political leaders to act. Low incomes, poverty, unemployment, income shocks
such as those sparked by volatility in food prices, rapid urbanization, and inequality between
groups all increase the risks of violence. External stresses, such as trafﬁcking and illicit ﬁnan-
cial ﬂows, can add to these risks.
    The 2011 World Development Report looks across disciplines and experiences drawn from
around the world to offer some ideas and practical recommendations on how to move beyond
conﬂict and fragility and secure development. The key messages are important for all coun-
tries—low, middle, and high income—as well as for regional and global institutions:
    First, institutional legitimacy is the key to stability. When state institutions do not adequately
protect citizens, guard against corruption, or provide access to justice; when markets do not
provide job opportunities; or when communities have lost social cohesion—the likelihood



                                                                                                         xi

      of violent conﬂict increases. At the earliest stages, countries often need to restore public con-
      ﬁdence in basic collective action even before rudimentary institutions can be transformed.
      Early wins—actions that can generate quick, tangible results—are critical.
          Second, investing in citizen security, justice, and jobs is essential to reducing violence. But
      there are major structural gaps in our collective capabilities to support these areas. There
      are places where fragile states can seek help to build an army, but we do not yet have similar
      resources for building police forces or corrections systems. We need to put greater emphasis
      on early projects to create jobs, especially through the private sector. The Report provides
      insight into the importance of the involvement of women in political coalitions, security and
      justice reform, and economic empowerment.
          Third, confronting this challenge effectively means that institutions need to change. Interna-
      tional agencies and partners from other countries must adapt procedures so they can respond
      with agility and speed, a longer-term perspective, and greater staying power. Assistance needs
      to be integrated and coordinated; multi-donor trust funds have proven useful in accomplish-
      ing these aims while lessening the burdens of new governments with thin capacity. We need
      a better handoff between humanitarian and development agencies. And we need to accept a
      higher level of risk: If legislatures and inspectors expect only the upside, and just pillory the
      failures, institutions will steer away from the most difﬁcult problems and strangle themselves
      with procedures and committees to avoid responsibility. This Report suggests some speciﬁc
      actions and ways of measuring results.
          Fourth, we need to adopt a layered approach. Some problems can be addressed at the coun-
      try level, but others need to be addressed at a regional level, such as developing markets that
      integrate insecure areas and pooling resources for building capacity. Some actions are needed
      at a global level, such as building new capacities to support justice reform and the creation of
      jobs; forging partnerships between producer and consumer countries to stem illegal trafﬁck-
      ing; and acting to reduce the stresses caused by food price volatility.
          Fifth, in adopting these approaches, we need to be aware that the global landscape is chang-
      ing. Regional institutions and middle income countries are playing a larger role. This means
      we should pay more attention to south-south and south-north exchanges, and to the recent
      transition experiences of middle income countries.
          The stakes are high. A civil conﬂict costs the average developing country roughly 30 years
      of GDP growth, and countries in protracted crisis can fall over 20 percentage points behind in
      overcoming poverty. Finding effective ways to help societies escape new outbursts or repeated
      cycles of violence is critical for global security and global development—but doing so requires
      a fundamental rethinking, including how we assess and manage risk.
          Any such changes must be based on a clear roadmap, and on strong incentives. I hope this
      Report will help others and ourselves in sketching such a roadmap.

Glossary


Organized violence—the use or threat of physical force by groups. Includes state actions
against other states or against civilians, civil wars, electoral violence between opposing sides,
communal conﬂicts based on regional, ethnic, religious or other group identities or compet-
ing economic interests, gang-based violence and organized crime and international nonstate
armed movements with ideological aims. While an important topic for development, we do
not cover domestic or interpersonal violence. At times we refer to violence or conﬂict as a
short-hand for organized violence, understood in these terms. Many countries address certain
forms of violence, such as terrorist attacks by nonstate armed movements, as matters that are
subject to their criminal laws.

Repeated cycles of violence—Countries or subnational areas that have seen more than one
episode of organized violence for 20–30 years.

Stresses—The political, social, security, or economic risks that correlate with organized vio-
lence. Violence is more likely when a combination of stresses operate in an environment
characterized by weak institutions. Stresses can be internal—within the potential capacity of
an individual state to control—or external, emanating from regional or global dynamics.

Conﬁdence—Trust between groups of citizens who have been divided by violence, between
citizens and the state, and between the state and other stakeholders (neighbors, international
partners, investors).

Expectations—The way people make judgments about the future and how it will affect them,
their families, and their communities. In situations where a track record of violence has cre-
ated low trust, both excessively low and excessively high expectations can create problems for
government policy.

Elite pacts—Formal or informal agreements by the holders of political, military, or economic
power. These agreements, often enforced through coercion and patronage, are typically “per-
sonalized,” based on individual agreements. Throughout history the key motivating factor in
forming an elite pact has been the wish to contain violence and to secure the property and
economic interests and opportunities of pact members. The Report argues that elite pacts
can provide short term security but that violence often recurs unless the pact broadens and is
accompanied by institutional transformation.

      Institutions—The formal and informal “rules of the game.” They include formal rules, written
      laws, organizations, informal norms of behavior and shared beliefs—and the organizational
      forms that exist to implement and enforce these norms (both state and nonstate organiza-
      tions). Institutions shape the interests, incentives, and behaviors that can facilitate violence.
      Unlike elite pacts, institutions are impersonal—they continue to function irrespective of the
      presence of particular leaders, and thus provide greater guarantees of sustained resilience to
      violence. Institutions operate at all levels of society—local, national, regional, and global.

      Fragility and fragile situations—Periods when states or institutions lack the capacity, account-
      ability, or legitimacy to mediate relations between citizen groups and between citizens and the
      state, making them vulnerable to violence. Research for the Report reinforces the close link
      between institutional fragility and the risk of conﬂict.

      Legitimacy—Normatively, this term denotes a broad-based belief that social, economic, or
      political arrangements and outcomes are proper and just. The concept is typically applied to
      institutions. Legitimacy is acquired by building trust and conﬁdence among various parties.
      Forms of legitimacy include process legitimacy (which relates to the way in which decisions
      are made), performance legitimacy (which relates to action, including the delivery of public
      goods), and international legitimacy (which relates to the discharge of values and responsibili-
      ties that international law view as the responsibility of states).

      Capacity—The ability of institutions to carry out their core functions efﬁciently and effec-
      tively. When states lack this capacity, they cannot mitigate stresses that might induce organized
      violence.

      Accountability—The ability of institutions to be responsive to citizens, including abiding by
      their aggregated preferences, disclosing necessary information, permitting citizen participa-
      tion in decision-making, and allowing for citizen sanction of public ofﬁcials on the basis of
      publicly recognized norms and procedures.

      Citizen security—Both freedom from physical violence and freedom from fear of violence.
      Applied to the lives of all members of a society (whether nationals of the country or other-
      wise), it encompasses security at home, in the workplace, and in political, social, and economic
      interactions with the state and other members of society. Similar to human security, “citizen
      security” places people at the center of efforts to prevent and recover from violence.

      Justice and inclusion—The Report uses justice in two ways. The ﬁrst use refers to the broadly
      held notion of fairness. While this varies in different societies, it is a universally identiﬁ-
      able concept and carries the notion of fair process and due outcomes in the distribution of
      political power, resources, opportunities, and sanctions. The second use is more speciﬁc: the
      institutions that are central to resolving conﬂicts arising over alleged violations or different
      interpretations of the rules that societies create to govern members’ behavior; and that, as
      a consequence, are central to strengthening the normative framework (laws and rules) that
      shapes public and private actions. This includes the elements of the justice system most critical
      to preventing or transitioning out of violence: core criminal justice functions—the ability of
      the police, courts, and penal system to fairly investigate, prosecute and punish acts linked to
      organized violence—and institutions required to address underlying disputes that contribute
      to violence (for example, institutions that deal with land and property dispute resolution).
                                                                                           Glossary    xvii



Transition moments—Events that make new efforts to prevent or recover from violence pos-
sible. These can involve space for deep and wide-ranging change (for example, the end of a
war, a deep national crisis, a change in government after one party has been in power many
years) or more limited change (a new governmental reform plan or shift in key appointments,
negotiations or coalition-building between different actors in society, events that spur reﬂec-
tion in society such as riots, military defeats, natural disasters, or key political anniversaries).

Collaborative, inclusive-enough coalitions—Unlike elite pacts, these coalitions involve broader
segments of society—local governments, business, labor, civil society movements, in some
cases opposition parties. Coalitions are “inclusive enough” when they involve the parties nec-
essary to restore conﬁdence and transform institutions and help create continued momen-
tum for positive change; and when there is local legitimacy for excluding some groups—for
example because of electoral gains, or because groups or individuals have been involved in
abuses.

Signaling—Demonstrating an intention to break with past policies—in the context of this
Report, policies that have increased violent risks. Signals are designed to mobilize coalitions
of support, and can be made through announcements or through actions—for example,
appointments and redeployments of security forces.

Commitment mechanisms—Ways to persuade stakeholders that intentions to break with past
policies will not be reversed, including creating independent functions for implementing or
monitoring agreements.

Early results—Visible improvements to security, justice, and inclusion, economic oppor-
tunities, and services, delivered in the ﬁrst 100 days and the ﬁrst 12 months following an
announced change in policy prevent or recover from violent crises.

Sequencing and prioritizing reforms—Deciding on the type and scope of changes societies will
make ﬁrst, those that will be addressed later, and the timeframes for achieving change.

Pragmatic, best-ﬁt approaches—Programs, institutions and reforms that are not technically
the lowest-cost option for achieving outcomes, but are adapted to local political, security, and
institutional realities.

Transforming institutions—Developing over time “rules of the game” that increase resilience
to risks of violence, including laws, organizations, norms of behavior, and shared beliefs that
ensure that the beneﬁts from individuals choosing to act peacefully and lawfully exceed the
costs.
Methodological Note


One of the greatest challenges in researching lessons on violence prevention and recovery
is the lack of available quantitative and qualitative data, due to challenges of security and
access, along with low statistical capacity. Even in the World Bank’s comprehensive data sets,
countries most affected by violence often register empty data columns. Polling, household
surveys, and evaluations of the impacts of policies and project interventions are also limited
in violence-affected countries and regions.
    A growing body of literature on civil war focuses more on the causes of war than on the
policies to prevent or recover from violence, and less analysis is available on organized crimi-
nal violence. Over the past decade, however, this Report has beneﬁted from a growing body
of multi-disciplinary research (political science, economics, sociology, psychology, security
studies) and policy papers on peacebuilding, statebuilding, conﬂict prevention, reconstruction
and stabilization operations, peacekeeping, and conﬂict recovery, complemented by a large
data set from multiple sources (the Uppsala Conﬂict Data Program, the International Peace
Research Institute of Oslo, and Human Security Report Project, homicide data from national
sources, United Nations Ofﬁce on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Health Organization
(WHO), geospatial coding of conﬂict events and data from the Armed Conﬂict Location and
Event Database and polling from regional barometers as well as surveys conducted by Fafo).
    As the topics of violence and development transcend academic and policy disciplines, it has
been crucial that a common understanding of key terms be developed and used for the report
(see the glossary). For this project, background papers by respected academic researchers have
produced signiﬁcant new econometric work on the relationship between institutions and vio-
lence, further complemented by country and regional case study research and consultations.

Learning from experience: Generating a global conversation
The WDR team sought to complement research by generating a global conversation with
national reformers, civil society and private sector leaders, as well as regional and interna-
tional policymakers, grappling with violence in diverse regions worldwide. The team focused
explicitly on moving this conversation beyond the ‘traditional’ Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) donors and multilateral partners for the World
Bank, to engage with national reformers, middle income country policy makers, regional
institutions and diplomatic and security partners, including:
• Consultations and multi-stakeholder round-tables with government leadership, civil
  society, private sectors, media and international actors in some twenty low- and middle-
  income countries and regions that are presently affected by violent conﬂict, or have man-
  aged to escape from it in recent years. Countries and regions visited included Afghanistan,
  Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the
  Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Italy,
  Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Mali, Mexico, Nepal, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Rwanda,
                                                                                                   xix

        Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, the United
        Kingdom, the United States, West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen.
     • Regional discussions with policymakers and experts to explore diverse experiences and
       perspectives and the importance of regional action, including in two workshops in coop-
       eration with the African Union and the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis
       Ababa, a session hosted by ASEAN in Jakarta, a regional workshop in Mexico City, a Mid-
       dle East/North African regional workshop in Beirut, and sessions in Brussels in coopera-
       tion with the European Union.
     • Cooperation and exchanges with the United Nations system on the political, security,
       development, and humanitarian dynamics of the challenge. A number of exchanges have
       been held with the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, the UN Economic and
       Social Council (ECOSOC), the UN Secretariat and UN agencies, funds and programs. The
       team has also engaged with the International Dialogue for Peacebuilding and Statebuild-
       ing, the OECD International Network on Conﬂict and Fragility, North Atlantic Treaty
       Organization (NATO), the African, Asian and Inter-American Development Banks.
     • Consultations in capitals to generate lessons from policymakers, experts, nongovernmental
       organization (NGOs) and private sector representatives, including Berlin, Beijing, Berne,
       Cairo, Copenhagen, Delhi, the Hague, Helsinki, Jakarta, Jeddah, London, Mexico City,
       Oslo, Ottawa, Paris, Rome, Stockholm and Tokyo.
     • The 2011WDR brought together an Advisory Council of high-level leaders and practitio-
       ners as a sounding board for emerging thinking, and to offer practical advice on the reali-
       ties of policy-making in countries affected by conﬂict (box 1).
     • WDR brainstorming sessions have also been held to tap the knowledge and experience of
       academics, policymakers and NGO Representatives, in partnership with other multilateral,
       think tank, academic, and regional institutions.

   BOX 1    The 2011 WDR Advisory Council
   The 2011 WDR Advisory Council was convened at the beginning of the WDR process to exchange with the team on the Report’s emerging
   messages and recommendations. Membership includes a diverse cross-section of national, regional, multilateral, and civil society leaders
   with deep experience in conﬂict prevention and recovery. The Advisory Council met three times during the Report development process:
   September 2009 in Washington DC; February 2010 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; and September 2010 in Beijing, China. AC Members also used
   their convening power to support WDR capital visits in regional consultations worldwide. Based on their reﬂections on WDR themes, the
   Report includes individual contributions from Advisory Council Members, which reﬂect their personal views. These boxes include lessons from
   AC Members’ own involvement in conﬂict settings or topical discussions based on their expertise.

Fostering a continuing conversation
This WDR has laid a major emphasis on communication because, from the start, the aim was not just to inform but to reach
out across multiple policy communities, to enhance understanding of trends in conﬂict, and to promote practical changes in the
way we address conﬂict. This implied a longer term strategy than for previous reports to build momentum over time with the
aim of clarifying the challenges, testing policy prescriptions and advocating concrete proposals. The extensive outreach program
has both contributed to the substance of the report and initiated the communication process much earlier than previous WDRs.
This WDR is also making extensive use of video, the web and social media to broaden the public discussion on fragility and
conﬂict. An interactive website has been launched featuring data used in the report, thematic background papers, WDR conﬂict
case studies, video material, blogs, and twitter feeds (the WDR blog at http://blogs.worldbank.org/conﬂict and our twitter site
at http://twitter.com/wbConﬂict).

Definitions and data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the
Classiﬁcation of Economies table at the end of the Selected World Development Indicators.
Income classiﬁcations are based on GNP per capita; thresholds for income classiﬁcations in
this edition may be found in the Introduction to Selected World Development Indicators.
Group averages reported in the ﬁgures and tables are unweighted averages of the countries in
the group, unless noted to the contrary.
   The use of the countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World Bank
about the legal or other status of territory. The term developing countries includes low- and
middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from central plan-
ning, as a matter of convenience.
   Dollar ﬁgures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise speciﬁed. Billion means 1,000 mil-
lion; trillion means 1,000 billion.

                 Wallensteen 2010; Lacina and Gleditsch 2005). The minimum threshold for monitoring is a minor civil
                 war with 25 or more battle deaths a year. Low, high, and best estimates of annual battle deaths per
                 conﬂict are in Lacina and Gleditsch (2005, updated in 2009). Throughout this Report, best estimates are

How violence disrupts development

F I G U R E F 1.3   The gap in poverty is widening between countries affected by violence and others
                    New poverty data reveal that poverty is declining for much of the world, but countries aﬀected by violence are
                    lagging behind. For every three years a country is aﬀected by major violence (battle deaths or excess deaths
                    from homicides equivalent to a major war), poverty reduction lags behind by 2.7 percentage points.

     REFLECTIONS FROM ADVISORY COUNCIL MEMBERS: 2011 WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT

           The role of external stresses
           Drug and human traﬃcking, money laundering, illegal exploitation of natural resources and wildlife, counterfeiting, and viola-
           tions of intellectual property rights are lucrative criminal activities, which facilitate the penetration by organized crime of the
           already vulnerable sociopolitical, judicial, and security structures in developing countries.
                In Central America, for example, several countries that regained political stability two decades ago are now facing the decay
           of the state, whose institutions lack the strength to face this onslaught. Transnational organized crime has converted some Carib-
           bean countries into corridors for the movement of illegal drugs and persons toward Europe and North America. Bolivia, Colom-
           bia, and Peru, continue to be the main global cocaine producers, while Mexico is facing an unprecedented wave of violence given
           its border with the largest immigrant, drug consumption, and arms producing market. West Africa has become the newest pas-
           sage of drugs coming from South America and destined for Europe. Several African countries suﬀer the illegal exploitation of
           their natural resources, while Asia is a hub for tons of opiates originating from Afghanistan. The unprecedented progression of
           organized crime could spell the collapse of many weak states as their institutions fall prey to the associated violence. The precari-
           ous economic development observed in many regions of the world provides a stimulus for consolidating these illegal activities,
           which will continue to thrive as a consequence of the impunity they encounter in developing countries.



           WDR Note: Weak institutions are a common factor in explaining repeated cycles of violence
           Building on previous work by Collier, Fearon, Goldstone, North, Wallis, and Weingast, and others, political scientists Jim Fearon
           and Barbara Walter used econometric techniques for the WDR to test whether general rule of law and government eﬀective-
           ness, low corruption, and strong protection of human rights correlate with a lower risk of the onset and recurrence of civil war
           and of high homicides from criminal violence. Fearon ﬁnds that countries with above average governance indicators for their
           income level have a signiﬁcantly lower risk of the outbreak of civil conﬂict within the next 5 to 10 years—between 30 to 45 per-
           cent lower—and that the relationship also holds true for countries with high homicides. This work conﬁrms earlier directions in
           the policy community, such as the International Network on Conﬂict and Fragility’s emphasis on the links between peacebuild-
           ing and state-building.
               Measures of accountability are as important as measures of capacity in this calculation. Fearon ﬁnds that high levels of polit-
           ical terror in past periods increase the chances of current conﬂict. Walter ﬁnds that signiﬁcant reductions in the number of
           political prisoners and extrajudicial killings make the renewal of civil war between two and three times less likely than in coun-
           tries with higher levels of human rights abuses. She notes, “A reasonable interpretation of these results is that greater repression
           and abuse by a government creates both grievances and signals that those governments (sic) are not dependable negotiating
           partners; suggesting that less coercive and more accountable approaches signiﬁcantly decrease the risk of civil conﬂict.” Other
           measures of accountability also matter: measures of rule of law and corruption are as or more important than measures of
           bureaucratic quality.

                      Accepting the       Economic and social interventions in situations of insecurity can justiﬁably be designed to contribute
                      links between       to citizen security and justice outcomes (in the Liberia electricity program above, an increase in
                      security and        citizen trust in government would have been an appropriate measure of program success, rather
                      development         than the sustainability of the electricity provision). Security programs can also be designed to
                      outcomes            contribute to development outcomes (an increase in trade, for example). This would require agencies
                                          to use outcome measure outside their traditional “technical” domains and work together within the
                                          combined program frameworks described above.

                      Base budget         When insecurity is high, both the costs and beneﬁts of interventions may change dramatically over
                      and ﬁduciary        a short period. This argues for greater ﬂexibility in administrative budget and staﬀ planning. In
                      processes on        program budgets, it implies careful sequencing wherein some programs will be more beneﬁcial at a

                      competitive         quantity contracts, or contracting processes that allow direct negotiations with knowledge of regional
                      markets, and        markets—can be appropriate. Where institutional capacity is insuﬃcient, procedures need to be

Notes

 1. The World Development Report 2011 deﬁnes organized violence as the use or threat of physical
    force by groups, including state actions against other states or against civilians, civil wars, electoral
    violence between opposing sides, communal conﬂicts based on regional, ethnic, religious, or other
    group identities or competing economic interests, gang-based violence and organized crime, and
    international, nonstate, armed movements with ideological aims. Although these are also impor-
    tant topics for development, the WDR does not cover domestic or interpersonal violence. At times,
    violence or conﬂict are used as shorthand for organized violence, understood in these terms. Many
    countries address certain forms of violence, such as terrorist attacks by nonstate armed movements,
    as matters that are subject to their criminal laws.

    Gleditsch and others 2002.
 3. Countries affected by fragility, conﬂict, and violence include those countries with: (1) homicide
    rates greater than 10 per 100,000 population per year; (2) major civil conﬂict (battle deaths greater
    than 1,000 per year (as deﬁned in the from 2006 to 2009), (3) UN or regionally mandated peace-
    building or peacekeeping missions; and (4) low-income countries with institutional levels in
    2006–09 (World Bank’s CPIA less than 3.2), correlated with high risks of violence and conﬂict. See

      33. In addition, there are structural and incremental factors that increase conﬂict risk. Among these
          are features of the physical terrain that make rebellion easier. These features do not cause war
          in the common sense of the word, they simply make it more possible. Mountainous terrain has
          been shown to increase risks, by increasing the feasibility of rebellion. Neighborhood matters
          too: there are both negative effects from proximity to other wars or countries with high rates of
          violent crime and illicit trafﬁcking and positive effects from being in a neighborhood largely at
          peace. See Buhaug and Gleditsch 2008; Gleditsch and Ward 2000; Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006;

      ing is reﬂected in recent policy documents as well: OECD 2010a, 2010g, 2011.
36.   Institutions are deﬁned in the WDR as the formal and informal “rules of the game,” which include
      formal rules, written laws, organizations, informal norms of behavior, and shared beliefs—as well
      as the organizational forms that exist to implement and enforce these norms (both state and non-
      state organizations). Institutions shape the interests, incentives, and behaviors that can facilitate
      violence. Unlike elite pacts, institutions are impersonal—they continue to function irrespective of
      the presence of particular leaders, and therefore provide greater guarantees of sustained resilience to
      violence. Institutions operate at all levels of society—local, national, regional, and global.

      values, and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conﬂict prevention and
      peace-building in a society.” UN Interagency Framework for Coordination on Preventive Action

      individuals to take risks in dealing with others, solve collective action problems, or act in ways that
      seem contrary to standard deﬁnitions of self-interest.” Furthermore, Levi notes that “At issue is a
      cooperative venture, which implies that the truster possesses a reasonable belief that well-placed trust
      will yield positive returns and is willing to act upon that belief.” Braithwaite and Levi 1998, 78.

51.   The interlink between security and development has been debated under the notion of human
      security, which encompasses freedom from fear, freedom from want and freedom to live in dignity.
      By putting the security and prosperity of human beings at the center, human security addresses
      wide range of threats, both from poverty and from violence, and their interactions. While acknowl-
      edging the importance of human security and its emphasis on placing people at the center of focus,
      this Report uses the term “citizen security” more often to sharpen our focus more on freedom from
      physical violence and freedom from fear of violence. The hope is to complement the discussion on
      the aspect of freedom from fear in the human security concept. Building on the Commission on
      Human Security 2003 report, the importance of human security has been recognized in the UN
      General Assembly 2005 resolution adopted at the 2005 World Summit, the UN General Assembly
      2009 report, and UN General Assembly 2010 Resolution, as well as in other fora such as Asia-Paciﬁc
      Economic Cooperation, G8, and World Economic Forum. See Commission on Human Security
      2003; UN General Assembly 2005b, 2009b, 2010.
52.   “Conﬁdence-building” in mediation terminology means building trust between adversaries; in a
      ﬁnancial context, the term “conﬁdence” denotes trust by market actors that governments are adopt-

            ing sound policies and will be capable of implementing them. The WDR deﬁnes the term as
            building trust between groups of citizens who have been divided by violence, between citizens
            and the state, and between the state and other key stakeholders (neighbors, international part-
            ners, investors) whose political, behavioral, or ﬁnancial support is needed to deliver a positive
            outcome.

            mandate is to “support, strengthen, and assist institutions of the State of Guatemala responsible for
            investigating and prosecuting crimes allegedly committed in connection with the activities of illegal
            security forces and clandestine security organizations.” See UN 2006a.

            and closing the sovereignty gap in fragile and conﬂict-affected states through the lens of “double
            compact.” The double compact focuses on the “network of rights and obligations underpinning
            the state’s claim to sovereignty . . .” and refers ﬁrst to the “compact . . . between a state and its citi-
            zens . . . embedded in a coherent set of rules, and second, “between a state and the international
            community to ensure adherence to international norms and standards of accountability and trans-
            parency.” Ghani and Lockhart 2008, 8.

85. A recent study examined the cost to countries of aid volatility, which induces volatility into govern-
    ment revenues and development programs. The loss in efﬁciency from volatility of net ODA was
    more than twice as high for weak states than strong states, at 2.5 versus 1.2 percent of GDP (see
    Kharas 2008).
86. Trafﬁcking is intrinsically regional and global in nature, with knock-on impacts between produc-
    ing, transit, and consuming countries. Colombia’s actions against drug cartels affect Central Amer-
    ica, Mexico, and even West Africa; California’s recent policy debate on legalizing drugs potentially
    impacts producing countries. Similar effects happen with other commodities: restraints on logging
    in one country can increase demand in other countries that do not have similar policies, bringing
    with it increased vulnerability to corruption and violence.
87. The Kimberley Process is jointly undertaken by civil society groups, industry, and governments
    to stem the ﬂow of “conﬂict diamonds” used to fuel rebellions in countries like the Democratic
    Republic of Congo. The process has its own diamond certiﬁcation scheme imposing extensive
    requirements on its 49 members (representing 75 countries) to ensure that the rough diamonds
    shipped have not funded violence. See Kimberley Process Certiﬁcation Scheme 2010.

    regions that have united to form one collective voice on the global stage.” The g7+ was established in
    2008 and includes: Afghanistan, Burundi, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Demo-
    cratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, the Solomon Islands, Sierra Leone, South Sudan,
    and Timor-Leste. See International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding 2010.
92. A practical example of this type of shift is Ethiopia in 2005, when government and donors agreed to
    move from regular budget support to a program of transfers to local and municipal governments.
    The program included measures to ensure that all regions of the country, irrespective of how they
    had voted in elections, received continuing central government support.

    projects covering transport, power, telecommunications, environmental management, human re-
    source development, tourism, trade, private sector investment, and agriculture. The GMS is rec-
    ognized as having enhanced cross-border trade while reducing poverty levels and creating shared
    interests in economic stability and peace.

      99. West Africa Coast Initiative (WACI) is a joint program among the UNODC, UN Ofﬁce for West
          Africa, UN Department of Political Affairs, and INTERPOL to combat problems of illicit drug traf-
          ﬁcking, organized crime, and drug abuse in West Africa. The initiative comprises a comprehensive
          set of activities targeting capacity-building, at both national and regional level, in the areas of law
          enforcement, forensics, border management, anti-money-laundering, and the strengthening of
          criminal justice institutions, contributing to peacebuilding initiatives and security sector reforms.
     100. The “Euroregion” began as an innovative form of transborder cooperation (between two or more
          states that share a common bordering region) in the late 1950s. With the purpose of stimulating
          cross border economic, sociocultural and leisure cooperation, the Euroregion model grew, and was
          boosted through the creation of a common European market and recent democratic transitions.
          There are currently more than one hundred Euroregions spread across Europe, and the model has
          in recent times been replicated in eastern and central European territories. Cooperation has not
          been without problems in areas previously affected by conﬂict, but there are good examples of
          cross-border developmental, social and security programs that involve areas where ethnic minori-
          ties reside across several states or in areas that have suffered the trauma of interstate and civil war
          in the past. See Greta and Lewandowski 2010; Otocan 2010; Council of Europe 1995; Council of
          Europe and Institute of International Sociology of Gorizia 2003; Bilcik and others 2000.
     101. Recognizing that insecure borders have been recurrent hosts to conﬂict, the African Union estab-
          lished the African Union Border Program in 2007 to delimit and demarcate sensitive border ar-
          eas and promote cross-border cooperation and trade as a conﬂict prevention tool. The program
          consists of four components. First, it pursues both land and maritime border demarcation since
          less than a quarter of Africa’s borders have been formally marked and agreed, and disputes are likely
          to continue with future discoveries of oil. Second, it promotes cross-border cooperation to deal
          with itinerant criminal activities. Third, it supports cross-border peacebuilding programs. Fourth,
          it consolidates gains in the economic integration through the regional economic communities. Its
          ﬁrst pilot project was launched in the Sikasso region in Mali and in Bobo Dioualasso in Burkina
          Faso—bringing together local, private, and public actors to strengthen cooperation. See African
          Union 2007a.
     102. ASEAN has played an important role in mediation and conﬂict resolution in the Southeast Asia re-
          gion. Examples include its assistance in the Cambodian conﬂict of 1997–99, the Timor-Leste peace-
          keeping operation of 1999 onward, the Aceh Reconciliation of 2005, and the Myanmese Cyclone
          Nargis catastrophe of May 2008.

     104. Of the different forms that South-South cooperation has taken, technical assistance has been the
          most common. Although many technical assistance projects focus on economic and social devel-
          opment, countries in the Global South have also developed specialized capacities in post-conﬂict
          peacebuilding. Examples include South Africa’s support to build structural capacities for public
          service through peer learning with Burundi, Rwanda, and Southern Sudan. Cooperation among
          45 municipalities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras helps to manage regional public goods
          such as water in the Triﬁnio region. The African Development Bank also has a speciﬁc facility for
          South-South cooperation in fragile states. See also OECD 2010e.
     105. In the West African countries that have recently experienced coups d’état, for example, the view
          of the African Union was that donor support to social and poverty reduction programs should
          continue in these countries, but that larger-scale support should be paced to support the return to a
          constitutional path. In practice, donors were divided between those that suspended assistance com-
          pletely and those that continued assistance with no change. WDR team consultation with ofﬁcials
          from African Union in Addis Ababa, 2010.
WDR Framework and Structure


The Report argues that the risk of violence increases when stresses—both internal and exter-
nal—combine with weak institutions. Given this challenge, how have countries prevented or
escaped violence? The WDR framework (ﬁgure 1) suggests that there is a need to ﬁrst restore
conﬁdence and then to transform institutions that provide citizen security, justice, and jobs.
    The interlink between security and development has been debated under the notion of
human security, which encompasses freedom from fear, freedom from want, and freedom to
live in dignity.1 By putting the security and prosperity of human beings at the center, human
security addresses wide range of threats, both from poverty and from violence, and their
interactions. Building on the report by the Commission on Human Security in 2003, the
importance of human security has been recognized in the United Nations General Asembly
and other international fora. While acknowledging the importance of human security and its
emphasis on placing people at the center of focus, this Report uses the term “citizen security”
more often to sharpen our focus more on freedom from physical violence and freedom from
fear of violence. Our hope is to complement the discussion on the aspect of freedom from
fear in the human security concept.

     The dynamics of change are similar in countries facing violence of purely criminal origins and
     those facing political and civil conﬂict; in countries with different combinations of stresses
     and institutional characteristics; and in those at different incomes, including middle and high
     income countries facing subnational violence. This said, the Report’s framework must be
     applied contextually, taking into account the speciﬁc features of the case in question. This dif-
     ferentiation is explored throughout the Report. Lessons from country case studies in chapters
     4 to 8 include, for example, brief “differentiation tables” that summarize the relevant types of
     violence, transition opportunities, key stakeholders, key stresses, and institutional challenges
     faced (table 2). These tables provide a brief assessment of the critical dynamics that, based on
     experience, must be taken into account when designing an appropriate strategy to prevent,
     mitigate, or recover from violence.

The Challenge
T
        his chapter presents the development challenge of political
        and criminal violence. The eﬀects can be devastating. Violence
        kills and displaces people, destroys human and physical capi-
tal, stunts growth, and all too often spills across borders. More than
1.5 billion people live in countries aﬀected by fragility, violence, or
conﬂict. A child living in a conﬂict-aﬀected or fragile developing
country is twice as likely to be undernourished as a child living in
another developing country and nearly three times as likely to be out
of school. No low-income fragile or conﬂict-aﬀected state has yet
achieved a single Millennium Development Goal (MDG). There is
hope, however. Countries that have managed to reduce violence
have also produced some of the fastest development gains.

     BOX 1.1     Interstate and civil war—1900 to the present
     Interstate war has declined dramatically since the two world wars of the ﬁrst half of the 20th century. Major civil conﬂicts (those with more
     than 1,000 battle deaths a year) increased during the postcolonial and Cold War era, peaking in the late 1980s and early 1990s (ﬁgure a).
     Since 1991–92, when there were 21 active major civil wars, the number has steadily fallen to less than 10 each year since 2002.8

         The declines are all the more remarkable given the rising number of sovereign states—from around 50 in 1900 to more than 170 in 2008.
     Despite a tripling in the number of states and a doubling of population in the last 60 years, the percentage of countries involved in major con-
     ﬂicts (interstate or civil) has not increased, and there has been a decline since 1992.
         In addition, civil wars have become less violent. Battle deaths have dropped from an average of 164,000 a year in the 1980s and 92,000 a
     year in the 1990s to 42,000 a year in the 2000s (ﬁgure b). This is consistent with recent evidence of declines in the number of wars, human rights
     abuses, and fatalities in war—and in the indirect deaths associated with wars.9

                                         As the number of civil wars declined, the total annual deaths from these conﬂicts (battle
                                         deaths) fell from more than 200,000 in 1988 to less than 50,000 in 2008.

     Note: Civil wars are classiﬁed by scale and type in the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conﬂict database (Harbom and Wallensteen 2010; Lacina and Gleditsch
     2005). The minimum threshold for monitoring is a minor civil war with 25 or more battle deaths a year. Low, high, and best estimates of annual battle
     deaths per conﬂict are in Lacina and Gleditsch (2005, updated in 2009). Throughout this Report, best estimates are used, except when they are not
     available, in which case averages of the low and high estimates are used.

                        Following September 11, 2001, there was an exponential rise in media coverage of terrorism. Meanwhile, media coverage of
                        gangs and traﬃcking has also been increasing. Recently, the coverage of gangs and traﬃcking approached that of civil war.

F I G U R E 1.2   Victims of terrorism
Over the last decade, 86 percent of nearly 50,000 fatalities from terrorism occurred in attacks aimed at non-Western targets. The attacks of
September 11, 2001, are the exception rather than the rule, and the phenomenon of terrorism has long aﬀected all regions of the world.

1998 to 2008 and the National Counter Terrorism Center (NCTC) from 2004 to 2009. Pie charts from 1999 to 2003 are thus based on GTD data; from 2005 to 2007 on
average shares from the two datasets; and for 2009 on NCTC data.
Note: From 1998 to 2009, 41,753 fatalities occurred in attacks on nonwestern targets, of a global total of 48,828. These statistics are based on the nationality of the
principal target of each attack; “Western” targets are deﬁned as all targets from OECD countries, targets in all other countries are deﬁned as “non-Western.” So attacks
on non-Western targets may occasionally include Western fatalities, and vice versa.

     B OX 1.2   Instability, political violence, and drug trafficking in West Africa

     West Africa is one of the poorest and least stable regions in the world. All but 3 of its 16 countries are on the United Nations (UN) list of “least
     developed countries.” Since independence, countries in the region have experienced at least 58 coups and attempted coups and many civil
     wars—and rebel groups remain active.
         Where conﬂict has ended, recovery and the creation of resilient institutions take time; and the weakness of governance in post-conﬂict
     environments attracts transnational criminal networks. International drug traﬃckers began in 2004 to use the region as a base for shipping co-
     caine from South America to Europe.
         In 2008 an estimated 25 tons of cocaine passed through West Africa, with a transit value of about US$1 billion by the time it reached West
     Africa, and an ultimate value of some US$6.8 billion at its destinations in Western Europe.20 Drug traﬃckers use some of the proﬁts to bribe
     government oﬃcials. As the UNODC (UN Oﬃce on Drugs and Crime) notes in its Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment for West
     Africa, “Law enforcement oﬃcials can be oﬀered more than they could earn in a lifetime simply to look the other way.” 21


          Traﬃcking and violence during conﬂicts in West Africa, 1990–2009

          West Africa has experienced political, communal, and criminal violence since 1990. During conﬂicts, diamonds, timber, and
          oil were traﬃcked. Recently the region has become a transit route for cocaine traﬃcked from South America to Europe.

countries varying geographically, at diﬀerent stages of development and facing or recovering from diﬀering types of violence. Country representative samples were
used for Côte d’Ivoire, Sierra Leone, and Colombia. The surveys were undertaken in selected regions of Democratic Republic of Congo and Mali. Independent

                  Poverty is on the decline for much of the world, but countries aﬀected by violence are lagging behind. For every three years that a
                  country is aﬀected by major violence (battle deaths or excess deaths from homicides equivalent to a major war), poverty reduction
                  lags behind by 2.7 percentage points. For some countries aﬀected by violence, poverty has actually increased.

Note: Figure 1.6a shows the incidence of each of the ills associated with unmet MDGs for fragile, conﬂict-aﬀected, and recovering countries in relation to the
incidence for all other developing countries. The ratio is weighted by the aﬀected population, so each bar can be read as the odds-ratio of a person being aﬀected
relative to a person in a non-fragile or conﬂict-aﬀected state: for example, children of primary school age are three times as likely to be out of school in fragile and
conﬂict-aﬀected states as those in other developing countries.

Note: Current fragile and conﬂict-aﬀected states account for 33 percent of the population of the countries considered here. States recovering from fragility and
conﬂict account for an additional 14 percent of the population. So, if the MDG deﬁcit were borne evenly, these countries would account for 47 percent of each of the
ills described. The red to orange people-ﬁgures represent the percentage of the deﬁcit for each MDG in fragile, conﬂict-aﬀected, and recovering countries. The blue
ﬁgures represent the persons aﬄicted in other developing countries. Excluded here are Brazil, China, India, and Russian Federation, all signiﬁcantly ahead of or on
par with other developing countries on the MDGs (see panel a). Due to their size, including them in the calculations would skew any discussion involving the global
population.

18.   The UN Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change deﬁned terror-
      ism as “any action, in addition to actions already speciﬁed by the existing conventions on aspects of
      terrorism, that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or noncombatants,
      when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel
      a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act” (UN 2004a,
      52). Earlier debates focused on whether deﬁnitions should be based only on nonstate actors; the
      High-level Panel pointed out that issues of state use of force against civilians are covered in the in-
      ternational laws of war, international criminal law, and international humanitarian law. See also

      with previous conﬂicts in the 1960s are those that had conﬂicts between 1945 and 1959, and those

            of their MDG gap (see World Bank 2010e). Current data compiled for the MDG Summit in 2010
            show that no low-income fragile or conﬂict-affected state has met the targets for a single MDG.
            Some countries are close and have made dramatic gains in recent years and it is possible that they
            could meet targets. For more information, see World Bank 2010n; UNSTAT 2010; UN 2007.

T
       hroughout history, agreement between powerful leaders has
       been the most common strategy to prevent large-scale vio-
       lence. This type of agreement, which we call an “elite pact,”
does impose security for periods, but violence generally recurs. The
immediate cause of the violence varies greatly by country, with many
countries experiencing a combination of security, economic, and
political stresses. These stresses may be internal (including low in-
come or high inequality between groups) or they may be external
(including global economic shocks, international drug traﬃcking, or
the inﬁltration of foreign forces). This Report argues that in these
environments, institutions and governance serve as an “immune
system” and defense against stresses. When these stresses occur in
societies with weak institutions and governance, violence often
occurs. Reform is often diﬃcult or impossible where violence is pres-
ent. As a result, countries that fail to build legitimate institutions risk
entering a vicious cycle of repeated violence and weak institutions.
This chapter spells out what we know about this vicious cycle and
why some countries are more vulnerable to violence than others.

B OX 2.1   Economic and political theories of violence and this Report
 Violent conﬂict has been the subject of large and long-standing literatures in many academic disciplines, and this report draws from
 many strands of that literature.

 Rapid change and rising expectations
 One common perspective has been the importance of drivers such as rapid economic and social change. Drawing on research by psy-
 chologists and sociologists, Gurr argued that social and political conﬂict arises when groups experience feelings of “relative depriva-
 tion” and the frustration of expectations for deserved or anticipated economic or social status. Huntington agreed that economic mod-
 ernization raises expectations and mobilizes members of traditional societies toward national politics, contending that conﬂict occurs
 when political institutions lack the capacity to accommodate and manage rapidly rising demands.

 Failing to credibly agree to abstain from violence
 Many economists and political scientists see violence as originating from “commitment problems”—situations where organized groups
 have opposing interests but cannot credibly agree to abstain from violence for a variety of reasons. The focus in these theories is on
 the diﬃculty of groups or individuals in some settings to commit themselves to not using force when it would be advantageous to do
 so. This thinking can be traced back as far as Hobbes, who contended that violent civil conﬂict is a consequence of low state capacity
 to deter challengers and manage conﬂict among groups in society. Recent theories on opportunistic arming and consequent violence
 can be found in Hirshleifer, Skaperdas, Grossman, and Fearon. Becker developed a rational actor model of crime. Thinking on the “secu-
 rity dilemma”—that arming for defense can also be used to attack, leading to violence—can be traced to Schelling, Posen, Snyder and
 Jervis, and de Figueiredo and Weingast.

 Greed or grievance
 These contending theories have led to debates over the relative importance of normative and economic motives for violence, which
 has recently led to debates on whether economic incentives or broader social and political motives drive societies to violence. This
 question was formulated as “Greed and Grievance” by Collier and Hoeﬄer, who suggested that primary commodities, diasporas, low
 earnings, human capital, and dispersed populations were positively correlated to the outbreak of civil conﬂict, suggesting support for
 the “greed” hypothesis. Further exploration, review and critique of these issues can be found in Nathan and Sambanis, as well as
 Satyanath, Miguel, and Sergenti and Blattman and Miguel.9

 Horizontal inequality and identity
 Signiﬁcant contributions to this debate include recent theories of polarization and horizontal inequality and analysis of violence based
 solely on identity, such as nationalism and ethnicity. Theories of horizontal inequality as developed by Stewart, and polarization pro-
 posed by Esteban and Ray argue that inequality alone does not predict civil war—violence may be driven by relationships between
 inequality and identity that contribute to the onset of civil violence.10 In addition, national or ethnic identity may lead to a violent
 response to oppression or marginalization and need not include any equity concerns, but may be motivated instead by a disposition
 for self-government.11

 Ethnic divides and commitment problems
 Bridging the arguments on grievance and rational choice motives for conﬂict, Fearon contends that ethnic polarization is most likely to
 precipitate conﬂict when ethnic groups cannot make credible commitments to abstain from violence. This is consistent with the phi-
 losophy in this Report: both political and economic dynamics are often at play, and neither greed nor grievance alone is suﬃcient to
 explain the incidence of violence.

 Avenues for peaceful contests
 The question remains: why do some societies avoid violence when others do not? To answer this question, we build on the hypotheses
 put forward by North, Wallis, and Weingast, who focus on impersonal institutions with open access to political and economic opportu-
 nities, creating avenues for peaceful and credible contestation.12 Besley and Persson contend that investments in legal systems and
 state capacity can reduce the incidence of violence. Keefer argues that violence occurs when societies cannot collectively punish
 leaders who engage in predatory behavior or collectively build a capable counterinsurgency force, suggesting that institutionalized
 political parties serve as a bulwark against conﬂict by resolving these problems of collective action and credibility. Recent empirical
 quantitative evidence supports these hypotheses—Goldstone and others ﬁnd that the quality of political institutions is an order of
 magnitude more important than other factors in determining risks of political crises and civil wars, while Brückner and Ciccone suggest
 that institutions are necessary to accommodate shocks in prices to avoid violence. More work is needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings thus
 to better understand the channels through which institutions contribute to resilience to violence.

     BOX 2.1      Economic and political theories of violence and this Report (continued)
     Institutions matter in preventing violence
     This chapter draws on existing research on the risk factors of violence across the political science, social science, and economic
     disciplines and extends understanding of violent conﬂict in two ways:

     •   It presents the risk factors associated with violence, organized into security, economic, and political factors. This adds to existing
         work on drivers of conﬂict, with an emphasis on the role of external stresses—those outside a country’s control. Examples are
         international organized crime and traﬃcking, inﬁltration of foreign ﬁghters, and economic shocks.

     •   It then presents empirical ﬁndings that support arguments by theorists (such as North, Wallis, and Weingast) that institutions mat-
         ter for violence prevention. It concludes by hypothesizing why and how the failure to develop legitimate, capable, and accountable
         institutions causes repeated cycles of violence.

      Violence is not easily contained. The colored circles represent conﬂict events by those militant and rebel groups that are active
      across borders. Recent violence has spilled across many borders in Central Africa, most notably those of the Central African

     BOX 2.6          Do similar economic factors create risks for political conﬂict and extreme levels of
                      violent organized crime?
     The most reliable indicator to compare violence across countries is the homicide rate, which has risen markedly in Latin American and
     Caribbean countries since the early 1990s—from 12.6 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants to almost 20 homicides in recent years.
        Analysis of global data conﬁrms earlier work by Loayza, Fajnzylber, and Lederman on homicide rates in Latin America, revealing
     that:

     • Institutional capacity and accountability is associated with lower risks of civil war and homicide rates.

     • Higher country GDP, like civil wars, is associated with lower homicide rates, even comparing periods within countries.
     • Democratic collapses, as with civil wars, are associated with increasing homicides.
     • Oil production, associated with civil war risk, does not predict higher homicide rates.

     • Countries with higher income inequality tend to have more homicides, a pattern that holds when comparing countries in the same
       region. These ﬁndings are the principal factor that distinguishes criminal violence from civil wars, which are not found to be corre-
       lated with income inequality, but exhibit some relation to horizontal inequalities across ethnicity or other identity groups.

        In qualitative studies, unemployment and idleness also feature as risk factors that spur recruitment into both rebel movements
     and gangs. Surveys showed remarkably similar perceptions about motives for participation in gangs and in rebel movements (see
     ﬁgure). In both cases, unemployment and idleness were cited as the primary reasons for young people to join gangs or rebel move-
     ments, reinforcing the links between social inequality and violence.


               Rebel movements and gangs attract people with similar motives
               Surveys found that the main motivations young people cited for becoming rebels or gang members are very similar—
               unemployment, idleness, respect, and self-protection, all well ahead of revenge, injustice, or belief in the cause.

    B OX 2.9    Quantitative research on institutions and violence risk
      For this Report, Fearon and Walter tested whether the rule of law, government eﬀectiveness,
      low corruption, and strong protection of human rights, as measured by the Worldwide Gover-
      nance Indicators (WGI), correlate with a lower risk of onset and recurrence of civil conﬂict. This
      test involved a more detailed statistical examination of these governance indicators than
      undertaken before.
          Because countries with high incomes generally have stronger governance indicators, it has
      been diﬃcult for previous researchers to distinguish the eﬀect of institutional weakness from
      the eﬀect of low income. Fearon approached this problem by controlling the sample for
      national incomes, and then identifying “surprisingly good” governance—when a country has
      higher governance ratings than other countries at the same per capita income. The attempt to
      identify the impact of governance on the risk of violence then comes from seeing whether sur-
      prisingly good or bad governance in one period is associated with the onset or recurrence of
      conﬂict later.
          Fearon ﬁnds that a country with “surprisingly good” governance indicators has a 30–45 per-
      cent lower risk of civil war in the next 5–10 years than its peers with more modestly rated gov-
      ernance. Once institutions are added to the analysis, they become a more important factor
      than income as a correlate of civil war. Similarly, he ﬁnds that institutions are highly related to
      the risk of extreme levels of criminal violence, proxied by homicides, with countries that had
      measures of better governance in 1996–98 experiencing lower homicide rates in 2000–05,
      even when controlling for income.
          Walter ﬁnds a similar governance impact on the risk of recurring civil war. A formal constitu-
      tion—a simple measure of the rule of law and the expression of societal values through formal
      institutions—reduces the odds of renewed conﬂict by 64 percent. Measures of accountability
      are as important as measures of capacity in this calculation: as described earlier, past human
      rights abuses have a particularly strong impact on the risk of future conﬂict, and measures of
      rule of law and corruption are as important as, or more important than, those of bureaucratic
      eﬃciency.

    B OX 2.10     Fragility, weak institutions, governance, and violence
     To capture state fragility, the World Bank and other multilateral development banks have used
     measures of institutional weakness, such as their Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
     (CPIA) frameworks. The CPIA indicators attempt to measure, however imperfectly, the quality
     and inﬂuence of key state and society institutions and the policies they implement. Low-
     income countries with scores below a composite 3.2 in the CPIA are coded as fragile. Nothing
     in the indicators themselves directly measures the levels of political or criminal violence. The
     ﬁgure illustrates that countries lacking the institutional capacity and accountability to absorb
     systemic stress are more likely to experience violence—and less able to extract themselves
     from it or to contain its eﬀects.
         Of 17 countries that remained fragile between 1990 and 2008, 14 experienced major civil
     war violence in the same period and 2 experienced minor civil wars, as shown in the ﬁgure.70
     In other words, nearly every country with prolonged periods of weak institutional capacity
     experienced organized political violence. Of course, this violence is in turn likely to compro-
     mise development and further erode institutional capacity (similarly to the “conﬂict trap”
     identiﬁed by Collier and others (2003)). Even though the CPIA indicators do not include direct
     measurement of political and security institutions and policies, there is a striking correlation
     between “fragility” as deﬁned in the CPIA scores, and the incidence of major episodes of orga-
     nized violence. By measuring institutional fragility, the CPIA is in eﬀect measuring the presence
     or risk of organized violence. 71

 2. In addition, for example, there are structural factors that increase conﬂict risk, which include features
    of the physical terrain that make rebellion easier. These features do not cause war in the common
    sense of that word, but simply make it more possible. Mountainous terrain has been shown to in-
    crease risks by increasing the feasibility of rebellion. See Buhaug and Gleditsch 2008; Gleditsch and
    Ward 2000; Salehyan and Gleditsch 2006. See also Murdoch and Sandler 2004. On terrain and neigh-

 9. Much of this response has taken the form of critical discussion; see, for example, Nathan 2005. A
    particularly useful “study of studies” is Sambanis 2004, which ﬁnds that GDP per capita and political
    instability are the only variables that consistently predict civil war onset. Researchers looking at natu-
    ral resources have found mixed results—oil being most consistently associated with civil war out-
    break. Recent work by Satyanath, Miguel, and Sergenti 2004 tied rainfall and agricultural shocks to
    the onset of civil war, while Besley and Persson 2009 explore the effect of international price shocks
    on the onset of conﬂict. Arnson and Zartman 2005 cover much of the core arguments in the greed
    versus grievance debate.

    emergence of transnational rebel (TNR) organizations, bargaining failure, and civil conﬂict; see Sale-

27. Labor market data in developing countries are irregular and unreliable. For example, very few Sub-
    Saharan African countries have carried out labor force surveys. Population censuses (an important
    source for claims about labor force participation and unemployment rates) are commonly out of
    date, and often unreliable even when recent. Further, wage employment in agriculture in poor coun-
    tries is “invisible” in most conventional databases. See Cramer 2010.

     46.   The difﬁculty of studying this phenomenon is compounded by the fact that our understanding of
           and data sets on identity are weak; as Hegre and Sambanis have shown, slight changes in how differ-
           ent features of ethnicity—language groupings, afﬁliation measures, and so on—are operationalized
           in studies have major effects on ﬁndings about causality and the direction of causality (Hegre and

           deﬁnition. Economic HIs are measured by average household assets and social HIs by average years
           of education. The effect of HIs is quite high: the probability of conﬂict increases threefold when
           comparing the expected conﬂict onset when all variables have average values, compared to a situa-
           tion where the extent of horizontal inequality of assets among ethnic groups is at the 95th percentile.
           In the case of inter-regional HIs, the probability of conﬂict increases 2.5 times as HIs rise from the
           mean value to the 95th percentile value. See also Stewart 2010.

65. See Fearon 2010a; Walter 2010; Hoefﬂer, von Billerbeck, and Ijaz 2010. A range of indicators can be
    used to measure governance and institutional capacity. The Users’ Guide on Measuring Fragility pro-
    vides an excellent contemporary stocktaking of the literature and concepts (Mata and Ziaja 2009).
    The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) scores are prepared internally
    and are publicly available for International Development Association (IDA) countries for the years
    2005 to present. The World Bank has recently undertaken an annual harmonizing exercise to align
    the deﬁnitions of fragility with regional development banks (the Asian Development Bank and the
    African Development Bank). Other well-known measures of governance and quality of institutions
    include the Worldwide Governance Indicators measures of government and the International Coun-
    try Risk Guide (ICRG) measures compiled by the PRS Group. The Worldwide Governance Indica-
    tors are an index comprising multiple sources, whereas the ICRG measures are expert assessments on
    multiple dimensions of political, economic, and ﬁnancial risk. It locates three common attributes of
    states, “legitimacy, authority, and effectiveness,” among a variety of indexes and deﬁnitions of fragil-
    ity and compares the results across indices. See Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2010b. There is a
    blurred line in the indicators between the measurement of governance outcomes (actual levels of
    representation and participation, accountability for decisions and for illegal actions, and corruption
    and human rights abuses) and institutional characteristics (whether there are systems and capacities
    that regulate state-society relations within the rule of law, provide for prosecution of abuses, and so
    forth). Most governance indicators actually measure both: whether a system is in place (for example,
    a constitution or anti-corruption law, government policy on equitable service provision) as well as
    some measurement, often imperfect, of whether these systems deliver good governance outcomes in
    practice (low corruption levels, free and fair elections, avoidance of impunity for human rights
    abuses, and so on).
66. See Stedman 1996; Brown 1996; Posen 1993; Snyder 2000; Goldstone and Ulfelder 2004; Goldstone
    and others 2010; Besley and Persson 2009, 2010.
67. State legitimacy is tied to agreed rules and processes that promote accountability to its citizens, whether
    through participation or through patronage. Patronage is particularly pervasive in fragile situations
    where state capacity is weak; yet, it can also weaken state legitimacy if seen as unfair and reinforcing
    horizontal inequalities (OECD 2010g, 2011). Shared beliefs are essential to link the state and its society
    in constructive ways (Bellina and others 2009); for example, elections only become more than a formal
    tool to collect opinion when there is a common and entrenched belief that they express the “will of the
    people.” Together with collective identities and religion, “tradition” is a very important way to “ground”
    state legitimacy (Clements 2010). These sources of legitimacy do not exist in isolation: improving
    service delivery does not necessarily increase state legitimacy if the other elements are missing. State
    legitimacy results from a combination of these sources and may take various forms, depending on
    context.
68. The development community’s focus on fragility is related to pioneering work undertaken by Paul
    Collier and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala under the Low Income Countries Under Stress initiative. The pol-
    icy implications of this original work were extensively elaborated by INCAF, an organization within
    the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of OECD, as well as by the UN and various bilaterals,
    most notably the U.K.’s DFID (Department for International Development). INCAF has produced
    innovative thinking on security system reform, service delivery in fragile situations, the legitimacy of
    the state, and the role of donors. The United Nations identiﬁed the need for institution-building for
    a more secure and developed world at an early stage, particularly in the ﬁelds of conﬂict prevention
    and peacebuilding. New thinking on fragility and state-building has received signiﬁcant support
    from research funded by DFID over the past 10 years; for a synthesis, see Garassi 2010.

Lessons from

T
       his chapter sets out the Report’s framework for how countries
       escape the vicious cycle of fragility and move toward a virtu-
       ous cycle of conﬁdence-building and institutional transfor-
mation, especially in the areas of citizen security, justice, and jobs.
The framework is presented as an expanding spiral because these
processes repeat over time as countries enter and exit multiple
transition moments. Even as one set of immediate priorities is
resolved, other risks emerge and require a repeated cycle of action
to bolster institutional resilience. This process takes at least a
generation. Societies undertaking this endeavor face a legacy of
pervasive and enduring mistrust, which makes collective action to
address challenges or provide public goods so diﬃcult. Outsiders
cannot restore conﬁdence and transform institutions for countries
because these processes are domestic and must be nationally led.
But to help countries restore peace and reduce regional and global
instability, international actors can provide external support and
incentives and help reduce external stresses.

      BOX 3.1   Unrealistic expectations in fragile states are hurdles to progress
      The impact of a legacy of mistrust in violence-affected countries
      A legacy of mistrust can mean that key actors do not respond as hoped to new political signals or new public programs. Consider
      Afghanistan, where citizens need to calculate the risks of siding either with the Taliban or with the government and NATO (North
      Atlantic Treaty Organization)—or with neither.
          In making these decisions, individuals consider what they think others are likely to do. The thinking process might go like this: “The
      consequences of my decision to provide the authorities with information on the Taliban depend on what others around me are going
      to do. If my neighbors won’t cooperate, the authorities are going to lose control, and I’d be crazy to help them. So, even though I do
      not support the Taliban, I’m better oﬀ helping them.” The same could apply to providing information on drug traﬃckers.2
          All institutional change requires the coordinated actions of many people. That is why small events that change the beliefs about
      what others will do can evoke big changes in the choices each individual makes. A single, but widely publicized, government humilia-
      tion in combat operations, for example, can translate into a major loss of popular support. A single, but widely publicized, incident of
      corruption can evoke big changes in expectations and in political and economic behavior.


      Expectations and trust in fragile states and in non-fragile states
      Analysis of 280 country surveys in Latin America and Africa shows a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in citizen trust in fragile and non-fragile
      states. The results reveal that countries that are not fragile or aﬀected by conﬂict have signiﬁcantly higher levels of trust in the police,
      the justice system, and the parliament. This is consistent with recent research that explores cross-country diﬀerences in trusting neigh-
      bors and governments.
          In simple terms, people’s expectations are often wrong about the future in fragile states. A simple cross-country regression using
      data on expectations of economic improvements and actual economic growth suggests that, in non-fragile states, peoples’ expecta-
      tions of the direction the economy will take in the next 12 months has a signiﬁcant correlation with actual outcomes.3 But in fragile
      states, there is no such correlation: responses to the survey question, “will economic prospects improve in the next 12 months?” bear
      no relationship to what subsequently happens in the economy. This is important, because all rational expectations theory in econom-
      ics and political science—and the policy decisions linked to it—assume that people have a reasonably informed ability to make judg-
      ments about the future.
          The low trust in government institutions in fragile and conﬂict-aﬀected countries poses a formidable constraint to leaders trying to
      launch positive change. To further complicate the situation, operational experience and input from national policymakers highlight a
      second, quite diﬀerent version of the expectations problem, that is, the excessively high popular expectations that arise in moments of
      political hope and transition. Governments repeatedly encounter this: signing a peace agreement or a donor pledge conference can
      create a wave of enthusiasm and the expectation that rapid change will follow. When the bubble bursts, as it usually does, govern-
      ments can experience a rapid loss of credibility.
          If policy makers understand these dynamics, they can harness public enthusiasm for change to their advantage by crafting signals
      in ways that conform to expectations (chapter 4). Where mistrust is high, they have to take actions that send very strong signals—sig-
      nals that are self-evidently costly, such as integrating former rebels into the national army structure, as in Burundi, or guaranteeing
      long-term employment to former adversaries, as in South Africa through the “sunset clause” oﬀered to white civil servants. They also
      have to ﬁnd ways to make promises binding, often using third parties as guarantors.

      forthcoming.
      Note: Diﬀerences in trust and expectations between fragile and non-fragile states reported here were statistically signiﬁcant at the 5 percent
      level. These diﬀerences were signiﬁcant whether non-fragile was deﬁned as CPIA (Country Policy and Institutional Assessment) greater than 3.2

      B OX 3 .3   Violence can increase during fast institutional transformations
       The late 1980s witnessed major economic reform in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost
       and perestroika initiatives. Among the consequences were severe unemployment, the virtual collapse of a
       previously comprehensive social welfare regime, and a sharp contraction of many public services. This
       was followed by the breakup of the Soviet Union into independent republics and the introduction of
       multiparty politics. A rise in homicides accompanied this period of turbulence, peaking in 1993 at 18
       per 100,000 population and again in 2001 at 20 per 100,000 (see ﬁgure). With reforms beginning to pay
       dividends by the 2000s, social instability subsided and homicides began to fall.

           Most former Soviet republics experienced a spike in homicides following the dissolution of the Soviet
       Union, with notable peaks in Estonia (20 in 1994), Georgia (17 in 1993), Kazakhstan (17 in 1996), and Tajiki-
       stan (21 in 1993). In every country except Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, homicides increased between
       1990 and 1994, followed by a decline, though the average homicide rate in 2000 remained above the level
       of 1990, and only a few countries had lower homicide rates at the end of the decade.

F I G U R E 3.1   WDR Framework: Repeated cycles of action to bolster institutional resilience
                  The WDR framework is presented as an ever-expanding spiral because these processes repeat over time as countries go through
                  multiple transitions. Even as one set of immediate priorities is resolved, other risks and transition moments emerge and require a
                  repeated cycle of action to bolster institutional resiliency. The arrow below the spiral illustrates that external support and incentives
                  can help this nationally led process, and the arrow above it illustrates how external stresses can derail it.

B OX 3.4   The WDR framework and theories of violence prevention
 Paul Collier in Breaking the Conﬂict Trap and The Bottom Billion, and Douglass North, John Wallis, and Barry
 Weingast in Violence and Social Orders have been among the most inﬂuential theorists of the links among
 conﬂict, violence, and development.
    North, Wallis, and Weingast describe three “doorstep conditions” for fragile countries to move toward
 long-term institutional violence prevention:
 • Ensuring the rule of law, particularly over property issues, for elites
 • Creating a “perpetual state” in the constitutionality of transfer of power and the ability of state commit-
   ments to bind successor leaders
 • Consolidating control over the military.
     Their framework provides a perceptive analysis of national development dynamics but does not
 explicitly address international stresses on states, international assistance, or the inﬂuence of international
 norms and standards.
     Collier’s work, by contrast, focuses less on domestic political dynamics and more on low income, cor-
 ruption, and natural resource rents. He explicitly considers external security guarantees and international
 standards for resource extraction.
     This Report brings together these strands of thinking and adds analysis that both supports earlier
 hypotheses and provides new questions for further research. It uses quantitative techniques to conﬁrm
 that institutions matter for violence prevention. It brings this together with other work from economics,
 political, and social science on how institutional transformations take place. And it adds some concepts
 and examples from country case studies and regional and country consultations to ﬂesh out understand-
 ing of these transitions.
     Chapter 2 provided empirical analysis of the importance of institutions for long-term violence preven-
 tion. It supports the theories of economists and political scientists who have focused on institutions, such
 as Collier; Fearon and Laitin; and North, Wallis, and Weingast. Interestingly, it provides some initial evi-
 dence not only that very highly developed countries deﬁned by North and colleagues as “open access
 orders” have lower rates of violence, but also that institutions and good governance outcomes matter at
 much lower levels of development. Institutions matter for preventing criminal violence and organized
 crime as well as for preventing political conﬂict.
     This chapter focuses on practical lessons that can be applied in extreme conditions of insecurity and
 weak institutions. It expands on existing work in three ways:
 • Why institutional reforms are so diﬃcult. The chapter draws upon scholars such as Acemoglu and
   Robinson, Fearon, and Laitin; Keefer, Weingast and others who have studied early transition periods to
   describe why the political economy of institutional reform in insecure environments is so diﬃcult, and
   why so many reform eﬀorts therefore fail.
 • What it takes to make institutional reforms happen. The chapter uses country case studies and inputs
   from national reformers to look at how countries in outright crises have restored conﬁdence, and how
   countries with ongoing insecurity and weak legitimacy, capacity, and accountability have transformed
   their institutions in the longer term. This work builds on North and colleagues’ analysis of the pathways
   to move to broader institutional transformation, prevent violence from recurring, and lay the basis for
   longer-term development—but it focuses on earlier periods of transition in very insecure environ-
   ments. In so doing, it moves beyond most existing theories by explicitly considering how external
   stresses and external assistance can aﬀect these processes.
 • Understanding that transformations take time and adopting appropriate institutional models is
   critical. The chapter adds empirical measures of how long these transformations take, even for the
   countries that made the fastest transitions in the late 20th century, and considers what can accelerate
   them. It also adds an important qualiﬁer to “institutions matter for violence prevention” by arguing that
   this does not mean convergence toward Western institutional models. Societies that prevent violence
   from recurring have designed solutions based on their own history and context—and have created or
   adapted rather than simply copied institutions from other countries.
    The rest of this chapter elaborates the arguments in each of these areas. Chapters 4–9 then show how
 countries can restore conﬁdence and transform institutions—and how international support can help
 them do so.

    B OX 3.5   “Best-ﬁt” reforms
     What do we mean by “best-ﬁt” reforms? Because of the risks of political backlash and premature overload-
     ing described earlier, in conditions of imperfect security and weak institutions, “best-practice” technocratic
     reform options may not work. Less orthodox approaches that are best-ﬁt in the context of imperfect secu-
     rity, institutional capacity, and competitive markets can work better—but may have “second best” implica-
     tions that need to be managed.17 Consider the following ﬁve examples:

     •   A country wants to legitimize the formation of a government and a new reform direction through an
         election, but insecurity still rages over most of the territory, many voters cannot get to the polls, and
         polling and vote-counting cannot be monitored. Non-electoral representative mechanisms, where per-
         ceived by citizens to provide genuine voice and accountability, can be used in the short term, but in
         the medium term, they will require renewed legitimization.

     •   A country has 20–30 percent unemployment, criminal gangs recruiting from its youth population, and
         an economy structurally underinvested in areas of its comparative advantage. In the short term, pub-
         licly subsidized employment may be the best-ﬁt option, but in the longer term, an exit pathway to for-
         mal employment in the private sector will be needed.

     •   A country needs electricity for the economy to recover, but insurgents have the capability to attack
         large generation and distribution facilities. Medium-size generators may cost more but may be the best-
         ﬁt option in the short term. In the longer term, the country may need to exit to a lower-cost solution.

     •   A country wants to divert public spending to education and infrastructure, but has a large standing
         army and a rebel army in place. In the short term, integrating these forces and paying their salary
         costs may be the best-ﬁt option, but in the longer term, the force may need to be downsized and
         professionalized.

     •   A country has tens of thousands of people accused of past human rights violations, but its formal jus-
         tice system can process only 200 cases a year. A community-based process may be the best-ﬁt option,
         but the formal justice system will still need to be built, with redress for families inadequately dealt with
         in the initial process.

      Notes

       1. According to Margaret Levi, “Trust is, in fact, a holding word for a variety of phenomena that enable
          individuals to take risks in dealing with others, solve collective action problems, or act in ways that
          seem contrary to standard deﬁnitions of self-interest.” Furthermore, Levi notes that “At issue is a co-
          operative venture, which implies that the truster possesses a reasonable belief that well-placed trust
          will yield positive returns and is willing to act upon that belief” (Braithwaite and Levi 1998, 78).
       2. Similar problems arise in the transition from communism to a rule-of-law state. The thought pro-
          cess might be as follows: “If I build value in a new ﬁrm rather than stripping the assets of the state, I
          will gain only if rule of law is established. That will happen only if others demand rule of law, too. If
          others don’t believe rule of law will be established, they will prefer to strip assets rather than build
          value, so they will be unlikely to demand rule of law, and in that case, I’d be crazy to build value in a
          new ﬁrm. Thus, even though most people would be better off building value under rule of law than
          stripping assets in a lawless state, given my expectations of political development, I’m better off strip-
          ping assets.”
       3. A 30 percent increase in people who believe that growth will improve in the next 12 months is associ-
          ated with a 1 percent increase in actual growth rates in the subsequent year, signiﬁcant at the 5 per-
          cent level.
       4. A few societies have very strong state capacity, but score low on governance indicators because they
          are highly exclusionary—South Africa under apartheid is an example. These countries will have less
          difﬁculty in implementing promises because their military and civilian organizations are capable.
          But it is possible that, even in these cases, institutional weaknesses in shared values and cohesion
          make it difﬁcult to deliver on change. Indeed, in South Africa change has not been a simple process.

       9. Economic theory helps us understand the consequences of a perception of impunity that increases
          willingness to use violent means. Chapter 2 referred to the way in which insecurity dynamics produce
          “prisoner’s dilemmas,” where lack of trust between two actors undermines their ability to cooperate
          to produce mutually beneﬁcial outcomes. Economic theory shows that if the actors in question be-
          lieve they will encounter the same dilemma again in the future, their calculation may differ—they
          might recognize that taking a risk by trusting their counterpart in the present can produce important
          payoffs in the future. So-called iterated prisoner’s dilemmas make cooperation possible, though not
          guaranteed. If a society is confronted by a situation where many actors believe that others within
          society may use violence to resist change, their willingness to bet on future cooperation is dimin-
          ished. Where insecurity is not an immediate issue, betting on future payoffs makes sense; where the
          future is highly uncertain, logic dictates placing an excessive premium on protecting existing privi-
          leges and resources, not risking them for collective gains. See Axelrod 1984.
      10. See Keefer, Neumayer, and Plümper 2010.
      11. See UN Security Council 2010a, WDR consultation with government ofﬁcials, UN donor represen-
          tatives, local nongovernmental organizations, and community-based organizations in Haiti, 2010.
      12. An alternative perspective to the intertwined relationship between institutions and violence can be
          found in Cramer 2006.
      13. The WDR deﬁnes “citizen security” as both freedom from physical violence and freedom from fear
          of violence. Applied to the lives of all members of a society (whether nationals of the country or
          otherwise), it encompasses security at home; in the workplace; and in political, social, and economic
          interactions with the state and other members of society. Similar to human security, “citizen security”
          places people at the center of efforts to prevent and recover from violence. Also see Frühling, Tulchin,
          and Golding 2003.
      14. Conﬁdence-building in mediation means building trust between adversaries; in ﬁnancial crises, trust
          in markets means that governments are adopting sound policies and will be capable of implementing
          them. The WDR deﬁnes the term as building trust between groups of citizens who have been divided
          by violence, between citizens and the state, and between the state and other key stakeholders (neigh-
          bors, international partners, investors) whose political, behavioral, or ﬁnancial support is needed to
          deliver a positive outcome.
      15. These incentives are not always enough. Chapter 4 discusses cases where leaders are unwilling to
          recognize an impending crisis or take action, and the approaches used to resolve these situations.
      16. Building on the Commission on Human Security 2003 report, the importance of human security has
                             From violence to resilience: Restoring conﬁdence and transforming institutions     117



      been recognized in the UN General Assembly 2005b resolution adopted at the 2005 World Summit,
      the UN General Assembly 2009b report, and UN General Assembly 2010 Resolution, as well as in
      other fora, such as Asia-Paciﬁc Economic Cooperation, G8, and World Economic Forum.
17.   Throughout this report, the term “best-ﬁt” describes solutions that are ﬁtted to context of the society
      at the moment and may not be the ﬁrst best solutions by other metrics. Thus, these solutions invoke
      the concept of the “second best” as used in economic theory—reforms may only be optimal once all
      distortions and considerations are taken into account. In this way, best-ﬁt solutions may be optimal
      given all of the economic, political, physical, and institutional constraints and conditions.

19.   Based on historic CPIA scores, 40 countries would have been classiﬁed as fragile for ﬁve or more
      years between 1977 and 1989. Box 2.10 showed that 17 of these countries remained fragile until 2009
      and that 16 of those experienced minor or major civil war. Of the 23 that “escaped” fragility, 15 had

      from International Country Risk Guide data; the Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi indicator of “gov-
      ernment effectiveness”; the Failed State Index’s “progressive deterioration of public services” indica-

      de Weijer 2010.
24.   Pritchett and de Weijer 2010.
25.   Global and regional norms play an essential part in preventing violence by constraining leadership
      abuses of power, and in supporting local institutional transformations by helping maintain a focus on
      goals and functions rather than particular institutional forms. These norms can take the form of formal
      international agreements and can also manifest as social movements, such as the Otpor movement.
26.   For example, while both Myanmar and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have—to varying
      degrees of success—used communication and travel bans to limit access to information and main-
      tain control domestically, their ability to restrict information has declined dramatically in recent
      years, as Internet access in Myanmar, and satellite television in both countries, convey images of the
      world outside. See Horsey and Win Myint 2010.
27.   Color revolutions refer to a series of spontaneous movements that arose in succession in several
      former Soviet republics and one Balkan state during the early 2000s. These were mainly nonviolent
      protests advocating for democracy against governments seen as corrupt and/or authoritarian. Start-
      ing as small spontaneous actions, they evolved within days or weeks into mass movements that top-
      pled governments and instituted new democratic regimes. Each movement adopted a speciﬁc color
      or ﬂower as its symbol, and at the center of these movements were nongovernmental organizations
      (NGOs) and particularly student activists. These movements were successful in Serbia (2000), Geor-
      gia (Rose Revolution 2003), Ukraine (Orange Revolution 2004), and the Kyrgyz Republic (Tulip
      Revolution 2005). See Kuzio 2006; D’Anieri 2006; Michalcik and Riggs 2007.

      incomes, creating a low-level equilibrium. The WDR focuses on the institutional deﬁcit: the institu-
      tions that enable the peaceful resolution of contests are missing from fragile environments. With
      actors lacking the means to make credible commitments to reform, societies are unable to break free
      from the threat of violence. A low-level equilibrium of dysfunctional institutions and recurrent vio-
      lence is thereby created.

        hapter 4 analyzes country lessons on building conﬁdence
        through coalitions and early results. Most states moving back
        from the brink of violence have developed “inclusive-
enough” coalitions for action, with diﬀerent forms suiting their
circumstances. In forming such coalitions, leaders took action to
build trust by signaling that new policies would be diﬀerent from
the past and would not be reversed. They built conﬁdence by
achieving a few concrete results as a prelude to wider institutional
transformation. States that have succeeded in early conﬁdence-
building measures have often done so through a pragmatic
blending of policy tools and by calling on non-state capacity, both
civic and international.

    B OX 4.2    Gang-related homicides in Los Angeles
      In Los Angeles, gang and drug-related violence accounts for a large percentage of crime
      (nearly 50 percent of homicides) and negatively aﬀects education, health, business and jobs,
      housing prices, and the ability for families to enjoy parks and other leisure activities. While
      gangs are not new to Los Angeles County, gang membership ballooned from negligible in
      1970 to 70,000 to 100,000 30 years later. Almost 6,000 people died from gang violence
      between 1995 and 2006, comparable to the civil war in Uganda over the same period,
      where estimates of battle deaths between 1995 to 2006 range from 3,300 to 16,000, with a
      best estimate of 7,500 (Uganda has more than twice the population of the Los Angeles
      metropolitan area).22
          After years of struggling to deal with gang-related violence, a team of experts recently
      wrote, “In short, Los Angeles needs a Marshall Plan to end gang violence” (Advancement
      Project 2007, 1). New initiatives aim to prevent violence before it escalates by funding and
      training outreach workers who can mediate disputes, stop rumors, and engage with those
      who cause violence (“shotcallers”). The strategy involves regular conﬁdence-building initiatives
      through frequent consultations among key stakeholders, which can include reformed gang
      members and community leaders. This outreach approach also involves multisectoral coordi-
      nation (law enforcement oﬃcers conduct community visits accompanied by parole oﬃcers,
      educators, child services, and representatives from other city departments as well as civil soci-
      ety) to develop relationships and trust between the community and law enforcement.

      (Thornton and others 2011).
      Note: The challenges of measuring progress in these environments and scaling up successes are not
      dissimilar from those discussed in the rest of this Report. So-called outreach models are in their early
      stages of implementation in Los Angeles and have not been fully integrated into Los Angeles Police

      Following the end of the 14-year Liberian civil war in 2003, the international community became increasingly concerned about the
      mismanagement and corruption under the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL). Corruption was not just an economic
      concern: political and army reactions to the extensive corruption of the Tolbert government have been widely cited as a trigger for
      the coup that sparked Liberia’s ﬁrst civil war in 1989, and the theft of national resources continued to ﬁnance violent groups. The
      extreme corruption prevented improvements in government capacity by constraining national revenues and diverting external
      resources.
           After intense negotiations, diplomatic pressure, and the threat of an embargo on external assistance, the NTGL and Liberia’s inter-
      national partners agreed to the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP). The AU (African Union) and
      ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) led discussions with the NTGL, and the UN Security Council welcomed GEMAP
      in Resolution 1626 of September 19, 2005. GEMAP’s aim was to improve revenue collection, budgeting, and expenditure management;
      upgrade procurement practices; strengthen transparency over concessions of national resources; control corruption; and build govern-
      ment capacity.
           A deﬁning feature of GEMAP is the use of international experts with co-signatory authority in the operations of ministries and
      state-owned enterprises, the review of concessions and contracts (including timber and diamonds), and the establishment of an
      oversight mechanism, the Economic Governance Steering Committee (EGSC), to guide and monitor GEMAP implementation. The EGSC
      is a mechanism of shared accountability, chaired by President Johnson Sirleaf and the American Ambassador as the deputy chair.
           GEMAP has helped bring some rapid improvements and was an appropriate response to Liberia’s particular mix of stresses, stake-
      holders, and institutional challenges at the time. Revenues increased from US$84.5 million in 2005–06 to a projected US$347 million in
      2010–11, and Liberia’s ranking on the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index climbed from 150 to 97 between 2007
      and 2009.
           GEMAP, however, has also ignited debate over the management role of expatriates. President Johnson Sirleaf told the UN Security
      Council that “a major deﬁciency still exists as with other technical assistance programs—the lack of capacity development for sustain-
      ability. This fault has contributed to tensions between foreign and local experts, thereby raising issues of ownership and sovereignty.”36
      A lesson from GEMAP is to look closely at phasing the handover of responsibilities over time and manage local understanding and
      support.

      The Liberian government capitalized on a well-managed donor program and a long-standing dearth of public-spirited government to
      visibly deliver public goods, restoring conﬁdence in government. The key was to be speciﬁc about what was promised—restoring elec-
      tricity in Monrovia in a year, for example—and to make sure that the government actually delivered what it had promised. Tornorlah
      Varpilah, Liberian Deputy Minister of Health, told the WDR team that Liberia took some immediate actions to satisfy public opinion.
      The ﬁrst was to guarantee peace and security using UN forces. Then the President took action to provide free primary education, free
      primary health care, and electricity in the capital city. Those interventions helped build conﬁdence in the government.44 Simultane-
      ously, the government worked to improve capacity in the public ﬁnance and justice systems for the longer term.

       economic deprivation, natural resource wealth

      In 2002, the government made restoring security a top priority and deﬁned a set of fairly narrow targets for violence-aﬀected areas:
      restoring safe transit by deploying military resources to protect the main road network and sponsoring convoys of private vehicles that
      allowed many Colombians to travel between major cities in safety for the ﬁrst time in years; reducing homicides and kidnappings;
      restoring social services to the national average; and improving trust in the state. Meetings around the country during the electoral
      campaign and a review of the strengths and weaknesses of past eﬀorts informed selection of these targets. A review of the previous
      Politica Nacional de Rehabilitación (PNR)45 program, for example, indicated that it had spread its eﬀorts too thinly across diﬀerent
      regions, so the new government chose a smaller number of violence-aﬀected areas. It also drew on wider capacities to execute the
      program, including U.S. support for security-sector capacity-building and the engagement of Colombian NGOs and other donors in
      social programs in violence-aﬀected rural areas. Frequent perception surveys of citizens kept the government up-to-date on progress.

     B OX 4.6   (continued)

     Following the Pakistan government’s 2009 military oﬀensive to drive militants from the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and
     the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KP; formerly the Northwest-Frontier Province), the government—with the World Bank, Asian Devel-
     opment Bank, UN, and European Union—undertook an assessment to address needs and understand the factors underlying violence.
     In addition to traditional analyses of economic and social data, the assessment involved a crisis analysis and consultations with more
     than 1,000 representatives of communities from FATA and KP. Focus group discussions were also held by local NGOs and women’s
     groups. The primary issues were jobs and justice system reform, including the country’s overall legal framework (diﬀerent in FATA from
     the rest of Pakistan) and the resolution of land and family disputes. The exercise highlighted the danger of overpromising: initial plans
     did not take capacity into account, resulting in unrealistic timelines. Since the assessment, Pakistan has faced the even more immediate
     challenges of the devastating humanitarian disaster caused by the ﬂoods in August 2010. But the assessment still gives a detailed pic-
     ture of citizen priorities.

      BOX 4.7   Different sectors, core goals
      National programs (sometimes with international support) have used tools from one “sector” to meet goals in another. These
      approaches can be eﬀective in a variety of situations—in countries recovering from civil war and in societies aﬀected by drug-related
      violence, ranging from low to middle income.

      Justice and inclusion goal—Security intervention. In Burundi, a key part in the Arusha peace process that stabilized the long-running
      civil war was the creation in 2004 of a new national army, the Force de Défense Nationale, in which the Hutu ethnic group represented
      40 percent of the oﬃcer corps. This was important for the Hutu, who account for more than 80 percent of the population but had long
      been excluded from the military and had suﬀered from military actions against them as far back as 1972.

      Justice and inclusion goal—Economic intervention. Jamaica’s inner cities have been at the center of the country’s crime and violence
      problem, which, coupled with growing poverty, has further exacerbated social fragmentation and the weakness of civic organizing in
      inner-city communities. With donor support, the government launched a program to provide inner-city community infrastructure and
      services for the poor in 2006, which includes measures to promote short-term conﬂict mitigation and resolution, as well as medium-
      term social prevention and capacity enhancement interventions.

      Security goal—Economic intervention. In Mozambique, the civilian population was caught up in successive military oﬀensives. During
      Mozambique’s transition, joint international-national eﬀorts to provide assistance and sustainable resettlement to both former com-
      batants and the internally displaced eased the potential tension that postwar population shifts and a lack of livelihood opportunities
      might otherwise have caused.

      Security goal—Multisectoral intervention. To address rising urban violence in Cali, Colombia, the DESEPAZ program (a Spanish acro-
      nym for development, security, and peace) integrated employment and microenterprise programs for youth, urban upgrading, and pri-
      mary education alongside security interventions. The program was also noteworthy for its organizers’ understanding of crime: because
      most homicides occurred on weekends, holidays, and at night, selling alcohol and carrying guns at those times were banned. A 30 per-
      cent decline in homicides in 1994–97 is attributed directly to the program.

      Economic goal—Justice and inclusion intervention. After early eﬀorts to implement the Dayton Accords in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
      international monitors found through interviews with business persons that trade between Bosnian, Croat, and Serb majority regions
      was substantially aﬀected by ethnically denominated license plates. The Oﬃce of the High Representative mandated that nonethnic
      license plates be issued to all cars in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and within weeks of this initiative, traﬃc and trade had surged.

      Economic goal—Security intervention. After the establishment of the UN Interim Mission in Kosovo in June 1999, UN administrators
      observed that trade between Kosovo and its neighbors was depressed. Insecurity on the major highways from Pristina to border cross-
      ings was identiﬁed as an obstacle, so NATO’s KFOR troops were deployed to provide security along major highways and transit points.
      Exports rose from €27.6 million in 2002 to €297 million in 2010, and imports from €854.8 million to €2.1 billion.

      Economic goal—Security intervention. In Liberia, partnership between the UN peacekeeping mission, the United Nations Develop-
      ment Programme, and the World Bank maintained the country’s degraded roads, so that parts of the country were no longer cut oﬀ
      from the capital during the rainy season, with a consequent boost in conﬁdence.

     Afghanistan, one of the world’s poorest countries, has experienced a near continuous period of invasion and occupation, civil war, and
     oppression since the late 1970s. Between the overthrow of President Daoud before the Soviet invasion in 1979 and the Bonn Accord in
     2002, the central government never had authority across the entire country. In addition to a long legacy of violence and poverty, the
     country faces the daunting stresses of internal conﬂict, terrorism, ethnic tension, regional and global security stresses, and extensive
     corruption.
          Development under these conditions obviously is particularly challenging. However, the largest development program in Afghani-
     stan, the National Solidarity Program (NSP), has registered some important successes. Since its inauguration in 2003, it has established
     more than 22,500 community development councils across 361 districts in all 34 provinces and ﬁnanced more than 50,000 develop-
     ment projects. Through the democratically elected, gender-balanced councils, the program builds representative institutions for village
     governance. Typical projects construct or improve critical infrastructure, such as communal drinking water facilities, irrigation canals,
     local roads and bridges, and electrical generators, and oﬀer vocational training or literacy courses to villagers.
          Economic evaluations show consistently high rates of return across all sectors (above 12 percent). A midterm evaluation by the Uni-
     versity of York in the United Kingdom in 2005–06 found signiﬁcant evidence of greater public faith in the national government, along
     with better community relations. The independently conducted Randomized Impact Evaluation of Phase-II of Afghanistan’s National
     Solidarity Program in 201050 reinforced this ﬁnding through a large-sample quantitative assessment using randomized controlled trials
     to compare outcomes in 250 villages covered by the NSP, with 250 villages not yet participating in the program. As part of the inde-
     pendent evaluation indicated above, a survey was conducted between October 2007 and May 2008 that showed that the simple pro-
     cess of electing councils and planning local investments increased villagers’ trust in all levels of government. Across the board, those in
     villages participating in the NSP had more trust in government oﬃcials, showing that it is possible to markedly change perceptions of
     state institutions through eﬀective local interventions.
          Furthermore, a separate study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in Washington, DC, found that “the CDCs and
     tribal shuras51 are seen as more responsive to Afghan needs than provincial governments and provincial councils, and in many cases are
     the only sign of improvement villagers have seen in the past ﬁve years.”52

      Vigilantism has often provided security in the absence of eﬀective state performance. While it may be seen initially as legitimate, it
      presents tremendous risks to both the state and citizens, especially in protecting universal standards of due process (often the justice is
      summary) or in separating petitioner, prosecutor, and judge (often a mob dynamic prevails).
          Although Nigeria has had signiﬁcant income from oil revenue, the country remained stuck in low per capita income and saw little by
      way of the development of eﬀective institutions. Throughout the 1990s and the early part of the 2000s, corruption and non-accountable
      institutions remained deﬁning features of the Nigerian political landscape. Earlier episodes of separatist conﬂict (in Biafra) had not resur-
      faced, but oil-rich areas in the south had seen civil violence, and Nigeria had also experienced sectarian violence in its eastern provinces.
          In the late 1990s and early 2000s, vigilantism was rampant in eastern Nigeria. In response to a rash of robberies and home invasions,
      residents formed vigilante groups that patrolled and guarded entire neighborhoods at night. One such group was the Bakassi Boys,
      who initially earned the support of politicians and the public because they reduced crime. In the words of one newspaper columnist:
      “I am a living witness to the fact that for three years before the year 2000, in my part of Imo State, life was made unbearable by the
      callous activities of armed bandits. They suddenly seemed to have so multiplied that anybody found outside his front door after dusk
      was risking his or her life. Then suddenly things began to happen. Well-known hoodlums who were friends of the police gradually took
      notice and either ﬂed or stayed at their peril. Home was becoming haven again, and evening parties and outside engagements re-
      turned to the community. It was such a great relief. Asked thereafter to choose between the Bakassi Boys and the police, the village
      folks preferred the former.”63
          Vigilante groups are celebrated in Nigerian popular culture—pictured in movies and on calendars—as appropriate defenders of the
      public against criminals. Even mainstream observers of Nigerian society, including eminent political scientists like Peter Ekeh, saw the
      Bakassi Boys as qualitatively diﬀerent from other vigilante groups. Yet, as noted by Human Rights Watch in 2002, the Bakassi Boys came
      to be viewed as an uncontrollable and illegal band, which, though ﬁlling a void left by a weak state, had become ruthless mercenaries
      who could be hired to eliminate political or commercial opponents. Beyond these accusations, the celebrated operations of the Bakassi
      Boys were problematic because of the lack of due process accorded presumed criminals. As one anthropologist notes: “The Bakassi Boys
      originated in acts of necessity undertaken in the face of terror. Noble intentions, however, have a tenuous existence in the midst of the
      endemic corruption, political factionalism, and electoral machinations that characterize the Nigerian political landscape. Thus Nigerians
      remain suspicious of the power ceded to vigilantes.”64

Notes

 1. Background work for this Report included review of almost 30 low- and middle-income country
    cases—both successful efforts to transition away from violence and those less successful—that expe-
    rienced a mix of forms of stress and types of violence as identiﬁed in chapters 1 and 2. The cases var-
    ied widely in their institutional characteristics, ranging from low-capacity countries with relatively
    accountable institutions to higher capacity countries with weak accountability mechanisms. This
    work was supplemented by national and regional consultations with politicians and analysts from
    government and nongovernment institutions.
 2. As noted in the guide to the WDR, commitment mechanisms are means of persuading stakeholders
    that intentions will not be reversed. This follows the common economic deﬁnition of commitment
    mechanisms or commitment devices. See Dixit 1980; Schelling 1960; Spence 1977.

 9. According to leadership development literature, the three qualities of effective leadership include
    the ability to set direction, including deﬁning and vetting a vision among relevant individuals and
    groups; to create alignment, including coordinating the knowledge and work of a collective in ser-
    vice of this broader direction/vision; and to maintain commitment to this broader direction/vision,
    including through the expansion of the group’s efforts to achieve collective goals, not just individual
    goals. For more information about leadership theories, see Northouse 2008; Hughes, Ginnett, and

      26. Las Madres de la Plaza ﬁrst appeared as a distinct group on April 30, 1977, when 14 women de-
          cided to gather near the pyramid of the Plaza de Mayo in downtown Buenos Aires and demand
          that the repressive military regime disclose the whereabouts of their children who were abducted
          by the military due to their political ideals and associations and subsequently disappeared. Initially
          dismissed, then ridiculed, and later brutally persecuted, the ranks of Las Madres continued to
          grow and received recognition internationally for their nonviolent demonstrations in a society
          cowed into silence where all the traditional means of public expression, dissent, and protest were
          forbidden. Over time, the group of mothers transformed into a political movement and became a
          symbol of resistance against the military dictatorship. See Navarro 2001.
      27. For instance, shaping a positive and inclusive relationship between citizens and the state has been
          an important part of Timor-Leste’s institutional and political agenda since 2007. The government
          has actively worked on improving its communication and engagement capacity; a relaxation of the
          country’s language policy (though most young Timorese speak Bahasa and very little Portuguese,
          the ofﬁcial language policy since 2000 mandated that Portuguese would be the national language
          of instruction and administration. This resulted in poor functioning of the civil service, a lack of
          development of media, and weak communication between the state and its people) is indicative
          of a general shift in the government’s approach. Simultaneously, the international community
          started to lend more consistent support to initiatives that promote dialogue (see Von Kaltenborn-
          Stachau 2008).

      33. See de Greiff 2010, 11: “How do transitional justice measures promote this sense of civic trust?
          Prosecutions can be thought to promote civic trust by reafﬁrming the relevance of the norms that
          perpetrators violated, norms that precisely turn natural persons into rights-bearers. Judicial insti-
          tutions, particularly in contexts in which they have traditionally been essentially instruments of
          power, show their trustworthiness if they can establish that no one is above the law. An
          institutionalized effort to confront the past through truth-telling exercises might be seen by those
          who were formerly on the receiving end of violence as a good faith effort to come clean, to under-
          stand long-term patterns of socialization, and, in this sense, to initiate a new political project around
          norms and values that this time around are truly shared. Reparations can foster civic trust by dem-
          onstrating the seriousness with which institutions now take the violation of their rights . . . vetting
          can induce trust, and not just by ‘re-peopling’ institutions with new faces, but by thereby demon-
          strating a commitment to systemic norms governing employee hiring and retention, disciplinary
          oversight, prevention of cronyism, and so on.”
      34. Transitional justice approaches are deﬁned by the UN as the “full range of processes and mecha-
          nisms associated with a society’s attempt to come to terms with a legacy of large-scale past abuses
          in order to ensure accountability, service justice and achieve reconciliation. These may include
          both judicial and non-judicial mechanisms and individual prosecution, reparations, truth seeking,
          institutional reform, vetting and dismissals, or a combination thereof ” UN 2004b, 4. See also

      41. Successful social cohesion policies require recognition of language and/or cultural practice in
          cases where a group perceives itself systemically excluded and disrespected. In so doing, care must
          be taken to avoid creating further ﬁssures or entrenching practices that curtail the civil rights of
          women, caste groups etc. See Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock 2006; Gupta 1970.

    aimed at the establishment of peace; national reconciliation; and the normalization of areas af-
    fected by development imbalances, weakness in the institutional presence of the state, and social
    conﬂicts. See Presidencia República de Colombia 1993.

48. The literature on community-driven development in situations of fragility and conﬂict is exten-
    sive; see, for example, Baird 2010; Cliffe, Guggenheim, and Kostner 2003.
49. Experimental evaluations of CDD programs are rare. One example is Fearon, Macartan, and
    Weinstein 2009, who carried out research on the impact of a community-driven reconstruction
    program in 42 communities in Liberia. “A ﬁeld experiment in which villages in northern Liberia
    were randomly assigned to receive international development assistance provides evidence that
    the introduction of new local-level institutions can alter patterns of social cooperation in a way
    that persists after the program’s conclusion. Villages exposed to a community-driven reconstruc-
    tion program exhibit higher subsequent levels of social cooperation than those in the control
    group, as measured through a community-wide public goods game. These results are striking.
    They suggest that changes in community cohesion can take place over a short period of time; can
    occur in response to outside intervention; and can develop without fundamental changes either to
    the structure of economic relations or to more macro-level political processes. Random assign-
    ment of communities to treatment provides conﬁdence in the causal nature of the relationship,
    and the use of behavioral outcome measures reinforces our sense that the effects are real. These
    ﬁndings suggest that post-conﬂict development aid can have a measureable impact on social cohe-
    sion” (Fearon, Macartan, and Weinstein 2009, 12). For a broader discussion of violent conﬂict and
    the transformation of social capital, see Colletta and Cullen 2000.
50. The randomized impact evaluation of the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) is a multiyear study
    designed to quantify changes—across indicators such as economic activity, agricultural production,
    access to infrastructure and services, and structures and perceptions of local governance—in 250
    “treatment villages” compared to those villages not participating in the NSP. The evaluation is being
    led by Andrew Beath of Harvard University; Professor Fotini Christia of Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology (MIT), Shahim Kabuli of the World Bank, and Professor Ruben Enikolopov of the New
    Economic School, and is being implemented in conjunction with the Vulnerability Analysis Unit
    (VAU). It is being supported by the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations (FAO), and the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) of the Govern-
    ment of Afghanistan. For more information, see the National Solidarity Programme website: http://
    www.nsp-ie.org/index.html.
51. Shura is an Arabic word for “consultation” or “council.” The word itself can describe an assembly,
    an organized body of participants, or an administrative body or council, or may describe a deci-
    sion-making process. In Afghanistan, tribal shuras have played an important role in community
    security and governance since the absence of a functioning government in 1978, and continue to
    play a pivotal role in the provision of justice.

56. As noted in chapter 1, the WDR team asked the Norwegian research institute Fafo to conduct
    surveys in seven countries and territories, involving a mix of nationally representative samples as
    well as subregions affected by violence. One of the survey areas focused on the entity that should
    be responsible for providing public goods, such as reducing unemployment and protecting natio-
    nal security. The survey offered respondents a range of actors (the national government, private
    enterprises, traditional authorities, and so forth). In answering the question: “Who should be the
    main body/entity responsible for allocating land?” respondents as a whole (across the seven loca-
    tions—Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo (North and South Kivu prov-
    inces), Mali, Sierra Leone, and the West Bank and Gaza) chose traditional leaders as the second
    most important entity for land allocation following national governments. In some countries (for
    instance, Côte d’Ivoire), the percentage of respondents who identiﬁed traditional leaders (57 per-
142   WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 1



            cent) actually surpassed those who identiﬁed the national government (30 percent). Of all the re-
            sponsibilities, land allocation (22 percent) was on average the most popularly identiﬁed area for
            traditional leaders, followed by protecting rivers and forests (6 percent). See Bøås, Tiltnes, and
            Flatø 2010.
      57.   Protocol-based school management system is a school management system in which control is
            decentralized. The government provides authorization for private entities (in most cases faith-
            based groups) to operate schools under speciﬁc government guidelines and regulations. These
            guidelines cover areas such as curricula, norms regarding class size, qualiﬁcation and salaries of
            teachers, and system of assessment.
      58.   Baird 2010.
      59.   Contracting out is one mechanism for accountability between policy makers and service providers
            and tends to work better when both parties are focused on outcomes and keep the formal pro-
            cesses light. Effective monitoring and evaluation of results is essential to reward good performers
            and improve or replace those who are not doing a good job. See Baird 2010.
      60.   See, for example, Wood 2008, which shows how warring parties make use of networks at the sub-
            state level, and also how legacies of conﬂict are transmitted through these networks into political
            and military life, local identities and authority structures, gender roles, and political relationships.
            See also Peterson and Zuckerman 2010. Blattman charts the need for further micro-level research
            on the topic. See Blattman, forthcoming; Spear and Harborne 2010.

            effort—even though the estimated economic cost of the conﬂict (Rp. 107.4 trillion) was almost
            twice the cost of damage and losses from the December 2004 tsunami (MSR 2009).
      69.   MSR 2009.
      70.   The MSR report hypothesizes that this could be because people who were employed during the
            conﬂict were more likely to be targeted or possibly that nonvictims are more likely to be students.
            Moreover, it is also likely that employment-generating projects that target conﬂict victims may miss
            non-victims who also need assistance (MSR 2009).

        hapter 5 describes the dilemmas of institutional trans-
        formation for resilience to violence. The ﬁrst of these is
        about timelines: delays in a “too slow” reform process pro-
long states’ vulnerability to violence. But lessons from the history
of institutional transformation provide cautionary evidence that
going “too fast” creates other risks of backlash. Countries that have
addressed violence have sequenced reforms, frequently over a
generational time period, to develop social consensus, and to allow
their societies to absorb change and to develop their institutional
capacities. The second dilemma is about the prioritization of institu-
tional reforms. This chapter provides lessons from country reform
approaches to security, justice, and jobs, as well as from wider issues
like elections and corruption, on how experimentation, adaptation,
and pacing can result in “best-ﬁt” reforms that are adapted to the
local political context.

      BOX 5.3   Coordinated political, security, and development responses to violence—Lessons from
                urban, subnational, and organized criminal violence in Latin America
      Multisectoral violence prevention programs suggest a way of bringing diﬀerent actors together to address the complexities of violence.
      In rapidly urbanizing areas—not only in the developing world, but also in high- and middle-income countries—violence is character-
      ized by the convergence of a wide range of risk factors, including overcrowding, inequality, youth unemployment, and drug crime.
      While violence has traditionally been managed through the criminal justice sector and coercive responses, recent multisectoral
      approaches, particularly in Latin American cities, have demonstrated the beneﬁts of a more integrated response. The approaches
      emphasize a balance between long-term structural prevention and control-oriented approaches and address a variety of stress factors
      simultaneously. The emphasis on local government and community engagement in design, implementation, and oversight has fostered
      better diagnoses of the drivers of violence and ensured stronger community ownership.
          The city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, had a steep rise in homicide rates from 1997 to 2001. The victims and perpetrators of violence
      were often young men under the age of 24 living in slums. Preventive actions were implemented by the state government of Minas
      Gerais, in partnership with the city and nongovernmental organizations, under the program Fica Vivo, which targeted youth for social
      support, education, and sports. Social interventions were accompanied by a new form of policing that ﬁrst captured sought-after crimi-
      nals and then installed a permanent community police element—gaining the trust and conﬁdence of the population. An evaluation of
      the program in one of the targeted communities showed reductions of as much as 45 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants per semester
      compared with the rest of the city. Fica Vivo has a return on investment of 99–141 percent of the total cost of the program.
          In Bogotá, Colombia, between 1993 and 2002, a multisector strategy was credited with progress in combating urban violence. The
      strategy included campaigns to promote citizen disarmament and control of alcohol consumption; neighborhood crime-monitoring
      committees; family police stations to control domestic violence and reduce assaults on women; police reform measures; urban renewal
      eﬀorts, such as the Transmilenio urban transport program; and employment programs. Evaluations showed that some of these inter-
      ventions resulted in sizable reductions in the levels of violent crime. For example, restrictions on gun carrying during weekends and
      holidays are credited with reducing the homicide rate by 14 percent. The urban renewal and transportation program, known as Trans-
      milenio, was credited in some of the most violent areas of Bogotá with reducing overall levels of crime and violence dramatically by 86
      percent. Interventions related to the strengthening of the police force and interventions to alleviate the backlog of cases in the judicial
      system and speed up trials also had notable reductions in the levels of violent crime, with a 76 percent reduction in the assault rate.7

                   WDR note: Why is it important to pay attention to the security and justice budgeting process?
                   Security and justice are essential public goods that beneﬁt development and poverty reduction. It is both appropriate and
                   necessary for the state to allocate resources for the maintenance of security and access to justice. Attention must therefore be
                   paid to the ﬁnancial management of the security and justice sectors so that resources are used eﬀectively and eﬃciently
                   against agreed priorities in a transparent and accountable manner.
                      Three crucial, inter-related components of managing security and justice expenditure are as follows:
                   •   As in other parts of the public sector, security and justice budgets should be prepared against sectoral strategies. Gov-
                       ernments must be able to identify the needs and key objectives of the security and justice sectors as a whole and the
                       speciﬁc roles that the various security and justice actors will be asked to play.
                   •   Resources must be allocated according to priorities both within the security and justice sectors and between security
                       and justice and other sectors. Sectoral strategies and information on performance are critical components of the allocative
                       process. The key ﬁnancial and economic managers plus the legislature must have the capacity to be fully involved in this
                       process, and the process must include all relevant actors. Security and justice must compete fully with other sectors for fund-
                       ing. Public expenditure analysis that covers the whole of government can help provide information to inform this process.
                   •   Finally, resources appropriated must be used eﬃciently and eﬀectively. This requires careful monitoring and evaluation of
                       operational performance, both within the security and justice services and by civil servants. Basic well-functioning ﬁnancial
                       management information systems are critical in this regard. Additionally, it is extremely important that irregularities identi-
                       ﬁed in the course of monitoring are addressed, lest a climate of noncompliance be created or reinforced. The transparency
                       of procurement processes is as important in security and justice as in other areas. Internal audit units or inspector-general
                       functions within the defense, justice, and interior ministries can play important roles in ensuring eﬀective resource use.

    Twenty-four-hour courts—arraignment courts that hear complaints and review fresh evi-
    dence—show how criminal cases can be expedited. One example is the 24-hour court that was
    established in 2005 by the Supreme Court of Guatemala. This is an interinstitutional eﬀort, with
    not only the judiciary, but also the Public Ministry, the Ministry of Government, the National
    Civil Police, and Public Defense Institute participating. Apart from operating 24 hours a day,
    365 days a year, the 24-hour court availability has facilitated compliance by the police with the
    due process requirement of presenting detainees to a court within a six-hour limit. Over the
    ﬁrst three years of the court’s operation, the number of cases it dismissed declined from 77
    percent to under 15 percent. Nearly 50 percent of all arraignments ended in alternatives to
    detention, such as bail, house arrest, weekly presentations at the local court, or restrictions on
    travel. Drug consumption cases fell from over 30 percent to about 7 percent. And the courts
    made greater use of alternatives to trial.

    In ﬂagrante delicto courts were established in Costa Rica in 2008 on a pilot basis in San José
    to reduce criminal case disposition times. They were set up within the existing legal frame-
    work, with no need for further legal reforms. Their purpose is to ensure due process guaran-
    tees in simpliﬁed procedures to handle cases where the defendant is caught in the act of com-
    mitting of a crime (that is, in ﬂagrante delicto). These courts remain open 24 hours a day, 365
    days a year and operate with several shifts of judges, prosecutors, and public defenders. The
    cases are turned over immediately to the prosecutors, who may request an immediate hearing
    with the judge to analyze alternative mechanisms, such as summary judgment or preventive
    detention. When the defendant and the public defender choose an expedited trial, it can take
    place immediately or be set in a few days.

    In Colombia, Justice Houses—integrated, multi-agency service centers—are used to solve con-
    ﬂicts. These Justice Houses, ﬁrst designed and implemented by USAID (the United States
    Agency for International Development) in 1995, have assisted over 7.8 million citizens since
    inception, mainly from low-income communities. There are now 50 well-staﬀed facilities
    throughout the country in urban and rural areas, some of which are regional in nature. Given
    their success in reducing local conﬂict and preserving peace, plans include the construction of
    10 new Regional Justice Houses in partnership with the Ministry of Interior and Justice. Other
    social services include Peace Centers, which are expanded versions of Justice Houses where the
    community has access to programs that promote citizenship values, peaceful coexistence, and
    amicable solution of conﬂicts. The ﬁrst Peace Center opened in December 2002 in Barrancaber-
    meja, one of the most violent areas in Colombia, and there are now 15 throughout Colombia.

                   Making anti-corruption institutions eﬀective in Rwanda after the genocide
                   H.E. Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda; WDR Advisory Council Member

Dairy is a traditional consumer product in Kosovo. In the 1990s, the command production system broke down and cooperatives dis-
solved. Many families became self-suﬃcient units, producing to meet their own consumption needs and trading surplus for other
goods and services. The conﬂict of 1998–99 destroyed much of the production base, damaged infrastructure, displaced people, wid-
ened ethnic divisions, and eroded Kosovars’ trust in each other and their government. Shortly after agricultural production and eco-
nomic activity resumed in Kosovo, donors began working with value chain participants to upgrade the dairy industry. Value chain
implementers worked ﬁrst with individual farmers to make no- or low-cost changes to improve yields and quality, then expanded their
reach by working with larger groups and associations. Thereafter, they steered farmers toward commercial channels, helping them fur-
ther upgrade their processes to improve productivity and quality and to rebuild links with processors. In parallel, they worked with pro-
cessors to orient them to end markets and, based on demand, to upgrade their processes and products to improve quality, expand
production, and increase market share. By working from the micro to the macro as Kosovo moved from relief to development, donors
and implementers supported upgrading and sustained growth in the dairy sector. In just over three years, for example, the Kosovo
Dairy Value Chain project boosted domestic sales by €36 million and added 624 new jobs following an investment of €3.9 million. The
impact on social cohesion is unclear. While a dairy board was set up that explicitly included both ethnic Albanians and Serbs, there was
no evidence as to whether the board had a direct impact on participation of diﬀerent ethnic groups or increased cooperation between
ethnic groups.



Rwanda

 Types of violence: Genocide; political, communal, and cross-border

 Transition opportunity: Large space for change post-genocide            Key stakeholders: Smallholder farmers, private sector,
                                                                         government, international partners

 Key stresses: Intercommunal tension and ethnic divides,                 Institutional challenges: Severe accountability and capacity
 continuing security threat—mistrust/fear, trauma and legacy of          constraints in judicial, security, and political institutions—public
 abuse, return of refugees and IDPs (internally displaced persons)       and private; legacies of communal suspicion and violence


Coﬀee, grown mostly by subsistence farmers, has long been an important source of income in rural areas and foreign exchange
for the Rwandan economy. But the war and genocide of 1994 had a devastating eﬀect on the coﬀee sector due to loss of life and the
destruction or neglect of coﬀee trees. By 1996, coﬀee production was only about half the 1993 level. Between 2002 and 2006, the USAID
(United States Agency for International Development)-funded US$5 million Agribusiness Development Assistance to Rwanda project
boosted export-ready coﬀee production and created several thousand seasonal jobs.
    Traditionally, farmers depulped and washed their cherries by hand before selling them to traditional exporters of semiwashed coﬀee.
Modern stations now encourage farmers to sell them unwashed cherries, since they can process them more eﬃciently with modern
equipment. By selling directly to the station rather than through intermediaries, the farmers are paid more per pound while avoiding the
tedious hand labor.
    The result has been tremendous. Between 2000 and 2006, the country went from producing 18 tons of fully washed coﬀee to 940
tons. There is also some evidence that greater economic security among participants in the coﬀee value chain is also linked to lower
ethnic distance, lower distrust toward other ethnic groups, and a tendency toward conditional forgiveness.

      electricity sector had suﬀered heavily during the war from extensive destruction and the signiﬁcant reduction of payment collections.
      Despite this, most Lebanese people still beneﬁted from some access to electricity during the war and in the initial stages of recovery—
      and continued to do so in subsequent periods of instability.
          Already during the war, the bulk of electricity was provided by the private sector in the absence of a functioning public sector.
      A mix of individual and collectively owned electricity generators, run by a few formal and many informal private businesses, became
      an established part of the utility market. The ability of the private sector to ﬁll the void left by a ﬂawed public service owed much to an
      open and unregulated economy—and a strong culture of entrepreneurship.
          Even after the end of the civil war, the private sector remained a critical energy supplier. Privately sold generators continued to
      supply electricity (primarily during blackouts) to both households and businesses and often covered whole neighborhoods. By 1994,
      for example, 98 percent of businesses and 95 percent of households were estimated to have received round-the-clock electricity, with
      a signiﬁcation portion from private sources.
          Although small-scale private capacity ﬁlled a void left by a lack of public sector engagement, the small, unregulated, and private
      provision of electricity has serious economic and environmental drawbacks as a long-term system. Private generation costs Lebanese
      households nearly twice as much as public generation. And the public electricity sector has yet to be reformed. State subsidies to the
      sector in 2007 were estimated to have reached 4 percent of the country’s GDP. Lebanon’s electricity sector thus illustrates the beneﬁts
      of best-ﬁt approaches during periods of crisis, but also the need to exit them over time to prevent long-term ineﬃciencies.
          Given the electricity crisis during reconstruction eﬀorts in Iraq, the question arises as to whether a best-ﬁt, short-term solution
      could have been found. Iraq opted to rebuild its national electricity grid, but lack of progress in such a massive undertaking has left the
      proportion of unmet demand for electricity largely constant since 2003, at 40–50 percent. Did the political, economic, and security con-
      text in Iraq create an enabling environment for a private sector–led solution? In 2003–04, several Lebanese companies started estab-
      lishing secondary neighborhood grids in Baghdad, supplied by small, private electricity generation. The Government of Iraq also con-
      sidered policies to promote small, private generation in 2005, recognizing its own lack of capacity to meet demand in the short term.
      However, the deepening security crisis in Baghdad, including active campaigns to target small private power suppliers, preempted this
      approach. In comparison to Lebanon, Iraq’s weaker tradition of private entrepreneurship and record of eﬀective public service delivery
      into the 1990s may be additional reasons for the lack of emergence of privately generated electricity in the past decade.

    Women in Nepal have suﬀered disproportionately from the decade-long civil war and the continued waves of political, criminal, and
    ethnically driven violence, including in the country’s southern Tarai region. Women are among the poorest population groups; their
    traditional social and economic networks were severely aﬀected and many became heads of households as a result of the conﬂict,
    and their educational attainment is signiﬁcantly below that of men. In this context, empowerment of women is especially critical in
    engendering sustainable economic growth and human development, as well as signaling a break from the past.
        The Women’s Empowerment Program provided cost-eﬀective training and support to 6,500 groups of 130,000 members in the
    Tarai from 1999 to 2001. Its impact on the lives of the participating women has been encouraging. Almost half of the women who
    participated in the program gained a level of literacy, and two-thirds of the women started a business since joining it, thus having an
    independent source of income for the ﬁrst time. When 200 groups were asked how the program had changed their lives, they most
    frequently mentioned gaining self-conﬁdence and an enlarged sphere of inﬂuence in the household, followed by learning to read and
    being accorded more rights.

    In many center-periphery conﬂicts—where groups are engaging in violence to gain autonomy or secede from the state—the devolution
    of political power has been proposed as a possible solution to resolve conﬂict, maintain or restore law and order, and rebalance relations
    between local and central governments.
        But devolution is not an automatic answer to regional tensions and can at times amplify conﬂict. In Northern Ireland, it was not only
    the 1921 partition of Ireland that drove the conﬂict, but also the devolution of authority to a new Northern Ireland Assembly and the
    eﬀects on center-periphery relations. Unionists found a need to reemphasize that they were British, while the Catholic minority lost faith
    in political structures that provided few safeguards for them.
        In Northern Ireland, a new process of devolution was a centerpiece of the Good Friday Accord, introduced gradually to allow conﬁ-
    dence to be built up. The Accord was signed in 1998, but decommissioning of the Irish Republican Army’s weapons and the security
    reforms were not completed until 2005, and the devolution of policing and justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly was ﬁnally com-
    pleted on March 8, 2010.

      Gender has been one of the most politicized issues in Afghanistan for a century. Afghan women and girls today still face suﬀering,
      humiliation, and marginalization from the discriminatory views of the role and position of women in society. Gender gaps are wide-
      spread in health, education, access to and control over resources, economic opportunities, and political power and voice. And yet, this
      role is not stagnant. The National Solidarity Program (NSP), the country’s largest development program, operates in villages across the
      country through democratically elected community development councils (CDCs). Through mobilization by facilitating partners,
      women are involved in voting, while CDC modalities provide a variety of conﬁgurations enabling more balanced gender participation
      (mixed CDCs, parallel committees (one male, one female) that report to a mixed-gender CDC, or a women’s committee that consults
      with a fully male CDC). Results of a comparison between NSP and non-NSP villages using a rigorous study design in an independent
      evaluation suggest that having women in charge of decisions in community projects improves the perceptions by both men and
      women of women in leadership roles (see ﬁgure). This is not being advocated as “the” solution, but it shows that incremental steps can
      lead to incremental progress, even for culturally diﬃcult issues of inclusion.


             F I G U R E A Opinions on the role of women in community life: “Is there a woman in the village who is well
                          respected by men and women?”
                          More men and women in villages that participated in the NSP believe that there is a woman who is
                          well respected in their village than did respondents in villages that did not participate in the program.

          they promote youth incarceration, reducing crime in the short term, but may ultimately lead to
          greater recidivism and more serious crime in the longer term (see Cunningham and others 2008).

      14. Public ﬁnancial management (PFM) reviews are a useful tool to improve transparency and gover-
          nance in the security sector. A PFM review in the Central African Republic found that 25 percent
          of the national budget was spent on the security sector, of which 21 percent was on the military
          and gendarmerie (law enforcement agency charged with police duties, but organized along military
          lines) and only 3 percent was on the police, and that 75 percent of the security sector expenditures
          were on salaries, which were relatively clearly controlled. A major drain on recurrent expenditure
          was an over-age component, comprising over one-third of the army. The main area of concern was
          about receipts and income, which remained off-budget, including taxation on ﬂow of persons and
          commerce. As a result of this report, the European Commission has started ﬁnancing the pensioning
          off of the over-age in the army, and the World Bank has provided training in public ﬁnancial man-
          agement practices to key staff in the security sector as part of its program on improving capacity and
          functioning of public ﬁnancial systems in the government (World Bank 2009f).

          conﬂict countries has been 30 percent. However, this may take time and not be feasible, especially as
          most developed societies do not fulﬁll this target. For example, Finland has 10 percent, the United

    ditional dispute resolution systems can be adapted to address violence against women. For
    instance, 90 percent of women were satisﬁed with the shalishi process (a community dispute
    resolution system) when it was introduced by a rural women’s group in West Bengal, two-thirds
    felt that they were better off, and nearly 90 percent said that physical violence by the husband had
    decreased or stopped. See International Center for Research on Women 2002; Bott, Morrison,

45. Another successful example of the use of Peace Justices and mobile courts to provide better
    access to justice, especially for the most disadvantaged groups, was in Honduras, as part of a
    project to modernize the judicial branch. Project results include (1) enhanced access to justice
    for vulnerable groups (30,000 annual users), ﬁrst-instance courts in rural zones (1,000 annual
    users), and mobile courts in urban-marginal areas (7,000 annual users); (2) specialized service to
    10,000 women in family courts; (3) improved protection to 15,000 women and children against
    domestic violence; (4) specialized service to 1,500 persons from vulnerable groups; (5) establish-
    ment of an integrated ﬁnancial management system that promotes transparency and efﬁciency
    of the courts; (6) development of the judicial career with all the manuals for the selection, classi-
    ﬁcation, and evaluation of personnel that will allow the transparent and competitive selection of
    3,200 personnel; (7) adoption of a new management model for case management that will allow
    monitoring and evaluation of 1,200 judges; and (8) improved services to internal and external
    users of the courts through an IT (information technology) system and judiciary information

       67.   Evidence about the impact of value chain projects on social cohesion is mixed. For example,
             in Nepal, participants in a fresh vegetable value chain project pointed to improved community
             relations stemming from their expanded common interest. And joint efforts and research in
             Rwanda indicates that participation in a coffee value chain project was linked to low ethnic dis-
             tance and distrust. In contrast, a groundnut value chain project in Guinea, while strengthening
             ties between two ethnic groups, did not include the local refugee population, a key party in local
             tensions. For Guinea and Nepal, see Parker 2008. For Rwanda, see Boudreaux and Tobias 2009.

             straint facing ﬁrms (and usually electricity is much higher than any of the other issues). It is also
             in the top three issues for 17 out of the 22 countries assessed. Only two countries, Côte d’Ivoire
             and Tonga, do not have electricity in their top six environmental constraints. Other constraints
             include obtaining ﬁnance, political instability, practices of the informal sector, and corruption.

     for small and medium enterprises is Business Edge of the International Finance Corporation
     (IFC), which makes locally adapted and translated adult-learning materials available, trains
     local trainers, builds capacity of local training companies (who tend to be small and medium
     enterprises themselves), and establishes quality assurance mechanisms so that local ﬁrms
     might in turn train the local population. Business Edge operates in several fragile and con-
     ﬂict-affected economies, including Iraq, Papua New Guinea, West Bank and Gaza, and Yemen.
     In Yemen, nearly 30,000 participants were trained from 2006 to 2010. An independent evalu-
     ation found that the program had a lasting impact on the country. Business Edge fostered a
     vibrant management training market that is active even after subsidies have been withdrawn.
     In Pakistan, an assessment of the program showed that the number of small and medium
     enterprises preparing cash ﬂow statements after training increased by 20 percent and that
     71 percent of participants with irregular credit histories had cleared or decreased their outstand-
     ing amounts six months after the training. See Peschka 2010.

     that hiring is skill-appropriate rather than hiring overqualiﬁed workers who are likely to use the
     scheme as a stepping stone; (2) circular movement of workers to allow good employees to return
     in subsequent years rather than be offered a one-time-only chance at offshore employment
     thereby reducing the incentive to violate the agreement; (3) cost-sharing on travel-related costs
     with employers so that ﬁxed costs borne by migrants are not so large that they make overstaying
     attractive; and (4) commercial viability so that the scheme remains private sector driven and
     reﬂects labor market conditions in host countries rather than by arbitrary quotas that become
     outdated if labor market conditions in destination countries change (World Bank 2006b).

 98. “For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where women run only 18 percent of the
     small businesses, discriminatory provisions in the Family Code require married women to obtain
     marital authorization to go to court in a civil case, to buy and sell property, or to enter into any
     obligations, including starting a business. Banks generally require co-signature/approval of hus-
     bands if women are to obtain loans. The Family Code also affects the ability of all women to
     obtain employment, because proof of marital status is required, and this is difﬁcult in a context
     in which identiﬁcation papers are largely unavailable. Neighboring Rwanda, by contrast, has no
     such regulations, and women in that country run more than 41 percent of the small businesses.”

             settle intertribal disputes, discuss social reforms, and approve a new constitution. More recently,
             a Loya Jirga was convened in 2002 following the fall of the Taliban government and the Bonn
             Accord to choose the new transitional government for the country. See BBC News 2002.
      104.   Success was not universal, however, and some conferences failed to produce an institutional

             of 1972 (see Gadir, Elbadawi, and El-Batahani 2005). However, rebels in the south (primarily
             Anya Nya) were not organized until the early 1960s, and battle deaths from violence did not reach
             major civil war thresholds until 1962, not falling till 1973 (Harbom and Wallensteen 2010).

      112.   Wilkinson and others argue that proportional representation may spur in-ﬁghting among var-
             ious ethnic groups over a small number of highly coveted political ofﬁces, limited economic
             resources, and positions of social status; it may also lead ethnic leaders to bargain harder with
             their rivals and overplay their hands (Wilkinson 2000; de Zwart 2000). Others argue that decen-
             tralization can reinforce ethnic identities, produce discriminatory legislation, provide resources
             for rebellion, and facilitate the collective action necessary for secession. Those that have recently
             found in favor of devolution as a way of maintaining national integrity have done so with cave-
             ats: Brancati argues that decentralization can reduce the likelihood of secession and ethnic con-
             ﬂict, but can have the opposite effect if regional parties are too strong. Lustick and others have
             run simulations that suggest that power-sharing in multicultural countries can lessen the likeli-
             hood of secession—but will in the process mobilize ethnic minorities (Brancati 2006; Lustick,

             the facts and context of serious violations of human rights or of international humanitarian law
             in a country’s past. Commissions’ members are usually empowered to conduct research, support
             victims, and propose policy recommendations to prevent recurrence of crimes. See International

      119.   Truth-seeking is a process through which societies attempt to make sense of the atrocities they
             have suffered during conﬂict or authoritarian regime and to prevent future injustices. Through
             the truth-seeking process, victims are able to ﬁnd closure by learning more about the events
             they suffered, such as the fate of disappeared individuals, or why certain people were targeted
             for abuse. It involves the protection of evidence, the opening and maintenance of archives, the
             opening and publication of state information, and production of comprehensive reports. These
             efforts often come from ofﬁcial inquiry groups called truth commissions. See International Cen-

             countries studied to support the priority given to privatization of state enterprises, this does not

131.   Horizontal inequality is a measure of inequality among individuals or households, not groups. It

137.   After the 1999 referendum, Timor-Leste faced serious health problems, a destroyed infrastructure,
       and virtually no trained personnel. The Interim Health Authority signed agreements with inter-
       national NGOs for each district, and focused its efforts on developing sensible plans, monitoring
       delivery, and training a new cadre of health staff. The initial priority was to provide basic health
       care and services. In the ﬁrst phase, international and national NGOs occupied a central role in
       providing emergency health services throughout Timor-Leste, independently funded through
       humanitarian assistance. In the second and third phase, Timor-Leste fostered a learning environ-
       ment by using 100-day planning cycles to standardize the service packages provided in different
       parts of the territory, with clear targets and a strong focus on results, building conﬁdence and
       capacity by meeting those targets. Over time, the Interim Health Authority was replaced by a new
       Ministry of Health, which assumed district management of the system and facilities. As a result
       of this framework, by late 2001 a fully Timorese Ministry of Health had recruited more than 800
       health staff, given 60 percent of the population access to basic services within a two-hour walk
       from their homes, and boosted health facility use to 1.0 outpatient visits per capita. By 2004, an
       estimated 90 percent of the population had a facility within a two-hour walk, and health facility
       use rose from 0.75 outpatient visits per capita to 2.13. The health ministry and district opera-
       tions were among the few state functions resilient to renewed violence in 2005–06, continuing to
       operate and indeed to provide assistance to the displaced population. World Bank 2002a, 2008h;

       ﬁgure of 45,000 members to 31,000. Shortly after the signing of the accords, however, the army
       reported that its force level actually stood at 35,000, so it only needed a 4,000 troop reduction,
       which indeed took place (more systematically among rank and ﬁle than among the ofﬁcer corps)
       (Stanley and Holiday 2002). See the report of the UN Veriﬁcation Mission in Guatemala, as it
       was winding down its operations (UN Veriﬁcation Mission in Guatemala 2003, 2004).
C
        hapter 6 examines the achievements and shortfalls of
        international support for violence prevention and recovery.
        Multilateral, bilateral, and nongovernmental agencies have
helped committed national leaders deliver great accomplishments
in reducing levels of civil wars. But the international system has not
kept pace with the adaptation of violent actors themselves, and it is
ill-equipped to navigate repeated cycles of violence or the blurred
boundaries between political conﬂict and criminal violence. Interna-
tional agencies are geared to minimizing domestic reputational and
ﬁduciary risk—increasingly so—rather than supporting “best-ﬁt”
institutional solutions that match political realities on the ground.
And there are critical gaps: development agencies have long
focused on building national capacity, but much less so in the
spheres of security and criminal justice. Security agencies operate
in those spheres, but with less long-term focus on building national
institutions. “Support for job creation is a crucial gap across the
international architecture.”

           After 17 years of violence that killed an estimated 900,000 people and displaced a quarter
           of the country’s people, a General Peace Agreement (GPA) was brokered from June 1990 to
           October 1992 by the Roman Catholic Community of Sant’Egidio. The ﬁnal outcome was a
           full-ﬂedged peace agreement owned by the two parties, the Mozambique Government led
           by FRELIMO (the Mozambique Liberation Front) and RENAMO (the Mozambique National
           Resistance). The result was a complex legal and political system that provided institutions and
           methods for the transition to the 1994 elections. The sustainability of the peace agreement
           itself was immediately proved by the absence of any ﬁghting in the seven-month vacuum in
           which Mozambique was left, before the United Nations (UN) operation in Mozambique
           (ONUMOZ) strengthened its presence in the country to monitor the implementation of the
           peace agreement, support the resettlement of refugees, and help form a national army.
           The ONUMOZ mandate brought together for the ﬁrst time the political, military, electoral,
           and humanitarian components of the UN intervention, with an emphasis on enhancing
           coordination.
                ONUMOZ acted as a guarantor of the ceaseﬁre, playing a stabilizing role on the basis of
           its perceived neutrality and helping create trust on both sides. Its role was facilitated by the
           content and quality of the peace agreement resulting from the 27 months of negotiations in
           Sant’Egidio, where a full set of guarantees was devised and proved a key element in facilitating
           a durable peace settlement after the end of ﬁghting. Strong donor engagement and ﬁnancial
           contributions also played a key role in demobilizing combatants from both sides, while human-
           itarian aid during the early years after the GPA helped lessen tensions among displaced popu-
           lations. Since the GPA, Mozambique has grown rapidly—GDP increased an average of 8 per-
           cent a year between 1993 and 2007. Civil liberties and political rights have also increased,1
           reﬂected in elections held in 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009.
                The readiness of both bilateral and multilateral donors to support the implementation of
           the peace agreement through large-scale ﬁnancial support for reconstruction was crucial in
           the transition process. Mozambique is calculated to have received about US$500 million a year
           (in both humanitarian and development aid) on average throughout the 1990s, which was
           equivalent to about two-thirds of imports and 60 percent of the government budget. This
           external aid has played a pivotal economic role in supporting private consumption at the out-
           set, and subsequently in providing ﬁnance for investment and institutional strengthening that
           became the driving force behind Mozambique’s economic growth.2

    Ghana, viewed as one of the most stable countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, has experienced its
    own bouts of local or community violence; a recent study identiﬁed more than 200 low-level
    conﬂicts between 1994 and 2002. The potential for serious violence threatened to emerge in
    2002 over the succession to the Dagbon chieftaincy, after the Andani clan chief of the Dagbon
    ethnic group and 40 of his followers were murdered by the rival Abudu clan. This had national
    implications: Ghana’s vice president was a Dagomba, and the main opposition party had cho-
    sen its vice presidential candidate from a faction contesting the succession. The central gov-
    ernment therefore needed to defuse tension before the next national election. A state of
    emergency was declared in the Dagbon kingdom, and a commission of inquiry established.
    But the commission failed to bring a settlement: its report was rejected by both sides.
        The government then sought UN help to broker a dialogue among youth, women, and
    labor leaders and state institutions, including the police. A compromise was devised that
    included a funeral with full state honors for the slain Andani leader and the nomination of an
    Andani regent. An agreed “roadmap” for succession gave both factions a future chance at pro-
    viding a successor. The 2004 national elections were peaceful, with chiefs and police cooperat-
    ing to avoid violence.
        Building on this dialogue, the Ministry of the Interior, supported by UNDP and UNDPA,
    created a National Architecture for Peace, consisting of district, regional, and national councils,
    which brings together locally respected, politically neutral Ghanaians and provides a platform

      To combat corruption and crime, Guatemala created the International Commission against Impunity,
      known by its Spanish acronym, CICIG, through an agreement with the UN in 2007. Its mandate is to
      “support, strengthen, and assist institutions of the State of Guatemala responsible for investigating and
      prosecuting crimes allegedly committed in connection with the activities of illegal security forces and
      clandestine security organizations.” 45 It is one of the few instances of an international commitment
      mechanism deployed to help a state deal with gang-related and criminal violence.
          CICIG responds to the reality that Guatemala, after a 36-year civil war, has experienced continuous and
      mounting stresses of gang-related violence and police and judicial corruption. Studies show that a legacy
      of failed reintegration of demobilized soldiers at the end of Guatemala’s civil war has contributed to
      today’s spike in criminal violence and gang activity.
          CICIG draws on independent international and local investigative expertise and refers cases to
      Guatemalan prosecutors in the domestic judicial system. A Special Prosecutor’s Oﬃce for CICIG has been
      established in the Public Prosecutor’s oﬃce, and CICIG has also provided technical assistance and capacity-
      building support to the National Civilian Police, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Public Prosecutor.46
      As of March 2010, CICIG had mounted 1,544 judicial proceedings and arrested 135 individuals, including
      former President Alfonso Portillo, accused of embezzling funds.
          CICIG has been an innovative response to the twin challenges of high external stress and low internal
      capacity. However, while CICIG has registered successes within Guatemala, larger regional challenges of
      organized crime and traﬃcking lie beyond its control.

                         and sustainable into the future.”69 In Afghanistan, Tajikistan, and Pakistan, the
                         AKDN cements its commitment in protocols, agreements, and treaties with local,
                         district, and national governments. It builds a diverse donor base, including
                         local, national, and international contributions; invests heavily in local manage-
                         ment and implementation capacity; develops approaches and services that can
                         be sustained by local partners and institutions if donor interest declines; and
                         adopts a cautious approach to area and program expansion unless driven by
                         local demands, priorities, and readiness.70 Typical engagements exceed 20 years.

                         ties, the AKDN bases its development approach on trust earned through demon-
                         strated long-term commitment to these regions and their peoples. That commit-

B OX 6.7   Stop-go aid: Volatility in selected fragile states
Over the last 20 years, countries that experienced longer periods of fragility, violence, or conﬂict experi-
enced more volatility in their aid. Figure A shows that the coeﬃcient of variance (CV) of net oﬃcial develop-
ment assistance (ODA), excluding debt relief, is higher for countries that have experienced more violence
since 1990. This relationship, reﬂected by the upward trend line, is statistically signiﬁcant and suggests that,
on average, a country that experienced 20 years of violence experienced twice the volatility in aid of a
country that did not experience violence. Volatility of revenues has considerable costs for all governments,
but particularly so in fragile situations where it may derail reform eﬀorts and disrupt institution-building.

This volatility is illustrated by ﬁgure B—it was not uncommon for total aid to Burundi, the Central African
Republic, Guinea-Bissau, and Haiti to drop by 20 or 30 percent in one year and increase by up to 50 per-
cent the following year (humanitarian aid and debt relief, excluded from these statistics, would further
increase the volatility).

           In its loan agreements, the World Bank often requires the publication of partner countries’
           engineering estimates of the costs of building a road. When the market is competitive, publish-
           ing the estimates can produce lower bids. Such publication also ensures a procurement norm
           of transparency and equity—that all bidders are on equal footing and companies with close
           ties to the roads authority cannot obtain the estimates “under the table.”
                Set against these beneﬁts is the risk that this procurement practice will facilitate the oppo-
           site of its intent—collusion. When ﬁrms are negotiating an agreement on a collusive price, the
           cost estimate provides a target or focal point for their agreement. This eﬀect is dramatically
           illustrated in a World Bank Institutional Integrity comparison of the estimated price against the
           winning bid on 46 contracts for road construction and repair let during 2009 and 2010 under a
           Bank-ﬁnanced project in an Eastern European country. The closeness of the two is inconceiv-
           able without collusion (see ﬁgure). As a result, a procurement norm has achieved neither the
           goal of quick support—delays are created in publishing the estimate, nor fostering a legitimate
           and transparent process—due to real or perceived collusion.

 Dual accountability dilemma: Accountability and capacity constraints at the national level
 made multidonor trust funds an attractive solution; trust fund arrangements took advantage
 of the mandates and competencies of the UN and the World Bank.


Afghanistan
UNDP established the Afghan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF), supported by 24 donors and
valued at US$73 million for a limited period of six months, to pay for the most pressing needs
of reestablishing the civil service: paying salaries, rehabilitating government buildings, and
procuring equipment. This support bolstered government capability and legitimacy in the
early phases of transition and bridged the gap until such time as a subsequent MDTF could
provide long-term budget support and ﬁnance investment programs.
    The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF), supported by 32 donors, disburses
funds through a ”recurrent window” to ﬁnance the budget (salaries of civil servants and facility
costs, particularly in education and health) and an “investment window” to support the gov-
ernment’s National Priority Programmes. The ARTF is intended to coordinate funding and
reduce the burden on the government, promote transparency and accountability, and rein-
force the role of the national budget in promoting national objectives. Since its inception in
2002, donors have committed US$4 billion (as of December 2010), the largest contribution to
the Afghan budget. The ARTF moved quickly, disbursing 99 percent of committed funds in
2003–04 and 75 percent in 2005–06, serving as the main vehicle for ﬁnancing payment
of government salaries, as well as key projects such as the Salang Tunnel and the National
Solidarity Program. UNDP administers the complementary Law and Order Trust Fund for
Afghanistan (LOTFA), which largely funds police salaries. The current phase of LOTFA was
funded by 15 donors providing around US$306 million.

Southern Sudan
A US$545 million Southern Sudan Multidonor Trust Fund was established in 2005, with
ﬁnancing from 14 donors and with the World Bank appointed as trust fund administrator.
     The government of Southern Sudan, donors, NGOs, and civil society have criticized the
MDTF for slowness and ineﬃciency, lagging disbursements, and inﬂexibility. Reviews have
pointed to the World Bank’s underestimation of logistical diﬃculties, institutional deﬁciencies,
and communication challenges—and to inconsistent managerial oversight, especially in the
critical early phase. Part of the explanation for this was the dilemma faced by the World Bank
in trying to balance the risk posed by swift action (possible misuse of the funds) with the risks
of inaction (failing to disburse funds and not achieving goals).
     The World Bank has taken steps to improve the fund’s management—disbursements in
2010 amounted to US$188 million and reached a total of US$400 million by December 2010
(almost three-quarters of the funds committed).

                                             1. In 1990, Freedom House gave civil liberties in Mozambique the worst possible score and political
                                                rights the second-worst on a scale of 1 to 7, whereas the scores had both improved to 3 in 2009.
                                                Freedom House uses a 1 to 7 scale, where 7 indicates the lowest level of freedom, with few or no
                                                political rights because of severe government oppression, sometimes in combination with civil war.
                                                At the other end of the scale, countries and territories with a rating of 1 enjoy a wide range of po-
                                                litical rights, including free and fair elections.

                                             6. South-South bilateral aid increased by some 68 percent, from 2004 to 2008, to an estimated US$626

23.   Light mediation start-up budget (LMSB) covers the cost of a small mediation team that is required
      to address a limited conﬂict. Such conﬂicts are typically clearly between two states or coherent par-
      ties within a state (without a regional dimension) that are amenable to resolution within a short
      period of time (possibly within a year). The LMSB will allow UNDPA to establish a mediation effort
      quickly and sustain it for up to three months, while the full costing for the initiative is being devel-
      oped and resourced. Heavy mediation start-up budget (HMSB) covers the initial costs of address-
      ing a complex conﬂict situation. Complex conﬂicts typically have local and regional dimensions,
      and the mediation team is likely to be deployed in multiple locations. Complex conﬂicts are likely
      to require a heavier presence in the capital and a presence in the regions and neighboring countries.
      In this regard, the HMSB is intended to facilitate the rapid establishment of the initial UN presence
      on the ground for a period of one year, while the costing of the full mediation team for the ﬁrst and
      subsequent years is developed and resourced.

      en’s political participation and their access to education, health, housing, and other resources—a
      success attributed to the only female member in the peace negotiations. See Potter 2005.

      the phrase “collaborative capacities” and further reﬁned the institutions relevant to prevention and
      recovery from violence as “dynamic networks of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources,
      values, and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conﬂict prevention and
      peace-building in a society” (UN Interagency Framework for Coordination on Preventive Action

             for implementing or monitoring agreements. This follows the common economic deﬁnition of
             commitment mechanisms or commitment devices (e.g., see Dixit 1980, Schelling 1960, and Spence
             1977). Doyle and Sambanis (2006, 111) ﬁnd that treaties and UN missions work in concert and
             note “a positive (though not large) correlation between UN mandates and the signing of a peace
             treaty, since treaties are necessary for certain UN operations.” The UN can facilitate peace treaties
             among parties, and enforce peace when agreements become unstuck as “without a treaty and trans-
             formational UN mission, the likelihood of success drops substantially from an initial value of about
             80 per cent to less than 5 per cent at extreme values of hostility” (Doyle and Sambanis 2006, 130).

             ernments might pursue to increase the prospects of sustained economic development from natural
             resource exploitation. See Natural Resource Charter 2010.

             jurisdiction. To date, the Congress has approved four essential laws: Law on Arms and Ammunition,
             Law to Strengthen Criminal Prosecutions, Law on Jurisdiction in High-Risk Criminal Proceedings,
             and Reforms to the Law Against Organized Crime and Incidents. See CICIG 2009.

       48.   Both the UN and the international ﬁnancial institutions consider regional stances in their ap-
             proaches to governments, but no structured mechanisms exist to discuss this with the regional
             institutions.
       49.   A major focus of humanitarian assistance in past years has been four deadly disease clusters––acute
             respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, malaria, and measles—all of which are major killers in
             wartime. All are preventable and treatable at very low cost. Worldwide increases in immunization
             coverage over the past 30-plus years have played a large part in reducing mortality from these dis-
             eases. Between 1974 and 2006, coverage for the six major vaccine-preventable diseases rose from
             less than 5 percent to more than 75 percent of the world’s population. In addition to preventing
             and treating disease, a signiﬁcant share of humanitarian aid budgets is devoted to treating severe
             malnutrition. Fatality rates for severely malnourished children have decreased because of this and
             better treatment protocols. Peacetime immunization drives, together with the life-saving impact
             of humanitarian assistance, have all contributed to reducing wartime mortality from disease and
             malnutrition. See Human Security Report Project, forthcoming; Guha-Sapir and D’Aoust 2010.

66. A notable exception to the fragmentation of donor assistance strategies is the preparation of a coun-
    try assistance framework in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Following the 2006 elections, do-
    nors confronted the need to begin planning for the post-election period in a fragile and uncertain
    political landscape. A joint strategy framework, building on the ﬁve pillars identiﬁed in the Poverty
    Reduction Strategy Program, appealed to the Democratic Republic of Congo’s partners as a way of
    mitigating risk while preparing the way for partners to engage in substantive dialogue with the new
    government on pre-identiﬁed and pre-agreed issues as soon as it was formed. Under an initiative by
    the UN Integrated Ofﬁce in the UN Democratic Republic of Congo peacekeeping mission and the
    World Bank, a Country Assistance Framework was developed as a common strategic approach to
    recovery and development assistance, and was agreed to by 17 international partners. A challenge
    with such joint donor planning, however, is to keep it ﬂexible enough to respond to new challenges,
    as subsequently emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo. See also Rohland and Cliffe 2002;
    Republic of Liberia and UN 2007.
67. Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart, in Fixing Failed States, analyze the issue of establishing legitimacy
    and closing the sovereignty gap in fragile and conﬂict-affected states through the lens of “double
    compact.” The double compact focuses on the “network of rights and obligations underpinning
    the state’s claim to sovereignty . . .” and refers ﬁrst to the “compact . . . between a state and its citi-
    zens . . . embedded in a coherent set of rules,” and second, “between a state and the international
    community to ensure adherence to international norms and standards of accountability and trans-
    parency” (Ghani and Lockhart 2008, 8).

       74. Volatility has costs in all economic activity with expectations, reﬂected by risk premiums. Losses
           associated with volatility can come in the form of additional costs of ﬁnancial management; the
           opportunity costs of idle funds (windfalls) or missed investment opportunities (shortfalls); the
           costs associated with over borrowing and debt buildup when there is uncertainty about amount
           needed and concessional credits are used; and the costs associated with volatility in ﬁscal spending
           and the real exchange rate that can follow from volatility in aid (Kharas 2008). These costs can be
           further ampliﬁed by donor “herding” behavior, which is often more responsive to political instabil-
           ity and violence. Additionally, the costs of shortfalls may be higher in fragile and conﬂict-affected
           states. While an aid shortfall in a typical developing country may lead to the costs above, in a fragile
           or conﬂict-affected state, such a shortfall may completely derail transition moments, interrupting
           reform and possibly leading to political crises.

           nity has supported many best-ﬁt measures in complex conﬂict settings (see chapter 5). As further
           examples, in 2003–04, while conditions for comprehensive disarmament in Haiti were not in place,
           UNDP undertook an innovative project that linked disarmament to a community approach in-
           volving information campaigns, support to community conﬂict-resolution mechanisms, and mi-
           croprojects beneﬁting community groups as well as former members of armed gangs. In the West
           Bank and Gaza since 2002, the World Bank and several donors have been ﬁnancing non-salary
           recurrent expenditures of the ministries of Health, Education and Higher Education, and Social
           Affairs through the Emergency Services Support Program MDTF in response to a deepening ﬁscal
           and economic crisis.

           should expect and receive highly competent and committed professionals able to work in difﬁcult
           environments); a simple and well thought out program that can be implemented quickly; effec-
           tive coordination among donors to ensure consistent policy advice; the participation of national
           champions to move the process along; and links to speciﬁc programs (so that advice and training
           reinforces new initiatives) (World Bank 2000).

           of need, and remain deployed for a minimum of 60 days); standby capacity (can be in-country
           within 60 days, and remain deployed for a minimum of 180 days); and rostered capacity (can be in-
           country within 180 days, deployment term subject to contract) (see Chandran and others 2009; Sisk
           2010; Korski and Gowan 2009). Australia’s International Deployment Group (IDG), for example, is
           a standing corps of more than 500 Australian federal police ofﬁcers trained and ready to deploy on
           peacekeeping missions (see Peake and Brown 2010). The U.S. Ofﬁce of the Coordinator for Recon-
           struction and Stabilization is building up a civilian standby capacity of interagency personnel.

       90. Of the different forms that South-South cooperation has taken, technical assistance has been the
           most common. Although many technical assistance projects focus on economic and social devel-
           opment, countries in the Global South have also developed specialized capacities in post-conﬂict
           peacebuilding. Examples include South Africa’s support to build structural capacities for public
           service through peer learning among public sector schools (Management Development Institutes)
           at the Ministries for Public Administration in Burundi, Rwanda, and Southern Sudan. Cooperation
           among 45 municipalities in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras helps to manage regional public
           goods, such as water, in the Triﬁnio region. See OECD 2010f.

 91. In 2008, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) established the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to
     “effectively assist eligible fragile states to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay foundations
     for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth” (AfDB 2011, 1). The FSF has
     three grant pillars: Pillar I, the supplemental support window for funding infrastructure, state capac-
     ity building, and accountability; Pillar II, the arrears clearance window; and Pillar III, the technical
     assistance and capacity-building window. Eligible states are those that have a harmonized AfDB/
     World Bank CPIA rating of less than 3.2, or countries that have had UN or regional peacebuilding,
     peacekeeping, or mediation operations over the last three years. Pillar III provides technical assis-
     tance and capacities aimed at ﬁlling critical gaps in carefully selected public sector domains through
     secondment of seasoned professional staff from neighboring countries and on-the-job training
     opportunities with the objective of building a sustainable cadre of senior civil servants—fragile
     states that have the capacity in management and implementation of reforms. The program is usu-
     ally implemented as integrated components of comprehensive capacity-building plans. By March
     2010, this South-South cooperation facility had received resources in the amount of UA (Units of
     Accounts) 85.39 million, equivalent to13.2 percent of the total FSF resources (AfDB 2010, 5).

     from 26 per 100,000 in 2006–07 to 17 in 2008–09, lower than in any other major Latin American

     UNDP and UNDPA to build such capacities in violence-affected countries are either former inter-

     implemented with discrete UN assistance, or have been trained by them. See UNDP 2010a.
 97. Funding provided through the Ofﬁce of the Transition Initiatives at USAID is one example. This
     transition funding is not subject to the same policies and procedures as other ﬁnancing provided
     by USAID. DFID’s Middle East and North Africa Department has created a Program Risk Assess-
     ment Matrix that assesses risk factors in conﬂict programming. The EU is currently developing a

     specialized divisions. The principles underlying security provision can also be quite different in oth-

     IFC also partnered with the BBC in Afghanistan on a series of radio “edutainment” programs that
     combine education with entertainment on issues such as unemployment, lack of infrastructure,
     and inadequate service provision and aimed to raise awareness of the beneﬁts of small business

      116.   Precisely because the budget is a tool for political bargaining, when the government has few re-
             sources available to it within a budget, its scope for negotiating inclusive-enough pacts is dimin-
             ished. Diminished also is its ability to balance the process of building more inclusive institutions,
             for which social service delivery is an important tool (see also Ghani, Lockhart, and Carnahan

        hapter 7 extends the analysis of this Report to international
        eﬀorts to deal with the regional and global stresses associ-
        ated with the risks of violence. Here we encounter a diﬀerent
lacuna: agencies dealing with country-level support have neglected
global stresses, and international agencies tackling global stresses
have paid modest attention to the special characteristics of coun-
tries aﬀected by violence. Rectifying this requires a two-pronged
approach: take more decisive steps to tackle global stresses in
their own right, and build into those eﬀorts a conscious eﬀort to
reinforce the capacity of states with weak institutions to build up
buﬀers against global shocks. This approach may often need to be
initiated at the regional level, where states can pool capacities and
share eﬀorts to manage the impacts of global systems. No state or
society is impermeable, and most states’ economies are deeply
interwoven with regional and global economic systems.

     B OX 7.2   The Kimberley Process for “conﬂict diamonds”
     The Kimberley Process, a certiﬁcation scheme to ensure that the origins of rough diamonds are
     sources free of conﬂict, was initiated to stem the ﬂow of ”conﬂict diamonds” used to fuel rebel-
     lions in countries like the DRC, and has been jointly undertaken by civil society groups, indus-
     try, and governments. It evolved from recommendations by a UN Security Council sanctions
     committee that investigated the relationship between commodity traﬃcking and violence in
     the DRC. The Kimberly Process diamond certiﬁcation scheme imposes extensive requirements
     on its 49 members (representing 75 countries) to ensure that the rough diamonds shipped
     have not funded violence.
          Although diamonds have high value-to-weight ratios and are very portable, diamond
     wholesale markets and processing facilities are concentrated in speciﬁc locations, with the
     former primarily in Antwerp and the latter primarily in Mumbai. Some 80 percent of rough dia-
     monds and more than 50 percent of polished stones pass through Antwerp. Only high-value
     stones are now polished in New York; most small low-value stones are polished in and around
     Mumbai, whose workshops accounted for an estimated 90 percent of the global polished dia-
     mond output in 2009. The number of licit diamond producers is also small. All these factors
     make it hard to trade conﬂict diamonds without attracting attention.

          B OX 7 .3   The economics of cocaine trafﬁcking
           In 2008, the average kilo of cocaine entered the Mesoamerican transit corridor at a price of
           about US$1,000.28 The same kilo could then be sold on the U.S. side of the border for about
           US$33,500. These numbers, point estimates based on average market values, can vary widely
           depending on market conditions, purity, organization, and vertical integration in cocaine
           production and traﬃcking. Still, taking these rough estimates as a starting point, the average
           potential proﬁt for moving a kilo of cocaine through the Mesoamerican transit corridor into
           the United States is over US$30,000 before other costs of traﬃcking are deducted.
               If 10 to 20 percent of the cost is used in transportation, security, and labor, and 20 to 30
           percent of cocaine in transit is seized, this would reduce the potential proﬁts from traﬃcking
           an individual kilo to between US$15,000 and US$21,000. Even taking these deductions into
           account, this proﬁt range is far higher than the annual 2008 GDP per capita of any country in
           the region. But in economic terms, the prospective drug traﬃcker must consider two other
           potential costs: the opportunity cost of other gainful employment forgone and the risk pre-
           mium associated with the dangerous and illegal occupation of drug traﬃcking. Recent
           increases in interdictions and arrests would also increase these costs.

    B OX 7.4      Multiple interdiction efforts: Cocaine in the Americas
     In the Americas, the cocaine trail begins with on-farm production in only three South American countries
     (in 2008, Colombia accounted for 51 percent of global production, Peru 36 percent, and Bolivia 13 per-
     cent);33 transits through Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean; and is sold wholesale and retail in the
     United States. A proliferation of initiatives is trying to stem this ﬂow: 10 bilateral or regional programs, with
     many countries belonging to more than one program (see map).
          This situation raises questions about the coherence of the international response, especially since
     increased enforcement in one area often leads to diversion to another. The creation of one Caribbean
     initiative was justiﬁed in part because “recent eﬀorts to enhance drug enforcement eﬀorts along the
     [U.S.] southwest border seem to be having a consequent eﬀect of moving transit routes back into the
     Caribbean.”34

           If the avoidance of failed states were the sole policy goal, the legalization of all drugs would be
           transparently desirable: failed states and civil conﬂicts create congenial conditions for illicit
           drug-dealing, while illicit drug production weakens states and fuels civil conﬂict, with drug rev-
           enues supporting insurgents and other armed nonstate actors and corrupting oﬃcials. How-
           ever, drug abuse creates problems for drug abusers and for their families, neighbors, and co-
           workers. Prohibition is not a perfect answer: it can exacerbate those problems, create violence
           and corruption around illicit markets (in producer, transit, and consumer countries), and con-
           tribute to the problem of mass incarceration. Yet prohibition also tends to reduce drug con-
           sumption. Alcohol abuse is far more common, and generates far more intoxicated violence,
           than the abuse of any illicit drug. So there is tension between security and governance and the
           control of drug abuse: blanket drug legalization would be a blow against terrorism, but would
           also increase the prevalence of substance-abuse disorders.
                It is sometimes claimed that the full beneﬁts of prohibition in reducing substance abuse
           could be achieved through some combination of taxes and regulations, without incurring the
           costs of prohibition in terms of violence. But that claim rests on two fallacious beliefs: that
           taxes and regulations would not be proﬁtably deﬁed, and that the economic and political mus-
           cle of the newly legalized drug industries would not succeed in eating away at the controls
           that limit their marketing scope.
                Eﬀective taxation and regulation might be technically feasible, with bans on marketing,
           restriction of commerce to cooperatives, or delegation of authority to physicians and pharma-
           cists operating under professional strictures. But there is no reason to be conﬁdent that such
           systems of eﬀective control would be established or would remain stable.
                The current international drug-abuse control regime too rests on twin fallacies: ﬁrst, that
           actions in producer countries can greatly restrict drug abuse “downstream,” and, second, that,
           since drug production creates security-and-governance problems, any sort of counter–drug
           activity naturally helps solve those problems. “Source control” eﬀorts are largely futile, and
           source-country counter-narcotics eﬀorts—not only enforcement but also alternative develop-
           ment—naturally exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, security and governance problems. They
           do so by raising prices (and thus revenues, since ﬁnal demand is highly inelastic to farm gate
           price) and by conferring competitive advantage on traﬃckers with the most guns and the most
           inﬂuence: terrorists, insurgents, warlords, armed transnational crime groups, and corrupt oﬃ-
           cials. The same is true of “crop substitution” or “alternative development.” In Afghanistan, a
           combination of enforcement and development eﬀorts has concentrated poppy growing in
           areas under Taliban control, and thus increased the yield to the Taliban from whatever “taxes”
           it can collect from poppy farmers and heroin reﬁners.
                It is possible to imagine a drug-enforcement eﬀort focused on the intersection between
           drug dealing and security-and-governance problems, pursuing traﬃckers and growing regions
           that contribute most to instability. But as with taxation and regulation, imagining a better pol-
           icy is not the same as implementing it.
                Reduced source-country enforcement would have minimal impact on the drug problem in
           rich consumer countries. Soil in which illicit drug crops can be grown is not a scarce resource,
           and shrinking the supply from one producer generally means a corresponding increase in pro-
           duction elsewhere.
                Successful demand-reduction eﬀorts both reduce substance abuse and shrink the revenues
           of illicit enterprises, including those that threaten the stability of producer-country govern-
           ments. Forcing drug abusers under criminal-justice supervision for other crimes has much
           greater potential to shrink total volumes. We should try to optimize the policies that imple-
           ment prohibition, developing a drug-control regime that serves the goal of reducing the
           extent of substance-abuse disorders and the damage they cause at the minimum cost in terms
           of security and governance.

Worldwide prohibition of drugs is roughly 100 years old. During that time span, national and
subnational governments have expended enormous sums on police, prosecutors, and prisons
in attempts to enforce it. Advocates of prohibition believe that, despite these costs, the world
has beneﬁted by avoiding a far greater incidence of drug use, addiction, and other negatives.
Thus, according to this perspective, the beneﬁts of prohibition exceed the costs.
     In fact, prohibition causes far more deleterious consequences than it prevents. To see why,
consider the consequences of prohibition.
     First, prohibition generates violence because it drives markets underground. In legal mar-
kets, participants resolve their disputes with advertising and lawsuits, but in underground mar-
kets these nonviolent mechanisms are not available, so participants use violence instead. Traf-
ﬁckers engage in turf battles with rival traﬃckers and shoot employees who steal, customers
who do not pay, and suppliers who renege on contracts. Traﬃckers also employ violence
against law enforcement attempts to arrest them, against politicians who support extradition
to the United States, and against civilians who cooperate with the police.
     Violence soared in the United States, for example, in response to federal alcohol prohibition
in 1920 but then declined rapidly after repeal. Prohibition also generates corruption. Those
who run afoul of the law have strong incentives for bribery of police, judges, and politicians.
     Prohibition contributes to the spread of HIV, hepatitis, and other blood-borne diseases
because it raises drug prices. When drugs are expensive, users face an incentive to inject rather
than consume in less risky ways because injection delivers the biggest bang for the buck. The
impact is not only on drug users but on the broader population.
     Prohibition creates a source of ﬁnance for violent groups, including terrorist groups and
rebel organizations. Traﬃckers need protection from law enforcement and the military, so they
hire terrorist groups to provide this enforcement. Terrorists beneﬁt by earning income that
supports their operations. Without this support, terrorist groups like the Taliban in Afghanistan,
the FARC in Colombia, and the Shining Path in Peru would face far greater diﬃculty in funding
their activities. On the ﬂip side, legalization would allow police and the military to devote more
resources to ﬁghting terrorist or insurgent groups than ﬁghting traﬃckers.
     All these eﬀects are adverse consequences of prohibition. The only possible justiﬁcation for
prohibition, therefore, is that it might reduce drug use or the harmful side-eﬀects of use.
     Yet abundant evidence suggests that prohibition has, at most, a modest impact in reducing
drug use. Repeal of alcohol prohibition produced only about a 20 percent increase in use,
while Portugal’s 2001 decriminalization policy for reasonable personal consumption of drugs
did not cause a measurable increase (indeed, use was lower afterwards). Across countries, use
rates bear little connection to the strictness of the prohibition regime. The Netherlands has a
tolerant policy towards use of marijuana, for example, yet use rates diﬀer little from those in
the United States.
     This evidence does not rule out the possibility that use might increase by measurable
amounts under legalization, but assertions that use or addiction would skyrocket are inconsis-
tent with evidence. Societies have the option of legalizing the good but targeting misuse—as
is done for alcohol and other goods that can be used irresponsibly but that most people use
responsibly. Consistency therefore requires the same approach to drugs.
     In sum, prohibition has a broad range of harmful eﬀects and, at best, a modest and specu-
lative beneﬁt. Legalization means the harms from drugs fall mainly on those who choose these
risks, many of whom were already doing so under prohibition, rather than on innocent
bystanders and law enforcement institutions. The choice between prohibition and legalization
is therefore clear. Legalization is not a panacea, but it is unquestionably the lesser of the evils.

    B OX 7.6    Partnering with client countries to curb corruption in
                World Bank–funded projects
     The World Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency investigates allegations of corruption, fraud, coer-
     cion, collusion, and attempts to conceal this conduct in World Bank–funded projects. If a com-
     plaint is substantiated, a process is begun and can result in barring ﬁrms or individuals from
     bidding on Bank-ﬁnanced contracts, with referrals to the appropriate law enforcement authori-
     ties for possible criminal prosecution under national law.
          Over the past six years, 67 individuals and ﬁrms have been barred from bidding on World
     Bank contracts from two years up to indeﬁnitely. The list includes very small ﬁrms and nongov-
     ernmental organizations in developing countries to U.K. publisher Macmillan Limited and the
     China Road and Bridge Corporation, a large state-owned enterprise. During this period, the
     Bank also concluded a settlement agreement with Siemens AG whereby the Siemens Group
     agreed to voluntarily refrain from bidding on Bank-ﬁnanced contracts for two years. As part of
     its settlement with the Bank, Siemens will commit US$100 million over the next 15 years to
     global eﬀorts to ﬁght fraud and corruption. Macmillan and others have agreed to cooperate
     with the Bank’s ongoing eﬀorts to combat fraud and corruption in its projects and to imple-
     ment an anti-corruption compliance program.
          The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Euro-
     pean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Inter-American Development Bank
     have agreed to honor each other’s debarments so that in the future, a ﬁrm debarred by one
     bank will be ineligible to bid on contracts funded by the other banks.
          Since it was established in 2001, the Bank’s Integrity Vice Presidency has referred 112 cases
     to national law enforcement agencies. Referrals in 2001–06 resulted in convictions in national
     courts in Bolivia, Guinea, Norway, and the United States for receiving a bribe, embezzlement,
     or other corruption oﬀenses. More recently, a referral led the Kenyan Anticorruption Commis-
     sion to open 38 criminal investigations, two of which are being prosecuted. Acting on informa-
     tion from the World Bank, the Norwegian government indicted three former employees of
     Norconsult for bribery, and the Palestinian Attorney General’s oﬃce opened an investigation of
     a contractor on a World Bank–funded project for fraud.

    B OX 7.7   The Australian Crime Commission’s high-risk money
               movement strategy
    Under its ﬁnancial crimes program, the Australian Crime Commission is piloting a risk-based
    approach to identifying funds linked to organized crime. This approach to money laundering,
    developed with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC), analyzes bulk
    ﬁnancial transaction data to identify and monitor “high-risk” money movements (those most
    likely to involve illicit funds). To identify these ﬂows and the associated criminal enterprise struc-
    tures and entities, the commission has developed a methodology to identify unusual and unex-
    pected amounts of money ﬂowing through AUSTRAC and the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide
    Interbank Financial Telecommunication) banking system.
        This highly selective approach allows investigators to target their resources eﬃciently.
    Individuals and groups identiﬁed this way are cross-checked for police records and, if found
    suspicious, are further investigated using surveillance, interviews, and, where necessary, coercive
    powers. The intelligence enables investigators to follow high-risk transactions into and from
    Australia and to identify potential criminal actors at each end of the money chain.
        This approach helped identify one Southeast Asian crime syndicate that imported A$129 mil-
    lion of narcotics over ﬁve weeks in 2001. The group is likely to have conducted similar imports
    throughout the preceding 12 months, or more than A$1 billion in illicit funds for this syndicate
    alone. Another Southeast Asian crime syndicate of four small shops transferred A$300 million in
    drug proﬁts overseas over 12 months in 2001.

          B OX 7 .9   Global approaches to land
           In response to a sharp increase in investment involving signiﬁcant use of agricultural land,
           water, grassland, and forested areas in developing and emerging countries, the FAO, Interna-
           tional Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Conference on Trade and
           Development (UNCTAD), and the World Bank launched a consultative process involving gov-
           ernments, civil society, international organizations, and the private sector to develop voluntary
           guidelines for responsible large-scale acquisition of land rights.
               The principles are intended to assist in “alleviating hunger and poverty, enhancing the
           environment, supporting national and local economic development, and reforming public
           administration” by setting priorities for domestic food, shelter, and sustainable development
           needs. The draft set of “Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment that Respects Rights,
           Livelihoods and Resources” is as follows:
              1. Existing rights to land and associated natural resources are recognized and respected.
              2. Investments do not jeopardize food security but rather strengthen it.
              3. Processes for accessing land and other resources and then making associated invest-
                 ments are transparent, monitored, and ensure accountability by all stakeholders, within
                 a proper business, legal, and regulatory environment.
              4. All those materially aﬀected are consulted, and agreements from consultations are
                 recorded and enforced.
              5. Investors ensure that projects respect the rule of law, reﬂect industry best practice, are
                 viable economically, and result in durable shared value.
              6. Investments generate desirable social and distributional impacts and do not increase
                 vulnerability.
              7. Environmental impacts due to a project are quantiﬁed and measures taken to encourage
                 sustainable resource use while minimizing the risk/magnitude of negative impacts and
                 mitigating them.

       BOX 7.11      Pooling services regionally
       In the past three decades, the role of regional organizations as providers of public services has increased in Sub-Saharan Africa and the
       eastern Caribbean. Political independence brought self-determination but also meant that services formerly provided through colonial
       institutions had to be supplied by ﬂedgling national institutions. Several countries responded by pooling resources regionally and con-
       tracting out some public service provision to the newly created regional organizations.
           In most cases, the services contracted out were advisory rather than executive. For instance, countries relied on regional organi-
       zations for advisory aspects of banking supervision (as with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank or the Banque des Etats de l’Afrique
       Centrale,66 and the Banque Centrale des Etats de l’Afrique de l’Ouest),67 while retaining the role of each country’s sovereign government
       in enforcing recommendations. In hindsight, this model worked well when there was a tradition of cooperation in central banking that
       predated independence.
           By pooling resources, countries have produced higher quality services and better civil servants than would have been possible had
       the countries acted separately. The success of this model has encouraged other experiments. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, Civil
       Aviation Authority, and Supreme Court, regional entities under the Revised Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Treaty, have been
       followed by a joint telecommunications regulator, the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority, and a joint natural disaster risk
       pooling mechanism, the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Fund. These organizations have also raised the bar on what the public
       and politicians expect for the quality of public services. Similarly, the regional central banks were followed in 1993 by the Organisation
       pour l’Harmonisation en Afrique du Droit des Aﬀaires in Central and West Africa, founded to harmonize business law among member
       countries and serve as a supranational appeals court on aspects of business law. The West Africa Telecommunications Regulatory Agree-
       ment, established in 2002, has pursued the harmonization and integration of the telecommunications market in West Africa.
           Although the role of regional organizations as public service providers has not developed to the same extent in the Paciﬁc, due in
       part to vast distances and more diverse historical and cultural backgrounds, the University of the South Paciﬁc is an initiative that others
       can learn from. Opened in 1968 and supported by 12 Paciﬁc Island countries, it is acknowledged internationally as a credible institution
       of higher learning.

    B OX 7.12    Early European measures to create shared economic interests in peace
    The creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)—the forerunner to the European Union—shows how economic inte-
    gration can underpin peace and security. The ECSC was formed to create a common market and jointly monitor the production and
    use of coal and steel—strategically important goods. The ECSC Treaty was signed in Paris in 1951 and led to the free movement of coal
    and steel and free access to sources of production. A common High Authority supervised the market, respect for competition rules,
    and price transparency.
        The ECSC enabled the lifting of ceilings on coal and steel production in key German industries in the postwar period without
    seeming to threaten the security of the country’s neighbors. Lifting these ceilings and generating regional conﬁdence in coal and steel
    markets were important, not just for Germany’s economic growth, but also for European economic recovery as a whole. The notion of
    cross-border cooperation to spur investment, regulate production, open markets, and build conﬁdence and trust are applicable in
    other regions prone to political instability or recovering from conﬂict.
        Other forms of European cooperation have also managed to develop productive exchanges across borders and individual regions.
    The “Euro region” began as an innovative form of transborder cooperation (between two or more states that share a common border-
    ing region) in the late 1950s. With the purpose of stimulating cross-border economic, sociocultural, and leisure cooperation, the Eurore-
    gion model grew, and was boosted through the creation of the European common market and recent democratic transitions. There are
    currently more than 100 Euroregions spread across Europe, and the model has in recent times been replicated in eastern and central
    European territories. Cooperation has not been without problems in areas previously aﬀected by conﬂict, but there are good examples
    of cross-border developmental, social, and security programs that involve areas where ethnic minorities reside across several states or
    in areas that have suﬀered the trauma of interstate and civil war in the past.

                                     6.   UN “Groups of Friends” began in the post–Cold War period as a mediation tool for countries
                                          attempting to prevent or exit conﬂict. Friends groups have been operating over the past two
                                          decades, providing a core group of interested states that apply diplomatic persuasion—carrots and
                                          sticks—in promoting peace settlements. Most often these are informal groupings, with a negotiated
                                          and varied rather than rigid mandate based on the country context. See Whitﬁeld 2007.

                                          account for 0.1 percent of the total global production of rough diamonds, which stood at US$12.7

14. Gemologists are generally able to identify the origin of diamonds if they receive several parcels of
    gems coming from the same area. They have great difﬁculties in identifying origin once stones from
    different areas have been mixed, and they are completely unable to identify the origins of a polished
    stone (see Goreaux 2001).
15. This is an estimate for oil trafﬁcked only from Nigeria, where this problem is concentrated, and is
    based on an estimated 150,000 barrels per day at a price of US$20 per barrel—a signiﬁcant discount
    over world oil prices to attract large buyers (see UNODC 2009a).
16. Estimated 2008 value of illegally imported wood products (see Lawson and MacFaul 2010, 125).
17. While it is technically feasible to trace the origins of timber (and this indeed has been the focus of a
    number of “responsible forestry” initiatives), doing so depends either on tagging at the country of
    origin and a secure chain of custody, or on a more complicated DNA analysis.

19. The number of legal manufacturers of small arms is estimated to have increased from fewer than
    200 companies in 1980 to more than 600 by 2001. As of 2001, at least 95 countries had the capacity
    to undertake the legal production of small arms. See Small Arms Survey Project 2001.
20. Most, but not all, small arms and light weapons are marked at the point of manufacture, for exam-
    ple, with a serial number and manufacturer’s mark that is stamped, etched, or engraved into metal-
    lic parts of the weapon. However, where they exist, the marks often contain insufﬁcient informa-
    tion for unique identiﬁcation and reliable tracing, and there is no centralized record-keeping. See
    Greene 2001.
21. UNODC 2010a, 82, 111.
22. Illicit trade in small arms and light weapons takes place in both the black and the gray markets. For
    a deﬁnition of both markets, see Stohl and Grillot 2009. For information on the SALW, see Small
    Arms Survey Project 2006. The estimate of the elicit portion is reported in Marsh 2002.

29. Although the deﬁnition of terrorism is fraught, and the question of which groups should be referred
    to as terrorist organizations is contested, 12 UN Conventions that have been adopted by the Gen-
    eral Assembly specify tactics that are classiﬁed as terrorism.
30. An example of this today is the presence of transnational terrorist organizations afﬁliated with
    Al-Qaeda in the subnational conﬂicts in Indonesia and the Philippines (see Putzel 2003; Kilcullen
    2009; Acharya and Acharya 2007).

38. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in 1990 by the ﬁnance ministers of G-7
    countries to combat the problem of illegal narcotics trafﬁcking and money laundering through
    strengthened international cooperation. The FATF’s initial mission was to focus on preventing the
    use of the banking system and other ﬁnancial institutions for the purpose of money laundering.
    As an initial step and based on an analysis of the existing situation, the FATF developed a series of
    recommendations on speciﬁc measures, including the adaptation of national legal and regulatory
    systems, that would help detect, prevent, and punish misuse of the ﬁnancial system for money
    laundering. Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the FATF issued additional guidelines to counter
    the terrorist ﬁnancing. The FATF relies on a unique cooperation network involving more than 180
    jurisdictions around the world, including multilateral organizations such as the G-20, UN, World
    Bank, and IMF. Additionally, eight FATF-style regional bodies have been created over the years as
    part of this network. See Financial Action Task Force 2010.
39. The Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units is an informal international gathering of ﬁnan-
    cial intelligence units (FIUs) formed in 1995. FIUs are national centers to collect information on
    suspicious or unusual ﬁnancial activity from the ﬁnancial industry and other entities or professions
    required to report transactions suspected of being money laundering or terrorism ﬁnancing. FIUs
242   WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 1



            are normally not law enforcement agencies; their mission is to analyze the information received. If
            sufﬁcient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution. The
            goal of the Egmont Group is to provide a forum for FIUs around the world to improve cooperation
            in the ﬁght against money laundering and ﬁnancing of terrorism and to foster the implementation
            of domestic programs in this ﬁeld. Intscher 2010.

      42.   Such as the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN), the U.K. Serious Organized
            Crime Agency (SOCA), the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC), and
            the Canadian Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center (FINTRAC).
      43.   A large proportion of FIUs (about 60–65 percent) receive only Suspicious Transaction Reports,
            which meet some test of suspicion, and are by and large domestic transactions, usually of a relatively
            modest amount. This is the mandatory minimum reporting requirement of the FATF Recommen-
            dations. A substantial minority of FIUs (about 25–30 percent) also receive, or have access to, Large
            Cash Transaction Reports, reported solely on the basis of the transaction exceeding a threshold
            value speciﬁed in law or regulation. A small proportion of FIUs (perhaps 10–15 percent) receive
            some Foreign Exchange Transaction Reports, usually those above a speciﬁed value threshold. A
            quite small proportion of FIUs (maybe 5–8 percent) receive, or have access to, Electronic Funds
            Transfer Reports (“wire transfers”), usually above a threshold, mostly for international, but in some
            instances also domestic transfers. See Intscher 2010.
      44.   Secrecy jurisdictions refer to jurisdictions that facilitate illicit ﬁnancial ﬂows stemming from three
            overlapping sources: bribery, criminal activity, and cross-border trade mispricing. Secrecy jurisdic-
            tions undermine development for the poorest countries as individuals taking advantage of these
            jurisdictions can commit a wide range of crimes such as tax evasion, nonpayment of alimonies,
            money laundering, terrorist ﬁnancing, drug trafﬁcking, human trafﬁcking, illegal arms trading,
            counterfeiting, insider dealing, embezzlement, ﬂeeing of bankruptcy orders, fraud, and others.
      45.   One barrier relates to privacy: access to information on wire transfers, for example, means infring-
            ing the privacy of the many millions of customers using wire transfers for entirely legal means.

      50.   The Green Climate Fund will support projects, programs, policies, and other activities in develop-
            ing country parties using thematic funding windows. The fund will be governed by the Green Cli-
            mate Board comprising 24 members, as well as alternate members, with equal number of members
            from developing and developed country parties. The assets of the Green Climate Fund shall be
            administered by a trustee, and the World Bank was invited to serve as the interim trustee, subject
            to a review three years after operationalization of the fund. The Cancún negotiations also decided
            that an independent secretariat shall support the operations of the fund. It was also decided that
            the Green Climate Fund shall be designed by a Transitional Committee of 40 members, with 15
            members from developed country parties and 25 members from developing country parties.
      51.   The preeminent example of regional cooperation in the cause of conﬂict prevention is captured in
            the emergence of today’s Europe, after centuries of interstate violence had culminated in the most
            destructive war in history. From the Marshall Plan and the Organisation for European Cooperation
            through the creation of the European Union and its absorption of former Soviet bloc countries,
            this evolving social compact has so far managed to navigate a range of volatile political and social
            developments and to bring a degree of political and economic unity that few would have foreseen
            65 years ago. The current accession process provides very strong incentives for candidate states
            to attain speciﬁed governance, security, and human rights standards. Lockhart 2010; Eichengreen

      resource development, tourism, trade, private sector investment, and agriculture. These projects
      were carried out with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, which had a track record of
      working with each of these countries on a bilateral basis, and was able to offer a platform for dia-
      logue as well as contribute technical knowledge and expertise that helped set consistent standards
      acceptable to all. The GMS is recognized as having enhanced cross-border trade while reducing

Practical Options
and Recommendations
T
       his chapter draws together practical country lessons and
       options to prevent organized criminal and political violence
       and recover from their eﬀects. The audience is strategic
decision makers in countries grappling with violence or attempting
to prevent it—national reformers in government and civil society, as
well as international representatives in the ﬁeld. As this Report has
emphasized throughout, eﬀorts to build conﬁdence and transform
institutions for citizen security, justice, and jobs need to be adapted
to the local political context in each country, at each transition
moment—and there is a need for humility, since lessons in how to
combat changing patterns of repeated violence are being reﬁned
and expanded on the ground all the time. This chapter, therefore,
lays out basic principles and a toolkit of options emerging from
country lessons and illustrates how these can be adapted to
diﬀerent contexts.

      South Africa
      In South Africa, inclusive-enough coalition-building in the run-up to the 1994 election meant involving all political parties and civil
      society in discussions over the country’s future, although the ANC maintained a hierarchy in which it led decision making among other
      ANC Alliance and United Democratic Front members. In Colombia, an inclusive-enough coalition to implement the new government’s
      Democratic Security Policy did not include all parties: FARC rebels were automatically excluded since they were not recognized by the
      Colombian government as a political organization. The ruling party instead galvanized support from the military; most business orga-
      nizations; and some civil society groups, who were also instrumental in leading popular protests demanding action on security; as well
      as community leaders in violence-aﬀected areas. Business groups were important in supporting the new government’s wealth tax,
      which provided an important source of ﬁnance for the Democratic Security Policy.
          In both countries, the main protagonists sent signals to demonstrate a break with the past. In South Africa, this involved a move
      within the ANC to adopt an inclusive approach to other parties and interests and a move by the National Party from discourse over
      group rights to discourse over individual rights—immediate actions such as the ANC’s unilateral suspension of armed struggle and the
      National Party’s decision to release Nelson Mandela and unban the ANC, Communist Party, Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), and Azanian
      People’s Organisation (AZAPO); and announcements on future policy, such as the creation of provincial governments to provide oppor-
      tunities for power for the smaller parties, job security for white civil servants, and free maternal and child health care for the broader
      population.

      Colombia
      In Colombia, the use of the word “democratic” in describing security approaches was intended to show that future policy would not
      involve the human rights abuses that had been common in the past in Colombia and other Latin American countries. Redeployment of
      military forces to protect civilian road transit and budget increases to the military were designed to foster business, military, and popu-
      lar support. In South Africa, however, announcements about future policy went much further than Colombia in the commitments of
      the Reconstruction and Development Program to social and institutional transformation, reﬂecting the political background of the
      ANC Alliance as well as the greater space for change at the time of the transition. In both countries, the degree to which these initial
      signals have been maintained in the longer term is still a subject of debate, but they were undoubtedly important in mobilizing
      support.
           Leaders in each country used diﬀerent types of commitment mechanisms to provide guarantees that policy announcements would
      not be reversed: broad mechanisms for transitional decision making, constitutional and legal change, and electoral monitoring in
      South Africa, reﬂecting more inclusive coalition-building; and narrower mechanisms in Colombia to ensure cooperation between the
      military and civilian agencies, such as the creation of a new coordination framework, Centro de Coordinación de Acción Integral (CCAI),
      reporting to the President.

B OX 8.2   Adapting community-level program design to country context: Afghanistan, Burundi,
           Cambodia, Colombia, Indonesia, Nepal, and Rwanda
The basic elements of community-based programs for violence prevention and recovery are simple and can be adapted to a
broad range of country contexts. All community programs under state auspices consist, essentially, of a community decision-
making mechanism to decide on priorities and the provision of funds and technical help to implement them. Within this model
there is a great deal of variance that can be adapted to diﬀerent types of stresses and institutional capacities, as well as to diﬀer-
ent opportunities for transition. Three important sources of variance are in how community decision-making is done, who con-
trols the funds, and where programs sit within government.
    Diﬀerent stresses and institutional capacities and accountability aﬀect community decision-making. In many violent areas,
preexisting community councils are either destroyed or were already discredited. A critical ﬁrst step is to reestablish credible par-
ticipatory forms of representation. In Burundi, for example, a local NGO organized elections for representative community devel-
opment committees in the participating communes that cut across ethnic divides. Similarly, Afghanistan’s National Solidarity Pro-
gram began with village-wide elections for a community development council. But Indonesia’s programs for the conﬂict-aﬀected
areas of Aceh, Kalimantan, Maluku, and Sulawesi did not include holding new community elections. Community councils were
largely intact, and national laws already provided for local, democratic village elections. Indonesia also experimented with sepa-
rating grants to Muslim and Christian villages to minimize intercommunal tensions, but eventually used common funds and
councils to bridge divides between these communities.
    Diﬀerent institutional challenges also aﬀect who manages the funds. Programs must weigh the trade-oﬀs between a ﬁrst
objective of building trust with the risks of money going missing and the elite capture of resources. Diﬀerent approaches to pro-
gram design to ﬁt context include the following:

•   In Indonesia, where local capacity was fairly strong, subdistrict councils established ﬁnancial management units that are
    routinely audited but have full responsibility for all aspects of ﬁnancial performance.

•   In Burundi, lack of progress in overall decentralization and diﬃculties in monitoring funds through community structures
    meant that responsibility for managing the funds remained with the NGO partners. In Rwanda, by contrast, greater space for
    change after the genocide meant the councils could from the start be integrated into the government’s decentralization
    plans.

•   In Afghanistan’s National Solidarity Program, NGOs also took on the initial responsibility for managing the funds while coun-
    cils were trained in bookkeeping, but within a year, block grants were being transferred directly to the councils.

•   In Colombia, where the primary institutional challenges were to bring the state closer to communities and overcome distrust
    between security and civilian government agencies, funds are held by individual government ministries, but approvals for
    activities are made by multisectoral teams in consultation with communities.

•   In Nepal, community programs show the full range of design options, with some programs giving primary responsibility for
    fund oversight to partner NGOs, to their large-scale village school program, where community school committees are the
    legal owners of school facilities and can use government funds to hire and train their staﬀ.

•   In Cambodia’s Seila program, councils were launched under UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) auspices and
    then moved into the government’s newly formed commune structure.

     The type of transition moment and governance environment also aﬀects how community decision-making structures align
with the formal government administration. Many countries emerging from conﬂict will also be undergoing major constitutional
and administrative reforms, just as the early-response community programs are being launched. There may be tensions between
national and local governance and power-holders at the center and the community. In Afghanistan, where center-periphery
issues are a key driver of conﬂict, and where warlords are a continuing threat to stability, community-driven development (CDD)
programs must be sensitive to national-local dynamics. Afghanistan’s Community Development Councils, though constituted
under a 2007 vice presidential bylaw, are still under review for formal integration into the national administrative structure.
     In other settings of either prolonged crisis or in authoritarian systems, CDD programs can be designed to sustain human capi-
tal and oﬀer an avenue for local-level debate in the absence of national-level progress. CDD programs designed in environments
with more limited space for change may rely more heavily on nongovernmental delivery of services, employing local workers for
skill building and focusing on “neutral,” nonpolitical issues in community debates.

       country’s large natural resources and potentially
       ﬁnancing renewed electoral violence. Increasing
       trade in Mozambique created the potential for
       increased customs revenue—but also increased
       vulnerability to corruption. High unemployment
       and a legacy of regional and ethnic tensions were
       issues in both countries—with a commensurate
       need to attract investors and donor funds to
       supplement public ﬁnances.


      Both countries outsourced some key functions to the private sector and undertook additional monitoring
      to guard against corruption and increase revenues. The functions chosen and the nature of external moni-
      toring were diﬀerent, however. Liberia focused on forestry inspections and natural resource concessions,
      reﬂecting the role of natural resource revenues in ﬁnancing violence, while Mozambique focused on cus-
      toms as a source of additional revenue that was vulnerable to corruption.
          Liberia undertook, through the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program, “dual
      key” oversight by regional and international experts of major contracts and concessions. The African Union
      and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) were instrumental in reaching agreement on
      this arrangement, along with the international ﬁnancial institutions, the UN, the United States, and the
      European Union, in recognition of the potential regional spillover eﬀects of rising corruption. In its initial
      stages, this arrangement focused more on accountability than capacity transfer, reﬂecting the severe
      nature of corruption challenges at the time. More recently, the program has emphasized capacity transfer
      more strongly. Following the elections, the new government also contracted a private inspection company
      to build and operate a system to track all timber from the point of harvest through transport to sale. The
      system ensures the government collects all revenue because it will not issue an export permit until the
      Central Bank conﬁrms that all taxes have been paid. In Mozambique, the government contracted a private
      company to run customs inspection functions and collect customs revenues. Both strategies delivered
      results, with domestic revenues rising and increased donor funds.

          B OX 8 .4   Bilateral cooperation against corruption and money
                      laundering in Haiti and Nigeria
            Key stresses: In both countries, corruption with international money-laundering links has
            undermined the capacity of national institutions to combat violence.

            Key stakeholders: Government, opposition parties, civil society, and donors were important
            stakeholders relating to corruption issues in Haiti, with the Unites States playing a particularly
            important role. Donors were less important in Nigeria, but civil society was much stronger
            than in Haiti.

            Institutional challenges: Political obstacles to prosecuting grand corruption were high in
            both countries. Capacity in the criminal justice system to prosecute complex corruption cases
            was present in Nigeria but absent in Haiti.


          Both countries developed links with the law enforcement institutions of other nations.
          Haiti’s government drew on capacity from the United States not only during the investigative
          phase but in the prosecution as well. In Nigeria, by contrast, local oﬃcials mainly drew on the
          investigative capacity of the United Kingdom to gather evidence to be used for convictions in
          Nigerian courts.
              Since former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide ﬂed into exile in 2004, successive Hai-
          tian governments have sought to recoup funds lost from a corrupt agreement with American
          telecommunications companies. According to the government, Haiti Teleco, Haiti’s state-
          owned telecom ﬁrm, had provided services at cut-rate prices to American providers in return
          for kickbacks to senior government oﬃcials and key Teleco staﬀ. The case involved a complex
          scheme of favorable tariﬀs with kickbacks channeled through an intermediary’s oﬀshore bank
          account. Proving it in a Haitian court would have been a challenge, given the absence of police
          and prosecutors with experience handling cases of sophisticated ﬁnancial crime, and once the
          earthquake hit in January 2010 it would have been nigh impossible. In December 2009, the U.S.
          Department of Justice charged two former employees of Teleco who allegedly received kick-
          backs with money laundering oﬀenses. In June 2010, one of the two was convicted and sen-
          tenced to four years in prison and ordered to pay US$1.8 million in restitution to the govern-
          ment of Haiti and forfeit another US$1.6 million. The second employee awaits trial.
              In Nigeria, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) worked closely with the
          U.K. Crown Prosecution Service and Scotland Yard to develop evidence against the corrupt
          governors of three Nigerian states. The EFCC alerted British authorities to the possibility that
          the governors were hiding the proceeds of corruption in London banks or real estate invest-
          ments. In one of the cases, the governor was prosecuted in the U.K. for money laundering; in
          the others, the evidence was used to prosecute them in Nigeria. Under the Nigerian consti-
          tution, state governors enjoy immunity while in oﬃce. In one instance, evidence developed
          by the U.K. criminal justice agencies was presented by a U.K. law enforcement oﬃcial to a com-
          mittee of the state’s legislature, which voted to remove the governor from oﬃce, thus lifting
          his immunity and allowing him to be charged in Nigeria. During these investigations, the EFCC
          worked closely with U.K. oﬃcials and received on-the-job training.

       UN transitional authority in Timor in 1999–2002.

       Institutional challenges: Limited service delivery, severe capacity
       constraints, many donor players were the major challenges.


      Timor-Leste
      Following the UN supervised referendum on independence of August 1999, Timor-Leste suﬀered widespread violence and destruction
      of its infrastructure and collapse of state services. In the transition period before and after independence in 2002, Timor-Leste man-
      aged, however, to provide both rapid results and long-term institution-building in the health sector in four phases.
           In the ﬁrst phase international and national NGOs occupied a central role in providing emergency health services throughout
      Timor, independently funded through humanitarian assistance. In the second phase, the interim health authority established in 2000
      developed a health plan and performance indicators and signed memoranda of understanding with NGOs to standardize the service
      packages provided in diﬀerent parts of the territory still under independent humanitarian funding. In the third phase, NGOs were con-
      tracted directly by the transitional authority to perform both local management and service delivery functions. In the fourth phase, the
      Interim Health Authority was replaced by a new ministry of health, which assumed district management of the system and facilities,
      with NGOs important in specialized service delivery and a capacity-building role, but decreased local personnel over time. All the
      major international agencies in the health sector worked together within this framework.
           By 2004 this gradual phasing of responsibility and capacity-building had led to 90 percent of the population having access to
      health facilities within a two-hour walking distance. Between 2000 and 2004, the use of these facilities rose from 0.75 outpatient visits
      per capita to 2.13. The health ministry and district operations were among the few state functions resilient to renewed violence in
      2005–06, continuing to operate and, indeed, to provide assistance to the displaced population.

      Afghanistan
      In the wake of the fall of the Taliban in 2002, Afghanistan’s basic health services were in a dismal condition, with maternal mortality
      estimated at 1,600 per 100,000 live births. The Afghan ministry of public health outlined a package of priority health services in
      response (costing about US$4 per capita per year) and contracted NGOs to deliver them, while also establishing rigorous monitoring
      and evaluation. The NGOs were selected competitively and sanctioned for poor performance.
          Early results have been optimistic, with a 136 percent increase in the number of functioning primary health care facilities between
      2002 and 2007. Despite a worsening security situation, the number of outpatient visits between 2004 and 2007 also increased by nearly
      400 percent. These outcomes have relied not only on political support but also on a commitment by the ministry of public health not
      to micromanage the process.
          By contracting autonomously operating NGOs while ensuring accountability, the Afghan government both earned and sustained
      policy leadership in the health sector. It allowed the ministry of public health to address scarce human resources, a lack of physical
      facilities, and logistical hurdles. The depth of ongoing violence in Afghanistan has not permitted national institutions to assume the
      role played by NGOs over time, as in Timor-Leste, but the Afghan government and ministry of public health have still managed to
      achieve much needed health outcomes in an uncertain environment dominated by insecurity and institutional challenges.

        hapter 9 sets out new directions for international policy.
        International assistance to strengthen the national institu-
        tions and governance that provide citizen security, justice,
and jobs, and to alleviate the factors that undermine them, is crucial
to break the repeated cycles of violence described in this Report.
But it requires an international system better adapted to address
21st-century risks of violence. This means refocusing assistance on
preventing criminal and political violence through greater, and
more integrated, support for security, justice, and jobs; reforming
the procedures of international agencies; responding at a regional
level; and renewing cooperative eﬀorts among lower-, middle-, and
higher-income countries.

               security, development, and humanitarian spheres

Risk and opportunity     A shift from early warning to contingency planning for repeated cycles of violence. While agency and academic models
assessments              of early warning continue to make useful progress, no such model can ever predict the exact timing of the onset of
                         violence or capture all local variations. More useful is a mode of planning that accepts as a starting point that states and
                         subnational areas with weak institutions continually risk being overwhelmed by a range of stresses.

                         Changes to planning and assessment tools as a basis for combined action. To adapt to the reality of repeated cycles of
                         violence and multiple transitions, assessment processes would become lighter and more ﬂexible to provide regular,
                         repeated assessments of risks and opportunities. The assessments would beneﬁt from more realism in priorities and
                         timelines; stronger political economy analysis; and a tighter focus on the goals of citizen security, justice, and jobs.

jobs                     development activities. These eﬀorts can build on initiatives in Latin America and Africa to provide local dispute resolution
                         and justice services, community policing, employment and training, safe public and trading spaces, and social and cultural
                         programs that promote tolerance.

                         the eﬀorts of security, police, and judicial personnel. These eﬀorts would build on the insights presented in this Report,
                         focusing on basic functions to build trust and performance (including budget and expenditure functions); connections
                         between the police, civilian justice, and corrections systems; and access to justice services at a local level, including
                         through the blending of formal and informal systems.

Links to sustained       Supporting of national and local capacities for mediation and coalition-building. Countries facing rapid transitions and
mediation                cycles of violence will need to negotiate new internal pacts, and build consensus, around eﬀective policies to address
                         their many challenges. These negotiations will in turn require that the parties have access to internal mediators, and to
                         their own skills and autonomous platforms, for dialogue and for the resolution of conﬂicts. By helping build and apply
                         such capacities, development assistance has already contributed to peaceful elections, for instance, in several cases since
                         2004, and most recently during the constitutional referendum in Kenya in 2010. Further development of national and local
                         capacities for managing cyclical conﬂict, cascading change, and rapid transitions is therefore not only essential, but also
                         feasible.

                         Supporting of expertise for international mediation. For these eﬀorts to deliver sustained results, they should be linked
                         to the developmental assistance that can provide conﬁdence-building and institutional transformation and should be
                         available to governments for the longer term. Seconding increased expertise from bilateral agencies and international
                         ﬁnancial institutions (IFIs) to UN regional and civil society special envoys and mediators would help bridge gaps in
                         political, security, and economic support.

                         Developmental help during mounting crises. Countries struggling to prevent escalation of criminal and political violence
                         often need timely ﬁnancial help, although this can be met in part by improving the predictability of funding for mediation,
                         initiating planned development support, and focusing security or development activities on localities with rising threats.
                         Where exceptional additional ﬁnancial support is needed (for example, in situations of high external stress and weak
                         institutions), the responsible leadership of national reformers can be gauged by the signals they are prepared to give—for
                         example, they might welcome international access to violence-aﬀected areas and transparent reporting of budget and
                         expenditure data under the auspices of an accepted regional prevention plan (see box 9.1 on investment in prevention).

Humanitarian             Guidelines on phasing humanitarian assistance to build national institutional capacity over time. Where national
support to national      institutional capacity and governance are improving, guidelines build on good practice by the UNDP, UNICEF (UN
institution-building     Children’s Fund), WHO (World Health Organization), WFP (World Food Programme), and many nongovernmental
                         organization (NGO) partners in combining humanitarian services delivery with capacity-building. Timelines for phasing
                         the transition from international humanitarian assistance to national institutional capacity will vary by country.

                         with appropriate monitoring. Where this is not possible, increased use of community-driven mechanisms and local staﬀ to
                         deliver humanitarian aid would help to build resilient local capacities.

                          WDR Note: Additional approaches for reducing volatility
                          The Centre for Global Development proposes the scaling up of successful projects in fragile and conﬂict-

                          pendent evaluation of projects. Projects that demonstrate early results could then draw upon additional
                          ﬁnancing through a special multi-donor trust fund designated as a tranche for scaling up. By reducing the
                          length of the feedback loop in project monitoring and evaluation, this approach would align incentives for
                          those delivering aid and those receiving aid and reward successes early in the project cycle, making this
                          approach wholly compatible with output-based aid.

                          rapid interventions in fragile situations, and it would not be desirable to lose the ﬂexibility to provide this type
                          of assistance. But the percentage of aid currently in small, fragmented, and short-term assistance appears to
                          be too high (see chapter 6) to beneﬁt long-term institution-building. The Accra Agenda commits donors to
                          developing long-term modalities to support the building of “capable, accountable, and responsive states.”

 3. Following an extensive study carried out by the Ofﬁce of the High Representative (the chief civil-
    ian peace implementation agency in Bosnia and Herzegovina) at the request of the Peace Imple-
    mentation Council, the coordinating structure of the International Community in Bosnia and
    Herzegovina was “streamlined” in 2002 to eliminate overlapping effort and responsibilities and
    increase effectiveness. As part of this process a Board of Principals was established under the chair-
    manship of the High Representative to serve as the main coordinating body for international com-
    munity activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Board of Principals meets once a week in Sara-
    jevo and is attended by Ofﬁce of the High Representative, NATO-led military Stabilisation Force
    (SFOR), Ofﬁce of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), European Union Police Mission,
    UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), European Commission, the World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UN Development Programme (UNDP). See Ofﬁce
    of the High Representative and European Union Special Representative 2011.
 4. Recognizing the public-good beneﬁts of some types of security assistance, as the OECD-DAC
    is considering by providing a separate channel for reporting assistance in these areas, could also
    help.
 5. g7+ is an open grouping of low-income countries experiencing conﬂict and fragility. It was estab-
    lished in 2008 and comprises the following countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, the Central African
    Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal, the Solo-
    mon Islands, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Timor-Leste.
 6. A practical example of this type of shift is Ethiopia in 2005, when government and donors agreed
    to move from regular budget support to a program of transfers to local and municipal govern-
    ments. The program included measures to ensure that all regions of the country, irrespective of
    how they had voted in elections, received continuing central government support.
 7. The WDR team, in conjunction with Mobile Accord and with generous donations of SMS (short
    message service) by Vodacom Congo, carried out a geo-polling project known as DRC Speaks!
    The project utilized cell phone technology to conduct the survey. Using SMS through cell phones,
    the project allowed more than 140,000 Congolese to share, without any ﬁlters, their thoughts,
    feelings, and concerns. See section on monitoring progress out of fragility in chapter 6 for more
    information.

14. The Natural Resource Charter is a set of common principles and a practical step-by-step guide for
    escaping the “resource curse.” It has no political heritage or sponsorships and was prepared by an
    independent group of global experts on economically sustainable resource extraction, assembled
    by Paul Collier, Director of the Centre for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University. The
    charter aims to foster coordination, both along the decision chain from exploration to expenditure,
    and among the international actors and stakeholders, by providing a unifying and overarching
292   WO R L D D E V E LO P M E N T R E P O RT 2 0 1 1



            framework for action. It provides the tools and knowledge base necessary to avoid the misman-
            agement of these diminishing riches and ensure they bring lasting beneﬁt. The charter consists
            of 12 precepts, detailing the broad princi-ples, speciﬁc recommendations, and practical guid-
            ance. It is also an information toolkit to guide governments and societies in their use of natural
            resources so that the opportunities they provide are seized in a way that results in maximum and
            sustained beneﬁts for citizens. The charter provides a clearinghouse for the collation and dis-
            semination of information and best practice in the governance and management of resource-rich
            economies. More information on the charter can be found at their website: http://www.natural
            resourcecharter.org/.

      19.   The Equator Principles (EPs) are a voluntary set of standards for determining, assessing, and
            managing social and environmental risk in project ﬁnancing. The EPs are considered the ﬁnan-
            cial industry “gold standard” for sustainable project ﬁnance and are based on the International
            Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards on social and environmental sustainability
            and on the World Bank’s Environmental, Health and Safety General Guidelines. The principles are
            intended to serve as a common baseline and framework for the implementation by each adopt-
            ing institution of its own internal social and environmental policies, procedures, and standards
            related to its project ﬁnancing activities. These principles do not create any rights in, or liability
            to, any person, public or private, and institutions adopt and implement the EPs without reliance
            on or recourse to IFC or the World Bank. The Equator Principles can be found in full at http://
            www.equator-principles.com/documents/Equator_Principles.pdf.
      20.   The Santiago Principles were developed in 2008 by the International Working Group of Sovereign
            Wealth Funds (SWFs) and represent a collaborative effort by advanced, emerging, and developing
            country economies to set out a comprehensive framework of 24 voluntary “best practices” guide-
            lines, aiming to provide a clearer understanding of the operations of SWFs. Their adoption on
            a voluntary basis signals strong commitment to the principles, and their implementation should
            further enhance the stabilizing role played by SWFs in the ﬁnancial markets, and help maintain the
            free ﬂow of cross-border investment. To date, 23 countries are members. For more information,
            visit the International Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds website: http://www.iwg-swf

            declined since peaking in the early1990s” in chapter 1.
      23.   Of the different forms that South-South cooperation has taken, technical assistance has been
            the most common. Although many technical assistance projects focus on economic and social
            development, countries in the Global South have also developed specialized capacities in post-
            conﬂict peacebuilding. Examples include South Africa’s support to build structural capacities for
            public service through peer learning among public sector schools (Management Development
            Institutes) at the Ministries for Public Administration in Burundi, Rwanda, and Southern Sudan,
            all countries that have emerged from violent conﬂict. Cooperation among 45 municipalities in El
            Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras helps to manage regional public goods such as water in the
            Triﬁnio region. In Triﬁnio, regional South-South cooperation has transformed a zone of tensions
            (no-man’s armed borders) into a zone of integration and development. See OECD 2010f.
      24.   The view of the African Union with respect to West African countries that have recently experi-
            enced coups d’états was that donor support to social programs and poverty reduction programs
            should continue in these countries, but that larger scale support should be paced to support the
            return to a “constitutional path.” In practice, donors were divided between those that suspended
            assistance completely and those that continued assistance with no change (WDR team consulta-
            tion with ofﬁcials in African Union in Addis Ababa, 2010).
      25.   An example of recent advances in evaluation in fragile states includes the new Development
            Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, which focuses on questions of legitimacy and utilization of
            public institutions, public service delivery, local collective action, social capital, and trust in elected
            ofﬁcials in projects in Aceh (Indonesia), Afghanistan, Angola, Central African Republic, Cambo-
            dia, and Guinea.

a. The distinction between ofﬁcial aid, for countries on the Part II list of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC),
and ofﬁcial development assistance was dropped in 2005. Regional aggregates include data for economies not listed in the table. World and income group totals include aid not allocated by
country or region. b. The numerator refers to 2008, whereas the denominator is a three-year average of 2006–08 data. c. Total for the ﬁve-year period. d. Includes Luxembourg. e. Data are from
debt sustainability analysis for low-income countries. f. Includes Taiwan, China. g. Includes reexports. h. Data on total exports and imports refer to South Africa only. Data on export commodity
shares refer to the South African Customs Union (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and South Africa). i. GNI refers to mainland Tanzania only. j. World total computed by the UN sums to zero, but
because the aggregates shown here refer to World Bank deﬁnitions, regional and income group totals do not equal zero.

With more than 1.5 billion people living in countries affected by conﬂict, the
World Development Report 2011 (WDR) looks into the changing nature of violence
in the 21st century. Interstate and civil wars characterized violent conﬂict in the
last century; more pronounced today is violence linked to local disputes, political
repression, and organized crime. The Report underlines the negative impact of
persistent conﬂict on a country’s or a region’s development prospects, and notes
that no low-income, conﬂict-affected state has yet achieved a single Millennium
Development Goal.

The risk of major violence is greatest when high levels of stress combine with
weak and illegitimate national institutions. Societies are vulnerable when their
institutions are unable to protect citizens from abuse, or to provide equitable
access to justice and to economic opportunity. These vulnerabilities are exacer-
bated in countries with high youth unemployment, growing income inequality,
and perceptible injustice. Externally driven events such as inﬁltration by foreign
combatants, the presence of trafﬁcking networks, or economic shocks add to the
stresses that can provoke violence.

The WDR 2011 draws on the experiences of countries that have successfully
managed to transition away from repetitive violence, pointing to a speciﬁc
need to prioritize actions that build conﬁdence between states and citizens,
and develop institutions that can provide security, justice, and jobs. Government
capacity is central, but technical competence alone is insufﬁcient: institutions and
programs must be accountable to their citizens if they are to acquire legitimacy.
Impunity, corruption, and human rights abuses undermine conﬁdence between
states and citizens and increase the risks of violence. Building resilient institutions
occurs in multiple transitions over a generation, and does not mean converging
on Western institutional models.

The WDR 2011 draws together lessons from national reformers escaping from
repetitive cycles of violence. It advocates a greater focus on continuous
preventive action, balancing a sometimes excessive concentration on post-
conﬂict reconstruction. The Report is based on new research, case studies,
and extensive consultations with leaders and other actors throughout the
world. It proposes a toolkit of options for addressing violence that can be
adapted to local contexts, as well as new directions for international policy
intended to improve support for national reformers and to tackle stresses that
emanate from global or regional trends beyond any one country’s control.

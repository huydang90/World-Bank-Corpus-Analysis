     Brooks, Kathryn Kline Dahl, Joyce Gates, Stephanie Gerard, Cathe Kocak, Jeffrey N. Lecksell, Brenda Mejia,
     Hugh Nees, Beatrice Sito, and Michael Treadway. The design was by the Magazine Group. Rebecca Sugui served
     as executive assistant to the team, and Daniel Atchison, Elizabeth V. De Lima, and Michael Geller as staff assis-
     tants. Maria D. Ameal served as administrative officer.
        Preparation of the Report was greatly aided by background papers and by contributions from participants in
     the consultation meetings. The names of these participants are listed in the Bibliographical Note.

COUNTRIES EMBARKED ON TRANSITION FROM VERY
different starting points. This part of the Report first considers
the patterns and progress of reform, broad outcomes, and the
influence of country-specific factors relative to the choice of
policies (Chapter 1). The core reforms in transition include lib-
eralizing prices, markets, and new business entry, and imple-
menting programs to regain or preserve price stability. But
countries cannot ignore their history and geography, and this
legacy, together with political developments, profoundly affects
both the relative importance of different market reforms and
how policymakers approach them.
       Liberalization and stabilization are closely interrelated
(Chapter 2). The freeing of markets is the basic enabling reform
from which all the potential benefits of transition flow. But
market price signals cannot do their work in an environment of
severe macroeconomic imbalances and high inflation. Stabilization is thus a
vital complement to liberalization in fostering productivity and growth dur-
ing transitionand beyond.
      Creating property rights and incentives and a mostly private economy
is a second challenge (Chapter 3). Here, too, initial conditions matter. Some
transition countries will have a much more urgent need to privatize than
others. But there can be competing objectives and difficulties in creating an
effective and popular program.
      A third major challengevital for social and political as well as eco-
nomic reasonsis to relieve poverty and address the other ill effects of tran-
sition on particular groups (Chapter 4). Many gain from transition, and
depending again on the starting point and context for reforms, transition can
be accompanied by declining poverty from day one. But the vast adjustments
involved in a change of economic system can also have adverse implications
for many. The losses they suffer need to be addressed through effective social
policies and measures that encourage sustained growth.

      Note: Bars indicate the extent to which policies supporting liberalized markets and entry of new firms prevailed in 1995 and on average over
      1989-95. Asterisks indicate economies severely affected by regional tensions between 1989 and 1995. The index is a weighted average of
     estimates of liberalization of domestic transactions (price liberalization and abolition of state trading monopolies), external transactions
     (elimination of export controls and taxes, substitution of low to moderate import duties for import quotas and high tariffs, current account
     convertibility), and entry of new firms (privatization and private sector, or nonstate, development). The weights on these components are 0.3, 0.3,
     and 0.4, respectively. Initial estimates for the three components were based on comparative information in World Bank and other reports. These
     were revised following consultation with country specialists as well as experts with a comparative perspective across a number of countries. For
     the twenty-five countries in CEE and the NIS the transition indicators and accompanying text in EBRD 1994 and 1995 provided a further basis for
     calibration. Nevertheless, any such index is judgmental and necessarily approximate. See also the De Melo, Denizer, and Gelb background paper.

   Note: Data are for 1995 and are simple averages for the countries in each group (see Figure 1.2). The laws and legal institutions index
   measures the scope and quality of new legislation and development of judicial institutions: 1, little progress on either; 2, some progress
   on laws, little on institutions; 3, some progress on both; 4, extensive progress on both. The banking sector index measures the
   independence, skills, and credit allocation practices of the better segment of banks, as well as the functioning of supervision and
   payments systems: 1, little change; 2, some initial progress; 3, system functioning fairly well but with limitations; 4, system functioning
   fairly well and with a larger segment of better banks. The role and management of government index measures the market orientation of
   government and the effectiveness of public sector management (see Figure 7.1 for specific indicators): 1, little change; 2, significant
   reform; 3, substantial reform; 4, advanced reform. The social policy index measures progress in pension reform, reduction of subsidies,
   streamlining and targeting of income transfers, and divestiture of social assets: 1, no reform; 2, limited reform; 3, modest reform; 4,

      Such support wastes resources and discourages viable

         Experience across GEE and the NIS supports these
     arguments. Hungary and Poland have sustained strong
     liberalization and reduced enterprise subsidies, from 7 to
      10 percent of GDP in the late 1980s to 2 to 3 percent in
     the early 1990s. Enterprises there have adjusted, and their

and poverty relief are intrinsic to transition. But they are not
enough to create vibrant market economies. Building on the
early gains of transition will require major consolidating
reforms, to develop strong market-supporting institutions, a
skilled and adaptable work force, and full integration into the
global economy.
      The many institutions that support market exchange and
shape ownership in advanced market economiesboth con-
crete organizations and abstract rules of the gamelargely dis-
appeared under central planning. As Part One showed, even in
this weak institutional setting, favorable policy reforms have
been able to spur economic growth. But a growing body of evi-
dence on market economies suggests that, for the longer term,
if transition economies are to join the ranks of the advanced
market economies, they will need not just good economic poli-
cies but strong and accountable institutions to support and
implement them.
       Which institutions are most critical? First are good laws and effective
means for their enforcement (Chapter 5). These establish and apply the rules of
the game, lower transaction costs, increase commercial certainty, create incen-
tives for efficiency, and control crime and corruption so that businesses can
focus on productive activities. Second are strong financial institutions (Chapter
    to encourage saving and channel it to its most productive uses. Financial
institutions also play an important role in corporate governance, complement-
ing that of enterprise owners, by imposing financial discipline and overseeing
the activities of borrowers. A third essential institution is government (Chapter
   but the all-powerful, all-encompassing governments of the planning era
need to be completely reoriented toward a smaller, more selective set of activi-
ties that support and complement, rather than stifle, private enterprise.
       Institutions do not develop in a vacuum. Reformers' top-down efforts
to develop strong legal and financial institutions and to change government
behavior must be complemented by bottom-up demand for such reform.
This demand will not spring up overnight, and it will often require deep
changes in incentives, attitudes, and experience. But it will emerge faster if
policymakers are vigilant in pursuing macroeconomic stability, open markets,
and private sector development.
       An extensive body of research shows the importance of human capital for
the sustained growth and adaptation of market economies. Many countries
enter transition with a strong human capital base, and their rising returns to
education already show the importance of skills in the new economy. Never-
theless, thorough reform of education and health systems is needed, both to pre-
serve past achievements and to adapt to the needs of the market (Chapter 8).
       Finally, openness to trade and foreign investment has proved an equally
robust predictor of strong economic performance across countries. Indeed, both
have already had a large positive impact in transition economies. Deeper inte-
gration into the institutions of the global economy carries obligations as well as
rights, and these can help integration serve a broader purpose: that of locking
in reforms against the emergence of pressure groups (Chapter 9).

          Note: The market orientation index is a composite measure of how much governments have imposed hard budgets on banks and enterprises,
          shifted public spending away from the productive sector and toward social services and infrastructure, withdrawn from commercial
          decisionmaking, divested enterprise social assets, and moved toward a targeted social security system. The index of management
          effectiveness combines measures of the consistency of fiscal policy and overall economic strategy; the quality of public investment planning,
          budget management, and tax administration; and the transparency of intergovernmental relations. Both indexes are constructed from relative
          country rankings, estimated based on comparative information and consultations with country specialists. See Figure 1.2 for details of the

                      THE WORLD BANK
                       1917 and 1950, countries containing one-third of the world's population launched a vast
              experiment to centralize control of economic resources and allocate them by planning. Recent
              years have seen another fundamental transformation, as the same countries change course, seek-
              ing to rebuild markets and reintegrate themselves into the global economy. Their transition from
Between       plan to market has reached a point at which it is worth taking stock of their achievements. How
securely have market processes and institutions taken root? What lessons do the short but turbulent reform
histories of the vanguard countries hold for those following them? And what does transition mean for the rest
of the world, including the many countries whose market economies rest on weak foundations?
   This nineteenth annual World Development Report steps back from the bewildering tumult of events and
policies now transforming economies in Central and Eastern Europe, the newly independent states of the for-
mer Soviet Union, and East Asia and assesses the progress and prospects of these economies in transition.
   The assessment takes the form of two complementary sets of questions. First, how have countries grappled
with the initial dilemmas of transition? How do they free prices, markets, and market participants from state
control without giving free rein to inflation? How do they set appropriate incentivesto encourage efficient
responses to market signalswhile creating an effective social safety net that does not abandon the losers in
the marketplace to destitution? The Report also examines how countries' histories and starting conditions
affect the approach to transition and its speed and progress. The bottom lineand the Report's central con-
clusionis that despite these very different points of departure, sound policy, wherever firmly and consis-
tently applied, has yielded rich benefits.
   Second, how can countries best consolidate these initial reforms, creating institutions that can support a
thriving market economy? One essential institution is well-crafted legislation and the rule of law. Another is
an active financial system, no longer the passive repository of state-channeled funds but an efficient inter-
mediary between savers and investors. Also needed are reformed education and health care systems, capable
of preserving and retooling these countries' rich reservoirs of human capital, and, perhaps most important, a
rightsized government with the strength to be effective in a market economy.
   The answers to these questions must be incomplete, but their broad dimensions are already taking shape.
And the answers, even if preliminary, matternot just for the countries concerned but for many others that
are making similar, if less pervasive, reforms toward wider markets and deeper international engagement.
   This Report includes, in a newly revised format, selected World Development Indicators, offering current
data on some 120 indicators of social and economic development for more than 130 countries and territo-
ries, with basic indicators for some 70 more. The Indicators are also available on diskette. An appendix to the
Report provides additional statistics on economies in transition.

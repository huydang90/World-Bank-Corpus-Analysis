Cover images by Paul Olaja. Paul is a 19-year-old artist studying at Kyambogo University in
Kampala, Uganda. In his paintings, Paul represents the many facets of youth: youth performing
as a way to share their rich culture, working hard to survive, and growing into their adult roles.
He depicts the central role of women, the tremendous diversity in the world and how young
people strive to become a part of it. In his own words "youth need to do something for the
world to hold it up."
As a teenager, Paul lost his parents to HIV/AIDS. Art is Paul's passion, and his goal is to use art
to share the stories of his homeland and to help other young people in need in Africa.

Foreword




The time has never been better to invest in young people living in developing countries--that is
the message of this year's World Development Report, the twenty-ninth in the series. The num-
ber of people worldwide aged 12­24 years has reached 1.3 billion, the largest in history. It is also
the healthiest and best educated--a strong base to build on in a world that demands more than
basic skills.
   Today's youth are tomorrow's workers, entrepreneurs, parents, active citizens, and, indeed,
leaders. And, because of falling fertility, they will have fewer children than their parents as they
move through adulthood. This in turn may boost growth--by raising the share of the popula-
tion that is working and by boosting household savings. Rich and poor countries alike need to
seize this opportunity before the aging of societies closes it. Doing so will enable them to grow
faster and reduce poverty even further.
   This Report examines five pivotal phases of life that can help unleash the development of
young people's potential with the right government policies: learning, working, staying healthy,
forming families,and exercising citizenship.Within each of these transitions,governments need
not only to increase investments directly but also to cultivate an environment for young people
and their families to invest in themselves. The Report identifies three policy directions for help-
ing youth develop themselves and contribute to society: expanding opportunities, enhancing
capabilities, and providing second chances.
   Investing in young people strongly contributes to the Bank's overarching mission of fight-
ing poverty. At the same time, investing in young people is a challenge for governments in all
countries, rich and poor. It is my hope that this Report contributes to addressing this challenge
by sharing the experiences of countries where young people, supported by good policies and
institutions, have been able not only to cope but to flourish--and in the process, contribute to
a future of hope and opportunity for all generations.

This Report has been prepared by a core team led by Emmanuel Y. Jimenez and compris-
ing Jean Fares, Varun Gauri, Mattias K. A. Lundberg, David McKenzie, Mamta Murthi,
Cristobal Ridao-Cano, and Nistha Sinha. The team was assisted by Amer Hasan, Sarojini
Hirshleifer, Natsuko Kiso, and Annette Richter, all of whom also contributed to drafting
parts of the Report, as well as Mehmet Ziya Gorpe, Claudio E. Montenegro, and Victor Sulla.
Additional contributions were made by Deon Filmer, Paul Gertler, Elizabeth King, and Peter
Orazem. The work was conducted under the general guidance of François Bourguignon and
Jean-Louis Sarbib. Extensive and excellent advice (including help in preparing background
papers) was received from Jere Behrman, Robert Blum, David Lam, and Cynthia Lloyd, to
whom the team is grateful without implication.
   Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided inputs and helpful comments
(see the bibliographic note). The Development Data Group contributed to the data appen-
dix and was responsible for the Selected World Development Indicators. The team would
also like to acknowledge the generous support of a multidonor programmatic trust fund,
the Knowledge for Change Program. Additional support was also provided by the Hewlett
Foundation and the governments of Denmark, Germany, Japan, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom.
   The team benefited greatly from a wide range of consultations managed by Maya
Brahmam, Stephen Commins, Viviana Mangiaterra, Juan Felipe Sanchez, Gerold Thilo
Vollmer, and Kavita Watsa. Consultations included events and workshops held in 26 devel-
oping countries and a few developed countries in Europe, North America, and Asia, as well
as online discussions of the draft. The team wishes to thank participants in these workshops,
videoconferences, and discussions, which included staff in country offices, researchers, gov-
ernment officials, staff of nongovernmental and private sector organizations and, of course,
the young people themselves. Particularly noteworthy were the efforts in the three countries
"spotlighted" in this Report: Brazil, Sierra Leone, and Vietnam.
   Rebecca Sugui served as senior executive assistant to the team, Ofelia Valladolid as pro-
gram assistant, and Jason Victor as team assistant. Evangeline Santo Domingo served as
resource management assistant.
   Bruce Ross-Larson was the principal editor. Book design, editing, and production were
coordinated by the World Bank's Office of the Publisher under the supervision of Dana
Vorisek, Susan Graham, Andrés Meneses, and Randi Park.

Most young people today are born into smaller families than their parents, but there are many more of them than in their
parents' generation. The developing world as a whole and many countries are seeing a peak in the numbers of youth because
population momentum--the inertia in population growth related to the large size of the childbearing population--is being
gradually overtaken by falling fertility. Now at 1.3 billion, the population of young people is expected to grow slowly into
the foreseeable future because the continuing growth in youth populations in Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North
Africa, and South Asia will counter the slow declines in East Asia and Europe and Central Asia.

Gender differences emerge sharply with the onset of puberty, affecting the life trajectories of girls and boys in profoundly
different ways. Governments have a range of policy levers to counter the inequalities in opportunities, capabilities, and

addressing constraints. But disadvantaged from the start, many young women also need directly targeted programs to help
them catch up.

                   Transitions

                                                     EVERY GENERATION GOES THROUGH TRANSITIONS. For infants, it is the
                                                     process of weaning. For those about to enter the "golden years," it is
                                                     the process of retiring. For what this Report has been calling the next

                                                     five transitions can be anticipated:

                                                     ·  Learning as adolescents and young adults
                                                     ·  Beginning to work
                                                     ·  Taking risks that impact health
                                                     ·  Forming families
                                                     ·  Exercising active citizenship

                                                        When and how these transitions occur vary enormously across
                                                     countries. But the patterns can be represented in a highly stylized

          spotlight                          Vietnamese youth: Managing prosperity

Vietnam has been experiencing a period of unprecedented economic growth and poverty reduction. The youth cohort today
is larger, more educated, healthier, and more enthusiastic than ever before. However, growth has not fixed all problems.
Indeed, it may have brought some new ones for Vietnamese youth: exposure to new health risks, difficult conditions among
rural migrants, frustration from the inability to find jobs that match their higher levels of education, and the inadequacy of
the skills produced by the education system relative to the changing needs of the labor market.1

Persistent inequality is one of the most important concerns in an economy that is otherwise growing and making progress in
reducing poverty. Inequality in human development outcomes among Brazil's youth endangers future progress. In particu-
lar, a shortage of labor market and educational opportunities for vulnerable groups reinforces the intergenerational trans-
mission of poverty and leads to continuing inequality. Brazil is developing a cross-sectoral approach to break this cycle.

After a brutal civil war, young people in Sierra Leone are trying simultaneously to build their lives and their country. Insti-
tutions and infrastructure are now being rebuilt, but opportunities are still limited. The country's 1.5 million young people
need a second chance to build their skills; they need opportunities to engage in productive employment; and they need the
opportunity to help rebuild social institutions for better governance. Youth make up more than a quarter of the population;
they are desperate to learn, to work, to start families, and to contribute to their country's growth and development.

   In FYR Macedonia, university students were
   tired of paying bribes and having their pro-

   campaign to raise awareness of the levels of
   corruption, attract other students to their
   anticorruption campaign, and lobby for
   reform that would foster a more transpar-
   ent university environment. The media
   embraced their campaign, and reform is

                                   three challenges. One is that the youth "lens" is a cross-sectoral one,

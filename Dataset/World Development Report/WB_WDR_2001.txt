Voyage to the New World, 1999. Mixed media on wood, by Manuel Cunjamá,
Mexico. The images used to open the chapters are also taken from this painting and
from three others by Cunjamá: Dialogue with the Universe, Magic Kite, and Looking
for the Cosmic Balance.

Manuel Cunjamá was born in 1971 in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas. He began exhibiting
his work in Chiapas in 1992. Currently, Ana Quijano Gallery in Mexico City is repre-
senting Cunjamá in traveling exhibits in the United States. Cunjamá’s work is included
in the collection of the World Bank art program.

In my work I seek and try to incorporate native symbols and elements that would take me to
prehispanic issues and all that I consider useful to this effect I show it in my work.

I use the sun, the moon, the night, and the universe as symbols representing the worry and
anxiety of the human being for the wholeness surrounding him: The infinite.
                                                                      —Manuel Cunjamá

The World Bank Art Program makes particular efforts to identify artists from develop-
ing nations and make their work available to a wider audience. The art program orga-
nizes exhibits, educational and cultural partnerships, competitions, artists’ projects, and
site-specific installations.

    This report has been prepared by a team led by Ravi Kanbur (director of the team until May 2000) and Nora Lustig (deputy di-
    rector until May 2000 and director since). Monica Das Gupta, Christiaan Grootaert, Victoria Kwakwa, Christina Malmberg Calvo,
    and Kevin Morrison served as full-time team members. Other core team members included Alice Sindzingre, Michael Woolcock,
    and Zainal Yusof. Major contributions to chapters were made by Homi Kharas, Aart Kraay, Peter Lanjouw, and Giovanna Pren-
    nushi as well as by Benu Bidani, William Easterly, Enrique Flores, Hélène Grandvoinnet, Richard Newfarmer, Gi-Taik Oh, and
    Mattia Romani. Michael Walton, in his capacity as director, Poverty Reduction, worked closely with the team throughout the
    process. Shanka Chakraborty and Shahin Yaqub assisted the team. Interns from the Washington Center provided other valuable
    assistance. The work was carried out under the general direction of Jozef Ritzen and Joseph E. Stiglitz and, in the final stages,
    Nicholas Stern. The World Bank Development Data Group was responsible for the Selected World Development Indicators.
    Bruce Ross-Larson and Meta de Coquereaumont were the principal editors of the report.
        The team was advised by Anthony Atkinson, Anthony Bebbington, Nancy Birdsall, François Bourguignon, Angus
    Deaton, Alain de Janvry, Yujiro Hayami, Emmanuel Jimenez, Grzegorz Kolodko, Michael Lipton, Lant Pritchett,
    Martin Ravallion, Amartya Sen, Lyn Squire, T. N. Srinivasan, and Mariano Tommasi. Deepa Narayan led the Voices of
    the Poor study. Vinod Thomas led the Quality of Growth study, which complements the work of this report. Ariel Fiszbein
    led the organization of the consultation process. Much insight was gained from the papers and discussions at the Sum-
    mer Workshop held in Washington, D.C., on 6–10 July 1999, as well as from the background papers prepared for this
    report. The authors, commentators, and participants, as well as the background papers, are listed in the bibliographic
    note. Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful comments and other contributions; their names
    are also listed in the bibliographic note.
        A wide range of consultations with academics, grassroots leaders, NGOs, private sector representatives, and policymakers
    were undertaken for this report, from initial outline to final draft. Thanks go to all the public institutions and civil society
    organizations that helped make these consultations possible, as well as the organizers and participants, whose contributions
    greatly enriched this report. Particular thanks go to the Bretton Woods Project and the New Policy Institute in the United
    Kingdom, which moderated the electronic discussion on the Web draft, and to all who submitted comments: 424 contri-

    Aires), Bangladesh (Dhaka), Canada (Ottawa), Chile (Santiago), Denmark (Copenhagen), Egypt (Cairo), Ethiopia (Addis

  Fund, the regional development banks, and several United Nations organizations.
      The preparation of background papers and the convening of several workshops were supported by the governments of
  Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United
  States; the MacArthur Foundation; Cornell University; and the Development Policy Forum of the German Foundation
  for International Development. The Voices of the Poor study was supported by the MacArthur Foundation, Cornell
  University, the U.K. Department for International Development, and the Swedish International Development Coopera-
  tion Agency; and several of the country studies were partially or fully financed by the NGOs that conducted the research.
      Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant to the team, and Maribel Flewitt, Shannon Hendrickson, Khin-U Khine,
  Rudeewan Laohakittikul, Jimena Luna, Nelly Obias, Gracie Ochieng, Leila Search, and Robert Simms as team assistants.
  Maria D. Ameal served as administrative officer. Nacer Megherbi and Edith Thomas provided technical support.

   Note: The poverty line is $1.08 a day at 1993 PPP. Poverty estimates are based on income or consumption data from the countries in each
   region for which at least one survey was available during 1985–98. Where survey years do not coincide with the years in the table, the
   estimates were adjusted using the closest available survey and applying the consumption growth rate from national accounts. Using the
   assumption that the sample of countries covered by surveys is representative of the region as a whole, the number of poor people was then
   estimated by region. This assumption is obviously less robust in the regions with the lowest survey coverage. For further details on data and
   methodology see Chen and Ravallion (2000).

A      t the start of a new century, poverty remains a global problem of huge
proportions. Of the world’s 6 billion people, 2.8 billion live on less than $2 a
day and 1.2 billion on less than $1 a day. Eight of every 100 infants do not live
to see their fifth birthday. Nine of every 100 boys and 14 of every 100 girls
who reach school age do not attend school. Poverty is also evident in poor
people’s lack of political power and voice and in their extreme vulnerability to
ill health, economic dislocation, personal violence, and natural disasters. And
the scourge of HIV/AIDS, the frequency and brutality of civil conflicts, and
rising disparities between rich countries and the developing world have
increased the sense of deprivation and injustice for many.

World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty (which follows two
other World Development Reports on poverty, in 1980 and 1990) argues
nevertheless that major reductions in all these dimensions of poverty are indeed
possible—that the interaction of markets, state institutions, and civil society can
harness the forces of economic integration and technological change to serve the
interests of poor people and increase their share of society’s prosperity.

Actions are needed in three complementary areas: promoting economic
opportunities for poor people through equitable growth, better access to
markets, and expanded assets; facilitating empowerment by making state
institutions more responsive to poor people and removing social barriers
that exclude women, ethnic and racial groups, and the socially
disadvantaged; and enhancing security by preventing and managing
economywide shocks and providing mechanisms to reduce the sources of
vulnerability that poor people face. But actions by countries and
communities will not be enough. Global actions need to complement
national and local initiatives to achieve maximum benefit for poor people
throughout the world.

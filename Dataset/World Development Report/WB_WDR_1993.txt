     This Report has been prepared by a team led by Dean T. jamison and comprising jose-Luis Bobadilla,
     Robert Hecht, Kenneth Hill, Philip Musgrove, Helen Saxenian, jee-Peng Tan, and, part-time, Seth
     Berkley and Christopher J. L. Murray. Anthony R. Measham drafted and coordinated contributions
     from the Bank's Population, Health, and Nutrition Department. Valuable contributions and advice
     were provided by Susan Cochrane, Thomas W. Merrick, W. Henry Mosley, Alexander Preker, Lant
     Pritchett, and Michael Walton. Extensive input to the Report from the World Health Organization was
     coordinated through a Steering Committee chaired by jean-Paul jardel. An Advisory Committee
     chaired by Richard G. A. Feachem provided valuable guidance at all stages of the Report's prepara-
     tion. Members of these committees are listed in the Acknowledgments . Peter Cowley, Anna E.
     Maripuu, Barbara J. McKinney, Karima Saleh, and Abdo S . Yazbeck served as research associates,
     and interns Lecia A. Brown, Caroline) . Cook, Anna Godal, and Vito Luigi Tanzi assisted the team .
     The work was carried out under the general direction of Lawrence H. Summers and Nancy Birdsall.
        Many others inside and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the
     Bibliographical note). The Bank's International Economics Department contributed to the data appen-
     dix and was responsible for the World Development Indicators . The production staff of the Report
     included Ann Beasley, Stephanie Gerard, jane Gould, Kenneth Hale, jeffrey N . Lecksell, Nancy
     Levine, Hugh Nees, Kathy Rosen, and Walton Rosenquist. The support staff was headed by Rhoda
     Blade-Charest and included Laitan Alii and Nyambura Kimani. Trinidad S. Angeles served as admin-
     istrative assistant. John Browning was the principal editor, and Rupert Pennant-Rea edited two
     chapters .
        Preparation of this Report was immensely, aided by contributions of the participants in a series of
     consultations and seminars; the subjects and the names of participants are listed in the Acknowledg-
     ments. The consultations could not have occurred without financial cooperation from the following
     organizations, whose assistance is warmly acknowledged: the Canadian International Development
     Association, the Danish International Development Agency, the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation,
     the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Swiss Development
     Cooperation, the U.S . Agency for International Development, the Overseas Development Adminis-
     tration of the United Kingdom, and the Environmental Health Division and the Special Programme
     for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases of the World Health Organization. The World Health
     Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund contributed to the preparation of the statistical
     appendices. Three academic institutions-the Harvard Center for Population and Development
     Studies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Swiss Tropical Institute-
      provided important support for the preparation of the Report .

   The diseases listed are those for which there is substantial evidente of a relationship with the household environment and which are listed in
Appendix B. Examples of excluded conditions are violence related to crowding (because of lack of evidence) and guinea worm infection related to
poor water supply (not listed in Appendix B).
   Estimates derived from the product of the efficacy of the interventions and the proportion of the burden of disease that occurs among the
exposed. The efficacy estimates assume the implementation of improvements in sanitation, water supply, hygiene, drainage, garbage disposal,
indoor air pollution, and crowding of the kind being made in poor communities in developing countries.
   Includes diarrhea, dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.
   Diseases within the tropical cluster most affected by the domestic environment are schistosomiasis, South American trypanosomiasis, and
Bancroftian filariasis.
  Based on very inadequate data on efficacy.

   The health benefits from information and communication and from disease surveillance are counted in the other public and clinical services in

Notes The rankings refer to health intervention priorities; disease groups are ranked only when there is a single intervention or accepted cluster of
interventions for controlling the diseases included in the group.
      Can be substantially controlled with cost-effective intervention; less than $100 per DALY saved.
      Can be partially controlled with moderately cost-effective interventions; $250 to $999 per DALY saved. (There are few or no interventions in
      the range of $100 to $250 per DALY saved.)
I   I Cannot be controlled in a cost-effective manner; $1,000 or more per DALY saved.
I   I Preventive and therapeutic interventions have not been evaluated for cost-effectiveness.

       Groups of economies
      For this map, economies are classified by
      income group, as they are for the tables
      that follow. Low-income economies are those
      with a GNP per capita of $635 or less in 1991;
      middle-income, $636-7,910; high-income,
      $7,911 or more.

Share of agriculture in GDP




        Less than 6 percent

        30 percent or more
                              Share of agriculture in GDP is calculated by taking the
                              value added of an economy's agriculture sector and
                              dividing it by gross domestic product. The shares say
                              nothing about absolute values of production. For
                              economies with high levels of subsistence farming, the
                              share of agriculture in GDP is difficult to measure
                              because of difficulties in assigning subsistence farming
                              its appropriate value. For more details, see the technical
        Data not available    note for Table 3.

 Becausegood health increases the economic prpducthrit of individuals and the economic
 growth rate of countries, investing in health is one means of accelerating development More
 importat, good health is a goal in itself
          )uring the past forty years life expectancy u the developing world has risen and
 child mOrtality has decreased, sometimes dramatically But progress is only one side o the
picture The toll from childhood and tropical diseases remains high even as new problei
including AIDS and the diseases of aging populationsappear on the scene And all counthes
are struggling with the problems of controlling health expenditures and making health care
accessible to the broad population
          This sixteenth annual World Development Report examines the controversial q1ieS
tions surrounding health care and health policy its findings are based in large part on innova-
tive research, including estimation of the global burden of disease and the cost-effectiveness of
interventions These assessments can help in setting priorities for health spending
          The Report advocates a threefold approach to health policy for governments in devel-
oping countries and in the formerly socialist countries
            Foster an economic environment that will enable households to improve their own
health .ro1ciesor econo flic growth that ensure income gains for the poor are essential. So,
too, is expand&tmvestment in schooling, particularly for girls
            Redirect government spending away from specialized care and toward such low-
cost and highly effective activities as immunization, programs to combat micronutrient defi-
ciencies, and control and treatment of mfectious diseases By adopting the packages of public
health measures and essential clinical dare described in the Report, developing countries could
reduce their burden of disease by 25 percent
            Encourage greater diversity and competition in the provision of health services by
decentralizing government services,' promoting competitive procurement practices, fostering
greater involvement by nongovernmental and other private organizations, and regulating
insurance markets.
          These reforms could translate into longer, healthier, and more productive lives for
people around the world, and especially for the more than 1 billion poor
          As in previous editions, this Report includes the World Development Indicators,
whih give comprehensive1 current data on social and economic development in more than 200
countries and territories The Indicatois are also available on diskette for ise with personal
conp/uters Special appendices to the Report provide hetlth statistics and estimates of the
global burden of disease.

Foreword

As I write, the world is ﬁghting to control the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a human
tragedy that has cost thousands of lives and brought suffering to families and across entire
communities. The outbreak is a tragedy not only for those directly affected by the disease
but also for their neighbors and fellow citizens. And the indirect, behavioral effects of the
Ebola crisis—slowing business activity, falling wages, and rising food prices—will make life
even more difﬁcult for millions of people who already live in extreme poverty in that region
of the world.
    Some of these behavioral effects are unavoidable. Ebola is a terrible disease, and quaran-
tines and other public health measures are necessary parts of the response. At the same time,
it is clear that the behavioral responses we are seeing, not just in West Africa but all over
the world, are partly driven by stigma, inaccurate understanding of disease transmission,
exaggerated panic, and other biases and cognitive illusions. Sadly, we have seen this happen
before, with HIV/AIDS and the SARS and H1N1 inﬂuenza outbreaks, and we will likely see
it again when we begin to prepare for the next outbreak. Societies are prone to forget what
happened, and policy makers tend to focus on the most socially prominent risks, which are
not always those that drive disease outbreaks.
    In light of these risks, this year’s World Development Report—Mind, Society, and Behavior—
could not be more timely. Its main message is that, when it comes to understanding and
changing human behavior, we can do better. Many development economists and practition-
ers believe that the “irrational” elements of human decision making are inscrutable or that
they cancel each other out when large numbers of people interact, as in markets. Yet, we
now know this is not the case. Recent research has advanced our understanding of the psy-
chological, social, and cultural inﬂuences on decision making and human behavior and has
demonstrated that they have a signiﬁcant impact on development outcomes.
    Research also shows that it is possible to harness these inﬂuences to achieve development
goals. The Report describes an impressive set of results. It shows that insights into how
people make decisions can lead to new interventions that help households to save more,
ﬁrms to increase productivity, communities to reduce the prevalence of diseases, parents to
improve cognitive development in children, and consumers to save energy. The promise of
this approach to decision making and behavior is enormous, and its scope of application is
extremely wide. Let me focus on a few themes.
    First, it has implications for service delivery. Research shows that small differences in
context, convenience, and salience have large effects on crucial choices, such as whether to
send a child to school, prevent illness, or save to start a business. That means development
practitioners need to focus not only on what interventions are needed but also on how they
are implemented. That, in turn, requires implementing agencies to spend more time and
resources experimenting, learning, and adapting during the intervention cycle.
    Second, as the risks and impact of climate change become clearer, we must use every
tool at our disposal to confront the challenge. The Report describes how, in addition to taxes
and subsidies, behavioral and social insights can help. These include reframing messages
to emphasize the visible and palpable beneﬁts of reducing emissions, and the use of social



                                                                                                 xi

      norms to reduce energy consumption, social networks to motivate national commitments,
      and analogies to help people grasp climate forecasts.
         Third, development professionals and policy makers are, like all human beings, subject to
      psychological biases. Governments and international institutions, including the World Bank
      Group, can implement measures to mitigate these biases, such as more rigorously diagnos-
      ing the mindsets of the people we are trying to help and introducing processes to reduce the
      effect of biases on internal deliberations.
         The Ebola outbreak makes clear that misunderstanding and miscommunicating risks can
      have serious repercussions. Quarantining infected individuals can prove sensible, but trying
      to quarantine nations or entire ethnic groups violates human rights and may actually hin-
      der efforts to control the outbreak of a disease. This year’s World Development Report provides
      insight into how to address these and other current challenges and introduces an important
      new agenda for the development community going forward.

Figure O.1 Automatic thinking gives us a partial view of the world
To make most decisions and judgments, we think automatically. We use narrow framing and draw on default assumptions and associations, which can
give us a misleading picture of a situation. Even seemingly irrelevant details about how a situation is presented can affect how we perceive it, since we
tend to jump to conclusions based on limited information.

A payday borrower receives his cash in an envelope. The standard envelope shows only a calendar and the due date of the loan.

In a ﬁeld experiment, randomly chosen borrowers received envelopes that showed how the dollar fees accumulate when a payday loan is outstanding
for three months, compared to the fees to borrow the same amount with a credit card.

Borrowers who received the envelope with the costs of the loans expressed in dollar amounts were 11 percent less likely to borrow in the next four
months compared to the group that received the standard envelope. Payday borrowing decreased when consumers could think more broadly about
the true costs of the loan.

Individuals do not respond to objective experience but to mental representations of experience. In constructing their mental representations, people
use interpretive frames provided by mental models. People have access to multiple and often conﬂicting mental models. Using a different mental

Figure O.7 There is greater variation across countries in cognitive caregiving than in socioemotional
caregiving
Cognitive caregiving activities, shown by the dark bars, tend to be much greater in countries with high Human Development Indexes (HDI) than in
countries with low HDI, although there are only slight differences in socioemotional activities (light bars) across countries. The height of the bars with
babies on them indicates the average number of cognitive caregiving activities reported by parents in low- and high-HDI countries.

Figure O.9 Understanding behavior and identifying effective interventions are complex and iterative
processes
In an approach that incorporates the psychological and social aspects of decision making, the intervention cycle looks different. The resources
devoted to deﬁnition and diagnosis, as well as to design, are greater. The implementation period tests several interventions, each based on different
assumptions about choice and behavior. One of the interventions is adapted and fed into a new round of deﬁnition, diagnosis, design, implementation,
and testing. The process of reﬁnement continues after the intervention is scaled up.

Figure 1.1 Framing affects what we pay attention to and how we interpret it
To make most decisions and judgments, we use narrow framing and draw on default assumptions and associations, which can give us a misleading
picture of the situation. Even seemingly irrelevant details of how a situation is presented can affect our perceptions, since we tend to jump to
conclusions based on limited information.

consequences. In a more behavioral model (panel b), decision makers may overlook some relevant information because they think automatically as

Figure 1.3 Reframing decisions can improve welfare: The case of payday borrowing


a. The standard envelope
A payday borrower receives his cash in an envelope. The standard envelope shows only a calendar and the due date of the loan.




b. The envelope comparing the costs of the payday loan and credit card borrowing
In a ﬁeld experiment, randomly chosen borrowers received envelopes that showed how the dollar fees accumulate when a payday loan is outstanding
for three months, compared to the fees to borrow the same amount with a credit card.

Borrowers who received the envelope with the costs of the loans expressed in dollar amounts were 11 percent less likely to borrow in the next four
months compared to the group that received the standard envelope. Payday borrowing decreased when consumers could think more broadly about
the true costs of the loan.

Figure 2.2 Children and young adults most affected by war are more likely to favor members of their
own group
Children and young adults in postconﬂict societies played games in which they chose how to share money. Individuals least affected by war behaved
in similar ways toward in-group and out-group members, whereas those most affected by war were much more likely to choose the egalitarian option
when playing with an in-group member than an out-group member. In both countries, exposure to war increased in-group favoritism.

Individuals do not respond to objective experience but to their mental representations of experience. In constructing their mental representations,
people use interpretive frames provided by mental models. People may have access to multiple and conﬂicting mental models. Context can activate a
particular mental model. Using a different mental model can change the individual’s mental representation of the world around him.

Figure 4.1 Poverty is a ﬂuid state, not a stable condition
In qualitative interviews around the world, community members were asked to rank everyone in the community on an economic ladder at the moment
and 10 years earlier. They were also asked to indicate which rungs of the ladder should be equated with poverty. According to these community
rankings, poverty is a ﬂuid state rather than a stable characteristic. This ﬁnding is consistent with consumption-based estimates of chronic poverty
from longitudinal data (Jalan and Ravallion 2000; Pritchett, Suryahadi, and Sumarto 2000; Dercon and Krishnan 2000).

income, farmers perform worse on a series of cognitive
tests of executive function and ﬂuid intelligence than
when they take the same tests after receiving their
earnings (for some examples of tasks that test execu-
tive function and ﬂuid intelligence, see ﬁgure 4.3). This
gap cannot be explained by differences in nutrition
before or after harvest, physical exhaustion, biolog-
ical stress, or familiarity with the testing instrument
after the harvest. The difference in scores translates
to roughly 10 IQ points, which is approximately equal
to three-quarters of a standard deviation and three-
quarters of the cognitive deﬁcit associated with losing
an entire night of sleep (Mani and others 2013).
    This cognitive depletion induced by scarcity is not
limited to poor farmers in India or to people living
under some absolute poverty line. The poverty line of
the United States, for example, is nearly seven times
the poverty line of low-income countries ($13 versus
$2 a day), but ﬁnancial anxiety among low-income

individuals in the United States triggers a very sim-
ilar effect. In an experiment in which people had to
answer questions about how they would react to some
hypothetical scenarios, such as ﬁnancing an unfore-
seen expense or an auto repair, some respondents
received ﬁnancially stressful scenarios (for example,
a $2,000 expense), while others received less stress-
ful variants (a $200 expense) (Mani and others 2013).
As with the farmers, low-income respondents who
had to think about a ﬁnancially stressful situation
performed worse on later cognitive tests by an equiv-
alent of 13 IQ points, suggesting that simply thinking
about the gap between needs and resources captures
the mind.
    This diminishment of executive function might

a laboratory experiment in the United States, research-
ers induced “poverty” and “afﬂuence” among relatively
well-off subjects by endowing them with fewer or
more items and paid them to perform certain tasks
using those items. The experimentally poor tended
to use their items more productively, earning more
points for each task they attempted (Shah, Mullaina-
than, and Shaﬁr 2012). Scarcity focused the mind.           Source: Mani and others 2013.

     is about to give birth. Key decisions, such as whether to enroll a child in school or whether to go to the hospital for a baby’s

     university, may require high levels of bandwidth no matter when they fall. Policies that make these decisions easier could be

There are socioeconomic gradients across a comprehensive set of child development measures in a population living in extreme
poverty in an area of Madagascar. There are strong associations between wealth and child development outcomes among
preschool children. Importantly, the largest gaps across socioeconomic groups are in receptive vocabulary, memory, and
sustained attention, domains that are highly predictive of later success in school and adult outcomes.

Figure 5.4 There is greater variation across countries in cognitive caregiving than in socioemotional
caregiving
Cognitive caregiving activities, shown by the dark bars, tend to be much greater in countries with high Human Development Indexes (HDI) than in
countries with low HDI, although there are only slight differences in socioemotional activities (light bars) across countries. The height of the bars with
babies on them indicates the average number of cognitive caregiving activities reported by parents in low- and high-HDI countries.

      Note: The blue line shows time trends for daily Internet searches related to quitting smoking around the time of former Brazilian president Lula da Silva’s cancer
      diagnosis. The green lines show time trends for the same period from prior years. Search volume is measured as relative search volume (RSV), where RSV = 100
      is the day with the highest search proportion, and RSV = 50 is a day with 50 percent of that highest proportion.

Figure 9.2 Predicting the effect of rainfall forecasts on the success of growing familiar crops was difficult
for farmers in Zimbabwe
In a series of workshops, subsistence farmers in Zimbabwe were asked what crops they grew, given seasonal rainfall forecasts. Farmers said they grew
maize when forecasts were in the D range, and they did not switch to millet when the forecast was in the B range, even though millet was more likely
to be successful.

Citywide water savings peaked
at 13.8% after 8 weeks.



Per capita water usage remained lower than precrisis
levels for more than a decade even when water cuts
were implemented after a second tunnel collapsed. This
suggests that the new social norms around conservation
persisted over time.

processes
In an approach that incorporates the psychological and social aspects of decision making, the intervention cycle looks different. The resources
devoted to deﬁnition and diagnosis, as well as to design, are greater. The implementation period tests several interventions, each based on different
assumptions about choice and behavior. One of the interventions is adapted and fed into a new round of deﬁnition, diagnosis, design, implementation,
and testing. The process of reﬁnement continues after the intervention is scaled up.

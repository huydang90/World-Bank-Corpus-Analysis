the emphasis of their fiscal policies, aiming for
lower structural budget deficits. Although
recession-related automatic stabilizers caused off-
setting increases in budget deficits-in most indus-

 Notes: This table measures only the seignorage corresponding to currency held by the public, since seignorage on banks' holding of currency
 reserves is difficult to measure for some countries. The first column is calculated as the end-of-year currency outside banks (IFS line 14a) minus
 the end-of-year value of the previous year, divided by the current year GDP. The second column is the ratio of the average of beginning-of-year
 and end-of-year currency outside banks to current GDP. The third column is the percentage change in currency outside banks from end-of-year to
 end-of-year. The final column is the percentage change in the consumer price index (IFS line 64) from December to December. The geometric
 average of growth rates is used for coluthns three and four; the arithmetic average of ratios is used for columns 1 and 2.

 Notes: The vertical axis is in log scale. The real exchange rate is an index of relative domestic and international prices expressed in a common
 currency. (In technical terms it is defined as the domestic price index times the exchange rate-expressed as units of foreign currency per unit of
 domestic currency-divided by an international price index in foreign currency.) An increase in this index signifies that the foreign currency
 equivalent of the domestic price index is increasing faster than the international price index. This is referred to as a real appreciation of the
 domestic currency, which implies that the country exporters are less competitive in international markets, while foreign producers are more
 competitive in the domestic market. The real exchange rate index is often expressed in "effective" terms, which take into account the relative
 importance of inflation and exchange rate movements in each trading partner.

Note: The asset composition of the hypothetical project consists of 40 percent building, 40 percent machinery and equipment, 10 percent vehicles,
and 10 percent land. Replacement investment is at the rate of econonmic depreciation for ten years. Real rate of return before taxes is fixed at 10
percent. Calculations are based on tax code provisions, not actual enforcement. Ireland is included as an example of a tax code with 100 percent
depreciation in the first year but no adjustment to nominal interest deductions.
  Ranked by statutory income tax rates.
  Refers to the use of negative tax liabilities in the project to offset positive tax liabilities on income from other investments. This can arise either
from legal provisions in the tax code, allowing the filing of consolidated returns for a firm or holding company, or through transfer pricing
schemes when consolidated returns are not allowed.

    These positive effects appear to be more than offset      8
  by the long-term negative impact of military spending,
  however. Research in the past decade, although not
  conclusive, points to a negative relation between mili-
  tary expenditure and economic growth. The most basic
  criticism is the high opportunity cost of military spend-
  ing, that is, the diversion of scarce resources from more
  productive civilian uses. As seen in Figure 5.4, low-
  income countries spend much more for military pur-
  poses than for social services. The true difference is
  likely to be much greater, because IMF data appear to
  understate military spending. Moreover, the military
  has typically been the sector most protected from
  spending cuts (see Figure 5.8). A 1982 study of sixty-                     1976      1978    1980      1982       1984

  health) and between military spending and savings.
   Critics of military spending have argued that the
   spinoff effects are overstatedfor example, that the
  linkages with civilian industries are small or that the
  benefits of military training to the civilian economy are
  few in countries with professional armed forces. More-
  over, defense spending often has a high import con-
  tent. In developing countries as a whole, arms imports
  represent about 5 percent of total imports. Payment for
  such imports can add considerably to balance of pay-
  ments problems and to the debt burden.

only because it is undervalued, however, but also
because other spending demandsinterest, subsi-

so onexert stronger pressure on decisionmakers

thermore, bureaucratic incentives may provide

on administrative overheads than on the delivery
of services or supplies. More attention must be
given to O&M in budget allocation and execution,
and incentives must be changed to make this
spending effective.

Public pay and employment policies

Among the most important issues surrounding
spending on general government administration,
as well as wage-related spending on O&M, are
those involving public pay and employment poli-
cies. These policies differ considerably among de-

      Groups of economies
      The colors on the map show what group a
      country has been placed in on the basis of its
      GNP per capita and, in some instances, its dis-
      tinguishing economic characteristics. For
      example, all low-income economies, those
      with a GNP per capita of $425 and less (in
      1986), are colored yellow. The groups are the
      same as those used in the 33 tables that follow,
      and they include only the 129 countries with a
      population of more than 1 million.

                The current account balance (on goods, services, income, and all unrequited transfers)
6               represents transactions that add to or subtract from an economy's stock of foreign financial
                items. For some purposes, however, official unrequited transfers (mainly foreign aid grants,
                food aid, and technical assistance) are treated as being closely akin to official capital move-
7               ments. A measure of the current account balance excluding net official transfers, referred to
                here as external financing, is then appropriate. For further information, see the technical
                note to Table 15 but note that the table reports dollar values for each measure in 1970 and
8               1986, while the chart traces period averages, relative to GDP, throughout the period.

A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT in the structure of the world economy has taken place
during the past few decades with the rapid expansion of the public sector in
both developing and industrial countries. Taxation, spending programs,
price controls, and licensing have been only some of the mechanisms
through which the public sector has attempted to shape the course of devel-
opment. Yet governmental action, long regarded as an ally of development
and even as its principal impetus, has since the early 1980s come to be seen
by a growing number of observers as an impediment to growth.
  What governments can achieve through the design of appropriate policies
on public financeto assist both short-term stabilization and long-term de-
velopment and to address problems of poverty and its consequences among
their citizensis the principal theme of this eleventh annual World Develop-
ment Report. Five main sets of issues are examined, most of them critical for
developing and industrial countries alike:       Stabilization and adjustment
through sound fiscal policy Improvement in the mobilization of resources
   Increased efficiency and effectiveness of public spending LII Increased
autonomy and accountability of local governments and state-owned enter-
prises LI The alleviation of poverty as a goal of programs in public finance
  This Report, like its predecessors, contains an overview of recent develop-
ments in the world economy and a World Development Indicators annex
with comprehensive and up-to-date data on social and economic develop-
ment in 129 countries. The data in the 34 annex tables are again available
separately on diskettes for use in personal computers.

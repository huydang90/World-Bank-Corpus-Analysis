       This Report has been prepared by a team led by Vinod Thomas and comprising Surjit S. Bhalla, Rui
     Coutinho, Shahrokh Fardoust, Ann E. Harrison, Daniel Kaufmann, Elizabeth M. King, Kenneth K.
     Meyers, Peter A. Petri, and N. Roberto Zagha. T. N. Srinivasan, Mark Rosenzweig, and Francisco
     Sagasti collaborated closely and provided extensive advice. The team was assisted by Sushenjit
     Bandyopadhyay, Fernando J. Batista, Marianne Fay, Jon Isham, Kali Kondury, Stefan Krieger, and
     Yan Wang. Stanley Fischer played a principal role in the initial stages of the Report's preparation. The
     work was carried out under the general direction of Lawrence H. Summers.
       Many others in and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the
     bibliographical note). The International Economics Department prepared the data and projections
     presented in Chapter 1 and the statistical appendix. It is also responsible for the World Development
     Indicators. The production staff of the Report included Kathryn Kline Dahl, Connie Eysenck, Alfred
     F. Imhoff, Hugh Nees, Kathy Rosen, Walton Rosenquist, and Brian J. Svikhart. Cartographic services
     were provided by Jeffrey N. Lecksell, Gregory George Prakas, and Eric M. Saks. Library assistance
     was provided by Iris Anderson and Jane Keneshea. The support staff was headed by Rhoda Blade-
     Charest and included Laitan Alli, Trinidad S. Angeles, and Lupita Mattheisen. Clive Crook was the
     principal editor.
       The advice and support of Professor Bela Balassa (1928-1991) are respectfully acknowledged. His
     contributions to this and past World Development Reports were valuable in understanding develop-
     ment. The core team remembers fondly David A. Renelt (1964-1991), who contributed to the Report.

Note: Countries were selected on the basis of data availability.
   To calculate these numbers for the eight developing countries, the probability of being ill (or absent from work) was multiplied by the number
of days ill (Or work days lost because of illness) in the month before the survey.
   Potential income loss is the probable number of days of absence from work as a percentage of reported normal days at work.
   For the United States, data are reported for the number of restricted-activity days resulting from illness in the population aged eighteen to
forty-four years.

taken only from consolidated budget accounts; countries that report only budgetary central government expenditure are not included.
Government social spending before 1975 is reported by a much smaller number of countries and is therefore not shown.

Trade reform in developing countries is much
more likely to go ahead if success in trade is not
punished. During the past several decades, aver-
age tariffs in industrial countries have been re-
duced to less than 6 percent. But the use of other
protective measures such as quotas, subsidies, vol-
untary export restraints, and countervailing and
anti-dumping measures, has risen alarmingly
since the 1960s. Increased protection is largely the
result of greater competition on world markets,
exacerbated by the inability of the GATT to control
nontariff barriers. Between 1966 and 1986, the
share of imports affected by all nontariff measures
increased by more than 20 percent for the United
States, almost 40 percent for Japan, and 160 per-
cent for the EC (Figure 5.3). By 1986, 21 percent of               In         In                  In Japan        In OECDb

      Note: All but 11,000 of the war deaths following 1949 took place in developing countries. All numbers are estimates and are subject to significant
      error. Domestic conflicts are not always clearly definable as civil wars, and thus coverage of these statistics varies among studies. A variety of
      civil disruptions are excluded. For example, estimated deaths during purges and collectivization in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, which
      range from 5 to 20 million people, are not included. Figures for deaths resulting from other such events after World War II are also excluded
      because of poor data. Rough estimates for these range up to 15 million. Also, some wars are counted as civil even when foreign intervention
      occurred. Deaths during the Korean War, deaths during the Viet Nam War for the 1965-75 period, and the war in Afghanistan for the 1978-89
      period are included under international wars.

-5       The current account balance (on goods, services, income, and all unrequited transfers)
         represents transactions that add to or subtract from an economy's stock of foreign financial
         items. For some purposes, however, official unrequited transfers (mainly foreign aid
-6       grants, food aid, and technical assistance) are treated as being closely akin to official capital
         movements. A measure of the current account balance before official transfers, sometimes
         referred to as "total to be financed," is then appropriate. For further information, see the
-7       technical note for Table 18, but note that the table reports dollar values for each measure in
         1970 and 1989, while the chart traces period averages relative to GDP throughout the penod.

In the time it takes to read this paragraph, about a hundred children will be bornsix in
industrial countries and ninety-four in developing countries. Some countries in the develop-
ing world have increased their standard of living more than fivefold in the past forty years,
but many others have made little progress. Today, more than one billion people, or a quarter
of the people in developing countries, live in abject poverty on less than one dollar a day.
No matter what the outlook in the industrial economies, the world will find lasting prosper-
ity and security only if the developing countries can raise their standard of living. This is the
challenge of development, the subject of this fourteenth annual World Development Report.
          The task of development is daunting. Yet history shows that rapid and sustained
progress is possibleeven in countries with few endowments other than resourceful peo-
ple. There has been enormous variation in the performance of developing countries, and
there is no single formula for development. The Report shows, however, that policies on
several frontsto promote investment in people, successful entrepreneurs, greater openness
to trade and global economic integration, and a stable macroeconomic foundationhave
proven effective in countries facing quite different circumstances.
         These policies form the basis for an emerging consensus in favor of a "market-
friendly" strategy for development. The Report describes this strategy and what both devel-
oping and industrial countries, as well as multilateral aid and finance agencies, can do to
ensure that it succeeds. And it goes further: it shows the complementary ways in which
markets and governments can pull together.
         A main theme of the Report is how the various aspects of market-friendly develop-
ment interact. Investing in people spurs entrepreneurs' productivity all the more powerfully
in an economy that has relatively undistorted domestic marketsand efficient domestic
markets increase the returns from investing in people. A more stable macroeconomy makes
it easier to withstand the external shocks that greater integration with the global economy
may causeand global linkages provide access to foreign capital, which makes it easier to
maintain domestic macroeconomic stability when internal shocks hit.
           Like previous editions, this Report includes the World Development Indicators,
which give comprehensive, current data on social and economic development in more than
180 countries and territories. These data will also be available on diskette for use with
personal computers.                                                                   ________

Foreword


Climate change is one of the most complex challenges of our young century. No country
is immune. No country alone can take on the interconnected challenges posed by climate
change, including controversial political decisions, daunting technological change, and far-
reaching global consequences.
    As the planet warms, rainfall patterns shift and extreme events such as droughts, floods,
and forest fires become more frequent. Millions in densely populated coastal areas and
in island nations will lose their homes as the sea level rises. Poor people in Africa, Asia,
and elsewhere face prospects of tragic crop failures; reduced agricultural productivity; and
increased hunger, malnutrition, and disease.
    As a multilateral institution whose mission is inclusive and sustainable development, the
World Bank Group has a responsibility to try to explain some of those interconnections
across disciplines--development economics, science, energy, ecology, technology, finance,
and effective international regimes and governance. With 186 members, the World Bank
Group faces the challenge, every day, of building cooperation among vastly different states,
the private sector, and civil society to achieve common goods. This 32nd World Develop-
ment Report seeks to apply that experience, combined with research, to advance knowledge
about Development and Climate Change.
    Developing countries will bear the brunt of the effects of climate change, even as they
strive to overcome poverty and advance economic growth. For these countries, climate
change threatens to deepen vulnerabilities, erode hard-won gains, and seriously undermine
prospects for development. It becomes even harder to attain the Millennium Development
Goals--and ensure a safe and sustainable future beyond 2015. At the same time, many
developing countries fear limits on their critical call to develop energy or new rules that
might stifle their many needs--from infrastructure to entrepreneurism.
    Tackling the immense and multidimensional challenge of climate change demands
extraordinary ingenuity and cooperation. A "climate-smart" world is possible in our
time--yet, as this Report argues, effecting such a transformation requires us to act now,
act together, and act differently.
    We must act now, because what we do today determines both the climate of tomorrow
and the choices that shape our future. Today, we are emitting greenhouse gases that trap
heat in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries. We are building power plants, res-
ervoirs, houses, transport systems, and cities that are likely to last 50 years or more. The
innovative technologies and crop varieties that we pilot today can shape energy and food
sources to meet the needs of 3 billion more people by 2050.
    We must act together, because climate change is a crisis of the commons. Climate change
cannot be solved without countries cooperating on a global scale to improve energy effi-
ciencies, develop and deploy clean technologies, and expand natural "sinks" to grow green
by absorbing gases. We need to protect human life and ecological resources. We must act
together in a differentiated and equitable way. Developed countries have produced most of
the emissions of the past and have high per capita emissions. These countries should lead
the way by significantly reducing their carbon footprints and stimulating research into

                                                                                                xiii

      green alternatives. Yet most of the world's future emissions will be generated in the devel-
      oping world. These countries will need adequate funds and technology transfer so they can
      pursue lower carbon paths--without jeopardizing their development prospects. And they
      need assistance to adapt to inevitable changes in climate.
         We must act differently, because we cannot plan for the future based on the climate of
      the past. Tomorrow's climate needs will require us to build infrastructure that can with-
      stand new conditions and support greater numbers of people; use limited land and water
      resources to supply sufficient food and biomass for fuel while preserving ecosystems; and
      reconfigure the world's energy systems. This will require adaptation measures that are
      based on new information about changing patterns of temperature, precipitation, and spe-
      cies. Changes of this magnitude will require substantial additional finance for adaptation
      and mitigation, and for strategically intensified research to scale up promising approaches
      and explore bold new ideas.
         We need a new momentum. It is crucial that countries reach a climate agreement in
      December in Copenhagen that integrates development needs with climate actions.
         The World Bank Group has developed several financing initiatives to help countries
      cope with climate change, as outlined in our Strategic Framework for Development and
      Climate Change. These include our carbon funds and facilities, which continue to grow as
      financing for energy efficiency and new renewable energy increases substantially. We are
      trying to develop practical experience about how developing countries can benefit from
      and support a climate change regime--ranging from workable mechanisms to provide
      incentives for avoided deforestation, to lower carbon growth models and initiatives that
      combine adaptation and mitigation. In these ways, we can support the UNFCCC process
      and the countries devising new international incentives and disincentives.
         Much more is needed. Looking forward, the Bank Group is reshaping our energy and envi-
      ronment strategies for the future, and helping countries to strengthen their risk management
      practices and expand their safety nets to cope with risks that cannot be fully mitigated.
         The 2010 World Development Report calls for action on climate issues: If we act now, act
      together, and act differently, there are real opportunities to shape our climate future for an
      inclusive and sustainable globalization.

Data notes
The countries included in regional and income groupings in this Report are listed in the
Classification of Economies table at the end of the Selected World Development Indicators.
Income classifications are based on gross national product (GNP) per capita; thresholds for
income classifications in this edition may be found in the Introduction to Selected World
Development Indicators. Figures, maps, and tables (including selected indicators) show-
ing income groupings are based on the World Bank's income classification in 2009. The
data shown in the Selected World Development Indicators are based on the classification
in 2010. Group averages reported in the figures and tables are unweighted averages of the
countries in the group, unless noted to the contrary.
   The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World
Bank about the legal or other status of a territory. The term developing countries includes
low- and middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from
central planning, as a matter of convenience. The terms industrialized countries or devel-
oped countries may be used as a matter of convenience to denote high-income economies.
   Dollar figures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise specified. Billion means 1,000
million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

     Poverty reduction and sustainable development remain core global priorities.
     A quarter of the population of developing countries still lives on less than $1.25
     a day. One billion people lack clean drinking water; 1.6 billion, electricity; and 3
     billion, adequate sanitation. A quarter of all developing-country children are mal-
     nourished. Addressing these needs must remain the priorities both of developing
     countries and of development aid--recognizing that development will get harder,
     not easier, with climate change.
         Yet climate change must urgently be addressed. Climate change threatens all
     countries, with developing countries the most vulnerable. Estimates are that they
     would bear some 75 to 80 percent of the costs of damages caused by the changing
     climate. Even 2°C warming above preindustrial temperatures--the minimum the
     world is likely to experience--could result in permanent reductions in GDP of 4
     to 5 percent for Africa and South Asia. Most developing countries lack sufficient
     fi nancial and technical capacities to manage increasing climate risk. They also
     depend more directly on climate-sensitive natural resources for income and well-
     being. And most are in tropical and subtropical regions already subject to highly
     variable climate.
         Economic growth alone is unlikely to be fast or equitable enough to counter
     threats from climate change, particularly if it remains carbon intensive and accel-
     erates global warming. So climate policy cannot be framed as a choice between
     growth and climate change. In fact, climate-smart policies are those that enhance
     development, reduce vulnerability, and finance the transition to low-carbon growth
     paths.
         A climate-smart world is within our reach if we act now, act together, and act
     differently than we have in the past:

     ·   Acting now is essential, or else options disappear and costs increase as the world
         commits itself to high-carbon pathways and largely irreversible warming trajec-
         tories. Climate change is already compromising efforts to improve standards of
         living and to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Staying close to 2°C
         above preindustrial levels--likely the best that can be done--requires a verita-
         ble energy revolution with the immediate deployment of energy efficiency and
         available low-carbon technologies, accompanied by massive investments in the
         next generation of technologies without which low-carbon growth cannot be
         achieved. Immediate actions are also needed to cope with the changing climate
         and to minimize the costs to people, infrastructure and ecosystems today as well
         as to prepare for the greater changes in store.

·   Acting together is key to keeping the costs down and effectively tackling both adap-
    tation and mitigation. It has to start with high-income countries taking aggressive
    action to reduce their own emissions. That would free some "pollution space" for
    developing countries, but more importantly, it would stimulate innovation and the
    demand for new technologies so they can be rapidly scaled up. It would also help
    create a sufficiently large and stable carbon market. Both these effects are critical
    to enable developing countries to move to a lower carbon trajectory while rapidly
    gaining access to the energy services needed for development, although they will
    need to be supplemented with financial support. But acting together is also critical
    to advance development in a harsher environment--increasing climate risks will
    exceed communities' capacity to adapt. National and international support will
    be essential to protect the most vulnerable through social assistance programs, to
    develop international risk-sharing arrangements, and to promote the exchange of
    knowledge, technology, and information.
·   Acting differently is required to enable a sustainable future in a changing world. In
    the next few decades, the world's energy systems must be transformed so that global
    emissions drop 50 to 80 percent. Infrastructure must be built to withstand new
    extremes. To feed 3 billion more people without further threatening already stressed
    ecosystems, agricultural productivity and efficiency of water use must improve.
    Only long-term, large-scale integrated management and flexible planning can sat-
    isfy increased demands on natural resources for food, bioenergy, hydropower, and
    ecosystem services while conserving biodiversity and maintaining carbon stocks in
    land and forests. Robust economic and social strategies will be those that take into
    account increased uncertainty and that enhance adaptation to a variety of climate
    futures--not just "optimally" cope with the climate of the past. Effective policy
    will entail jointly evaluating development, adaptation, and mitigation actions, all
    of which draw on the same finite resources (human, financial, and natural).

   An equitable and effective global climate deal is needed. Such a deal would
recognize the varying needs and constraints of developing countries, assist them
with the finance and technology to meet the increased challenges to development,
ensure they are not locked into a permanently low share of the global commons,
and establish mechanisms that decouple where mitigation happens from who pays
for it. Most emissions growth will occur in developing nations, whose current car-
bon footprint is disproportionately low and whose economies must grow rapidly to
reduce poverty. High-income countries must provide financial and technical assis-
tance for both adaptation and low-carbon growth in developing countries. Cur-
rent financing for adaptation and mitigation is less than 5 percent of what may be
needed annually by 2030, but the shortfalls can be met through innovative fi nanc-
ing mechanisms.
   Success hinges on changing behavior and shifting public opinion. Individuals,
as citizens and consumers, will determine the planet's future. Although an increas-
ing number of people know about climate change and believe action is needed, too
few make it a priority, and too many fail to act when they have the opportunity.
So the greatest challenge lies with changing behaviors and institutions, particu-
larly in high-income countries. Public policy changes--local, regional, national,
and international--are necessary to make private and civic action easier and more
attractive.

Note: The coloring in the figure shows the projected percentage change in yields of 11 major crops (wheat, rice, maize, millet, field pea, sugar beet, sweet potato, soybean,
groundnut, sunflower, and rapeseed) from 2046 to 2055, compared with 1996­2005. The yield-change values are the mean of three emission scenarios across five global climate
models, assuming no CO2 fertilization (a possible boost to plant growth and water-use efficiency from higher ambient CO2 concentrations). The numbers indicate the share of GDP
derived from agriculture in each region. (The share for Sub-Saharan Africa is 23 percent if South Africa is excluded.) Large negative yield impacts are projected in many areas
that are highly dependent on agriculture.

     Note: The glaciers of the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau regulate the supply of water throughout the year in major river basins
     supporting large agricultural and urban populations, with meltwater providing between 3 and 45 percent of river flow in the Gan-
     ges and Indus, respectively. Reduced storage as ice and snowpack will result in larger flows and flooding during rainy months
     and water shortages during warmer, drier months when water is most needed for agriculture. Glacier locations shown in the map
     only include glaciers larger than 1.5 sq. km in area. Numbers indicate how many people live in each river basin.

centage points; for example, the poverty rate in the northeast, estimated at 30 percent (based on $1 a day with year 2000 data), could rise by 4 percentage points to 34 percent.
The estimates allow for internal migration, with the poverty outcomes of migrants counted in the sending municipality.

Note: The bars in (a) represent various mitigation measures, with the width indicating the amount of emission reduction each measure would achieve and the height indicating the
cost, per ton of avoided emissions, of the measure. Tracing the height of the bars creates a marginal mitigation cost curve. Panels (b) and (c) show the marginal mitigation cost curve
if mitigation only takes place in high-income countries (b) or only in developing countries (c), as well as the resulting deadweight losses associated with these scenarios. Such dead-
weight losses could be avoided or minimized through financial mechanisms that allow a separation between who pays and who mitigates, and ensure the most cost-effective mitiga-
tion measures are adopted.

          focus A              The science of climate change

The climate is changing--that is now indisputable. There is a scientific consensus that the world is becoming a warmer
place principally attributable to human activities. In the words of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
in its fourth assessment report: "Warming of the climate system is unequivocal."1 For nearly 1 million years before the
Industrial Revolution, the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere ranged between 170 and 280 parts per
million (ppm). Levels are now far above that range--387 ppm--higher than the highest point in at least the past 800,000
years, and the rate of increase may be accelerating.2 Under high-emissions scenarios, concentrations by the end of the 21st
century could exceed those experienced on the planet for tens of millions of years.

Note: This figure shows the sources and growth rates of some of the medium- to long-term greenhouse gases. Fossil fuels and land-use change have been the major sources of
CO2, while energy and agriculture contribute about equally to emissions of CH4. N2Ocomes mainly from agriculture. Additional greenhouse gases not included in the figure are
black carbon (soot), tropospheric ozone, and halocarbons. The comparisons of the equivalent emissions of different gases are based on the use of the 100-year Global Warming
Potential; see note 9 for explanation.

Notes: The figure shows risks from climate change, as described in 2001 (left) compared with updated data (right). Climate-change consequences are shown as bars and the
increases in global mean temperature (°C) above today's levels (0 degrees to 5 degrees). Each column corresponds to a specific kind of impact. For example, "unique and threat-
ened systems," such as alpine meadows or arctic ecosystems, are the most vulnerable (illustrated by the shading in column A) and only a small change in temperature may lead
to great loss. The color scheme represents progressively increasing levels of risk from yellow to red. Between 1900 and 2000 global average temperature increased by ~0.6°C
(and by nearly 0.2°C in the decade since) and has already led to some impacts. Since 2001 the assessed risk of damages has increased even for temperatures of an additional 1°C
above today's levels, or about 2°C total above preindustrial levels.

shift in the system. These could be triggered this century depending on the pace and magnitude of climate change.

Note: An expert elicitation of opinions about the probability of passing a tipping point in a subset of these systems--the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet, melting of
Greenland ice sheet, Amazon drying, and ocean circulation (Kriegler and others 2009)--estimated at least a 16 percent probability of one of these events for a warming of 2­4°C.
The probability would rise to greater than 50 percent for a global mean temperature change above 4°C relative to year 2000 levels. In many cases, these numbers are considerably
higher than the probability allocated to catastrophic events in current climate-damage assessments; for example, Stern (2007) assumed a 5­20 percent loss of the ice sheets with
a 10 percent probability for a warming of 5°C.

Note: Three idealized CO2 emission paths (FA.7a) each consistent with total cumulative emissions (b) of 1 trillion tonnes of carbon. Each of the paths yields the same range of
projected temperature increase (c) relative to uncertainty in the climate system's response (grey shading and red error bar), provided the cumulative total is unaffected. The blue,
green, and red curves in FA.7a are all consistent with the 1 trillion tonne budget, but the higher and later the emissions peak, the faster the emissions have to decline to stay within

     Note: Living with floods is engrained in the economic activities and culture of people in South and Southeast Asia. The floodplains
     of some of the major river basins (Ganges, top; Mekong, bottom) concentrate a large number of people and expose agriculture and
     growing urban centers to seasonal flood risk. Climate change is likely to bring more intense flooding, partly caused by the melting of
     glaciers in the upper catchment of the Himalaya region and partly by the shorter and more intense monsoon rains, which will likely
     change flood patterns in the region. At the same time urban centers are rapidly encroaching into agricultural areas that serve as
     natural retention zones for flood waters, bringing new complexity to managing flood water and urban expansion in the future.

                                        Note: With increasing global temperatures, climate zones will shift north, and by the middle of the 21st century many central and
                                        northern European cities will "feel" Mediterranean. This is not good news and has major implications: water utilities will need to
                                        adjust management plans, and health services will need to be prepared for more extreme heat episodes (similar to the 2003 Euro-

Note: Infectious and vector-borne diseases have been expanding into new geographic areas all over the world. In the Americas
the incidence of dengue fever has been rising because of increasing population density and widespread international travel
and trade. Changes in humidity and temperature brought about by climate change amplify this threat and allows disease vectors
(mosquitoes) to thrive in locations previously unsuitable for the disease; see Knowlton, Solomon, and Rotkin-Ellman 2009.

Note: The map shows degree to which countries are financially vulnerable to floods and storms. For example, in countries shaded dark red a severe weather event that would
exceed the public sector's financial ability to restore damaged infrastructure and continue with development as planned is expected about once every 11 to 50 years (an annual
probability of 2­10 percent). The high financial vulnerability of small economies underscores the need for financial contingency planning to increase governments' resilience
against future disasters. Only the 74 most disaster-prone countries that experienced direct losses of at least 1 percent of GDP due to floods, storms, and droughts during the past
30 years were included in the analysis.

Note: In Niger farmers have turned back the encroaching desert; landscapes that were denuded in the 1980s are now densely studded with trees, shrubs, and crops. This trans-
formation, so vast that its effects can be observed from satellites, has affected 5 million hectares of land (about the size of Costa Rica), which amounts to almost half of the culti-
vated land in Niger. The new economic opportunities created by the regreening have benefited millions of people through increased food security and resilience to drought. Key
to this success was a low-cost technique known as farmer-managed natural regeneration that adapts a centuries-old technique of woodland management. After some earlier
success with the reintroduction of this indigenous technique in the 1980s, farmers saw the benefits and spread the word. The social learning effect was enhanced by donors sup-
porting farmer study tours and farmer-to-farmer exchanges. The central government's role was pivotal in reforming land tenure and forest policies.

Note: Slow economic growth in the agricultural sector has made Dakar the destination of an exodus from the rest of the country. Forty percent of Dakar's new inhabitants between
1988 and 2008 have moved into zones of high flood potential, twice as high as that of Dakar's urban (19 percent) and rural communes (23 percent). Because urban expansion is geo-
graphically limited, the influx of migrants has resulted in a very high concentration of people in urban and peri-urban zones (in the map, 16 pixels constitute one square kilometer).

                                   in a changing climate

Earth supports a complex web of 3 million to 10 million species of plants and animals1 and an even greater number of micro-
organisms. For the first time a single species, humankind, is in a position to preserve or destroy the very functioning of that
web.2 In people's daily lives only a few species appear to matter. A few dozen species provide most basic nutrition--20 percent
of human calorie intake comes from rice,3 20 percent comes from wheat;4 a few species of cattle, poultry, and pigs supply 70
percent of animal protein. Only among the 20 percent of animal protein from fish and shell fish is a diversity of dietary species
found.5 Humans are estimated to appropriate a third of the Sun's energy that is converted to plant material.6

evaporation, but the values shown here are annual averages, which could mask seasonal variability in precipitation such as an increase in both floods and droughts.

Note: The maps show the median change (based on 8 climate models using SRES A1B) in annual values in 2030­2049, compared with 1980­1999. A "dry" day is defined as one with
precipitation less than 1millimeter whereas a "rainy" day has more than 1 millimeter. Precipitation intensity (SDII, or simple daily intensity index) is the total projected annual precipi-
tation divided by the number of "rainy" days. White areas show areas of high model disagreement (fewer than two-thirds of the models agree on the sign of change).

Note: When humans use water, they affect the quantity, timing, or quality of water available for other users. Water for human use typically involves withdrawing water from lakes,

water, it is a consumptive use--it becomes unavailable for use elsewhere in the basin. In contrast, releasing water from a dam to drive hydroelectric turbines is a nonconsump-
tive use because the water is available for downstream users but not necessarily at the appropriate time. Withdrawals by a city for municipal supplies are mainly nonconsump-
tive, but if the returning water is inadequately treated, the quality of water downstream is affected.

Note: In the developed world intensive agriculture has often come at high environmental cost, including runoff of excess fertilizers leading to dead zones in coastal areas. Dead
zones are defined as extreme hypoxic zones, that is, areas where oxygen concentrations are lower than 0.5 milliliters of oxygen per liter of water. These conditions normally lead
to mass mortality of sea organisms, although in some of these zones organisms have been found that can survive at oxygen levels of 0.1 milliliter per liter of water.

Note: Projections based on the MiniCAM Global Integrated Assessment Model. Both scenarios represent a path to achieve a CO2 concentration of 450 ppm by 2095. In figure
3.14a, a price is put on carbon emissions from fossil fuels, industry, and land-use change. In figure 3.14b, the same price is applied but only to fossil-fuel and industry emissions.
When a price is not applied to terrestrial emissions, growers are likely to encroach into natural habitats, mainly in response to the demand for biofuels.

Note: The sectoral share of global emissions in figure 4.4a is for 2004. The sectoral share of emissions in high-, middle-, and low-income countries in figures 4.4b, 4.4c, and 4.4d
are based on emissions from the energy and agriculture sectors in 2005 and from land-use changes and forestry in 2000. The size of each pie represents contributions of green-
house gas emissions, including emissions from land-use changes, from high-, middle-, and low-income countries; the respective shares are 35, 58, and 7 percent. Looking only
at CO2 emissions from energy, the respective shares are 49, 49, and 2 percent. In Figure 4.4a, emissions from electricity consumption in buildings are included with those in the
power sector. Figure 4.4b does not include emissions from land-use change and forestry, because they were negligible in high-income countries.

Note: Each dot represents the emissions reduction that a particular model associates with a concentration target--450, 550, 650 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)--
in 2050. The number of dots in each column signals how many of the 14 models and model variants were able to find a pathway that would lead to a given concentration outcome.
"Overshoot" describes a mitigation path that allows concentrations to exceed their goal before dropping back to their goal by 2100, while "not to exceed" implies the concentra-
tion is not to be exceeded at any time. "Full" refers to full participation by all countries, so that emission reductions are achieved wherever and whenever they are most cost-
effective. "Delay" means high-income countries start abating in 2012, Brazil, China, India, and the Russian Federation start abating in 2030, and the rest of the world in 2050.

Note: Maintaining emissions at 450 ppm CO2e or less at all times is almost impossible to attain. If concentrations are allowed to exceed 450 ppm CO2e before 2100, keeping
warming close to 2°C still poses tremendous challenges, as the right-hand column outlines. Annex I countries are the OECD and transition economies committed to reducing
emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. The non-Annex I countries did not take on any commitment to reduce emissions.

      Fossil CCS is fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. While the exact mitigation potential of each wedge may vary under dif-
      ferent models depending on the baseline, the overall conclusions remain the same.

Note: See table 4.4 for detailed definitions of technology development stage. A given technology group can be progressing through different stages at the same time but in dif-
ferent country settings and at different scales. Wind, for example, is already cost competitive with gas-fired power plants in most of the United States (Wiser and Bolinger 2008).
But in China and India wind may be economically but not financially viable against coal-fired power plants. So for clean technologies to be adopted in more places and at larger
scales, they must move from the top to bottom in table 4.4.

The interaction between the international trade and climate change regimes has potentially major implications for devel-
oping countries. While there are positive reasons for exploring synergies between the two regimes and for aligning policies
that could stimulate production, trade, and investment in cleaner technology options, instead much focus has been on using
trade measures as sanctions in the global climate negotiations.

Note: The 2009 Accenture Climate Change Survey was conducted with a sample of 10,733 individuals in 22 developed and emerging economies. The sample was representative
of the general population in developed countries and urban populations in developing countries. Panel a: Respondents were asked about their willingness to switch to a greener
energy provider if the provider offered services that help reduce carbon emissions. Intentions did not translate into action, with most respondents staying with their old energy
provider. Panel b: Based on the questionnaire, countries were ranked on two criteria--confidence and intention. Confidence measured the individual's optimism about the ability
of individuals, politicians, and energy providers to find a solution. Respondents in emerging economies generally were more optimistic about humankind's ability to take action to

Note: Output is an index of cooperative behavior in climate change policy, spanning ratification of agreements, reporting, and financing--it ranges between 0 and 1, with higher
values indicating more cooperation. Outcome is an index of cooperative behavior in climate change policy, spanning emission trends and emission levels--it ranges between
0 and 1, with higher values indicating more cooperation. The Political Rights Index by Freedom House is a measure of democracy encompassing the degree of freedom in the
electoral process, political pluralism and participation, and functioning of government. Numerically, Freedom House rates political rights on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 representing
the most free and 7 representing the least free. However, in this figure the scale of original data has been inverted and higher values indicate a higher level of democracy. Data
are 1990­2005 averages. The figure shows that there is a positive relationship between output and level of democracy, as represented by the Freedom House political rights index;
democratic countries have, in general, better output. Conversely no significant relationship has been found between level of democracy and climate outcomes in the form of emis-
sion reductions (using emissions reductions in 2003 compared to 1990 levels).

 1, 2       Annual average CO2 emissions         CO2 emission estimates due to deforestation are based on Houghton (2009) and are derived from estimates
            (million metric tons) and rank       of tropical forest cover change by the 2005 UN Forest Resources Assessment (FAO 2005). Estimates of CO2
                                                 emissions from deforestation vary across time and also as a result of uncertain data: There is variation
                                                 among estimates of deforestation rates and estimates of carbon stocks in the forests converted to other
                                                 uses. To account for year-to-year trends and measurement uncertainty, the numbers reported here are
                                                 based on average annual emissions between 1990 and 2005. The 25 largest contributors to CO2 emissions
                                                 from deforestation in 2005, shown in the table, account for approximately 95% of the world total. Net
                                                 deforestation from high-income countries is estimated to be close to zero or slightly negative. The rank is

            (% of cropland)
 3          Aquaculture production            Aquaculture production includes farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans,
            (millions $)                      and aquatic plants in brackish water, freshwater, or marine environment; both in inland waters and
                                              marine areas. Aquaculture production specifically refers to output from aquaculture activities, which are
                                              designated for final harvest for consumption. Data is from FAO (2009).
 4­7        Projected physical impacts        Projected physical impacts of climate change by the middle of the 21st century. Selected indicators include
                                              change in average annual temperature, change in precipitation and precipitation intensity, and change in
                                              heat wave duration. These projections estimates represent an ensemble mean of 19 general circulation
                                              models used for the IPCC Fourth Assessment (IPCC 2007). The changes are estimated for the future time
                                              period 2030­2049 relative to 1980­1999. Indicators are spatially-weighted averages for each country.

Table A6   Wealth of nations
 Column     Indicator                       Notes
 1          Total wealth                    The aggregate wealth nations have produced in the past, reflecting the value of all goods, resources, and
            ($ per capita)                  services, including natural, produced, and intangible capital. Sub-categories of natural capital include
                                            forest, soil, and agricultural resources, which are indicative of a country's reliance on natural resources
                                            and vulnerability to climate change. All indicators are expressed in per capita US$ value obtained after
                                            dividing the total value by midyear population (World Bank 2005).
 2          Produced capital                Produced capital includes machinery, equipment, and structures and urban land.
            ($ per capita)
 3          Intangible capital              Intangible capital includes raw labor, human capital, social capital, and other factors such as the quality of
            ($ per capita)                  institutions. It is calculated as a residual, the difference between total wealth and the sum of produce and
                                            natural capital.
 4          Natural capital                 Natural capital includes energy resources (oil, natural gas, hard coal, and lignite), mineral resources
            ($ per capita)                  (bauxite, copper, gold, iron, lead, nickel, phosphate, silver, tin, and zinc), timber resources, nontimber forest
                                            resources, cropland, pastureland, and protected areas.
 5          Pastureland                     Natural capital associated with pastureland reflects the annual value of pastureland for production
            ($ per capita)                  of goods. Returns to pastureland are assumed to be 45 percent of output value, which is based on the
                                            production of beef, lamb, milk, and wool valued at international prices.
 6          Cropland                        Natural capital associated with cropland reflects the annual value of agricultural production based on
            ($ per capita)                  available cropland. Return to cropland is computed as the difference between the market value of crops
                                            and crop-specific production costs.
 7          Protected areas                 Natural capital associated with protected area reflects the annual value of benefits associated with
            ($ per capita)                  protected areas including recreational value, tourism and other existence values.
 8          Nontimber forest resources      Nontimber forest benefits include minor forest products, hunting, recreation, and watershed protection.
            ($ per capita)                  Annual benefits were derived assuming that one-tenth of the forest area in each country is accessible with
                                            benefits ranging from $190 per hectare in developed countries to $145 per hectare in developing countries.
 9          Timber resources                Timber resources are based on coniferous and non-coniferous roundwood (wood in the rough) production.
            ($ per capita)                  Since market values are used to estimate the value of standing timber a distinction is made between forests
                                            available and forests not available for wood supply. The area of forest available for wood supply is defined
                                            as within 50 kilometers of infrastructure.
 10         Subsoil assets                  Subsoil assets are proven reserves of mineral deposits located on or below the earth's surface that are
            ($ per capita)                  economically exploitable, given current technology and relative prices.

 3          Triadic patent families         Defined as a set of patents, for a single invention, granted by the European Patent Office, the Japan Patent
            (per million people)            Office, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office. It is a good indicator of the number of patents
                                            filed and patents per capita (OECD 2008).
 4          Knowledge Economy Index         Knowledge Economy Index (World Bank 2008) is an aggregate index based on the World Bank Knowledge
                                            Assessment Methodology 2008 (KAM) and represents the overall preparedness of a country or region for
                                            the knowledge economy. The KEI is constructed as the simple average of 4 sub-indexes, which represent
                                            the following 4 pillars of the knowledge economy: (1) Economic Incentive and Institutional Regime, (2)
                                            Education and Training, (3) Innovation and Technological Adoption, and (4) Information and Communications
                                            Technologies Infrastructure.

   Environmental Benefits Statement
The World Bank is committed to preserving endangered
forests and natural resources. The Office of the Publisher
follows the recommended standards for paper usage set by
the Green Press Initiative, a nonprofit program supporting
publishers in using fiber that is not from endangered
forests.
In the printing of the World Development Report 2010:
Development and Climate Change, we took the following
measures to reduce our carbon footprint:
· We used paper containing 100 percent recycled fiber
  made from post-consumer waste; each pound of post-
  consumer recycled fiber that replaces a ton of virgin fiber
  prevents the release of 2,108 pounds of greenhouse gas
  emissions and lessens the burden on landfills.
· We used paper that is chlorine-free and acid-free.
· We printed the World Development Report 2010 with
  vegetable-based inks that are made from renewable
  sources and that are easier to remove in the recycling
  process.

Today's enormous development challenges are complicated by the reality of
climate change--the two are inextricably linked and together demand immediate
attention. Climate change threatens all countries, but particularly developing ones.
Understanding what climate change means for development policy is the central aim of
the World Development Report 2010.




Estimates are that developing countries would bear some 75 to 80 percent of the costs of anticipated
damages caused by the changing climate. Developing countries simply cannot afford to ignore
climate change, nor can they focus on adaptation alone. So action to reduce vulnerability and lay the
groundwork for a transition to low-carbon growth paths is imperative.

The World Development Report 2010 explores how public policy can change to better help people
cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a
threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and
how energy systems will need to be transformed.

The authors examine how to integrate development realities into climate policy--in international
agreements, in instruments to generate carbon finance, and in steps to promote innovation and the
diffusion of new technologies.

The World Development Report 2010 is an urgent call for action, both for developing countries that
strive to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income
countries that need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries' efforts.

The authors argue that a climate-smart world is within reach if we act now to tackle the substantial
inertia in the climate, in infrastructure, and in behaviors and institutions; if we act together to reconcile
needed growth with prudent and affordable development choices; and if we act differently by investing
in the needed energy revolution and taking the steps required to adapt to a rapidly changing planet.

       This Report was prepared by a team led by David Turnham and comprising Chandra Hardy, Dale
     Hill, William Jones, Homi Kharas, Gary Kutcher, Per Ljung, Christopher Redfern, Harry Walters, and
     Arshad Zaman. The Economic Analysis and Projections Department prepared much of the data on
     which Part I is based, and supplied information and assistance for the whole Report. The team also
     worked closely with members of the Economics and Research staff and of the Agriculture and Rural
     Development Department, particularly Jean Baneth, Hans Binswanger, Graham Donaldson, Jack Duloy,
     Peter Miovic, and Donald Pickering. The authors would like to thank these and many other contributors,
     reviewers, and production and support staff. The work was carried out under the general direction
     of Bevan Waide.
       For the discussion of agricultural development, the team would like to acknowledge the considerable
     help and assistance provided by the staff of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
     International Labour Organisation (ILO). FAQ kindly provided material from their data collection which
     is used extensively in the text. Neither these organizations nor members of their staffs are responsible
     for views expressed in the Report.
       The judgments expressed are those of the World Bank staff and do not necessarily reflect the views
     of the Board of Directors or the governments they represent.

Note: Country groups are the same as in Table 2.2. The above table may be interpreted as follows. Losses in national income arise from
   unfavorable movements in import prices compared with export prices. When these price movements are measured relative to the
   GDP price index, they can be translated into increases in the price indexes of investment or consumption goods relative to the GDP
   price index. The distribution of the total shock between these components is influenced by government policies. This information is
   shown for the major country groups in the upper part of the table: their sum equals external shocks to which adjustment was necessary.
   Countries responded to these shocks by (1) reducing absorption which was distributed over consumption and investment; (2) borrowing
   from abroad and, where necessary, (3) slower growth. The relative reliance on these modes of adjustment appears in the lower part
   of the table.
   Thus, in the semi-industrial Southeast Asia group, for example, the average annual terms of trade loss in 1975-78 relative to 1970-72
   was 1.8 percent of average 1970-72 GDP. These fell more on consumption goods (1.4 percent) than on investment goods (0.4 percent).
   The losses were more than fully accommodated by reduced real domestic expenditure relative to GDP: the net domestic resources
   thus conserved (3.4 percent of 1970-72 CDI') were attributable to large reductions in the real consumption share (7.9 percent) offsetting
   a rise in the real investment share (4.5 percent). Real external capital flows accounted for an additional 0.4 percent of 1970-72 GDP.
   Together these modes of adjustment were sufficient to permit growth. For a more detailed discussion of the methodology, see Hardy
   and Kharas.
a. This line reflects the impact on the external deficit of changes in CDI' measured in 1970-72 US dollars. It therefore incorporates both
   real domestic growth and real exchange rate movements.

World Development Report has been published annually by The World Bank since 1978.
 Part I of World Development Report 1982 reviews development prospects in the international economy
and supplements the extensive discussion of adjustment issues in the 1981 Report. It finds that,
although international prospects have worsened over the past year, during the remainder of the
decade the middle-income countries should be able to continue narrowing the income gap between
themselves and the industrial countries. The prospects for many of the low-income countries,
however, remain a matter of grave concern.
   Part 11 of the 1982 Report concentrates on agriculture, which remains the chief source of income
for close to two-thirds of the population in developing countries and for the vast majority of the
world's poor. Informing the discussion is the experience gained by The World Bank in helping to
finance some 800 agicultural and rural developmnt projects in more than 70 countresexperience
supported by its broad, intensive programs of economic, scientific, and social research.
   Numerous tables and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the main body of the Report;
case studies are interspersed to provide analyses directly related to the substance of the text. The
final portion of the Report comprises "World Development Indicators," 25 two-page tables containing
economic and social profiles of more than 120 countries.

       This Report has been prepared by a team led by Lyn Squire and comprising Ehtisham Ahmad,
     Robert L. Ayres, Gary Fields, Helena Ribe, Mark Suridberg, Jacques van der Gaag, Dominique van de
     Walle, and Michael Walton. The team was assisted by Lara Akinbami, Fernando J. Batista, Robin
     Burgess, Elaine K. Chan, Pierre Englebert, Carlos Alberto Herran, Kathryn A. Larin, Natasha
     Mukherjee, and Anna-Birgitta Viggh. The work was carried out under the general direction of Stanley
     Fischer.
       Many others in and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the biblio-
     graphical note). The International Economics Department prepared the data and projections pre-
     sented in Chapter 1 and the statistical appendix. It is also responsible for the World Development
     Indicators. The production staff of the Report included Les Barker, Kathy DahI, Connie Eysenck,
     Kenneth Hale, Jeffrey N. Lecksell, Nancy Levine, Hugh Nees, Joyce C. Petruzzelli, Kathy Rosen, Walt
     Rosenquist, and Brian J. Svikhart. Library assistance was provided by Iris Anderson. The support
     staff was headed by Rhoda Blade-Charest and included Laitan Alli, Trinidad S. Angeles, and Maria
     Guadalupe M. Mattheisen. Clive Crook was the principal editor.
       Fondly remembered and acknowledged, too, is Pensri Kimpitak (1945-1990), illustrator and graph-
     ics designer for the Report since its inception in 1978, whose final illness prevented her participation
     in this edition.

 Many highly indebted developing countries
have been running substantial trade surpluses,
largely because of their need to service debt. Be-
tween 1980 and 1981 the nineteen severely in-
debted middle-income countries had an average
trade deficit of $4 billion; during 1982-89 they
achieved an average annual surplus of $26 billion,
the equivalent of 3.3 percent of GDP (see Figure
1.4). This improvement has come largely through a
reduction in imports. It bears witness to the                            1980              1983        1986               1989

countries in the 1970s and early 1980s failed this

Note: The poverty line in 1985 PPP dollars is $275 per capita a year for the extremely poor and $370 per capita a year for the poor.
  The headcount index is defined as the percentage of the population below the poverty line. The 95 percent confidence intervals around the
point estimates for the headcount indices are Sub-Saharan Africa, 19, 76; East Asia, 21, 22; South Asia, 50, 53; Eastern Eutope, 7, 10; Middle East
and North Africa, 13, 51; Latin America and the Caribbean, 14, 30; and all developing countries, 28, 39.
  The poverty gap is defined as the aggregate income shortfall of the poor as a percentage of aggregate consumption. Under 5 mortality rates are

Note: This table uses country-specific poverty lines. Official or commonly used poverty lines have been used when available. In other cases the
poverty line has been set at 30 percent of mean income or expenditure. The range of poverty lines, expressed in terms of expenditure per
household member and in PPP dollars, is approximately $300-$700 a year in 1985 except for Costa Rica ($960), Malaysia ($1,420), and Singapore
($860). Unless otherwise indicated, the table is based on expenditure per household member. The headcount index is the percentage of the
population below the poverty line. The average income shortfall is the mean distance of consumption or income of the poor below the poverty
line, as a proportion of the poverty line.
   Measures for this entry use income rather than expenditure.
    Measures for this entry are by household rather than by household member.

declined. These changes account for the significant
improvement in poverty seen in Figure 7.3.
  The success or failure of efforts to protect the
poor does not depend on whether the government
attempts to cushion the decline in consumption
during adjustment. The successful and the unsuc-
cessful alike have taken this route. Indeed, in both
Latin America and East Asia the counterpart of a
cushioned fall in consumption was lower invest-

     functional agencies of the United Nations system. Net
     disbursements of concessional assistance from the mul-

     1988; of this, assistance from IDA accounted for about
     $3.8 billion. The United Nations assistance agencies,
     such as the United Nations Children's Fund, the
     United Nations Development Programme, and the
     World Food Programme, provided about $3.8 billion.

         The current account balance (on goods, services, income, and all unrequited transfers)
         represents transactions that add to or subtract from an economy's stock of foreign financial
         Items. For some purposes, however, official unrequited transfers (mainly foreign aid grants,
         food aid, and technical assistance) are treated as being closely akin to official capital move-
         ments. A measure of the current account balance before official transfers, sometimes re-
         ferred to as "total to be financed," is then appropriate. For further information, see the

        The World Bank



 More than a billion people in the developing world live in poverty, and millions in
 Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America are experiencing increasing deprivation.
 Ten years after World Development Report 1980 looked at the cuses and extent of
 poverty, this thirteenth annual Report returns to the subject to examine what has
 gone right and wrong and to look toward the future. It recommends that countries
 and the development community pursue a twofold strategy for reducing poverty
 a strategy that has already shown promise.
         The first necessity is to promote broadly based growth that will generate in-
 come-earning opportunities for the poor. The second is to ensure, by improving
 access to education, health care, and other social services, that the poor can take
 advantage of these opportunities. Transfers and other special arrangements are
 needed for those who are not able to benefit fully from the increased opportuni-
 tiesfor example, the needy aged, the ill, and the disabledand those buffeted by
 economic shocks and setbacks. But the main elements of the strategy are designed
 to enable the poor to make effective use of their principal assettheir ability to
 work. The Report urges the development community to allocate larger shares of aid
 budgets to those countries which have shown in their policies a genuine commit-
 ment to reducing poverty.
        The world economy emerged from the shocks and transformations of the
 1980s in better shape than might have been expected. The current trends, if they
 continue, would create a good economic foundation for meeting the challenge of
poverty and creating brighter prospects for large populations in the developing
world in the last years of the twentieth century. Great progress has already been
made in the past three decades. Even during the so-called lost decade of the 98Os,
 living standards continued to improve for most of the world's poor. What is needed
 now is political commitmenton the part of the developing countries, the irdus-
- trial -countries, and the international community.
          Like previous issues, this Report contains a World Development Indicators
-annex with comprehensive, up-to-date data on social and economic development in
 more than 180 countries and territories. These data will also be available on diskette
 for use with personal computers.

growth is not affected), there would be an indirect
impact: reduced population growth allows re-

and welfare, instead of being stretched out to cover

will be explored in depth in World Development
Report 1984.

Conclusions
Steady growth in the industrial world is vital for
developing countries. At the same time, domestic
policies are critical for their performance. And these
are within their control. The scenarios discussed
in this chapter convey one clear policy message:
while there is some scope for improving resource
mobilization, the principal area for improvement
is in the efficiency of resource use. One major
source of greater efficiency is tradeby better ex-
ploiting comparative advantage. To improve eco-
nomic performance requires both policy reforms
and strengthened institutions for management

Groups of economies
 The colors on the map show what
 group a country has been placed in on
 the basis of its GNP per capita and,
 in some instances, its distinguishing
 economic characteristics. For example,
 all low-income countries, those with a
 GNP per capita of less than $410, are
 colored yellow. The groups are the
 same as those used in the 27 tables
 that follow, and they include only the
 125 countries with a population of more
 than 1 million.

World Development Report 1983 analyzes in its opening chapters the severe repercussions
of the 1980-82 world recession on developing countriesthe stagnation in world trade,
compounded by the sharp deterioration in commodity prices and high interest rates
that have halted economic progress in so many countries and given rise to severe debt
problems. In reviewing prospects for the 1980s, the Report argues for concerted in-
ternational action to roll back protectionism and maintain growth in capital flows,
especially concessional aid to low-income countries.
  The unfavorable external environment tacing the developing countries lends partic-
ular urgency to strengthening development performance. The management aspects of
development are the main topic of he 1983 edition. The second part of the Report
discusses the means available to governments to make their bureaucracies and state-
owned enterprises more efficient. It focuses on issues in economic planning, financial
management, decentralization, and accountability. The authors have drawn heavily
on country experience worldwide, as well as on the Bank's own experience gained
from assisting several thousand projects over the past quarter century.
  Numerous tables and multicolor maps and graphics supplement the main body of
the Report. Case studies are interspersed to provide analyses directly related to the
substance of the text. The final portion of the Report comprises "World Development
Indicators," 2? two-page tables containing economic and social profiles of 125 countries.
  World Development Report has been published annually by the World Bank since     1978.
Each edition examines the current world economic situation and prospects as they
relate to development and offers a detailed analysis of a particular topic or sector of
importance in economic and social development.

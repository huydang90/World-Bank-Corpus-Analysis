Foreword




Poverty reduction comes about through individuals, families and communities taking advan-
tage of the opportunities available to them by working, investing and innovating to better their
lives. But we live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in opportunity, both within and across
countries. Even the basic opportunity for life itself is disparately distributed: whereas less than
half of one percent of children born in Sweden die before their first birthday, this is the case for
close to 15% of all children born in Mozambique. Within El Salvador, the infant mortality rate
is 2% for children of educated mothers, but 10% for those whose mothers have no schooling.
In Eritrea, immunization coverage is close to 100% for children in the richest fifth of the popu-
lation, but only 50% for the bottom fifth.
   These children can not be blamed for the circumstances into which they are born, yet their
lives--and their ability to contribute to the development of their nations--are powerfully
shaped by them. That is why the World Development Report 2006, the twenty-eighth in this
annual series, looks at the role of equity in the process of development. Equity is defined in
terms of two basic principles. The first is equal opportunities: that a person's life achievements
should be determined primarily by his or her talents and efforts, rather than by pre-determined
circumstances such as race, gender, social or family background. The second principle is the
avoidance of deprivation in outcomes, particularly in health, education and consumption levels.
   For many if not most people, equity is of intrinsic importance as a development goal in its
own right. But this report goes further, by presenting persuasive evidence that a broad sharing
of economic and political opportunities is also instrumental for economic growth and devel-
opment. This is for economic reasons, because greater equity can lead to a fuller and more effi-
cient use of a nation's resources. It is also for political and institutional reasons: excessive
inequalities in power and influence can lead to political, social and economic institutions that
are less conducive to long-term growth. Few today's prosperous societies, if any, developed by
excluding the majority of their people from economic and political opportunities.
   The implication of this message for the work of the World Bank and others in the develop-
ment community is that a focus on equity should be a central concern in the design and imple-
mentation of policy for development and growth. This insight needs to be integrated into both
analytical and operational work on core areas of development design, including the role and
functioning of markets. Public action should seek to expand the opportunity sets of those who,
in the absence of policy interventions, have the least resources, voice and capabilities. It should
do so in a manner that respects and enhances individual freedoms, as well as the role of markets
in allocating resources.
   Equity in the international arena is also a central concern, and can play a powerful comple-
mentary role to domestic action. In a globally interconnected world, leveling the international
playing fields, both economically and politically, will help domestic efforts to combine equity
with efficiency and growth.
   In my view, the evidence that equity and economic efficiency as well as growth are comple-
mentary in the long run helps to integrate the main two components of the World Bank's
poverty reduction strategy. The focus on broadening opportunities strongly supports the first

                    pillar of the Bank's development strategy, namely enhancing the investment climate for every-
                    one. Together with the interdependence between the economic and political dimensions of
                    development it also reinforces the importance of empowerment. This report shows that the
                    two pillars are not independent from each other in supporting development, but instead are
                    intricately linked with one another. It is my hope that this report will have a real influence in the
                    way that we and our development partners understand, design and implement development
                    policies.

Inequality traps stifle economic development in a north Indian village
Villagers differ markedly from one another in the opportunities they have to improve their welfare and in their abilities to
use the assets and endowments available to them. Mirrored in village economic and social institutions--and in the politi-
cal processes for seeking change--these deep-seated inequalities have prevented the village from improving human devel-
opment and accelerating economic growth.

Why does equity matter?

   II      IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS REPORT, WE SUMMARIZED some of the evi-
           dence on inequalities in several dimensions. In addition to affecting
           well-being directly, such dimensions as health, education, income,
P A R T    voice, and access to services shape the opportunities people face for
           future progress and achievement. We emphasized the interconnections
           between these various dimensions. Not only is there inequality in the
           distributions of income, health status, and educational attainment,
           but--even more important--these indicators tend to be correlated.
           The rich tend to be both healthier and better educated than others.
           The poorest of the poor tend to have the lowest attainment in years of
           schooling and some of the worst health indicators. These correlations
           generally also extend to public services, with the poor gaining access to
           infrastructure, electricity, water, sanitation, and garbage disposal much
           later than others, if at all.
              Because education and wealth help a person gain influence in soci-
           ety, voice and political power are also generally thought to be correlated
           with economic well-being. The interaction between these mutually
           reinforcing economic, social, and political inequalities perpetuates
           them across generations. Chapter 2 discussed evidence indicating that a
           10 percent difference in economic status between two families in one
           generation tends to imply, on average, a 4 percent to 7 percent differ-
           ence in the next generation, depending on the country and measure-
           ment details. Opportunities clearly are not independent from social
           and family background, or from group identity.
              Do such disparities matter? Are people concerned with the large
           observed differences in access to education and health, and in eco-
           nomic opportunities, or merely with the fact that some people have
           low absolute levels of income, years of schooling, and access to serv-
           ices? Should policymakers worry about the unequal opportunities

Equity and development in the Spanish transition to democracy
In the last half century, Spain has gone from authoritarianism and underdevelopment to democracy and wealth. Spain's
history illustrates how the distribution of political agency and economic assets greatly influences the policy choices avail-
able to a society. The fundamentals of economic and political structure influence and constrain the choices. But the
process is not deterministic: political agency and policies can shift the underlying fundamentals (as happened in Spain in
the 1960s and 1970s) and open the space for new choices.

Leveling the economic
and political playing fields

III        WHAT CAN BE DONE TO INCREASE EQUITY IN THE WORLD? Can this be
           done in ways that also spur long-term prosperity? We read in part I that
           there are large inequalities of opportunity between people within coun-
P A R T    tries and--even more--between people in different countries. These
           inequalities are perpetuated through interlocking economic, political,
           and sociocultural mechanisms, creating inequality traps. Individuals
           from different groups and countries face a highly uneven playing field,
           both in their capacities to acquire endowments and aspire to a better life,
           and in their opportunities to reap returns from those endowments
           through market and nonmarket processes. Because differences between
           countries often exceed within-country differences, it is of particular
           importance that national policies support, or are at least consistent with,
           the narrowing of international differences, notably through the growth
           process.
              We argued in part II that many inequalities not only violate peo-
           ple's concern for fairness, but actually have costs for the development
           process. The effects on development depend on specific forms of
           inequality and their interactions with market imperfections and insti-
           tutions. Unequal opportunities are associated with inefficiencies and
           wasted economic potential. Pronounced inequalities in the distribu-
           tion of power are often associated with weak economic institutions,
           undermining the investment and innovation that is central to long-
           run growth. Greater equity is thus not only intrinsically desirable but
           also is complementary to long-run growth and prosperity. For poorer
           and excluded groups, a focus on equity can bring a double benefit--a
           bigger pie and a greater share.
              But the scope for such a complementary relationship between
           equity and aggregate development is often not exploited. When exam-
           ining this, we suggest there are two kinds of pathology in policy

Brazil                          Public financial institutions in Brazil appear to have served larger firms more than private banks have (Kumar 2005).

Chile                           Following liberalization in the late 1970s, many privatizations of state-owned banks went to groups of insiders (Larrain 1989).

Czech Republic                  Mass privatization in the Czech Republic delayed the establishment of a securities and exchange commission, facilitating tunneling
                                (stealing assets by channeling to another firm owned by insiders) (Cull, Matesova, and Shirley 2002).

Indonesia                       Market attributes large financial value for political connections, suggesting politics rather than economics determined access or
                                rents (Fisman 2001b).

France, pre-1985                Banks, protected and dependent on government support, lend to less productive firms (Bertrand, Schoar, and Thesmar 2004).

Korea, Rep. of                  The opening up of new segments of financial services provision was dominated by insiders. Increasing openness primarily expanded
                                and strengthened the politically most connected firms (Haggard, Lim, and Kim 2003, Siegel 2003).

Malaysia                        The imposition of capital controls in September 1998 primarily benefited firms with ties to Prime Minister Mahathir (Johnson and
                                Mitton 2003).

Mexico late 1800s               There was capture of the financial sector in Mexico in the late 1800s blocking entry in emerging industries (Haber, Noel, and Razo
                                2003).

Mexico early 1990s              Lending to connected interests in the early 1990s was prevalent (20 percent of commercial loans) and took place on better terms
                                than arms' length lending (annual interest rates were 4 percentage points lower). Related loans were 33 percent more likely to
                                default and had lower recovery rates (30 percent less) than unrelated ones (La Porta, López-de-Silanes, and Zamarripa 2002).

Pakistan                        Insider activities have significant economic costs. Politically connected firms borrowed twice as much from government banks and
                                had 50 percent higher default rates between 1996 and 2002, with economywide costs of rent-seeking estimated to be 0.3 percent to
                                1.9 percent of GDP per year. Brokers trading on their own behalf earned annual rates of return 50­90 percentage points higher than
                                those earned by outside investors. Hence, price manipulation by intermediaries helps keep equity markets marginal with few
                                outsiders investing and little capital raised (Khwaja and Mian 2004, 2004b).

Russian Federation              Russia's free-for-all banking entry, combined with its choice of a universal banking system, gave great discretion to insiders to
                                conduct asset stripping through the loan-for-shares scheme. The weak political accountability could not stop the capture of state
                                resources or protected rents (Perotti 2002, Black, Kraakman, and Tassarova 2000).

Thailand                        Connected lending was large before the 1997 crisis and firms with connections to banks and politicians had greater access to long-

potential tradeoffs are needed to guide policy choice over regional interventions.

Balancing access to medicines for the world's poor with incentives for

diseases and the income of countries matter for access and incentives.

Measuring equity




This report has concerned itself with equity, a concept which  mortality, and years of education in a slightly different format
we have defined to mean equality of opportunities and the      than what we are normally used to seeing for as many coun-
avoidance of absolute deprivation. As we made clear in the     tries in the world as possible. Table A1 presents poverty rates
report, the focus is mostly on inequality of opportunity, and  using national poverty lines as well as those using the interna-
much less on overall inequality in a one-dimensional space,    tional $1 and $2 per day poverty lines; information for the
such as income or education. We might be quite sanguine        national poverty line is also presented for urban and rural
about certain types of inequality across people if, for exam-  breakdowns of the population. Table A2 presents alternative
ple, their outcomes varied for reasons that had to do mainly   inequality measures to the commonly used Gini Index, fol-
with their own efforts. But we are concerned with systematic   lowed by evidence on inequality of land. In Table A3, we pre-
differences in opportunities between individuals and groups    sent infant mortality rates for more than 50 countries by the
of people due to different "circumstances" not under their     sex of the infant, the education level of the mother, the loca-
control, i.e. when these groups are distinguishable from one   tion (urban or rural) of the family, and the ranking of the
another only in characteristics that in some sense can be      household by an asset index. Finally, in Table A4, we present
argued to be "morally irrelevant" to their opportunities and   educational attainment by location and gender, but also pre-
outcomes in life.                                              sent measures of inequality in years of schooling, along with
   To give the audience a sense of inequality of opportuni-    the share of this inequality that is attributable to gender and
ties, we chose to present data on income/consumption, infant   location.

I  nequalities in incomes, in health, and in educational outcomes have long been a stark fact of life
   in many developing countries. When such inequalities in outcomes arise from unequal opportu-
   nities, there are both intrinsic and instrumental grounds for concern. Because inequalities in
opportunity are often accompanied by profound differences in influence, power, and social status--
whether at the level of individuals or groups--they have a tendency to persist. And because it leads
to an inefficient use of resources and to less effective institutions, inequity is inimical to long-term
development. It follows that there is a legitimate role for public action in the promotion of fairness
and in the pursuit of equity, provided such action is cognizant of the primacy of individual freedoms,
and of the role of markets in allocating resources.

World Development Report 2006 presents evidence on the inequality of opportunity, within and across
countries, and illustrates the mechanisms through which it impairs development. The Report advocates
taking explicit account of equity in determining development priorities: public action should aim to
expand the opportunities of those who, in the absence of policy interventions, have the least resources,
voice, and capabilities. Domestically, it makes the case for investing in people, expanding access to jus-
tice, land, and infrastructure, and promoting fairness in markets. Internationally, the report considers
the functioning of global markets and the rules that govern them, as well as the complementary pro-
vision of aid to help poor countries and poor people build greater endowments. Drawing on the World
Bank's 60 years of development experience, the World Development Report 2006 is essential reading
for understanding how greater equity can reduce poverty, enhance economic growth, advance devel-
opment, and deliver increased opportunities to the poorest groups in our societies.

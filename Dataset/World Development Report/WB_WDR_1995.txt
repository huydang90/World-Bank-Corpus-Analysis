         This Report has been prepared by a team led by Michael Walton and comprising Arup Banerji, Alejandra Cox
     Edwards, Ishac Diwan, Hafez Ghanem, David Lindauer, Ana Revenga, and Michal Rutkowski. The team was
     assisted by Vinod Ahuja, Deon Filmer, Praveen Kumar, Claudio E. Montenegro, Sarbajit Sinha, and Zhi Wang.
     Edward Balls was the principal editor. The work was carried out under the general direction of Michael Bruno.
         Many others in and outside the Bank provided helpful comments and contributions (see the Bibliographical
     Note). The International Economics Department contributed to the data appendix and was responsible for the
     World Development Indicators. The production staff of the Report included Amy Brooks, Kathryn Kline DahI,
     Geoffrey Eaton, Stephanie Gerard, Audrey Heiligman, Cathe Kocak, Jeffrey N. Leckseil, Hugh Nees, Kathy Rosen,
     Beatrice Sito, Tracey A. Smith, and Michael Treadway. The design was by Brian Noyes of the Magazine Group.
     The support staff was headed by Rebecca Sugui and included Daniel Atchison, Elizabeth V. de Lima, and Michael
     Geiler. Trinidad S. Angeles and later Maria D. Ameal served as administrative officer.
        Preparation of the Report was greatly aided by background papers and by contributions from participants in the
     consultation meetings. The names of the participants in the consultation meetings are listed in the Bibliographical
     Note.

     Which Development
    Strategies Are Good for
                    Workers?

MARKET-BASED ECONOMIES have delivered faster growth
than either centrally planned or protectionist econo-
mies. But how does growth affect workers? And what is
the role of governments in supporting rising incomes
for workers and their families? In this part of the Report
we examine the relationship between long-term de-
velopment and the fortunes of workers. We survey the
consequences of economic growth for workers in
Chapter 2, and the nature of interactions between
households and labor markets in Chapter 3. We then,
in Chapters 4 and 5, look at how policy choices can
affect the growth of labor demand and the provision of
skills. Finally,   in Chapter 6, we ask how market
outcomes affect inequalities in how the rewards of
growth are distributed.

     Is International

  Opportunity or a Threat
                to Workers?

THE LIVES OF WORKERS around the world are increas-
ingly connected through international trade, capital
flows, and migration. This expands opportunities, but
it also raises fears that international competition and
free-wheeling capital will cost workers jobs or impair
their standards of living, and that some groups of
workers or countries will be left out of expanding
international markets altogether. In Chapter 7 we out-
line the channels of interaction in an integrating world,
and we assess in the remaining three chapters of this
part of the Report how trade, capital flows, and
migration affect workers in both rich and poor
countries.

    PART THREE
     How Should
Governments Intervene in
    Labor Markets?

GOVERNMENTS INTERVENE in the workplace and in the
lives of workers in many ways. But there is a growing
debate over whether such interventions are really in
workers' best interest. One side calls for aggressive
action to protect workers, through regulations on mini-
mum wages, restrictions on firing, and the like. The
other side argues against such meddling, because it
discourages job creation and helps only a privileged
subset of workers, while hurting or, at best, neglecting
the most vulnerable. This part of the Report analyzes
the role of government in labor markets. Chapter 11
examines labor standards and their impact. Chapter 12
reviews the role of labor unions and their relation to
government. Chapter 13 considers policies designed to
deal with income insecurity. And Chapter 14 takes up
the role of government itself as an employer.

  How Can Policy Choices
  Help Workers in Periods
     of Major Change?

STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT and the transition from
central planning often bring wrenching changes for
workers and their families. But is the pain they bear due
to the faulty design of reform policy, or to the failed
development strategy that reform is now in the process
of uprooting? Are workers suffering a disproportionate
burden of the costs of adjustment? We look at these
questions in this part of the Report. Chapter 15 surveys
the similarities and differences of the difficult adjust-
ments that many countries are now going through, and
how labor fares in each case. Chapter 16 analyzes who
gains and who loses during these episodes of major
economic upheaval. Chapter 17 considers a menu of
microeconomic choices that can both speed the transi-

 The Outlook for Workers
    in the Twenty-First
          Century
THE PAST CENTURY has witnessed more divergence than
convergence in the fortunes of workers in different
parts of the world. Can the twenty-first century be
different? Will it bring in an era of inclusion, in which
economic integration continues and spreads, raising the
incomes of workers in all regionsand especially the
poorest? Chapter 18 relates the themes articulated in
the preceding chapters to the outlook for workers in the
principal regions of the world. It develops both a
pessimistic scenario for the future, in which workers'
living standards in the various regions drift further
apart, and an optimistic one, in which countries seize
the opportunities that global integration presents to
better the lives of their working populations.

      Note: Economies with sparse data or with population of more than 30,000 and fewer than 1 million are shown in Table is; however, data for these
      economies are included in the country groups calculations of totals and weighted averages in the main tables. For data comparability and coverage
      throughout the tables, see the technical notes.
       In all tables, data exclude Eritrea unless otherwise noted.
       In all tables data refer to the unified Germany, unless otherwise noted.
       In all tables, Turkmenistan should be classified as lower-middle-income.

         THE WORLD BANK

                          THE WORLD, most people spend most of their lives working. Even among the
          world's poorest, only a relative few are idle; the great mass of the poor work hard for little pay.
THROUGHOUTUnemployment afflicts more than a hundred million people worldwide and is a matter of major
concern in rich and poor countries alike. But hundreds of millions more, living mainly in the world's
low- and middle-income countries, remain in poverty not for lack of work but for lack of skills, or for
lack of the kind of economic environment in which they can use their skills to work more productively,
for higher pay.
   It is mainly through their work that most households are swept up in the profound changes that are
interweaving their national and regional economies into a single global economy. These changesthe
embrace of international markets, the abandonment of central planningportend enormous opportu-
nities for growth. But how do they affect people as workers-their wages, the risks they face, the condi-
tions under which they workespecially during what for many countries, and many households, is a
painful transitional period?
   This eighteenth annual World Development Report assesses what a more market-driven and integrated
world means for workers. It asks which development strategies best address workers' needs, and what
domestic labor market policies can do to establish a more equitable distribution of income, greater job
security, and higher workplace standards, while preserving and indeed enhancing the efficiency of labor
markets.
   The Report concludes that global integration holds out the prospect of tremendous future gains for
the world's work forcebut no guarantees. Sound domestic and international policies are indispensable
for realizing the promise of a prosperous, integrated global workplace. Policies that rely on markets while
avoiding or correcting market failures, that invest in people, that provide a supportive environment for
family farms as well as emerging industrial and services sectorsall these are good for workers.
Governments continue to exercise important functions: building and maintaining the social framework
within which workers, unions, and firms interact to set wages and working conditions; supporting work-
ers who are hurt when industries or whole economies suffer major shocks; and defending the rights of
the most vulnerable workers, whether they be child laborers victimized by exploitation, or women or eth-
nic minorities suffering from discrimination. In those economies that are less prepared to face global
competitionin particular, those emerging from central planningpublic action has a particularly
important role in promoting labor mobility, easing the cost of transition, and reaching those left out.
  This Report includes the World Development Indicators, which offer comprehensive, current data on
social and economic development in more than 200 countries and territories. The Indicators are also
available on diskette. An Appendix to the Report provides additional statistics on labor.

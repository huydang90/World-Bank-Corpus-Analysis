private organizations, laws, and social norms, contribute
to establishing recognized standards and enforcing con-
tracts, thus making possible transactions that would other-
wise not occur. Rich countries have more-diverse and more-
effective institutions to address information problems than
do poor countries. These institutions make it possible for
people to engage in economic transactions that improve
their lives—from buying milk, to finding a job, to getting
an education, to obtaining a loan. Information problems
are often at the core of the difficulties that poor people in
developing countries encounter in their daily struggle to
survive and to improve their lives.
    Part Two of the Report begins by discussing the nature
and extent of these problems, noting that they are a major
impediment to development—and especially severe for
the poor (Chapter 5). The unequal distribution of infor-
mation can never be entirely eliminated, but it can be
ameliorated, in part through institutional innovations de-
signed specifically for developing-country settings and the
special problems confronting poor people. The rest of

these innovations could not be unleashed until millions of
small farmers planted the new seeds. For this to happen, a
variety of information problems had to be addressed. In

with the inability of the poor to obtain credit—another
classic market failure closely related to information prob-

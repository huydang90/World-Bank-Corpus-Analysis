      This Report has been prepared by a team led by Shantayanan Devarajan and Ritva Reinikka,
      and comprising Junaid Ahmad, Stephen Commins, Deon Filmer, Jeffrey Hammer, Lant Pritch-
      ett, Shekhar Shah, and Agnès Soucat, with additional contributions by Nazmul Chaudhury.
      The team was assisted by Claudio E. Montenegro and Manju Rani. Bruce Ross-Larson and
      Meta de Coquereaumont were the principal editors. The work was carried out under the gen-
      eral direction of Nicholas H. Stern.
          The team was advised by a panel of experts led by Emmanuel Jimenez and comprising
      Martha Ainsworth, Abhijit Banerjee, Timothy Besley, John Briscoe, Anne Case, Luis Crouch,
      Angus Deaton, David G. de Groot, Anil Deolalikar, Esther Duﬂo, Vivien Foster, Anne-Marie

          Many others inside and outside the World Bank provided helpful comments, wrote back-
      ground papers and other contributions, and participated in consultation meetings. These con-
      tributors and participants are listed in the Bibliographical Note. The Development Data Group
      contributed to the data appendix and was responsible for the Selected World Development
      Indicators. Much of the background research was supported by several generous trust fund
      grants from the UK Department for International Development, and the Dutch, Finnish and
      Norwegian Governments.
          The team undertook a wide range of consultations for this Report, which included work-
      shops in Berlin, Brussels, Cairo, Colombo, Dhaka, Geneva, Havana, Helsinki, Kampala, New
      Delhi, Paris, Pretoria, Tokyo, Washington D.C., and a series of video conferences with partici-
      pants from Africa, East and South Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. The par-
      ticipants in these workshops and video conferences included researchers, government of?cials,
      and staff of nongovernmental and private-sector organizations.
          Rebecca Sugui served as executive assistant to the team; Leila Search as program assistant
      and technical support; and Endy Shri Djonokusomo and Ofelia Valladolid as team assistants.
      Evangeline Santo Domingo served as resource management assistant.
          Book design, editing, and production were coordinated by the Production Services Unit of
      the World Bank’s Of?ce of the Publisher, under the supervision of Susan Graham and Ilma

      Foreword




      We enter the new millennium with great hopes. For the ?rst time in human history, we have
      the possibility of eradicating global poverty in our lifetime. One hundred and eighty heads
      of state signed the Millennium Declaration in October 2000, pledging the world to meeting
      the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In Monterrey, Mexico, in the spring of 2002,
      the world’s nations established a partnership for increasing external assistance, expanding
      world trade, and deepening policy and institutional reforms to reach these goals. Foreign
      aid, which declined during the 1990s, has begun to increase again.
          But the ?rst few years of the 21st century bring heightened challenges. HIV/AIDS and
      other diseases, illiteracy, and unclean water threaten to dash the hopes of millions, possibly
      billions, of people that they might escape poverty. Tragically, conﬂict has undermined devel-
      opment in many countries. Peace and development go hand in hand. And even as we learn
      how to make development assistance more effective, aid continues to be criticized for not
      being effective enough.
          This year’s World Development Report, the 26th in the World Bank’s ﬂagship series, helps
      to re-ignite and reinforce our hopes by confronting these challenges. Development is not
      just about money or even about numerical targets to be achieved by 2015, as important as
      those are. It is about people. The WDR focuses on basic services, particularly health, educa-
      tion, water, and sanitation, seeking ways of making them work for poor people. Too often,
      services fail poor people. These failures may be less spectacular than ?nancial crises, but
      their effects are continuing and deep nonetheless. The report shows that there are powerful
      examples of services working for poor people. Services work when they include all the peo-
      ple, when girls are encouraged to go to school, when pupils and parents participate in the
      schooling process, when communities take charge of their own sanitation. They work when
      societies can curtail corruption—which hurts poor people more than it hurts the better
      off—particularly when it hits basic health services, which poor people need desperately.
      They work when we take a comprehensive view of development—recognizing that a
      mother’s education will help her baby’s health, that building a road or a bridge will enable
      children to go to school.
          Services work especially well when we recognize that resources and their effective use are
      inseparable. More effective use makes additional resources more productive—and the argu-
      ment for aid more persuasive. External resources can provide strong support for changes in
      policy and practice that can bring more effective use. This is how we can scale up to achieve
      the Millennium Development Goals.
          To improve service delivery, the WDR recommends institutional changes that will
      strengthen relationships of accountability—between policymakers, providers, and citizens.
      These changes will not come overnight. Solutions must be tailored not to some imaginary
      “best practice? but to the realities of the country or the town or the village. One size will not

                      ?t all. But I am convinced that this new way of thinking about service delivery, and indeed
                      about development effectiveness, will bear fruit, particularly when matched with adequate
                      resources and a desire to assess what works and what does not, and to decide what must be
                      scaled up and, indeed, what must be scaled down.
                          In short, this year’s WDR is central to the World Bank’s two-pronged strategy for devel-
                      opment—investing in and empowering people, and improving the climate for investment.
                      Next year’s WDR will focus on the second of these. Together, these reports form part of the
                      World Bank’s contribution to meeting the challenge the global community has set for
                      itself—to eradicate poverty in our lifetime.

   spotlight on                    Norway and Estonia

Developing social services and building a nation
One of the richest countries in the world, Norway today is the quintessential welfare state, with universal access to basic
health and education. But this welfare state evolved over two centuries, with private systems only gradually giving way to
state-run institutions. Making social services available to all was seen as part of building the Norwegian nation. Though
geographically close, Estonia regained its independence in 1991. It is seeking to develop its social services and build a
nation in a much shorter time, and under budgetary constraints.

Educación con Participación de la Comunidad en El Salvador
By contracting directly with communities, El Salvador dramatically increased the primary school enrollment of children
in poor and remote areas—without reducing the quality of learning.




E       l Salvador was wracked by civil war
        throughout the 1980s. Some 80,000

of roughly 5 million—and many more were

Good health at (initially) low income
Costa Rica and Cuba have both attained very low levels of infant mortality in the last 50 years. For Costa Rica, this is eas-
ily explained by rapid income growth and attention to traditional public health and, in recent years, to innovative
approaches to publicly funded health care. Cuba, on the other hand, has maintained lower levels of infant mortality than
many industrial countries and has eliminated diseases common to developing countries while remaining very poor. The
achievements came with a community-based health system with numerous health workers, highly motivated staff, and
close monitoring and evaluation of outcomes. Can Cuba’s model survive the economic reversals of the 1990s and pressure
for a more open and free society?

170,000 community health agents reaching 80 million Brazilians

ity rate was around 100 per 1,000 live

      Foreword



      This World Development Report is about creating opportunities for people to escape from
      poverty and improve their living standards. It is about creating a climate in which ?rms and
      entrepreneurs of all types—from farmers and microenterprises to local manufacturing con-
      cerns and multinationals—have opportunities and incentives to invest productively, create
      jobs, and expand, and thereby contribute to growth and poverty reduction. The Report thus
      deals with one of the central challenges of development.
         Expanding opportunities for people in developing countries is a pressing concern for gov-
      ernments and for the global community. Nearly half the world’s population lives on less than $2
      a day, and 1.1 billion barely survive on less than $1 a day. Young people have more than double
      the average unemployment rate in all regions, and population growth will add nearly 2 billion
      more people to developing countries over the next 30 years. Improving the climate for invest-
      ment in developing countries is essential to provide jobs and opportunities for young people
      and to build a more inclusive, balanced, and peaceful world.
         There is good news. More governments are recognizing that their policies and behaviors
      play a critical role in shaping the investment climates of their societies, and they are making
      changes. China and India provide compelling examples: investment climate improvements in
      these countries have driven growth and the most dramatic reductions in poverty in history.
      Many other governments are also taking on the agenda, but progress remains slow and uneven.
      Governments still saddle ?rms and entrepreneurs with unnecessary costs, create substantial
      uncertainty and risk, and erect unjusti?ed barriers to competition.
         This year’s World Development Report, the 27th in the World Bank’s ﬂagship series, looks at
      what governments can do to create better investment climates for their societies. Drawing on
      new research, including surveys of nearly 30,000 ?rms in 53 developing countries, other new
      data, and country case studies, it makes four main points.
         First, the Report emphasizes that the goal should be to create an investment climate that is
      better for everyone—in two dimensions. The investment climate should bene?t society as a
      whole, not only ?rms. Well-designed regulation and taxation are thus an important part of a
      good investment climate. And the investment climate should embrace ?rms of all types, not
      just large or inﬂuential ?rms. Small and large ?rms, local and foreign ?rms, and low-tech and
      high-tech ?rms each have important and complementary contributions to make to growth and
      poverty reduction.
         Second, the Report argues that efforts to improve the investment climate need to go beyond
      just reducing business costs. Those costs can indeed be extraordinary in many countries,
      amounting to several times what ?rms pay in taxes. But policy-related risks dominate ?rms’
      concerns in developing countries and can cripple incentives to invest. And barriers to competi-
      tion remain pervasive, dulling incentives for ?rms to innovate and increase productivity. Gov-
      ernments need to address all three aspects of a good investment climate.
         Third, the Report underscores that progress requires more than changes in formal policies.
      The gaps between policies and their implementation can be huge, with the vast informal
      economies in many developing countries providing the most palpable evidence. Governments

                                                                                                 xiii

                 need to bridge these gaps and address deeper sources of policy failure that can undermine a sound
                 investment climate. Governments need to tackle corruption and other forms of rent-seeking, to
                 build credibility with ?rms, to foster public trust and legitimacy, and to ensure their policy interven-
                 tions are crafted to ?t local conditions.
                     Finally, the Report reviews strategies for tackling such a broad agenda. It emphasizes that perfec-
                 tion is not required and that everything does not have to be done at once. But progress requires gov-
                 ernments to address important constraints in ways that give ?rms the con?dence to invest—and to
                 sustain a process of ongoing improvements. Persistence pays off.
                     These ?ndings are supported by detailed analysis and the many examples discussed throughout
                 the Report, which should provide practical insights for policymakers and for others concerned with
                 growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.
                     Improving the investment climate is the ?rst pillar of the World Bank’s overall development strat-
                 egy. The World Development Report 2005 complements last year’s WDR, which addressed key aspects
                 of the second pillar of that strategy: investing in and empowering people to take advantage of oppor-
                 tunities. Together, these two Reports offer sound advice and research that will help the World Bank
                 and our partners realize our common dream—a world free of poverty.

A Better Investment Climate
for Everyone
Firms and entrepreneurs of all types—from microenterprises to multinationals—play a
central role in growth and poverty reduction. Their investment decisions drive job creation,
the availability and affordability of goods and services for consumers, and the tax revenues
governments can draw on to fund health, education, and other services. The contribution
they make to society depends largely on the way governments shape the investment climate
in each location—through the protection of property rights, regulation and taxation,
strategies for providing infrastructure, and interventions in finance and labor markets. New
sources of data from the World Bank highlight how investment climates vary dramatically
across, as well as within, countries and underline the potential for improvement.
The World Development Report 2005: A Better Investment Climate for Everyone argues that
improving the investment climates of their societies should be a top priority for govern-
ments. Drawing on surveys of nearly 30,000 firms in 53 developing countries, country case
studies, and other new research, the Report explores questions such as:
• What are the key features of a good investment climate, and how do they influence
    growth and poverty?
•   Why is progress in improving the investment climate often slow and difficult?
•   What practical lessons can be drawn from country experiences on how to tackle such a
    broad agenda?
•   What has been learned about good practice in each of the main areas of the investment
    climate?
•   What role might selective interventions and international arrangements play in improv-
    ing the investment climate?
•   What can the international community do to help developing countries improve the
    investment climates of their societies?
In addition to detailed chapters examining these and related questions, the Report contains
selected data from the World Bank’s new program of Investment Climate Surveys, the
Bank’s Doing Business Project, and the World Development Indicators 2004, which is an
appendix of economic and social data for over 200 countries. Now in its 27th edition, the
World Development Report offers practical insights for policymakers, executives, scholars,
and all those with an interest in economic development.

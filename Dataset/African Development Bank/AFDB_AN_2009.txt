Annual Report 2003The African Development Bank Group

Comprises
The African Development Bank
The African Development Fund
The Nigeria Trust Fund

The overarching objective of the African Development Bank Group is to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in its regional
member countries (RMCs), thus contributing to poverty reduction. The Bank Group achieves this objective by: (i) mobilizing and allocating resources
for investment in RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice and technical assistance to support development efforts.

The African
Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development bank
whose shareholders comprise 53 African
countries (regional member countries —
RMCs) and 24 non-African countries (nonRegional Member Countries — non-RMCs). It
was established in 1964 and officially began
operations in 1967. The Bank's headquarters
is in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire. However, as a
result of political instability in the country,
the ADB Board of Governors in 2003 decided
to move the Bank to the current Temporary
Relocation Agency (TRA) in Tunis, Tunisia.

The Bank Group's primary objective is to
contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its
regional members, individually and jointly.
This objective is met by financing a broad
range of development projects and programs
through: (i) public sector loans (including
policy-based loans), private sector loans, and
equity investments; (ii) providing technical
assistance for institutional support projects
and programs; (iii) public and private capital
investment; (iv) assistance in coordinating
RMC development policies and plans; and
(v) emergency assistance grant not exceeding
US$ 1.0 million per operation, up to a maximum of two operations per country in any
one year. The Bank prioritizes are national
and multinational projects and programs
that promote regional economic cooperation and integration.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement) designates the Board of Governors as the
Institution's highest policy-making organ.
The Board of Governors is made up of one
representative from each member country and it issues general directives on the
Bank's operations, approves amendments
to the Agreement, oversees the admission
of new members and any increases of the
Bank's capital. The Board of Governors of
ADB meets at least once a year. The ADB
Board of Governors elects an 18-member
Board of Directors to which it delegates its
powers, with the exception of those expressly reserved to it in the Agreement. Twelve
Directors are elected from RMCs and 6 from
non-RMCs for a 3-year term which is renewable for one term. The Board of Directors
oversees all Bank operations.

e Board of Governors elects the President
the Bank Group for a 5-year term, renewle for one term. The President, who must
riginate from an RMC, chairs the Board
Directors, appoints Vice-Presidents — in
onsultation with the Boards — and manges the Bank's daily operations.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on nonconcessional terms. In 1997, it introduced 3

 

ew loan products to meet the needs of its
ients, namely: a single-currency variablerate loan, a single-currency floating-rate loan
and a single-currency fixed rate loan. The
interest rate for the single-currency variable
 

n
c

rate loan is based on the quarter's average
cost of all outstanding Bank borrowings
specifically allocated to fund these loans.
The interest rate for the floating-rate loan is

based on the 6 mont
of currencies offered
for fixed-rate loans is
cost of borrowing to
ment terms for Bank

y the Bank. The rate
based on the Bank's
und them. The repayloans are as follows:

¢ A repayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years for public sector loans;

¢ A repayment period of up to 14 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
4 years for publicly guaranteed Lines of
Credit (LOCs); and

¢ A repayment period of 5 to 20 years,
including a grace period of 1 to 3 years
for private sector loans.

 

The African
Development Fund

The ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973 and
became operational in 1974. Its main objective is to reduce poverty in RMCs by providing low-income RMCs with concessional
loans and grants for projects and programs
and support through technical assistance
for studies and capacity-building activities.

The Agreement Establishing the African

Development Fund (ADF) designates the
Board of Governors as the Fund's highest

Annual Report 2009

xipolicy-making organ. The Board of Governors
meets at least once a year. The ADF Board of
Directors, which oversees the general operations of the Fund, includes 6 Executive
Directors from non-RMCs — nominated by
their constituencies and 6 Executive Directors
representing the ADB.

The Fund's resources come from contributions and periodic replenishments by participants, usually on a 3-year basis. For ADF-XI
(2008-2010), Deputies agreed to a replenishment of UA 5.63 billion, which represents
a 52 percent increase over the ADF-X level.
The replenishment level includes UA 3.57
billion of donor contributions and UA 2.06
billion of advance commitment capacity.

No interest is charged on ADF loans. The
loans, however, carry a service charge of
0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50 percent
per annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans span a 50-year repayment peri
 

 

Annual Report 2009

od including a 10-year grace period. Lines
of Credit (LOCs) have a 20-year repayment
period which comes with a 5-year grace period. The Fund also provides grants to RMCs
which do not carry any interest charges.

The Nigeria Trust Fund

he NTF is a special ADB fund created in
1976 by agreement between the Bank
Group and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. Its objective is to assist
the development efforts of low-income
RMCs whose economic and social conditions necessitate concessional financing.
he NTF became operational in April 1976
ollowing the approval of the Agreement
Establishing the Nigeria Trust Fund by the
Board of Governors. Its initial capital of US$
80.0 million was replenished in 1981 with
US$ 71.0 million.

 

Under the terms of the Agreement
Establishing the NTF, the operations of the

Fund were envisaged to come to an end 30
years after the Agreement came into force.
At the conclusion of this 30-year period on
April 25, 2006, the Bank and the Nigerian
authorities agreed to two 1-year extensions
of the Agreement. During that period, in
November 2006, an independent evaluation
of the activities of the Fund was commissioned and the exercise was completed in
July 2007. On the basis of positive findings
and recommendations from the evaluation
and resulting from meetings held between
the Bank and the Nigerian authorities in
November 2007, the Nigerian authorities
agreed to extend the life of the NTF for a
further 10 years.

Following the approval of the NTF extension
by the Board of Governors of the Bank on
May 15, 2008, and the subsequent approval of the NTF Operational Guidelines in
December 2008 by the Board of Directors,
the NTF lending program recommenced in
2009.The African Development Bank Group

Annual Report 2009 xvMessage from the President of the African Development Bank Group
and Chairman of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African
Development Bank Group

| am pleased to submit this Annual Report
2009, which provides an overview of the
performance of the Bank during 2009, a year
of unique challenges for the institution, its
member countries, and the African economy
at large. This was a year that will go down
in the recent history of the Bank as one
that challenged our innovative ability, our
methods of work, and our resource base.

The toughest hurdle to overcome was
determining how to craft and deliver an
effective response to the global financial
crisis, without appropriate and adequate

instruments, while avoiding strategic drift.

In spite of these handicaps, the Bank was
able to effectively respond to the surging
needs of its regional member countries with
flexibility, innovation, and speed.

Our capacity to respond quickly and effectively
was made possible by our strong finances and
reinforced internal capacity. We were able to
efficiently manage the increasing volume of
operations, while sustaining our financial
soundness. Nonsovereign operations have

Annual Report 2009

continued to grow in volume and quality. We
are boosting our risk management capability
at all levels of the institution. All the windows
of the Bank reported positive earnings in
2009 and the Bank continues to enjoy the
highest ratings from all the major rating
agencies, thanks to shareholder support,
together with the Bank's strong record in
financial and risk management policies and
practices. This robust position has stood us
in good stead, as exemplified by the fact
that despite the turbulence in the financial
markets, the Bank has continued to raise
funds in the capital markets at competitive
and attractive rates. This is testimony to the
credibility of our institution.

Needless to say, the growth in demand
for our resources in the last two years has
placed pressure on the Bank and will limit
our lending ability going forward. In this
regard, | welcome the ongoing discussions
with our shareholders for a Sixth General
Capital Increase for the Bank; to provide
us the wherewithal to effectively support
the development efforts of our countries.
In the same vein, we are now in the
middle of consultations with ADF State
Participants for the 12th Replenishment of
the African Development Fund, on which the
majority of our regional member countries
depend. We hope to conclude both these
consultations in 2010. | would like to place
on record Management's appreciation for
the supportive and positive spirit, and the
confidence in the Bank and in Africa, which
have characterized these discussions.

Through its response to the crisis, the Bank
has demonstrated that it is a partner of
choice for all Africa’s economies, large and
small. This heightened confidence in the
Bank and its expanding franchise indicates
that it is now time to raise the bar.

As we enter the year 2010, the future
for African economies is still somewhat
uncertain but is less threatening. Much of
Africa has avoided a deep recession and
economies are rebounding. The Bank is ready
to assist our member countries to resume
the economic momentum built up over this
past decade. The lessons and experience we
gathered during the food and financial crises
will help us to prepare for the future. We are
updating, fine-tuning, and readjusting our
Medium Term Strategy accordingly.

This is the opportunity to express my
appreciation to our shareholders for their
unflinching support; to our Boards of
Directors and Management for skillfully
steering the Bank throughout the year in
the face of serious challenges; to our staff for
their devotion and dedication to duty; and
to our partners for their collaboration in our
collective endeavor. | commend this Report.

President of the African Development Bank

Group and Chairman of the Boards of DirectorsExecutive Summary

Bank Group operations at end-December 2009 stood at UA 8.06 billion, which is more than double the level of UA 3.53 billion achieved in
2008. This is mainly the result of the Bank’s swift and effective response to the global financial and economic crisis, which was addressed by
providing short-term trade and liquidity facilities to meet the emerging demand for resources from its regional member countries (RMCs).
During the year, the Bank continued to pursue its mandate by implementing its Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012), with its emphasis
on the selectivity of operations, targeted at the sectoral level on infrastructure, the private sector, governance, higher education, science
and technology. The focus on these priority areas will enable the Bank to better contribute to the broader development objectives of agriculture and food security, human development, regional integration, and support to fragile states and middle-income countries. The Bank
has also stepped up the mainstreaming of the cross-cutting issues of gender, environment, and climate change. During the year, the Bank
Group continued to pursue its institutional reforms to strengthen its internal capacity and business processes to maximize the development
effectiveness of its operations. In addition, the commitments and priorities agreed for the ADF-XI and the progress achieved at mid-term
were endorsed by the cooperating partners, thereby launching the process for the Twelfth Replenishment of the African Development Fund
(ADF-XIl). At the same time, in order to strengthen its balance sheet and to maintain its triple A rating, the Bank initiated the process to

mobilize additional capital resources under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI).

Macroeconomic

Situation and Outlook

The depth of the global financial crisis that
started in late 2008 negatively impacted the
African economy differentially across subregions and countries. Overall, Africa's growth
in 2009 was estimated at 2.5 percent, which
is less than half the pre-crisis rate, resulting in
a decline in real GDP per capita for the first
time in a decade. Africa lost between 30 to
50 percent of its 2008 export revenues during
the year. Despite some relief on import bills
due to falling food and oil prices, the overall
trade balance deteriorated sharply. The continent shifted from a current account surplus
of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit of
2.9 percent in 2009. The decline in export
revenues, and in a few instances in the levels
of aid and remittances, exerted a downward
pressure on exchange rates. Similarly, the
fiscal balance deteriorated; from a surplus of
2.2 percent to a deficit of 4.4 percent of GDP
from 2008 to 2009. The debt service as a
percentage of exports also deteriorated, from
5.2 percent in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2009.

The worst-affected countries proved to be the
emerging Regional Member Countries (RMCs),
including frontier markets such as South Africa
and the Seychelles, and resource-rich coun
tries such as Angola and Botswana. In contrast,
resource-poor and landlocked countries such
as those in East and West Africa have weathered the global downturn better.

Although the global economic and financial crisis resulted in a pronounced decline
in GDP growth in 2009, the outlook for
Africa in 2010 has improved substantially.
With the anticipated global recovery and
sound domestic policy responses, Africa's
GDP growth is projected to reach 4.5 percent
in 2010, and 5.2 percent in 2011, although
this is still below the growth rate of the precrisis years. The Bank's continued support to
African countries is essential to overcome
the crisis and bring the economies back to
high-growth paths. For example, the Bank
adopted a flexible approach of frontloading resources and restructuring projects to
deliver support where it was most needed in
response to the crisis. The Bank established
an Emergency Liquidity Facility (ELF) of US$
1.5 billion (UA 0.96 billion) and the Trade
Finance Initiative (TFI) of US$ 1.0 billion
(UA 0.64 billion) in March 2009, to meet
the increased demand for resources from its
RMCs. In addition, the Boards of Directors
approved the US$ 0.5 billion (UA 0.32 billion) Global Trade Liquidity Program (GTLP)

 

 

with other cooperating partners to channel
dedicated Lines of Credit (LOCs) or trade
finance to those African local banks with
regional coverage. Notwithstanding these
contributions, the increasing demand for
financing from RMCs has demonstrated the
inadequacy of the Bank's current resources
envelope. In response, in 2009 the Bank
began to take measures for an early General
Capital Increase (GCI-VI) to help meet future
demand from its RMCs. Furthermore, the
Mid-Term Review of the ADF-XI paved the
way for launching discussions on the ADFXII replenishment.

Bank Group Operational Activities

While addressing the short-term challenges
to its operations posed by the global financial crisis, the Bank continued in 2009 to be
guided by its overarching mission of poverty
reduction and sustainable economic growth
in its RMCs. In this respect, the Bank continued to implement its Medium-Term Strategy
(MTS) 2008-2012, selectively directing its
operational focus to the core sectors of infrastructure, governance, private sector operations, and higher education, science and
technology. This approach enabled the Bank
to respond more effectively to the RMCs’
broader development objectives in the areas

 

Annual Report 2009

xviixviii

of regional integration, human development,
agricultural development and food security,
and to meet the special needs of fragile
states and middle-income countries (MICs).
During the year, the Bank scaled up its efforts
to mainstream the key cross-cutting themes
of gender, environment, and climate change
into all its operations. The Bank also tapped
into its wealth of knowledge, accumulated
from research and analysis, Economic Sector
Work (ESW), and best practice based on its
operational experience, to facilitate many of
these responses. In all its efforts, the Bank
remained committed to strengthening development effectiveness, ensuring visible results
in RMCs, and to more systematic reporting
on its contributions.

Bank Group total loan, grant, and other
approvals in 2009 amounted to UA 8.06 bilion, compared with UA 3.53 billion in 2008,
representing more than a twofold increase.
Of the total approvals for 2009, UA 7.51
billion was in the form of loans and grants,
while UA 558.8 million went to debt relief,
private sector equity participation, guaranees, loan reallocation, and special funds
allocations. The two largest approvals for the
year were the loans for the Medupi Power
Project in South Africa (UA 1.73 billion) and
he Economic Diversification Budget Support
Loan to Botswana (UA 969.0 million).

 

 

n 2009 the distribution of Bank Group
approvals across its 3 windows shows that
he non-concessionary ADB window accounted for UA 5.60 billion (69.5 percent) of total
Bank Group approvals for 84 operations. The
concessionary ADF window accounted for
UA 2.43 billion (30.1 percent) of all approvals for 77 operations, and the Nigeria Trust
Fund (NTF) accounted for UA 5.7 million (0.1
percent) for 3 operations (1 project loan and
2 approvals for HIPC debt relief). Special funds
accounted for UA 27.8 million (0.3 percent)
of total approvals.

inued to reflect the priorities of its Mediumerm Strategy (2008-2012). The two sectors
hat benefited the most were infrastructure
with an allocation of UA 3.91 billion (52.1
percent), and multisector with UA 2.19 billion
(29.1 percent) (see Figure 0.1). These two sec‘ors accounted for 81.2 percent of total loans
and grants. The third largest beneficiary sector
was finance, with an allocation of UA 808.4
million (10.8 percent), mostly in the form of
Lines of Credit (LOCs) to mitigate the adverse
effects of the global financial crisis on RMCs'
inancial sectors.

he approval of UA 3.91 billion for infrastrucure in 2009, compared to UA 1.41 billion
in 2008, represents an increase of 177.3
percent. Of the infrastructure subsectors,
power supply received the largest allocation
(57.2 percent), followed by transportation
(33.1 percent), water supply and sanitation
(7.6 percent), and communications (2.2 percent). Targeting infrastructure demonstrates
the Bank's selectivity toward high-impact
projects that will improve the investment
climate for private sector development,
enhance competitiveness and productivity,
increase employment, and support sustainable economic growth.

 

In 2009 Bank Group loan and grant approvals for the 5 subregions (including multinationals) amounted to UA 7.51 billion,
compared to UA 3.17 billion in 2008 — an
increase of 136.9 percent. These were allocated as follows: Southern Africa, UA 3.40
billion (45.2 percent); West Africa, UA 1.24
billion (16.6 percent); North Africa, UA 1.05
billion (14.0 percent); East Africa, UA 515.6
million (6.9 percent); Central Africa, UA 274.9
million (3.7 percent); and multinationals, UA
1.03 billion (13.7 percent) (see Annex II-7).

African Development Bank (ADB)

In 2009 total approvals from the nonconcessional ADB window amounted to UA 5.60
billion for 84 operations, compared to UA
1.81 billon in 2008 for 58 operations, representing an increase of 209.4 percent. This
large increase was mainly due to an upsurge
in both project-lending and policy-based
loans. Project-lending, comprising public
and publicly guaranteed loans, and private
sector approvals (including private equity
and private guarantees), increased by 155.8
percent, from UA 1.54 billion in 2008 to UA
3.94 billion in 2009. Policy-based lending
also rose to UA 1.52 billion in 2009, from UA
136.4 million in 2008. This dramatic rise was
mainly the result of the 2 budget supportloans: to Botswana (UA 969.0 million) and
Mauritius (UA 437.3 million).

The other financing instruments include
grants, which rose to the level of UA 25.1
million in 2009, from UA 13.6 million in
2008 (84.6 percent increase); the allocation
for HIPC debt relief, which declined marginally from UA 113.8 million in 2008 to UA
12.8 million in 2009; and public guarantees
amounting to UA 6.2 million. The share of
he various financing instruments in the ADB
otal approvals in the year were as follows:
project lending: 70.3 percent; policy-based
lending: 27.2 percent; HIPC debt relief: 2.0
ercent; and grants: 0.4 percent.

n 2009 private sector operations totaled UA
.16 billion compared to UA 901.2 million
in 2008, an increase of 28.7 percent. The
inancial instruments consisted of project
loans and LOCs amounting to UA 1.01 bilion; private equity, UA 142.5 million; and
rivate guarantees of UA 5.3 million. The private sector approvals in 2009 represent 20.5
ercent of ADB approvals and 14.3 percent
of Bank Group total approvals. While the
roject loans in general aimed to accelerate
economic growth and reduce poverty, the
LOCs sought to deepen domestic financial
markets by supporting access to finance for
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). In
addition, private sector operations in many
sizeable multinational projects and programs
were intended to enhance economic cooperation and regional integration among RMCs.
The three notable multinational operations
approved during the year were: the Global
Trade Liquidity Program (GTLP) (UA 322.1
million), the Main One Cable System-Phase |
Project (UA 44.1 million), and the Emerging
Africa Infrastructure Fund (UA 33.2 million).

 

Disbursements on ADB loans during the
year totaled UA 2.35 billion, a 223 percent
increase over the UA 727.5 million disbursed
in 2008. Cumulative disbursements (including non-sovereign loans) amounted to UA
20.03 billion. As at end-December 2009, 785

loans amounting to UA 17.55 billion were
ully disbursed, representing 87.6 percent of
cumulative disbursements.

African Development Fund (ADF)

n 2009 approvals from the concessionary ADF window (comprising loans, grants,
roject preparation facility, debt and debt
service reduction, and loan reallocations) rose
0 UA 2.43 billion, from UA 1.67 billion in
2008 — an increase of 45.5 percent. ADF loan
and grant approvals increased from UA 1.65
illion in 2008 to UA 2.16 billion in 2009,
constituting a rise of 30.9 percent over the
revious year. The main beneficiary sectors in
2009 were infrastructure, at UA 1.38 billion
63.8 percent) and multisector at UA 530.5
million (24.5 percent). This is aligned to the
Bank's operational priority sectors, which
include infrastructure and governance, as
high-impact areas of intervention.

With respect to financing instruments, ADF
roject lending in 2009 increased 39.6 percent over the previous year. On the other
and, policy-based lending (financing sector
activities and budget support) declined from
UA 413.0 million in 2008 to UA 349.2 milion in 2009. Overall, approvals for project
and policy-based lending by the Fund rose
y 19.3 percent from UA 1.09 billion in 2008
0 UA 1.30 billion in 2009.

At the end of 2009, ADF disbursements of
loans and grants amounted to UA 1.73 bilion, compared to UA 1.13 billion in 2008 —
an increase of 53.1 percent. Cumulative disursements at end-December 2009 amounted to UA 13.61 billion. A total of 1,583 loans
and grants were fully disbursed, totaling UA
0.67 billion and representing 78.4 percent
of cumulative disbursements.

 

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)

n 2009 one loan amounting to UA 5.0 milion was approved for The Gambia under this
window. In addition, UA 0.7 million for debt
relief under the HIPC initiative was approved
or Burundi and Togo.

 

Disbursements from the NTF window
decreased from UA 8.45 million in 2008
to UA 4.87 million in 2009, a decline of
42.4 percent. This was due to the absence
of loan approvals during 2007 and 2008
from the window. As at end-December 2009,
cumulative disbursements amounted to UA
221.69 million. Altogether, 60 loans amounting to UA 204.30 million were fully disbursed,
representing 92.15 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

Institutional Reforms and
Development Effectiveness

The implementation of institutional reforms
in 2009 has: (i) strengthened the linkage
between institutional priorities and resource
allocation; (ii) enhanced institutional budget
flexibility through increased fungibility and
devolved authority; (iii) reinforced the new
accountability and performance framework
by linking deliverables to Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs); and (iv) introduced a consolidated, multi-year programming and
budgeting framework. The institutional
reforms include the following: enhanced
corporate services delivery, budget reforms,
increased decentralization and improved
operations business processes, which are
discussed individually below.

Corporate Performance Monitoring: In 2009
in accordance with the 2008-2012 MediumTerm Strategy (MTS), the Bank established
and filled the position of Chief Operating
Officer (COO). The role of the COO is multifaceted, including: ensuring overall coherence and coordination across Complexes; the
alignment of resources in conformity with
strategic priorities; and enhanced monitoring and management of corporate performance. The Bank also strengthened the role
of the Senior Management Coordinating
Committee (SMCC) and the Operations
Committee (OpsCom).

Budget Reforms: The Bank has given

Managers more flexibility in the use of
their budgets in order to maximize cost
Annual Report 2009effectiveness. It has also allowed them
discretion to change the mix of inputs as
hey consider appropriate, instead of having
(0 justify their decisions and seek approval
rom Senior Management. Performance and
efficiency indicators have been developed at
institutional and Complex levels, and per‘ormance monitoring now represents the
central tool for enforcing accountability. The
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were used
‘0 monitor institutional effectiveness in 2009
y comparing targets to results.

Decentralization: In order to strengthen
he Bank's presence in the RMCs, 26 Field
Offices (FOs), including a Regional Office
(RO) in South Africa, were established by
year-end 2009. However, only 23 of these
FOs were fully staffed and functioning by
his date. The other 3 are now operational but not fully functioning. Following the
implementation strategy proposed by a
Presidential Working Group in 2008, the
Bank established a Task Force to formulate
a decentralization road map. The recommendations of this Task Force will be presented
o the Boards of Directors in 2010.

 

Operations Business Processes: The outcomes of the Operations Business Processes
Reforms include enhanced cross-Complex
coordination, empowered country teams,
and streamlined processes for greater straegic alignment and delivery. In 2009 a
comprehensive revision of the Delegation
of Authority Matrix was carried out. Within
his framework, Field Officers now have delegated authority to handle loan negotiations,
signature, loan administration, portfolio management, project supervision, and dialogue
and communication with RMCs and partners.

 

Knowledge Management

and Development

In 2009, the Bank enhanced its visibility
and mainstreamed intellectual capacity into
its operations within the framework of the
Knowledge Management and Development
(KMD) Strategy (2008-2012). During the

Annual Report 2009

year, the Bank continued to play an active
role in the Committee of Ten Ministers of
Finance and Central Bank Governors (the
C-10), which had been set up to monitor the impact of the global financial crisis and to coordinate Africa's response at
various levels. The principles of selectivity,
relevance, value added, partnership, and
cost effectiveness continued to guide the
Bank's knowledge activities. The operational
experience in the Bank also contributed to
knowledge generation through closer interaction across all departments and units, and
through lessons learned from Economic and
Sector Work (ESW) and Project Completion
Reports (PCRs).

Capacity Development and Training: The
final draft of the Capacity Development
Strategy was discussed in December 2009
at the CODE meeting, pending approval
by the Boards in January 2010. In 2009,
the Bank organized a series of workshops
in order to enhance development impact
in Bank-funded projects. These included
16 Development Management Training
Workshops for 745 RMC policymakers in
different key areas, namely: Public Financial
Management, Good Governance, Trade
Negotiation and Regulation, PerformanceBased Allocation, Public—Private Partnerships,
and the Global Financial Crisis.

Eminent Speakers: Four renowned personalities were invited under the Eminent
Speakers’ Program to share their knowledge and experiences on the development
challenges facing the continent. Professor
Ha-Joon Chang of Cambridge University
spoke on the “Economic History of the
Developed Worlds: Lessons for Africa”;
Professor Jacques Attali, President of PlaNet
Finance, made a presentation on “Financial
Crisis and the Role of Microfinance”; Dr.
Sadako Ogata, President of the Japan
International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
spoke on “Peace and Development in
Africa: Upholding the Conditions”; and the
fourth speaker, Nobel Laureate, Professor

Wangari Maathai, made a presentation on
“Natural Resource Management and Poverty
Reduction: Strengthening the Links.”

Statistical Support Activities: The Bank's statistical support to RMCs in 2009 focused on
the following areas: (i) improving operational effectiveness and financial services; (ii)
strengthening statistical capacity and systems in RMCs; and (iii) enhancing the development, management, and dissemination
of development statistics on Africa through
statistical publications and the online data
access portal. The statistical support to RMCs
is guided by the Bank's commitment to the
Results Agenda for Operational Effectiveness.

Support to
Middle-Income Countries
Bank Group’s approved operations for middle-income countries (MICs) in 2009 (excluding multinational projects/programs) rose to
an unprecedented level of UA 4.35 billion.
This was in response to the financial crisis
and high demand for Bank Group resources.
This represents a 291.9 percent increase,
compared to UA 1.11 billion approved for
operations in MICs in 2008. In light of their
relative integration into global financial markets, their close trade links with the rest of
the world, as well as the tight funding conditions, MICs in Africa — as in other continents
—were hard-hit by the global financial crisis.
Consequently, the MICs turned to the Bank
as their preferred partner to financing some
of their investments.

In terms of its sectoral focus for MICs, infrastructure remained the top priority with a
54.2 percent share, followed by multisector at 37.2 percent. This is consistent with
the Bank's Medium-Term Strategy (20082012). The geographical distribution of the
MICs’ financing program in 2009 recorded a major shift. Departing from the pattern of the previous 6 years, Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA) received the largest proportion of approvals in terms of value (78.2
percent) compared with North Africa (21.8ercent). This shift can be explained by 2
jarge loans approved for South Africa (UA
.73 billion for the Medupi Power Project)
and Botswana (UA 969.0 million for the
Economic Diversification Support Loan). In
erms of financing instruments, project lending was the major financing vehicle in 2009,
accounting for 65.3 percent of total approvals for MIC operations, while policy-based
ending represented 34.1 percent.

Support to Fragile States

n 2009, the economic performance of
he African fragile states was also negatively affected by the global financial crisis.
Falling export earnings and declining capital inflows caused serious deterioration in
he balance of payments and fiscal difficulties for many countries. The accompanying
exchange rate volatilities and job losses also
resulted in the decline of per capita income
y more than 50 percent of forecasts in
some countries.

he global financial and economic crisis
undermined gains from economic reforms
and advances made in the fight against
overty in most fragile states. In response to
he crisis, the Bank approved UA 364.8 milion from the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to
inance 12 operations in 7 countries, namely
Central African Republic, Comoros, Cote
d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
and Togo.

 

The 2010 Administrative Expenses
and Capital Expenditure Budgets

In December 2009, the ADB Board of Directors
approved an Administrative Expenses and
Capital Expenditure Budget for 2010 comprised as follows: Administrative Expenses
of UA 264.0 million, a Capital Expenditure of
UA 28.8 million, and a contingency budget
of UA 2.6 million. The ADF Board of Directors
approved an indicative Administrative Budget
of UA 187.9 million for the Fund for the financial year ending December 31, 2010.

Net Income Allocation

The 2009 financial statements of the Bank
Group highlight the robustness of the Bank's
financial position, manifested in the combined net income before transfers approved
by the Boards of Governors of UA 239.05
million and an allocable income of UA
246.64 million.

The ratings agencies Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+
rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debt, respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
the Bank's strong membership support, its
preferred creditor status, sound capital adequacy, and prudent financial management
guidelines and policies.

Borrowings

The 2009 funding program in capital markets was initially approved for a maximum
amount of UA 2.50 billion. In July 2009, the
Board approved an increase of the amount
to be funded in the capital market by UA
3.90 billion, to a maximum of UA 6.40 billion, in response to the rapid increase in the
Bank's operations.

The Bank used various markets and instruments to meet its borrowing requirements
in 2009, which were guided by the pace of
disbursements. Overall the Bank raised UA
5.14 billion in 2009 and as at December 31,
2009, the outstanding borrowing portfolio of
the Bank stood at UA 10.58 billion.

Non-Voting Callable

Capital Increase

During the year ending December 31, 2009,
the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal
made by Canada and the Republic of Korea
offering to subscribe temporarily to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank
for the amounts of US$ 2.6 billion and US$
306.0 million respectively. On December
24, 2009 the Board of Directors submitted
the proposal to the Board of Governors for
consideration.

meetings and events. The main objective of
the seminars was to facilitate an exchange

about 2,030 participants, including Bank
Governors, Alternate Governors and delegates, members of the Boards of Directors,
development partners, ADB staff, members
of civil society, and observers.

The theme of the plenary session of the
Ministerial Roundtable “Africa and the

informed by the prevalent global financial
situation which was affecting the driv
ers of Africa's economic growth, including
prices and demand for primary commodities, capital flows, and regional integration.
The Roundtable noted that comprehensive
and coordinated actions at various levels of
response to the crisis were required to prevent African countries from sliding back into
economic stagnation and deepening poverty.

Present at the plenary session of the
Ministerial Roundtable were His Excellencies
Blaise Compaoré, President of the Republic of
Burkina Faso and Abdoulaye Wade, President
of the Republic of Senegal who delivered
the keynote address. The session was jointly
chaired by Dr. Donald Kaberuka, President
of the African Development Bank (AfDB)
Group and Mr. Abdoulie Janneh, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA). The High-Level Seminars took as their themes: (i) The
Global Financial Crisis and Fragile States in
Africa; (ii) Financial Crisis, Trade and Regional
Integration in Africa; (iii) Financial Crisis and
Decades of Reforms: Options for Africa's
Future; and (iv) The Financial Crisis and
Access to Financing.

The Annual Meetings were preceded by other
events, including meetings of the subsidiary
organs of the Boards of Governors; a presentation of the 2008 African Development
Report; as well as seminars which focused
on the following themes: (i) The Challenges
of Food Security in Africa and the Responses
of International Institutions; (ii) The
Strategic Role of Procurement in Improving
Performance and Development Effectiveness;
(iii) Joint IFl Action Plan for Private Sector in
Africa — Response to the Financial Crisis; and

Crisis: An Agenda for Action," given the serious negative impact of the global economic
downturn on the economies of the Bank's
regional member countries. He urged the
Bank's development partners to strengthen
their development assistance to Africa, particularly to the poorest countries, by increasing resources earmarked for concessional
lending, and to deliver on their promises in
relation to development aid for growth as
well as poverty reduction. He also appealed
to member countries to continue their pursuit
of good governance and macroeconomic
stability in order to create an environment
conducive to foreign direct investment.

In his opening statement, Dr. Donald

and people of Senegal for hosting the 2009

Addressing the current financial crisis and
its negative impact on African economies,

was a considerable challenge to growth. In
is presentation, he expressed optimism
in the long-term prospects for the continent, owing to its resilience and its capacity to withstand the effects of the crisis.
He emphasized that the Bank and other
inancial partner institutions would increase
resources, optimize and innovate the policy
and operational frameworks, and strive to
complement one another, while striking a
alance between short-term crisis responses
and longer-term structural concerns. The
President pointed out that in the prevailing
circumstances, any solution to the global

crisis that excluded Africa would not stand
the test of time. He proposed some practical
steps for addressing the situation, including:
(i) strengthening ADF by frontloading and
accelerating resource transfers; (ii) according renewed urgency to the Paris Declaration
and the Accra Agenda for Action; (iii) closing the gap between the Declaration and
implementation; and (iv) reinforcing country
ownership and a meaningful division of labor
etween bilateral partners and International
Finance Institutions (IFls), and among the
Fls themselves.

he President welcomed the G20 decision to
review the capital requirements of Regional
Development Banks (RDBs), including the
ADB. In this context, he noted that a General
Capital Increase would enable the Bank to:
contribute more to ADF and develop new iniiatives; optimize its strong capital base and
do more in low-income countries, including
tagile states; scale up support to private secor operations and enclave projects; increase
rade finance; and enhance guarantees.

 

Speaking on the status of the Bank’s finances, the President noted that even though
2008 had proved an exceptionally challenging year for any institution active in the financial markets, the Bank had fared well owing
to its prudent and proactive financial and risk
management policies. From the operational
point of view, the President noted that the
Bank Group was continuing to focus on its
core areas such as infrastructure, private sector development, and regional integration.
He highlighted the Bank Group's progress
in implementing the Fragile States Facility
(FSF) and addressing the evolving situation
in Zimbabwe.

 

In his statement, the President of the African
Union Commission, H.E. Jean Ping, commended the Bank for its timely and well
considered responses to the negative impact
of the current global financial crisis on RMCs.
He urged the international community to join
forces in combating poverty and the delete

rious impacts of the global financial crisis,
and to support the poorest African countries
y supplementing the resources of the ADF.

n his intervention, the President of Senegal,
H.E. Abdoulaye Wade, thanked the Bank for
accepting his country's invitation to host the
2009 Annual Meetings in Dakar, Senegal.
He considered the theme of the meetings,
“Africa and the Financial Crisis: An Agenda
or Action,” appropriate because of the serious negative impact of the crisis on African
countries. He called for an equitable and
fair global economic order to address the
inancial crisis and invited African countries
to explore alternative financing mechanisms, rather than relying on external aid.
n addition, President Wade called for unity
within the continent. He stressed the need
to bolster South-South cooperation as a
way of promoting African development and
urged African leaders to actively foster new
alignments. He declared the 2009 Annual
Meetings open and wished the Governors
success in their deliberations.

 

 

 

Governors’ Statements

The Governors expressed their appreciation to
the Government and people of the Republic
of Senegal for their warm hospitality and for
the facilities provided at the Annual Meetings.
They commended the coordinated action of
the international community in finding solutions to the global financial crisis. They lauded
the African Development Bank for launching
timely response initiatives, namely, the African
Liquidity Facility, the Trade Finance Initiative,
and the Action Plan for accelerated transfer of
resources to the poorest countries, all aimed
at enabling RMCs to withstand the negative
effects of external shocks.

The Governors noted that the major challenge facing the continent was how to sustain the economic progress that many African
countries had achieved over the previous five
years. They proposed a number of measures,
including the following: (i) an increase in
concessional resources by development part
Annual Report 2009

ners; (ii) increased foreign direct investments;
(iii) ownership of operational strategies by
the member countries; (iv) diversification of
African economies; and (v) private sector
development.

They commended the Bank for improvements
in its operations, its focus on infrastructure,
regional integration, governance and fragile
states, and for scaling-up its support to private sector operations in low-income countries. They called for selectivity in the Bank’s
interventions, a strategic assessment of the
skills mix, the focus on the right balance of
staff between the Headquarters and Field
Offices (FOs), and the clear definition and
delineation of their respective roles.

n addition, the Governors expressed satisfaction with the Bank's speedy response
© the crisis in Zimbabwe and urged for the
ormulation of proposals to further support
economic reform and stabilization. Looking
ahead, they invited the Bank to focus on
he Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
the threat posed by climate change, the
Gender Action Plan, increased support for
ragile states, and enhanced results delivery, through appropriate deployment of the
Bank’s human and financial resources.

he Governors proposed that the Bank
should: (i) explore innovative and flexible
ways to deploy unutilized ADF funds within
he existing frameworks; (ii) further strengthen its partnerships with other development
institutions; (iii) pay closer attention to the
integration of cross-cutting issues into policies and programs; and (iv) strengthen good
governance and enhance transparency by
improving information disclosure and internal controls.

 

The Governors welcomed and congratulated the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg on
its accession to the Agreement establishing the African Development Bank, which
paved the way for its full membership of
the Bank Group.

Governors’ Resolutions

During the Annual Meetings, the Boards of
Governors reviewed and adopted a range

BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

The Bank was confronted by the twin challenges of carrying out its mandate of reducing poverty and at the same time responding to the adverse effects of the economic
crisis and its impact on economic growth in
many RMCs. In response, the Boards put in
place appropriate financial instruments, in
addition to considering various policies, programs, and strategies that would enable the
Bank to carry on with its regular operations.
Notable initiatives approved by the Boards in
2009 were the establishment of the UA 0.96
billion (US$ 1.5 billion) Emergency Liquidity
Facility (ELF) and the UA 0.64 billion (US$
1.0 billion) Trade Finance Initiative (TFI), and

jointly with other development partners, the
Global Trade Liquidity Program (GTLP).

Enhancing Development
Effectiveness and Results

In carrying out its activities in 2009 in the
face of the global economic crisis, the Boards
continued to provide policy guidance on
the implementation of the Bank's MediumTerm Strategy (2008-2012). This took as
its focus poverty reduction and greater
selectivity in investing in its core priority
areas of infrastructure, governance, private
sector operations, and higher education,
science and technology. The Boards were
also involved in the ongoing discussions
for the Twelfth Replenishment of the ADF
(ADF-XII) and the Sixth General Capital
Increase (GCI-VI) of the Bank.

During 2009 the Boards of Directors of the
Bank Group held a total of 44 formal meetings, 25 informal meetings, and 5 seminars.
They approved 54 key policies, strategies, and
guidelines aimed at enhancing the Bank's
development effectiveness and results. The
Boards approved loans, grants, public and
private guarantees for sovereign loans, private
equity participations, loan reallocation, special

fund allocations, and HIPC debt relief projects
totaling UA 8.06 billion. Overall, the Boards
approved 13 Results-Based Country Strategy
Papers, 24 Country Portfolio Reviews, 4 HIPC
documents, 17 Humanitarian Emergency
Assistance grants for RMCs, and 1 proposal
for clearing Cote d'lvoire’s arrears.

Economic Outlook for Africa and the Role of the BankChapter 002 Overview of the Macroeconomic Situation and Outlook for Africa

This chapter provides a macroeconomic review of Africa and the outlook for the short- and medium-term. It first presents a brief overview
of the performance of Africa’s economies during 2009, focusing on the impact of the global financial and economic crises and on the
Bank’s response. This is followed by some perspectives on the medium-term outlook for Africa and the role of the Bank during that period,
to support its RMCs and set their economics back on a sustainable growth path.

OVERVIEW OF

THE MACROECONOMIC
SITUATION

At the beginning of the global financial crisis in late 2008, it was generally believed
that Africa would not be seriously affected
in view of its limited integration in the global financial market. Indeed, the first-round
effects were minimal, although not all countries were immune. South Africa and other
emerging economies in North, East, and
West Africa which were more exposed to the
global financial market, experienced “sudden stops” of capital flows, with declines
in stock market indices and the profitabil
 

a - Macroeconomic Indicato

ity of banks, including an increase in nonperforming assets. By early 2009 the worst
effects of the crisis were unfolding throughout Africa as trade, capital flows, tourism,
and commodity prices fell victim to the global
downturn. Policymakers were faced with the
question of how to mitigate the longer-term
impact of the crisis while preserving the
continent's robust economic performance
achieved over the previous decade.

At the macroeconomic level, the crisis deepened, but with varied impact across Africa.
Overall, real GDP growth in Africa in 2009
was estimated at 2.5 percent, less than half

1990-2009

 

the pre-crisis rate, resulting in the first decline
in real GDP per capita for the continent in a
decade (see Table 2.1). The worst-affected
countries were the emerging RMCs, including frontier markets such as South Africa and
the Seychelles, and resource-rich countries
such as Angola and Botswana. By contrast,
resource-poor or landlocked countries in East
and West Africa have weathered the global
downturn better. In addition, as a result of
the crisis, Africa lost between 30-50 percent of its 2008 export revenues in 2009.
Despite some relief on import bills due to
falling food and oil prices, the overall trade
balance deteriorated significantly. The con

of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2008 to a deficit
of 2.9 percent in 2009, a drop of 6.7 percentage points. Furthermore, the decline in
export revenues, remittances and in a few
instances aid, exerted a downward pressure
on exchange rates.

Similarly, the continent's fiscal balance worsened, as a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP in
2008 turned into a deficit of 4.4 percent in
2009 (see Table 2.1). Fiscal space was particularly affected through revenue losses and
automatic stabilizers associated with slower
economic activity.A more detailed analysis of
the macroeconomic situation and outlook for
Africa can be found in the African Economic
Outlook, 2009/2010 edition.

management on the part of African governments, as well as the effects of lower prices

as a percentage of exports also increased
from 5.2 percent in 2008 to 7.5 percent in
2009 (see Table 2.1).

The impact of the crisis on African economies varied considerably across subregions
and countries, as shown in Table 2.2. The
severity and impact of the global economic
crisis resulted in lower real GDP growth in
2009 compared to 2008 in all subregions,
underscoring its widespread ripple effects.
The East Africa subregion recorded a growth
rate in real GDP of 5.8 percent, maintaining
its ranking as the fastest-growing subregion
on the continent since 2005. This was mainly
due to accelerated growth rates in Ethiopia,
Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda during this
period. However, compared to 2008, growth
in East Africa decelerated by 1.4 percentage points in 2009. Of all the subregions,
Southern Africa has been the hardest hit.

rate of 1.1 percent in 2009, compared to a
positive growth rate of 5.4 percent in 2008.
The significant decline in economic activity in
South Africa, Botswana, and Angola resulted
ina 6.7 percent fall in GDP per capita from
US$ 2,787 in 2008 to US$ 2,599 in 2009.
Similarly, West Africa's robust growth of 5.5
percent in 2008 declined to 3.0 percent in
2009. Central Africa and North Africa also
experienced lower GDP growth rates of 1.7
percent and 3.8 percent in 2009, compared
to 4.8 percent and 5.3 percent respectively
in 2008.

East Africa's relatively better growth came
at a price. Inflation rose to double-digits in
the subregion in 2009 — almost twice the
continental average — while in other subregions inflation was in single digits, except
for Central Africa, which almost equaled the
continental average. Understandably, fiscal
and trade balance deteriorated markedly
in all subregions, with the fiscal imbalance
more pronounced in Southern Africa and
West Africa. A decline in trade balance was
evident in East Africa and North Africa.

 

The Global Economic

Crisis and the Bank Group’s
Response

With hindsight, it is clear that the Bank’s early mobilization of its knowledge resources,
together with its engagement with RMCs
and other regional bodies such as the
African Union Commission (AUC) and the
United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (UNECA), proved to be an effective
strategy for offsetting and also monitoring the effects of the crisis. It also provided
the partners with a platform to strategically
develop and coordinate Africa's response at
various levels. The Committee of Ten (C-10)
African Ministers of Finance and Central
Bank Governors, which had been established in Tunis in November 2008, became an
important African forum and voice. This consultative process fed directly into important
global processes such as the G-20. It benefited from the Bank's in-depth analysis of

Annual Report 2009

key issues that inform policymaking in Africa.
The IME the World Bank, the AfDB, and other
multilateral institutions were called upon to
provide flexible financial instruments in support of countercyclical actions, and to ensure
pro-growth policies that enhance diversification and competitiveness.

The strategic measures that were adopted
were additionally intended to reposition the
continent in order that it might avail itself of
any opportunities that might emerge from
the crisis. For example, cofinancing arrangements with other cooperating partners were
concluded, as in the case of the Global Trade
Liquidity Program (GTLP) administered by
the IFC (of the World Bank), to ensure that
trade finance would continue to flow into
Africa. In addition, the Bank galvanized both
African and international opinion in addressing the crisis. The Bank’s adoption of flexible
responses to the crisis, which comprised the
frontloading of resources and restructuring
projects to deliver resources where they were
most needed, also proved to be very successful. This was done through the establishment of the US$ 1.5 billion (UA 0.96 billion)
Emergency Liquidity Facility (ELF) and a US$
1.0 billion (UA 0.64 billion) Trade Finance
Initiative (TFI), approved by the Boards on
March 4, 2009.

The commendable outcomes at the Bank's
operational level were due to an increase in
the volume of private sector operations, from
UA 901.2 million in 2008 to UA 1.16 billion
by end-2009, well above the pre-crisis target. Public sector operations also increased.
By the end of 2009, the Bank had financed
over UA 6.92 billion worth of public sector
projects, including UA 4.35 billion directed at
MICs. This represents more than a threefold
increase over the 2008 approvals level. In
addition, the ADF delivered UA 2.43 billion
during 2009, characterized by substantial
frontloading of resources to RMCs.

Consistent with the scaling-up in the volume
and number of instruments of development

assistance, the Bank enhanced its capacity
and systems in order to maintain the highest standards of corporate governance and
integrity in executing its mandate. In 2009
the Bank raised over UA 5.14 billion (over
US$ 7.5 billion equivalent) from the capital
markets. In spite of these achievements, the
increasing demand for financing from RMCs
has demonstrated the inadequacy of the current resource envelope. This, coupled with
the financial crisis, has resulted in the Bank
initiating steps for an early General Capital
Increase (GCI-VI) during 2009 to help meet
the exceptional demand emanating from
its RMCs.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR
AFRICA AND THE ROLE OF
THE BANK

Africa's economic outlook for 2010 has
improved, but not substantially. Because of
the anticipated global recovery and domestic
policy responses, Africa's real GDP growth
is projected to reach 4.5 percent and 5.2
percent in 2010 and 2011 respectively, still
well below the growth rates of the pre-crisis
years. For 2009, inflation is estimated at 9.9
percent and the projection is that this will
decline to 7.7 percent in 2010 and 7.0 percent in 2011 (see Table 2.3).

On the basis of the expected continuous

by measures to establish social safety-nets

population. Private sector development is a
key medium-term challenge, one that should
provide a basis for greater diversified growth

sectors and a high share of foreign ownership have taken steps to protect domestic
banks from the impact of the financial crisis. As in other emerging market economies,
cooperation in the areas of regulation, financial supervision, and crisis prevention within
he financial sector are critically important in
Africa. Greater financial literacy for all market participants also needs to be promoted,
particularly awareness of the risks associated
with various forms of loans.

of the financial crisis, which has left many

he demand for Bank lending is projected to
remain high in the medium to long term, due
to a combination of two important factors.
First, while the continent was recording high
growth rates before the crisis, these were
insufficient to make a significant contribuion toward attaining the MDGs. Second, the
Bank has established itself as a partner of
choice for RMCs. It is important to note that
African countries have substantially improved
heir macroeconomic management capacity
and transparency and so are better placed to
absorb increased levels of external inflows.
he Bank will therefore need to operate at
higher levels of funding than before the crisis,
but this will only be possible with a major
scaling-up of its resources. It is in recognition of these special circumstances that the
Bank has initiated the process of the Sixth

Twelfth Replenishment of the ADF.

During 2009 the implementation of the Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012) underscored the selectivity of Bank Group operations, emphasizing the core areas, namely, infrastructure, private sector development, governance, higher education, science and technology. By focusing
on these areas, the Bank seeks to contribute toward the broader development objectives of agriculture and food security, human development, regional integration, and meeting the special needs of fragile states and middle-income countries. At the same time, the cross-cutting
issues of gender, environment, and climate change continued to be mainstreamed into areas of the Bank's operations. Looking inward,
the institution sustained its drive for institutional reforms to strengthen its internal capacity and business processes in order to maximize

the development effectiveness of its operations. In a

dition, resource mobilization was pursued through the ADF-XI Mid-Term Review; the

launching of the ADF-XII Replenishment consultations, and the negotiations for the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI). The Bank also

focused on partnership and cooperation activities wi

INTRODUCTION

Bank Group operations at end-December
2009 stood at UA 8.06 billion, which is more
than twice the 2008 level of UA 3.53 billion.
Bank Group support was tailored to countryspecific needs, and covered areas such as
budget support and trade finance, through
the newly established Emergency Liquidity
Facility (ELF), the Trade Finance Initiative (TFl),
and the development of key private sector
infrastructure projects.

While focusing on the short-term challenges
emanating from the global financial crisis,
the Bank, throughout 2009, continued to be
guided by the overarching goals of poverty
reduction and sustainable economic growth.
In this regard, the Bank continued to implement its Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) 20082012, emphasizing the need for selectivity in
its operations and focusing, at the sectoral
level, on the core operational priority areas,
namely, infrastructure, governance, private
sector operations, and higher education, science and technology. By focusing on these
core areas, the Bank sought to underpin the
broader development objectives of agriculture development and food security, human
development, regional integration, and the
special needs of the fragile states and middleincome countries (MICs). At the same time,
the Bank has improved the mainstreaming
of the cross-cutting issues of gender, environment, and climate change into its areas
of operations. In all its activities, the Bank
maintains its commitment to strengthening

Annual Report 2009

development effectiveness and results, and
to more systematic reporting on performance.

Notwithstanding the significant growth
in Bank Group operations during the year,
the Bank continued to face challenges in
some areas. These included: slow disbursements of loans, poor performance of some
of the RMCs’ portfolios, poor project quality-at-entry, and a high proportion of problem projects. The Bank has continued to
build its knowledge base through development research and Economic and Sector
Work (ESW). The accumulated lessons of
experience and best practice, which have
accrued from Bank Group operations in various countries, contribute to its knowledgebase and serve to inform future projects
and programs. Some of this knowledge is
collated by the Bank through reviews of
Project Completion Reports (PCRs).

 

DEVELOPMENT
EFFECTIVENESS
AND MANAGING FOR
RESULTS

During the year, the Bank continued to
strengthen its operational development effectiveness and results through an enhanced
Results Measurement Framework (RMF) and
the Action Plan on Quality and Results (APQR).
The RMF provided evidence that outputs have
contributed to measurable improvements in
development outcomes across a range of
Bank operations in RMCs.

h other key players in Africa’s development agenda.

Results Measurement
Framework: The
Contribution of Operations
to Results

Progress on Country Outcomes

In measuring the progress of ADF countries
towards high-level development results during ADF-XI, 19 country outcome indicators
were considered. These outcomes are the
result of collective action by multiple development actors over time and are aligned to
the Bank's operational priorities as summarized in the MTS (2008-2012). The country
outcomes and results revealed the following:

e Real economic growth was strong
(around 4 percent per annum) in ADF
countries, exceeding growth in African
MICs.

e ADF countries’ governance records
remain weak.

¢ The commodity boom, along with food
and fuel price increases, helped raise
Africa's share of global trade to more
than 3 percent, although the share of
intra-African trade registered only a modest rise. Steady improvement in business
climate indicators is evident (20-30 percent decline in the time and cost of business start-ups). This new development is
likely to raise Africa’s global standing if
reforms are deepened and accelerated.

© On infrastructure development, there is
evidence of slow improvements in access
to safe water and continued rapid growth
of ICT in some low-income RMCs.The Bank's Contribution to

Results on the Ground

During 2009 an assessment of outputs and
outcomes of all exiting ADF operations over
the previous 3 years (2006-2008) was undertaken. The assessment indicated the following:

¢ Animproved capacity to track outputs
and outcomes in 2009 through comprehensive PCRs (72 percent of all 20062008 PCRs were available);

© Good record of delivery of planned outputs, with nearly 75 percent of all output indicators achieved or surpassing
expectations;

¢ Significant evidence that outputs have
contributed to measurable improvements
in development outcomes across a range
of ADF priorities;

¢ Animprovement in the share of operations with satisfactory outcomes through
better quality-at-entry status and higher
effective implementation; and

e A need to improve the outcomes for
larger operations through more detailed
analysis.

The Bank successfully validated outputs and
outcomes for 98 percent of the 112 operations covered during the period 2006-2008,
drawing on their PCRs. Improved PCR coverage has facilitated the Bank’s growing
focus on results reporting. Overall, there is
ample evidence that ADF’s operations have
contributed to development results, whether
in the form of irrigation systems that lead to
higher crop yields, microfinance loans that
increase household incomes, or regional integration projects that provide more affordable access to energy.

Further, in 2009 the Bank undertook the
measurement of the effectiveness of infrastructure and regional integration projects
over the 2006-2008 period. The results
show improvements in the following areas:
(i) access of goods to markets due to better
roads; (ii) provision and generation of power
in rural areas and villages; and (iii) health

standards through better hygiene and clean
water. Over the same period, results indicate
that economic growth in the agricultural
sector is about four times more effective in
raising the income of extremely poor households than economic growth in other sectors.
Similarly, there is evidence of an emerging
vibrant private sector in ADF countries. The
share of ADF countries benefiting from private sector approvals (including regional
integration) increased from 55 percent in
2008 to 60 percent in 2009.

Action Plan for

Quality and Results (APQR)
The Action Plan for Quality and Results
focused on the following 5 areas:

(i) Accelerating Decentralization and
Harmonization for Better Results: By
the end of 2009 the Bank had opened
26 Field Offices across the continent.
The Action Plan calls for a speeding up
of decentralization and the empowering
of FOs by delegating decision-making
authority. Through local recruitment and
the transfer of international staff to
the field, the total of professional staff
based in FOs increased threefold, from
5 percent in 2006 to 15 percent by yearend 2009.

(ii) Enhancing the Quality-at-Entry of
Strategies and Operations: To enhance
quality-at-entry, the Action Plan makes
it simpler to design high-quality strategies and operations and to strengthen the operations review process.
Summary indicators of quality-at-entry
are now moving in the right direction,
with strong progress in the provision
of baseline data, improved timeliness
of budget support, and a reduction in
delays from approval to effectiveness
and first disbursements. For instance,
the percentage of CSPs with satisfactory baseline data increased from 33
percent in 2006 to 60 percent in 2009,
while the quality-at-entry of operations

(iii)

(iv)

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

also improved, from 37 percent to 50
percent over the same period.

Instilling a Results-based Supervision
Culture: The share of operations
supervised at least twice a year has
risen through the use of cost-effective,
field-led missions, aimed at preventing
problem projects. Institutional reforms
were implemented and the delegation
of authority to FOs was established.
Together, these measures have contributed to improved portfolio management. Processes and formats for operations supervision are being updated to
enhance the focus on results.

Enhancing Learning and Accountability
through Evaluation: In December
2008 the Bank updated its completion reporting procedures to ensure
timely and joint report preparation
with the borrower. A new format for
the report was developed and adopted in April 2009, which focuses on
results achieved and lessons learned.
Consequently, performance on the
timely delivery of completion reports
increased from 2 percent in 2007 to
91 percent by year-end 2009.

Improving Data and Systems for Results
Reporting: The Bank's information systems do not currently track operational
progress toward expected results. In
2008 the Bank began to develop a
set of core output and outcome indicators for its main sectors of operation to facilitate the corporate results
reporting process. In 2009 the Bank
developed a prototype of an automated results reporting system, linking
expected results to actual results.

Annual Report 2009

WChapter 003 Operational Priorities

The Bank has addressed several challenges
in respect of operations quality enhancement
during the year. These include:

(i) Improving project quality-at-entry: A
project's quality-at-entry has a strong
influence on the attainment of expected
results. The Bank has initiated a qualityat-entry assessment (called “readiness
review”) aimed at improving the quality
of operations prior to Board approval.

(ii) Requirement for RMCs to submit Project
Completion Reports (PCRs) 6 months
prior to project completion: To improve
quality, value and timeliness, the Bank
has revised its PCR procedures to allow
for the joint Bank/RMC preparation of
the PCR. This will be voluntary once
disbursement reaches 85 percent, while
it becomes mandatory at 98 percent
disbursement.

(iii) High proportion of problem projects: To
reduce the number of problem projects,
the Bank has initiated a supervision
review process to entrench the focus
on development results and promote

Annual Report 2003

evidence-based performance rating.
From 2008 to 2009, problem projects
decreased from 7 percent to 6 percent,
due to increased vigilance on project
restructuring and cancelation.

INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE

Good infrastructure is a prerequisite for a
business-enabling environment, sustainable
economic growth, and hence poverty reduction, which is the primary goal of all Bank
Group operations. Under the MTS, the Bank
seeks to address poverty through its support
to the productive sectors, the success of
which depends on improvements in infrastructure. Indeed, the AfDB considers the lack
of adequate infrastructure as one of the main
constraints threatening the growth momentum in the continent. The negative impact of
the global economic crisis on investments
in infrastructure in Africa is therefore all the
more serious. There has been a withdrawal of
foreign investment; moreover the constraints
in liquidity and credit in the financial markets
have resulted in a scarcity of available funds

 

at reasonable cost, and in the cancelation of
credit lines by some financial institutions. In
order to counterbalance the effects of the
credit crunch, the Bank increased its commitment of resources to the infrastructure
sector from both the ADF and ADB windows.

Approvals for infrastructure projects at endDecember 2009 amounted to UA 3.91 billion,
representing 52.1 percent of all Bank Group
loan and grant approvals for the year — the
argest sectoral allocation. In terms of the
subsector breakdown, power supply received
most funding at 57.2 percent (due primarily
‘0 the UA 1.7 billion Medupi Power Project
in South Africa), followed by transportation
(33.1 percent), and water supply and sanitaion (7.6 percent) (see Figure 3.1).

 

e related cross-border infrastructure operaions supported by the Bank have assisted in
rade facilitation and employment generation,
hereby improving subregional GDP growth,
strengthening the economic fabric of the
countries concerned, and contributing to poverty reduction and equitable development.

57.2%Within the context of infrastructure, the Bank
places a high emphasis on regional networks to promote integrated development
across the continent. Between 2006 and
2009 the ADF financed 28 energy and transportation operations for which UA 373 million was disbursed. Of this, UA 261 million
financed the construction and rehabilitation
of 8,000 km of paved and feeder roads in 20
road projects. For example, the UA 30 million Kicukiro—Kirundo Road Project, linking
Burundi and Rwanda at the Nemba joint border post, halved the transit time between the
2 countries. An additional 120 km of feeder
roads, completed in both countries during
the period, provided an estimated 600,000
rural dwellers with access to market centers.

Access to electricity is critical for socioeconomic growth, including the provision
of high-quality social services. During the
2006-2009 period, 8 energy projects were
funded with a contribution of UA 112 milion from the ADF portfolio. These projects
installed 200 megawatts of generation
capacity, constructed or rehabilitated over
685 distribution substations and transormers, and laid 8,811 km of transmission
ines. The Nigeria—Benin Interconnection
Project, linking the Nigerian electricity grid
to the common grid supplying Benin and
ogo, has optimized the countries’ regional
access to affordable energy. This enabled
the ADF Electrification of 17 Rural Centers
Project to extend the power supply from
7 to 28 rural centers in Benin, thereby
improving the lives of the rural populaion by facilitating the proper conservation
of vaccines in health centers, new school
and street lighting, and internet access for
rural libraries. These have improved school
attendance, popularized evening studying,
and improved teacher and student performance thus reinforcing educational outcomes.
This is one example of how investing in
infrastructure can contribute to socioeconomic development and poverty reduction
in RMCs.

 

 

 

 

Key infrastructure projects approved in 2009
included: (i) national road projects in Burkina
Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, Guinea, Mali,
Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone and
Uganda; (ii) airport projects in Morocco and
Tunisia; and (iii) power projects in Botswana,
Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, South Africa, and
Tunisia. From a regional integration perspective, the Bank approved multinational road
projects for Cameroon—Nigeria, Cameroon—
Gabon, Kenya—Ethiopia and Mozambique—
Malawi-Zambia; as well as international
railroad projects for Tanzania—Rwanda—
Burundi. The profiles of these and other
projects approved in 2009 are presented
at the end of Part 1.

Knowledge development: During 2009
a number of PCRs were produced for infrastructure operations that had contributed
significantly to knowledge accumulation
and best practices. For example, PCRs conducted for the Cotonou—Porto Novo Road
Rehabilitation Project, and the Electrification
of 17 Rural Centers Project in Benin revealed
the need for the following:

(i) Institutional support to develop tools,
including road traffic databanks, for
programming, prioritizing, implementation monitoring, and follow-up;

(ii) Facilitating the efficient utilization of
urban space through competent town
planning, development, and employment of appropriate tools to ensure the
integration of road networks in drawing up town and investment plans, and
programs;

(iii) Specific studies to integrate the urban
dimensions and constraints in infrastructure development, including revisiting the multimodal approach for better
adaptation to the urban context;

(iv) Preference for technically appropriate
options, even though these are more

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

costly at the outset, e.g. adopting
a 3-phase power supply in areas of
significant economic potential and single-phase for areas of low potential
to lower overall cost and accelerate
electrification programs; and

(v) Establishment of a classification of
the localities or sets of localities to be
electrified as an essential step in the
development of a master plan for the
electrification of the whole country.

The Water Initiatives

Water plays a pivotal role in socioeconomic
development, health, and social welfare,
especially for the poor. Accordingly, the
Bank continues to place a very high premium on helping its RMCs to meet the
MDG water and sanitation targets. Bank
support is channeled through its normal
operational windows and through 3 comlementary water initiatives namely: the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI), the Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program (MDWPP), and the African Water
Facility (AWF) (see Box 3.1). At the end of
2009 the Bank's water portfolio comprised
65 water and sanitation interventions in 35
African countries, totaling about UA 1.56
illion, from ADB, ADF, and the RWSS| Trust
Fund, and 57 projects for UA 56.6 million
coming from the AWF.

n 2009 the Bank approved 14 new operaions including: 5 urban and peri-urban
rojects for Cameroon, Congo, Egypt,
Mozambique, and Nigeria; 2 rural projects
or Rwanda and Senegal; 3 projects in
Central African Republic (CAR), Comoros,
and Kenya addressing both urban and rural
areas; and 4 feasibility studies totaling
UA 297.4 million. Also, 3 projects were
approved from the RWSSI Trust Fund for
an amount of UA 11.07 million. In addiion, the AWF approved 14 projects for UA
6.5 million.

 

Annual Report 2009

13Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

Box 3.1: The Three Water Initiatives

1. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)

The RWSSI remains a flagship Bank intervention, with the overall objective of extending safe water and basic sanitation coverage
to 80 percent of the rural population by 2015 at an estimated cost of UA 9.22 billion. Since the RWSSI program began in 2003,
the Bank has approved 25 operations in 20 countries with total financing of UA 1.44 billion, of which the Bank contributed UA
659 million (UA 600 million from ADF resources and UA 59 million from the RWSSI Trust Fund). The remaining UA 0.79 billion was
sourced from development partners, African governments, and the beneficiary communities.

The rural population benefiting from the RWSSI increased from about 6.34 million (for access to safe water) and 4.48 million
(for improved sanitation) in 2008, to over 27.0 million people for water and 22.16 million people for sanitation by the end of
December 2009. In 2009, 5 new programs were approved by the Board for a total of UA 75 million (UA 64 million from the ADF
and UA 11 million from RWSSI TF) for the following countries: Central African Republic, Comoros, Kenya (Phase II), Rwanda (Phase
II), and Senegal.

Two new donors, Canada and Switzerland, joined the RWSSI Trust Fund in 2009, with contributions of UA 22.3 million and UA
1.9 million respectively.

2. The Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP)

The MDWPP was established by the Bank, in partnership with the Dutch, Danish, and Canadian governments, in order to operationalize the 2000 Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy. The program was instrumental in the establishment
of the African Water Facility (AWF) and formulation of the RWSSI, as well as the development of a number of guidelines, tools, and
handbooks for the water sector. The main activities supported by the MDWPP in 2009 included:

Africa's participation at the Fifth World Water Forum in Istanbul: development of the Africa Regional Position Paper and the Action
Plan for the Implementation of the Sharm El Sheikh Commitments for Accelerating Achievements of Water and Sanitation Goals;
Leadership role in the thematic session on financing water infrastructure at the Second Africa Water Week;

Assessments on the implementation status of IWRM in 12 Southern African countries in collaboration with the Global Water
Partnership, in support of the Bank's MTS (2008-2012); and

A study on Water Governance in Africa and development of Guidelines for Governance Assessments for Water Sector Experts.

3. The African Water Facility (AWF)

The African Water Facility (AWF) is a key initiative led by the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW), administered by the
Bank, to mobilize resources to finance water sector facilitation and investment activities in Africa. AWF has leveraged about UA
215 million as a result of its project activities.

In 2009 two new donors, UK and Senegal, joined the Facility with contributions of GBP 15 million and EUR 175,000 respectively.
This increased the number of donors to 11 and cumulative cash contributions to EUR 109 millions (of which, EUR 74.1 million
had been received by December 2009). The Bank’s in-kind contribution through its hosting arrangement is valued at UA 1.24 million. The Bank also endorsed a UA 10 million financial contribution subject to approval by the Board of Governors. This will leave
a shortfall of UA 89.5 million for the 2010-2012 Operational Program.

Annual Report 2003DEEPENING PRIVATE
SECTOR INVESTMENT

The Bank has made significant progress
in enhancing its private sector operations.
It is constantly developing and financing
diverse projects in various sectors, including
infrastructure (power, transportation, and
communication), finance, and industry. In
2009, private sector operations amounted
to UA 1.16 billion, compared to UA
901.2 million in 2008. Project loans and
lines of credit approved in 2009 amounted to UA 1.01 billion; private equity,
UA 142.5 million; and private guarantees,
UA 5.3 million (see Figure 3.2). The 2009 private sector approvals represent 20.7 percen
of ADB and 14.3 percent of Bank Group total
approvals, respectively. While the projec
loans in general were used for accelerating
economic growth and reducing poverty, the
LOC approvals aimed at deepening domestic
financial markets by facilitating small- and
medium-size enterprises’ (SMEs) access to
finance. Bank Group investments in many
sizable multinational projects and programs
in the form of loans, LOCs, and private equity
aimed to enhance economic cooperation and
regional integration among RMCs.

 

he distribution of private sector operations by country classification for the year
was concentrated on regional/multinational
projects (51.7 percent), followed by
ow-income countries (ADF countries)
‘42.4 percent), and then MICs (ADB countries) (5.9 percent) (see Figure 3.3).

Four notable projects approved in 2009,
among the regional/multinational operations, were: the LOC for the Global Trade
Liquidity Program (UA 322.1 million); Main
One Cable System-Phase | Project (UA 44.1
million); Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund
UA 33.2 million); and equity investments in
Pan African Investment Partners II Limited
UA 32.5 million).

 

With regard to low-income countries, the
two main private sector loans were the SNIM
Expansion Project Guelb Il (UA 111.7 million) in Mauritania, and the Cocoa Board
First and Second Phases (UA 63.9 million)
in Ghana. The Bank also provided LOCs to
United Bank for Africa PLC (UA 96.6 million)
and Intercontinental Bank PLC (UA 67.0 million) both in Nigeria, among others (see the
Profiles of ADB-Approved Projects in 2009,
at the end of Part 1).

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

Among MICs, Tunisia benefited from one
project loan, namely, for Enfidha Airport (UA
63.2 million), while there was one guarantee loan for Maghreb Leasing Algeria (UA
5.3 million).

As reflected in Figure 3.4, the sectoral distribution of private sector operations indicates that finance received the largest share
of allocations (69.5 percent), followed by
infrastructure (20.8 percent) and industry

Box 3.2: Rwanda - Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program

(PRSSP-III}

 

Objectives: The PRSSP-III aims to create an enabling environment for private sector
growth, and to enhance transparency in the public financial management system by:

Improving the business environment and expanding access to credit by the private sector; and

Supporting reforms to improve the country’s public expenditure and financial
accountability in key areas of budgeting and financial reporting, and improving
competitiveness and governance in public procurement.

Outcomes/Impact: Under the ADF’s PRSSP-I to PRSSP-III series, Rwanda has
transitioned from postconflict reconstruction to development. Its PFM systems have
been restored and its governance indicators, including those relating to the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), have continued to improve.

Under PRSSP-III, Rwanda has reformed its laws aimed at better protecting investors.

This has boosted its ranking in the World Bank's “Doing Business Report 2010” by
76 positions to 67/183 in 2009, from a position of 143 in 2008.

Annual Report 2009

 

(9.6 percent). At year-end 2009, cumulative
approvals for private sector projects and programs totaled UA 4.65 billion, compared to
UA 3.50 billion in 2008; this represents an
increase of 32.9 percent.

Knowledge development: Private sector
operations during 2009 contributed significantly to operational knowledge accumulation. Project completion reports prepared
during 2009 in this sector have yielded lessons that will inform and improve future
Bank Group operations. Some of the lessons and best practices to ensure successful
privatization of state enterprises include: (i)
properly assessing the viability of the enterprises ex ante; (ii) strengthening the rules
governing privatization; and (iii) ensuring
the effective rehabilitation of the assets and
financial position prior to the enterprises
being privatized.Ex-ante Additionality and

(strongly positive) to 4 (none). The two ratings surpassed the target of 2.5 for WADO
and 2.0 for WAAC. These positive development outcomes can be attributed mainly to
improved private sector development, ani
their effects on RMCs' fiscal positions as wel
as enhanced infrastructure. The expecte
improvement in additionality arose mainly
from improved project quality and the minimization of financial risk.

 

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC
AND GOVERNANCE
REFORMS

To address Africa's governance challenges in this period of global financial turbulence, Bank Group efforts are guided by its
Governance Engagement Principles, as laid
down in its Governance Strategic Directions
and Action Plan (GAP) for 2008-2012.
Visionary leadership, effective institutions,
and home-grown capacity constitute the
bedrock for the realization of good governance. Credible leadership provides the basis
of trust between the State and society that
underlies public confidence in the State and
expected development benefits, especially
poverty reduction. Effective and accountable institutions are critical for delivering
long-term development and for providing
checks and balances.

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

Box 3.3: Botswana - The Economic Diversification Support Loan (EDSL}

 

Objective: EDSL, the first General Budget Support (GBS) operation approved by
the Bank for Botswana, has the objective of creating competitive conditions for
accelerated private sector growth, economic diversification, and poverty reduction.
lt was a stimulus package responding to the global financial and economic crisis
and the country’s need to reduce dependence on its mineral revenues. The EDSL
will promote fiscal sustainability by assisting the Government to implement the
2009/10 budget.

Expected Outcomes: (i) Emergence of vibrant non-mineral private sector activity;
(ii) increased application of market efficiencies to commercial activities in which the
Government continues to be involved; (iii) improved private sector regional competitiveness, while increasing the share of non-traditional exports in total exports;
(iv) better regulation of non-bank financial institutions to position Botswana as the
preferred offshore financial services center for Sub-Saharan Africa; (v) improved capital market development; (vi) increased FDI inflows; and (vii) enhanced governance
in the financial sector.

Modalities: EDSL meets country needs by bridging the fiscal deficit that has arisen in the 2009/10 budget as a result of the global economic downturn. Its main

strengths are:

e It uses country systems and monitoring mechanisms built around the national

budget;
¢ tis focused on results;

¢ It collaborates closely with the IMF and World Bank for implementation and

monitoring purposes;

e It enhances dialogue with the Government and other development partners
to better address the remaining challenges facing the country, including macroeconomic (e.g. wage bill issues) and social (especially HIV/AIDS, inequality

and poverty).

In 2009 the Bank Group's support for governance reforms continued to emphasize
greater selectivity and results-orientation,
focusing on strengthening economic governance and public financial management
at the sector, country, and regional levels.
The Bank Group prioritizes improvements
in economic and financial governance as
core elements to ensure effective, capable,
and accountable states. Good economic and
financial governance is the means to deliver
effective poverty reduction (see Box 3.2).

The Bank's support for RMCs’ governance
initiatives is provided from the ADB and ADF
windows, as well as from the Fragile States
Facility (FSF). The Bank Group uses, among its
instruments, a mix of Policy Based Operations
(PBOs). These are preferred by most RMCs
because they ensure increased national

ownership and leadership in the countries’

development efforts, including control over
domestic and aid resources to deliver their
own development priorities and plans. These
operations are also in line with the Bank's
commitments under the Paris Declaration

Annual Report 2009Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

Box 3.4: Governance - Delivering Results

Bank-supported governance initiatives in the areas below have led to the following outcomes:

Revenue Management: In Liberia the establishment of a One-Stop Shop (OSS)
Customs Service Facility has improved revenue collection, facilitated pro-poor spending, and maintained the reform momentum during the finance, food, and fuel crises.
Institutional reforms in the Gambia Revenue Authority led to an 8.3 percent increase
in tax revenue over 2008-09. A 31.0 percent increase in Tanzania's non-tax revenue
occurred over 2005-09, following the implementation of key actions on Natural
Resources Concessions and Licensing Management.

Budget Management: Automation of the interfaces between sectoral and central
ministries in Mali enhanced the timeliness of budget preparation, improving coverage
by 39.8 percent over 2008-09. In Comoros, the adoption of a legal framework for
public finance management helped improve budgeting. Improved budget planning
and execution in the Gambia led to an improved focus on poverty-related expenditure, which accounted for 50 percent of the total amount in 2009.

Public Procurement: Fund-supported enactment of the Procurement Act in Tanzania
led to a 27 percent increase in compliant agencies. In Benin, ADF-sponsored actions
against public procurement delays and fraud led to an average 8-month reduction
in delays and to the enactment of fraud sanctions. In Togo, the modernization of
public procurement led to a reduction in direct procurement, while in Burkina Faso
ADF-backed drive for transparency in public procurement led to a reduction in direct
procurement contracts from 15 percent in 2007 to 12 percent in 2009.

Government Auditing: Fund intervention reduced the 7-year backlog of audit
reports in The Gambia from 7 to 2 years over 2007-09. Similarly, interventions in
Sierra Leone and Liberia resulted in backlogs of audit reports declining significantly,
while in Rwanda audit coverage of government expenditure improved from 50 percent in 2006 to 55 percent in 2007.

Business Environment: In Zambia, the average time needed to register a business
decreased to 3-5 days in 2009 from 8 days in 2008 and 35 days in 2006. Similarly
in Cape Verde, the average time needed to start up a new business fell from 52 days
to just 1 day over the period 2007-08. In Rwanda, the adoption of bills on solvency,
business registration, competition, and consumer protection strengthened the private sector regulatory and legislative environment. The timeframe required to transfer
ownership of a business in Senegal almost halved from 117 to 60 days.

Social Outcomes: In Ethiopia, ADF budget support increased social welfare on
a number of levels: regional level expenditure rose from 41 percent to 51 percent
between 2004/5 and 2007/8; primary school enrollment increased from 11.4 million
to 14.0 million between 2004/5 and 2006/7; net primary enrollment ratio increased
by over 10 percent; while access to health services and safe drinking water by the
rural population increased from 35 percent to 46 percent.

on Aid Effectiveness, and as reaffirmed by
he Accra Agenda for Action. Presently, most
of the Bank Group PBO interventions are in
he form of general budget support to RMC
governments.

n 2009 the Bank Group further aligned and
harmonized its support with joint government donor frameworks, and was Chair of
joint donor budget support groups in Burkina
Faso, Malawi, and Tanzania. Bank Group
PBOs (loans and grants) grew from UA 597.4
million in 2008 to UA 2.09 billion in 2009.
An economic crisis-related stimulus package
or Botswana accounted for UA 969.0 milion (US$ 1.5 billion) of the 2009 total (see
Box 3.3). Approvals of new complementary
Bank Group institutional support projects to
strengthen capacity increased from UA 29.1
million in 2008 to UA 59.3 million in 2009.

 

The Bank Group's support to RMCs' policy and institutional reforms, designed to
improve service delivery, has resulted in tangible results (Box 3.4). Moreover, its support to Africa's fiscal responses to the food,
financial, and economic crises has helped
to sustain the development momentum.
These successes notwithstanding, serious
challenges remain, as outlined in Box 3.5.
The Bank has also supported private sector
development by promoting the enhancement
of the business climate in RMCs.

Bank Group Operations

to Promote Governance

at National, Sectoral, and
Regional Levels

At the country level: The Bank helps
RMCs to improve governance of their public financial resources by placing emphasis on
tax, budget, and procurement management.
It does this by strengthening oversight institutions and accountability systems (audit).
It also supports the enhancement of the
investment climate and business environment, focusing on pro-poor growth. In 2009,
the Bank Group approved 22 programs and
projects for a total commitment of UA 2.10Box 3.5: Governance - Challenges, Containment Actions,

and Outcomes

 

The challenges, constraints, and containment actions relating to the governance area
include the following:

i) Improving quality-at-entry through upstream analyses and non-lending works
that are not measurable by existing KPIs such as: (a) addressing cross-cutting
dimensions of governance in other “sectors”; (b) ESW production constrained
by inadequate internal financial and human resources capacity and mission
creep; and (c) complexity of measuring results and changes in governance;

ii) Consolidating the Bank's profile in governance through continued selectivity
and a sharper focus on core Bank priorities of economic governance and public
financial management in the selection of types and themes for ESW;

iii) Inadequate staff capacity needs to be addressed to enhance the business-enabling
environment in RMCs;

iv) Greater local presence and decentralization to Field Offices to monitor the
Governance Agenda at the country level; and

v) Building a database with other partners and sharing information.

The outcomes include:
i) Progress in 2009 in achieving the governance vision through the consolidation

of internal institutional reforms and the strengthening of the Bank's capacities;
ii) Greater focus on governance subsectors (public financial management and ena
bling business environment);

iii) Greater attention to governance in sectors (e.g. mainstreaming governance and

anti-corruption across sectors); and
iv) Better linkages.

billion to strengthen public finances in RMCs
through enhanced public and budget institutions and processes. The Bank has also
invested in shared analytical work with other donors, for instance through the Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability
(PEFA) analyses and other diagnostic work
in 5 RMCs, and Country Governance Profiles
in 3 other countries.

At the sectoral level: The Bank is scaling
up its drive to improve governance and combat corruption in high-risk sectors, including infrastructure, water, energy, transportation, and extractive industries. Among
other measures, the Bank has issued operations guidance for mainstreaming govern
ance concerns into Bank Group operations.
This support includes working through the
Making Finance Work for Africa (MFW4A)
Partnership, a G8 initiative launched in 2007
with the mission of establishing a common
latform for the harmonization and faciliation of financial sector development and
knowledge sharing in Africa. During 2009
he MFW4A Secretariat launched its website (http://www.mfw4a.org) to serve as a
knowledge hub.

he Bank Group backs African countries’
efforts to improve revenue governance in the
extractive industries sector through its support to the Extractive Industries Transparency
nitiative (EITI). In 2009 the Bank provided

 

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

such support to 8 RMCs, of which Liberia
became the first African country to complete
the EITI validation exercise.

At the regional level: The Bank Group
supports a number of regional bodies, initiatives, and networks that promote economic and financial governance. These include
the Collaborative African Budget Reform
Initiative (CABRI), the African Organization
of Supreme Audit Institutions (AFROSAI),
and the African Tax Administrators Forum
(ATAF) established in 2009. To support good
governance in public procurement, in 2009
the Bank convened the heads of African
public procurement agencies, to reinvigorate
reforms in this area. It also provides financial
support to the IMF-initiated African Technical
Assistance Centers (AFRITACs).

During 2009 the Bank contributed to the
development of a robust and systematic
monitoring and reporting framework for
the National Plans of Action and improved
modalities for civil society engagement to
enhance the work of the African Peer Review
Mechanism (APRM). The Bank also supported APRM country reviews of Ethiopia,
Lesotho, Mauritius, and Mozambique.

Knowledge development: In 2009 the
Bank produced several PCRs involving institutional reforms. The lessons learnt from
these PCRs include the following:

(i) Training, transfer of knowledge and
equipment must be accompanied by
appropriate structural, institutional, and
organizational changes;

(ii), The successful modernization of public administration is dependent on the
existence of national structures that
have clear responsibilities for coordinating activities, and that are equipped
with adequate resources and staffed
with qualified personnel; and

Annual Report 2009

2526

Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

(iii) An integrated framework of aid coordination, programming, and budgeting
strengthens the alignment and harmonization of development programs, and
helps prevent the duplication of tasks.
Such a framework serves to maximize
impact on institutional support and
capacity development.

PROMOTING
SOCIAL AND HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT

As elaborated in the MTS, poverty reduction
lies at the center of the Bank's vision. The
Bank Group's interventions contribute to
poverty reduction by focusing on activities
that bring about strong and equitable economic growth. In the education and health
subsectors, this means focusing on (i) higher
education, science, and technology (HEST),
with the aim of producing the human capital (scientists, engineers, researchers, doc
tors, etc.), who will serve in the countries’
centers of excellence and (ii) Technical and
Vocational Education and Training (TVET)
to address the skilled labor requirements
of the productive sectors. Investment in the
social sector (education, health, etc.) can in
this way contribute to human development
and poverty reduction.

This orientation of the Bank Group interventions is geared toward helping RMCs attain

their respective MDG targets and achieve

sustainable levels of economic advancement. Specifically, Bank Group support to the
HEST and TVET programs aim to: (i) improve
national and regional centers of excellence
in science and technology; (ii) build and

rehabilitate existing science and technology
infrastructure, including tertiary education,
and link programs to productive sectors in
relevant countries; and (iii) assist RMCs to
address critical shortages of trained health
professionals and technicians, which is hampering the attainment of the health MDGs.

 

Bank Group’s Response to
the Financial and Economic
Crisis in the Social Sector

In response to the global financial and economic crisis, the Bank continued providing targeted support to programs that promote and enhance income opportunities,
employment creation, and social protection. The Bank focused on measures aimed
at: increasing social protection for unemployed youth; improving opportunities for
increasing rural incomes and employment
through capacity building; and improving
access to financial services by the poor. In
July 2009 the Bank, in collaboration with
the Association for the Development of
Education in Africa (ADEA) (now housed in
the Bank) and the World Bank, hosted a conference of African Ministers of Education and
Finance, development partners, civil society,
and representatives of the private sector on
the theme: “Sustaining the Education and
Economic Momentum in Africa amidst the
Current Global Financial Crisis.” The confer
 

Annual Report 2009ence called for greater cooperation among
education sector stakeholders and for better
leadership in African countries to safeguard
the hard-won gains achieved by RMCs over
the past decade.

n 2009 the Bank approved UA 228.6 milion for 17 operations in the social sector.
Distribution by subsectors shows the dominance of education (UA 199.2 million), followed by poverty reduction and social proection (UA 20.7 million), and health, (UA
8.7 million). Notable approvals include the
National Education Emergency Support
Program in Morocco; the Improvement of
Higher Education and Vocational Training in
Public Services in Gabon (see Box 3.6); the
Rural Income and Employment Enhancement
Program in Uganda, and a grant to support
he Network of Regional African Institutions
of Science and Technology.

n addition, during 2009 the Bank used
art of the US$ 1.0 million grant from the
Nigeria Technical Cooperation Fund (NTCF)
to finance the Mapping of Science and
Technology for Industrial Development in
Rwanda, and to support the African Scientific
Merit Award program, both linked to the
HEST initiative. It also approved 14 grant
operations amounting to UA 7.9 million
to fund important benchmark studies in 8
MICs. The Bank additionally approved 17
emergency humanitarian assistance operations amounting to UA 8.7 million to support:
victims of cholera outbreaks in Zimbabwe
and Guinea Bissau, victims of a meningitis outbreak in Chad, and flood victims in
Burkina Faso and Comoros.

 

Knowledge development: The lessons
and best practices learnt from PCRs conducted in 2009 for the social sector include
the following:

(i) Identification of user needs through
needs assessment studies to precede
project design is critical to ensure that
the resulting projects will be compre

Project aims:

Improving the skills of middle- and senior-level technicians and professional personnel; addressing problems of ineffectiveness of public expenditures, particularly in
the social sector, including education; enhancing the countrywide admission capacity of schools; improving the quality and relevance of educational programs; and
enhancing the effectiveness of public resources allocated to the education sector,
including progressively reducing expenditure on scholarships for studies abroad.

Project beneficiaries:

The beneficiaries include students of the 3 national universities, higher professional
schools, and institutes of industrial and rural technical and vocational education;
people wishing to enhance or readjust their skills through continuous and further
training; female students who will have increased access to technical and vocational training possibilities in areas hitherto unavailable to them; 1,000 university
and 4,000 technical education students each year; 468 teachers, supervisory staff
and heads of institutions whose skills will be strengthened.

Expected outcomes:

Improved effectiveness and efficiency of governance in the country's education
sector and the economy resulting from strengthened administrative and financial
management skills of 134 technical officers of the supervisory ministry and training institutions; and better rationalization of expenditure by reducing resources
allocated to foreign scholarships.

hensive and address all relevant aspects,
such as the cross-cutting issues of gender and the environment, as well as
social and economic concerns.

Community modes of construction have
the potential for enhancing the capacity of the rural communities and should
be encouraged for education and rural
development projects.

The Bank should endeavor to minimize
conditions that are legislative in nature
to enhance the speedy fulfillment of
loan conditions and effectiveness.

Effective and intensive community participation through extensive outreach
is needed to consult and involve stakeholders from the inception of project

design and preparation through to
implementation, to ensure continued
community support, commitment,
ownership, and the success of the
project.

PROMOTING REGIONAL
INTEGRATION

Since its inception, the Bank has been active
in regional integration activities in various
forms, ranging from support to regional economic communities (RECs), to intra- and
inter-regional trade enhancement, cooperation, and capacity building. During 2009
the Boards of Directors approved the Bank
Group's Regional Integration Strategy (RIS)
(2009-2012). The Strategy proposes bolder
and better-focused interventions for Africa's

Annual Report 2009

27Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

regional integration, as well as closer collaboration with key stakeholders such as
the AUC, ECA, and the RECs. The Strategy
hinges on regional infrastructure development and institutional capacity building, with
aid for trade, regional financial integration,
and the provision of regional public goods
(RPGs) as cross-cutting dimensions. In 2009
the Bank also developed the first RIS for the
Central Africa subregion (2009-2013), which
is pending approval by the Boards.

The Bank has also been involved in the strategic formulation of the regional integration
agenda of the continent. In particular, it participated in the design and operationalization of the NEPAD Short-term Action Plan
(STAP), followed by the design and subsequent prioritization of the Africa Action Plan
(AAP) and, recently in 2009, the formulation

and design of the Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA) (see Box 3.7).
Projects recently approved under STAP in
2008/2009 include the Mombasa—NairobiAddis Ababa Road, the Bamenda—Mamfe—
Abakaliki-Enugu (Cameroon-Nigeria)
Highway, and a power interconnection
project for Djibouti and Ethiopia.

Box 3.7: The Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA)

PIDA is a merger of (i) NEPAD’s Medium- to Long-Term Strategic Framework (MLTSF)
Study for the development of continental and regional infrastructure, (ii) continentwide sector policies, and (iii) a Master Plan initiative that is supported by the African
Union Commission (AUC). The merger of all existing African infrastructure initiatives was intended to provide a coherent and strategic framework that will serve
as a common platform for defining, implementing, and monitoring regional and
continental infrastructure development across Africa. The study is being cofinanced
by the African Development Fund (ADF), the Nigerian Technical Cooperation Fund
(NTCF), and other donors.

The objectives of PIDA — covering regional energy, transportation, ICT, and transboundary water resources — are to enable African decisionmakers to:

Establish a strategic framework for the development of regional and continental
infrastructure based on a development vision, strategic objectives, and sectoral
policies;

Establish an infrastructure development program around priorities and time
horizons up to 2030; and

Prepare an implementation strategy and process including, in particular, a priority Action Plan.

The Bank Group has been designated as the Executing Agency for PIDA and is
implementing the study in collaboration with the AUC and the NEPAD Secretariat.

al integration objective. The Bank also
approved 10 private equity investments
for multinational development projects in
LICs (see earlier section “Deepening Private
Sector Investment”).

Challenges in

Regional Integration

The Bank is confronted with the following
challenges in its effort to enhance regional
integration.

e Inadequate institutional and regulatory
frameworks (“soft” forms of infrastructure) to complement physical infrastructure development;
e Inadequate financial and logistical
capacities at national and regional agencies involved in advancing the integration agenda;
e Lack of reliable indicators for measuring
progress toward regional integration;
e Inadequate human resource capacity
and political will to implement agreed
integration initiatives; and
e Lack of adequate regional payments
systems that will facilitate transborder
financial transactions and regional trade.

and related action
lowing :

(i) Investing in institutional development and capacity building and in
the harmonization of trade legislation,
policies, technical standards and regulations, thereby facilitating regional trade.
In this regard, the Bank in 2009 supported the NEPAD Secretariat through
the enhancement of its technical capacity and the facilitation of its transformation into the NEPAD Planning and
Coordination Agency (NPCA) of the
AU. It provided technical and financial
support to the AUC in the formulation
of its Infrastructure Strategy, which
was subsequently endorsed at the AU
Summit in February 2009. The Bank also
provided capacity-building support to
various RECs, especially ECCAS, UMA,
COMESA and ECOWAS, in addition to
funding studies to enhance economic
and financial integration.

 

(ii) Building strong partnerships with
African institutions like the ECA, AUC,
NEPAD, and with RECs and global agencies such as WTO and World Bank to
deliver on continent-wide programs
such as the STAP and PIDA. The following were some of the activities undertaken under the aegis of these partnerships:

e The publication of Assessing Regional
Integration in Africa (ARIA), jointly produced by the ECA-ADB—AUC;

© The establishment of the ADB—AUC-ECA
Joint Secretariat Support Office (JSSO),
which is, entrusted with the coordination
of joint projects and programs;

¢ Trade facilitation activities with the
World Customs Organization, UNCTAD,
and the World Bank; and

¢ Establishment of ClimDev-Africa by the
ADB-AUC-ECA, to provide “climate
information for development in Africa.”
The Bank allocated UA 20 million to a
ClimDev-Africa Fund established in 2009.

SUPPORT FOR
FRAGILE STATES

The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established with resources totaling UA 647.8
million provided by both the ADB and the
ADF to support the recovery process of the
Bank's fragile member states. The FSF's grantsupported windows provide: (i) operational
support in excess of the performance-based
allocation (PBA) for infrastructure rehabilitation and reconstruction; (ii) arrears clearance;
and (iii) targeted support for economic and
sector work, capacity-building and technical
assistance, including secondments.

In 2009 the economic performance of fragile
states was badly affected by the global financial and economic crisis. Falling export earnings and declining capital inflows caused
serious balance of payments and fiscal difficulties. The accompanying exchange rate volatilities and job losses resulted in per capita
income falling by more than 50 percent of
forecasts in some countries. This has undermined gains from economic reforms and
advances made in the fight against poverty
in most fragile states. In response to this critical situation, the Bank approved UA 364.8

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

million from the FSF to finance 12 operations in Central African Republic, Comoros,
Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra
Leone, and Togo. Of the 2009 FSF approvals,
UA 240.9 million was for arrears clearance
for Céte d'Ivoire.

In addition, the Bank has established
strong partnerships with the Bretton Woods
Institutions, UN agencies, and other organizations supporting governance reforms and
providing technical assistance and capacitybuilding services in fragile states. The Bank
is a member of the OECD's International
Network of Conflict and Fragility, and the
MDB's Working Group on Fragility and Conflict.
The institution has also intensified collaboration with the AUC and UN agencies, especially
UNECA, in undertaking Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) on peace and state-building in
Africa.

(excluding multinational projects and programs) stood at UA 4.35 billion, which is
over 3 times the 2008 level of UA 1.11 bilion. This significant increase is primarily the
outcome of intensive demand for the Bank's
resources, against the backdrop of the global
inancial and economic crisis, and the Bank's
subsequent response.

shift. Departing from the pattern of the previous 6 years, Sub-Saharan Africa received
he majority share (78.2 percent) compared
with North Africa (21.8 percent), as shown in
Figure 3.7. This shift is the result of the large

Botswana (UA 969.0 million for the Economic
Diversification Budget Support Loan).

percent (see Figure 3.8). Guarantees and
grants from the MICs Technical Assistance
Fund (TAF), the African Water Facility (AWF),
and Special Relief Fund (SRF) made up the
remaining 0.3 percent of the resources. The
2009 MICs financing program featured a
greater use of small grants from the MICsTAF, the AWF, and SRF, than in previous years.

In implementing its MICs strategic framework approved in 2008, the Bank deepened
its business approach of being more responsive, flexible, and innovative, and thereby
more competitive in 2009. In particular,
the Bank adjusted its product and pricing
flexibility to better meet the needs of MICs.

 

AGRICULTURE AND
RURAL DEVELOPMENT

The Bank Group’s strategy for supporting
African agriculture and rural development
(ARD) is rooted in the fact that the sector is
the mainstay of the economic and social life

of most African communities. Consequently,
success in this area has an immediate and
wide-ranging effect on poverty reduction
and improved living standards in most RMCs.
The strategy seeks to promote food security
by encouraging investments in irrigation
infrastructure and agro-processing transportation networks, including storage facilities,
markets, and related equipment.

Technologies for Productivity
Enhancement and Food
Security

The application of irrigation and other agricultural technologies has made high-performing developing countries in East Asia
and the Pacific food-secure, as per capita production has outstripped demand. In
much of Africa, however, per capita annual growth in production has stagnated at
less than 1 percent due to a lack of investment in improved technologies and production methods. In recent years, a promising
development has appeared in parts of West,
East, and Southern Africa, where the use of
NERICA rice seed and hybrid maize combined with properly targeted subsidies for
key inputs, have resulted in highly improved
yields and output.

To enhance agricultural productivity and
production, as well as facilitate efficient
distribution and conservation (reducing
post-harvest losses), the MTS encourages
investments in irrigation infrastructure and in
marketing networks (transportation, storage,
markets, and related equipment) to ensure
food security. It also advocates policies and
regulations for the efficient management
of food stocks, their unhindered movement
within and between countries, as well as
good governance of public financial and
fiscal resources. In 2009 the Bank approved
UA 218 million for 25 agricultural operations. Most approvals were for projects and
programs aiming to increase food security
through productivity enhancement, infrastructure development, and natural resources
and climate change management.Infrastructure

Development, Climate
Change Management, and
Food Security

The high unit costs and the Group’s disappointing experience with large-scale public irrigation projects have led the Bank to
refocus its support for irrigation operations.
Currently, the Bank encourages private capital for large-scale irrigation programs, while
it concentrates its public funding on promoting small-scale, farmer-operated irrigation and water management systems. The
Massingir Dam Project in Mozambique, the
Mali Irrigation Development Program, and
the National Irrigation Water Saving Program
Support Project in Morocco, all approved in
2009, are designed to increase irrigation
capacity for small-scale farmers.

The Bank's forestry interventions mitigate
threats to the stability of the ecosystems.
These interventions contribute to climate
change mitigation and adaptation by
enhancing the management of renewable
natural resources (water, forestry, and land
resources) that provide fundamental life
support and reduce the effects of desertification, deforestation, and soil degradation.
For instance, the Congo Basin Ecosystems
Conservation Support Program approved
in 2009 aims to contribute to the sustainable management of forest resources and
protected areas, thereby helping to preserve
the ecological balance of the planet. The
Program seeks to enhance the socioeconomic wellbeing of the affected population
while enabling them to adapt to climate
change.

Inter-Agency Cooperation

for Improved Delivery of
Food Security Outcomes

Most agricultural projects approved in 2009
are designed to be implemented within the
framework of existing inter-agency partnerships in respective RMCs. Cooperation enables the Bank to draw from other partners’
experiences and expertise, while ensuring

inter-agency harmony in accordance with
the Paris Declaration on Development
Effectiveness. The Bank is working in partnership with the AUC and the ECA in ClimDev
Africa, and with the World Bank in implementing the Pilot Program for Climate Change
Resilience in Zambia and Mozambique.

The 2009 AfDB/IFAD evaluation of agriculture and rural development projects and programs in Africa reaffirmed the importance of
this sector for the continent's socioeconomic

development, while identifying a wide range
of challenges and constraints. The evaluation
concluded that there is a need to strengthen
sectoral policies, especially at the country
level; to improve the operational performance of lenders and governments; and to
develop a more efficient division of labor and
stronger partnerships among stakeholders.
While recommending the Bank's continued
engagement in agriculture, the evaluation
urged greater selectivity and alignment with
the Bank's strategic priorities, with a focus

on innovative approaches within the Bank's
areas of comparative advantage and strategic priorities. Accordingly, most agricultural
interventions approved in 2009 relate to
infrastructure, as this is key to achieving
food security and is therefore assigned the
highest priority in the MTS. In addition, the
Bank took account of the findings and recommendations of the AfDB/IFAD evaluation
in preparing its Agriculture Sector Strategy
(2010-2014) in 2009, which will be considered by the Boards of Directors in 2010.

To improve portfolio supervision and delivery
in its operations, the Bank is progressively
delegating authority and strengthening the
skills mix in its Field Offices. Consequently,
58.5 percent of agricultural projects were
rated as satisfactory and only 5.7 percent
as problematic during 2009, compared to
50.0 percent and 13.0 percent respectively in
2007. These achievements are encouraging
but the sector's development continues to
encounter serious challenges (see Box 3.8).

Knowledge development: The main lessons learned from the PCRs prepared during
2009 for agriculture and rural development
interventions can be summarized as follows:

(i) In cofinanced interventions, coordination and communication between the
cofinanciers and district, regional, and
national authorities are vital for the
smooth and successful implementation
of the project;

(ii), Improving smallholder agriculture
through projects that combine agriculture and infrastructure development
components is important and should be
adopted more widely in relevant Bank
Group operations;

(ii

Cofinancing demand-led agriculture and
rural development programs with IFAD
has proven to be cost-effective; the
PCRs also illustrate the advantages of
communal land ownership in protecting

Realignment of existing agricultural and non-agricultural portfolios:

66 projects have been identified for realignment in 21 countries. Of these: (i) 29
of 31 agricultural projects, which require revision of LOGS, have been realigned,
yielding UA 29.8 million for 17 countries; and (ii) 35 non-agricultural projects
have been identified in 11 countries, of which 31 have been realigned with Board

approval, yielding UA 66.3 million.

Budget support operations: The use of Bank resources for budget support

and balance of payment operations to free up domestic resources for the immediate responses to the food crisis. Twelve operations were identified, of which 3
were ongoing, freeing up UA 42 million, and 9 newly processed and approved
operations by the Board, freeing up UA 258.5 million.

Bank's Surplus Account operations: The Boards of Governors approved an

allocation of UA 20 million from the Bank's Surplus Account to assist 11 RMCs
severely affected by the food crisis. Ten of these operations, amounting to UA
19 million, have been approved by the Boards of Directors.

NERICA rice promotion initiative: The Bank, with the acceptance of the 7

West African countries implementing the ongoing multinational NERICA rice dissemination project, has released UA 2.24 million from the portfolio realignment
of the NERICA project to facilitate expansion of the area under NERICA cultivation over the next 2 years. This will produce additional seed for dissemination

Africa Food Crisis Response
(AFCR) Implementation:
Status and Results

The AFCR initiative was adopted as the
framework for accelerated Bank support to
RMCs facing food shortages and exorbitant
prices. Over the short-term, AFCR sought
to reduce the risk of increased poverty and
hunger by supporting food production, using
funds raised from the realignment of vari
ous types of operations including: (i) revisions of List of Goods and Services (LOGS)
of ongoing agricultural operations and scaling up the food production components;
(ii) use of undisbursed balances of closed
operations and of savings from completed
agricultural and non-agricultural operations;
(iii) budget and balance of payment support
programs; (iv) allocations from the Bank's
surplus income; and (v) increased NERICA
rice seed production and dissemination.

During 2009 the Bank allocated UA 415.6
million, from the various sources indicated
in Box 3.9, to finance the AFCR short-term
program. Of this amount, UA 339.0 million,
representing 81.6 percent of the allocated
amount, has been disbursed. At the end of
the program period in July 2009, about 2.1
million beneficiaries (34 percent women) in
28 RMCs had received agricultural inputsfrom the AFCR interventions. Preliminary
results for this support provided during the
2008/2009 crop season show significant
increases in production during 2009/2010,
compared to 2007/2008: rice production
rose to 715,400 mt from 159,530 mt; maize
to 3,550,000 mt from 182,170 mt; sorghum,
644,680 mt from 146,750 mt; and millet,
215,000 mt from 66,700 mt. The NERICA
tice seed initiative increased seed production from 1,390 mt in 2007/2008 to 16,674
mt in 2009/2010.

In the medium to long term, AFCR has
focused on improving primary and rural
infrastructure, water resource management, and increasing access to inputs. Efforts
are continuing to operationalize the Africa
Fertilizer Financing Mechanism, to expand
NERICA rice seed production and distribution, build capacity, enhance policy dialogue,
promote trade and agricultural research, and
establish the Africa Food Crisis Response
Facility.

The Bank's private sector window has initiated a number of different approaches: to
channel LOCs to agricultural SME producers;
direct lending to strategic partners involved
with smallholder farmers; to set up private
agribusiness equity funds; to support fertilizer
projects; and to promote public—private partnerships in agriculture. The AfDB-cofinanced
AgriVie Project approved in 2009 will avail
equity funds of between US$ 3.0 million and
US$ 7.0 million per qualifying agribusiness
firm. In 2009 the Bank also approved a business plan to increase Africa's water storage
capacity by at least 8.5 billion m?.

CROSS-CUTTING
ACTIVITIES

Environment and

Climate Change

During 2009 the Bank approved the Climate
Risk Management and Adaptation (CRMA)
Strategy as a follow-up to the Clean Energy

Investment Framework (CEIF) for Africa. The
CEIF set the agenda for mainstreaming clean
energy options, by promoting investments in
accessing cleaner energies and strengthening energy efficiency in all sectors. The CRMA
Strategy on the other hand seeks to: (i)
improve the effectiveness of Bank-financed
investments by reducing their vulnerability
and promoting their resilience to climate
variability and (ii) ensure sustainability by
uilding RMCs' capacity and knowledge to
address the challenges of climate change
hrough policy and regulatory reforms. Both
he CEIF and the CRMA constitute the Bank
Group's policy on climate change.

n 2009 the Bank reviewed about 170
rojects in its 2010-2012 pipeline to identify
hose eligible for carbon financing from the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) so
hat CDM components may be built into

n order to implement the CRMA during
he year, the Bank undertook a preliminary
assessment of 206 projects approved since
2007 in infrastructure, energy, water and
sanitation, and agriculture in respect to their
exposure to climate risks. Of these, about
66 (32 percent) were classified as susceptible to climate change. In 2009 the Bank
secured UA 4.5 million from the GEF (Global
Environment Facility) resources in order to
“climate-proof” some of its projects. Efforts
are being made to find more resources to
climate-proof all Bank projects. The Bank has
collaborated with the World Bank's Climate
Change Team to develop a computer-based,

he Bank has carried out capacity building for
mainstreaming climate change, risk reducion in the National Development Plans of
3 RMCs, and has mobilized GEF resources
0 build climate resilience into projects in 6
RMCs, and in one regional operation in the
Congo Basin.

n addition, the Bank has undertaken audits
of the implementation of the Environmental
and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) of
selected Category 1 and 2 infrastructure
rojects. The audit reports indicated the need
or more thorough environmental supervision by experienced staff during project
implementation; it also proposed compreensive environmental and social impact
monitoring checklists.

 

Bank’s Support to RMCs to Deliver
on Copenhagen Outcomes

In preparing for the Copenhagen Conference
on Climate Change, the African Ministerial
Conference on the Environment (AMCEN)
and the African Union requested technical
assistance from the Bank to: (i) equip African
negotiators with relevant negotiating skills
on key issues; (ii) organize consultations to
harmonize subregional positions into a single coherent African position; and (ii) provide technical and analytical support during
negotiations. The Bank provided consultants
in legal, finance, and policy areas. It also
organized a training workshop focusing on
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
Avoiding Degradation (REDD+) for the negotiators and other designated national officials.
At the conference, the African Group proposed the creation of a short-term Climate
Change Fund to be administered by the AfDB.
The Copenhagen Accord that emerged from
the conference endorsed the establishment
of the Copenhagen Fund, consisting of a US$
30 billion short-term funding for immediate
actions until 2012 and US$ 100 billion annually by 2020 in long-term financing.

Gender Mainstreaming

In cognizance of the findings and lessons
drawn from the mid-term review of the
Gender Plan of Action 2004-2007 (GPA-1),
the Bank approved the Updated Gender Plan
of Action 2010-2012 (UGPA) in July 2009.
The Bank also undertook gender assessments
in poverty reduction, health, and education
projects, and a multinational study on genderresponsive budgeting. In addition, it finalized
Country Gender Profiles for South Africa and
Kenya and sensitized RMCs on the need to
provide gender-disaggregated data at all
levels.

To improve quality-at-entry, the Bank has
strengthened the focus on gender-responsive
indicators and monitoring throughout the
institution and has developed gender mainstreaming checklists. In addition, it provided
training for Bank staff on the use of the
checklists, the design of appropriate genderresponsive strategies, and ways of identifying
appropriate entry points for gender mainstreaming during project design.

For the purposes of inter-agency collaboration, coordination, harmonization, and
exchanging lessons of experience and best
practices in gender mainstreaming, the Bank
is represented in the OECD GenderNet and
participated in the MDB workshop on Gender
Mainstreaming in Infrastructure Projects. The
Bank is also working closely with partners in
the Steering Committee, preparing for the
upcoming Beijing+15 in addition to responding to gender violence in fragile states.

Enhanced Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative: Progress Report
The Enhanced HIPC Initiative provides debt
relief to the poorest and most heavily indebted countries after they have reached their
decision and completion points. During 2009,

Annual Report 2003

two RMCs (Burundi and Central African
Republic) reached their completion points,
while Togo and Céte d'Ivoire reached their
decision points. As at end-December 2009,
21 RMCs had reached their completion
points and qualified for irrevocable HIPC
debt relief, 8 were in the interim period
between decision and completion points,
and 4 were at the pre-decision point (see
Figure 3.9).

Irrevocable HIPC debt relief of UA 161.6
million and UA 65.9 million was approved
at completion point for Burundi and the
Central African Republic, respectively, while

HIPC relief of UA 11.6 million and UA 133.4
million was approved at decision point for
Togo and Céte d'Ivoire, in that order. The
total HIPC debt relief approved in 2009
amounted to UA 372.6 million.

Cost of the HIPC Initiative

The overall cost of debt relief for the 40 countries around the world that are potentially
eligible for HIPC assistance is currently estimated at US$ 74.0 billion in nominal terms,
of which the costs to multilateral creditors
account for about 46.0 percent (US$ 34 billion). The Bank Group’s share is estimated
at US$ 5.77 billion, representing about 8.0

ADF in support of regional infrastructure and selected regional public goods.

The significant progress made in the results management area was also noted, particularly in the establishment of new indicators for sanitation, climate change, fragile
states, and gender mainstreaming. There were recommendations for the continued
improvement of statistical capacity building to ensure better measurement of results
in ADF countries. Improvements in institutional reforms were welcomed in the areas
of human resources management, decentralization, and aid effectiveness, toward
meeting the Paris Declaration targets. Participants reaffirmed their support for the

Sixth General

Capital Increase (GCI-VI)

In 2007 the High-Level Panel laid out a
vision for the Bank to become the premier
development finance institution in Africa. The
Bank's Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) 20082012 espoused the principles laid out by the
High-Level Panel report and charted a way
orward for the Bank. Since 2007, the Bank's
ending volumes have been on an upward
rajectory, in response to increasing demand
rom RMCs. The MTS therefore projects the
need for a capital increase by 2012.

he ability of African countries to raise funds
0 finance their development programs and
investments has been particularly affected
y the global financial crisis. This is attributable mainly to a collapse in demand for, and
in most cases also the price of, commodities
hat constitute the bulk of Africa's exports.
Furthermore, RMCs’ access to capital markets has deteriorated significantly.

 

As a result, the demand for lending from
he Bank has increased. Pre-crisis demand
or 2009 was estimated at UA 5.0 billion
and was increased to UA 8.06 billion as at
end-December 2009. The demand is projected to remain high in the medium to long
erm. Accordingly, at the Bank’s 2009 Annual
Meetings held in Dakar, Senegal, the Board
of Governors authorized the Governors’
Consultative Committee (GCC) to meet and
make a compelling case for a Sixth General
Capital Increase. The meeting was held in
Tunis on September 11, 2009 to launch the
GCI-VI consultative process. Various scenarios
for a capital increase were considered. Given
expectations of a sustained high demand
from RMCs for Bank support, a significant
capital increase with a substantial paid-in
portion would be required for the Bank to
continue to deliver on its mandate.

 

Annual Report 2003

Non-Voting Callable

Capital Increase

During the year ending December 31, 2009,
the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal
made by Canada and the Republic of Korea
offering to subscribe temporarily to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank
for the amounts of US$ 2.60 billion and US$
306.0 million respectively. On December
24, 2009, the Board of Directors submitted
the proposal to the Board of Governors for
consideration.

PARTNERSHIPS AND
COOPERATION ACTIVITIES

The Bank has continued to reinforce its strategic relationships during 2009 with various
development partners, including bilateral aid
agencies, multilateral development institutions, African civil organizations, regional economic communities (RECs), and private sector
organizations. This has involved consultations
with representatives of all 18 bilateral and
multilateral development partners of the
Bank. These consultations helped to identify
common areas of interest and to examine

how best to collaborate in order to move
forward the African development agenda.

The purpose of the Bank’s partnerships and
cooperation activities is to supplement Bank
Group lending and human resource capacity through the mobilization of financial
inputs and technical assistance, mainly via
cofinancing, technical cooperation arrangements, and secondments. This approach is
ully in line with the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness.

Cofinancing Operations

During 2009 the Bank approved 36 cofinancing projects, compared to 31 in 2008. The
otal cost of these projects amounted to UA
9.16 billion, compared to UA 8.05 billion in
2008, which is an increase of 138.0 percent.
he Bank Group's contribution amounted to
UA 3.89 billion (20.3 percent of the total),
external partners contributed UA 11.66
billion (60.9 percent), while government
and other local contributions accounted for
UA 3.61 billion (18.8 percent). The amount
invested by the Bank Group in cofinancing
projects in 2009 is by far the highest since
he start of its activities (see Figure 3.11).

activities is also a record amount, mainly due
to the pooling of efforts by multilateral and
bilateral agencies to jointly cope with the
negative impact of the global financial crisis.

Over the 12-month period to end-December 2009, the Bank Group mobilized UA
11.66 billion from its external partners to
cofinance 28 national projects and 8 multinational projects, compared with UA 4.74
billion in 2008, i.e. an increase of 141.8
percent (see Table 3.1). The volume mobilized in 2009 from multilateral and bilateral
partners was UA 4.75 billion, which is a 3.2
percent increase over the UA 4.60 billion
mobilized in 2008. Among the multilateral
partners, the main cofinanciers were: the
World Bank, the European Union (EU), the
European Investment Bank (EIB), the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), and the OPEC
Fund. The principal bilateral cofinanciers
were France, the United Kingdom, Japan, the
Netherlands, and Germany (see Figure 3.12).

In addition to contributions from multilateral and bilateral partners, a further UA 6.92
billion was provided by private sector insti
tutions, compared to UA 139.2 million in
2008. The private sector played a key role by
financing 3 regional and 6 national projects.

Local firms, governments, and other beneficiaries committed UA 3.61 billion to
projects and programs in 2009, a 95.1 percent increase from 2008 when the local
contribution stood at UA 1.85 billion.

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

The sector that benefited the most from cofinancing in 2009 was infrastructure (power,
transportation, communications, and water
and sanitation), which rose sharply to UA
13.96 billion from UA 1.05 billion in 2008.
This reflects the Bank's heavy investment in
power interconnections, to which public—private partnerships contributed UA 6.55 billion,
while the Bank and multilateral partners

respectively. It also reflects the Bank’s selectivity in line with the priority areas identified
in its MTS, namely to focus on infrastructure
projects in its RMCs and thereby enhance
regional integration. The second largest beneficiary was the social sector, which received
UA 2.64 billion; followed by multisector, UA
1.73 billion (see Table 3.1).

Technical

Cooperation Activities

The Bank mobilizes and manages Technical
Cooperation Funds (TCFs), as well as inkind expertise (technical assistance, seconded staff, etc.) from donors to complement
its own resources. During 2009, a total of
16 staff was seconded to the Bank and 10
Technical Assistance experts continued to
work with the Bank. The TCFs were provided

This chapter focuses on operations during 2009 for the Bank Group as a whole, and then for each of its three windows (ADB, ADF, and
NTF). The analysis includes approvals by sector, financing instrument, and subregion, with cumulative figures since 1967 for each of the 3
windows. This is followed by a breakdown of Bank approvals for each of the 5 African subregions. Profiles of all the projects and programs
approved by the ADB, ADF and NTF during the year are presented at the end of Part |.

OVERVIEW
OF BANK GROUP
OPERATIONS

The Bank Group loan, grant, and other
approvals in 2009 amounted to UA 8.06
billion, which is more than double the 2008
evel of UA 3.53 billion (see Figure 4.1). Of
he total approvals for 2009, UA 7.51 billion
was for loans and grants, compared to UA
3.17 billion in 2008; while UA 558.8 milion went to debt relief, private sector equity
participation, guarantees, loan reallocations,
and special funds allocations. The 4 largest
approvals in 2009 were for: the Medupi
Power Project in South Africa (UA 1.73 bilion); the Economic Diversification Support
Program in Botswana (UA 969.0 million);
he Competitiveness and Public Sector
Efficiency Support Program in Mauritius
(UA 437.3 million); and a Line of Credit
0 the Global Trade Liquidity Program (UA
322.1 million).

 

The distribution of total approvals among
Bank Group windows for the year was:
ADB, UA 5.60 billion (69.5 percent), the
ADF, UA 2.43 billion (30.1 percent), and the
NTF, UA 5.7 million (0.1 percent). Special
funds accounted for UA 27.8 million (0.3
percent). There was an increase of 209.4
percent in the ADB's total approvals for 2009
compared with 2008. Similarly, ADF's total
approvals rose by 45.5 percent relative to
2008 approvals. Special Funds approvals
decreased slightly from UA 28.2 million in
2008 to UA 27.8 million in 2009.

Bank Group Operations

by Sector

In 2009 Bank Group operations continued
to reflect the country strategies and development priorities of RMCs. The significant
increase in total approvals during 2009 relative to 2008 reflects the Bank's policy of
selectivity, project focus and effectiveness,
and the rising demand for infrastructure

also addressed through interventions in agriculture and rural development, and by financing operations in the social sector (education

and health). In addition, targeting financial

resources at infrastructure demonstrates the

Bank's selectivity toward high-impact projects

that will improve the climate for private sector investment, enhance competitiveness and

productivity, increase employment, and support sustainable growth.

Bank Group interventions in multisector
(loans and grants) stood at UA 2.19 billion
in 2009, which was a 200.1 percent increase
over the 2008 level of UA 728.5 million. This
reflects the Bank's determination to promote
good governance as a means of building
RMCs' institutional capacity for sound and
transparent fiscal management, which is

critical to foreign and domestic investment
and to encourage private sector activities. The
remaining 18.8 percent of Bank Group activities were distributed among the other sectors,
namely, finance (10.8 percent); social (3.0
percent); agriculture and rural development
(2.9 percent); industry, mining and quarrying
(1.5 percent); and environment (0.6 percent).

ADB OPERATIONS

The ADB window is the Bank's non-concessional lending arm through which it supports
development activities in 13 middle-income
countries and 2 blend countries (Nigeria
and Zimbabwe). The latter 2 countries also
have access to ADF resources for project
and program financing. In addition, a key
focus of the ADB window is to support the
private sector in all RMCs by providing direct
loans, lines of credit, equity participation,
and guarantees to financially viable private enterprises and multinational projects
that will enhance the regional integration
of RMCs.

In 2009 the ADB approved a total of UA
5.60 billion for 84 activities, compared with
UA 1.81 billon in 2008 for 58 operations;
this represents an increase of 209.4 percent

(see Figure 4.4). The pronounced rise in total
approvals was mainly due to increases in
both project lending and policy-based loans.

ADB Approvals by

Financing Instrument

Project lending and policy-based loans are
the 2 main financing instruments for the ADB.
Project lending is specific in nature, while
policy-based lending is designed to help
RMCs improve their macroeconomic policy,
and for structural and sectoral adjustment,
budget support, and institutional reforms.
Project lending, comprising public and publicly guaranteed loans and private sector
approvals (including private equity and private guarantees), increased from UA 1.54
billion in 2008 to UA 3.94 billion in 2009 —a
rise of 155.8 percent. Similarly, policy-based
lending increased to UA 1.52 billion in 2009,
from UA 136.4 million in 2008 (see Table
4.2). The significant increase in policy-based
lending in 2009 was due to the 2 budget
support loans to Botswana and Mauritius.
The other financing instruments were grants,
which amounted to UA 25.1 million in 2009
—arrise of 84.6 percent over the 2008 level
of UA 13.6 million. Allocation for debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative declined marginally
from UA 113.8 million in 2008 to UA 112.8

Annual Report 2003

(including non-sovereign loans) amounted
to UA 20.03 billion. By year-end 2009, 785
loans had been fully disbursed totaling UA
17.55 billion, representing 87.6 percent of
cumulative disbursements.

ADF OPERATIONS

The ADF window is the Bank Group's concessionary lending arm for countries that
cannot access funds from the ADB window,
other than for enclave and private sector
projects. ADF resources are allocated on the
basis of country creditworthiness, per capita
GNI, and country performance using the
Performance-Based Allocation (PBA) system.
The PBA is the Bank's main mechanism to
ensure that more resources are proportionately allocated to those RMCs that will use
them most effectively.

In 2009 ADF approvals comprising loans,
grants, project preparation facility, debt and
debt service reduction, and loan reallocations stood at UA 2.43 billion, compared

to UA 1.67 billion in 2008 — an increase of
45.5 percent (see Figure 4.7 and Table 4.3).

ADF Approvals by

Financing Instruments

With respect to project lending (loans) for
financing public sector operations in RMCs,
the Fund approved UA 951.3 million for 25
activities in 2009, compared to UA 681.8
million in 2008 for 24 activities. ADF project
lending in 2009 constituted an increase of
39.5 percent over the previous year. Policybased lending that involved financing sector
activities and budget support declined from
UA 413.0 million in 2008 to UA 349.2 million in 2009. Overall, approvals for project
and policy-based loans by the Fund increased
to UA 1.30 billion in 2009, compared to UA
1.09 billion in 2008.

In 2009 grant approvals increased by 56.1
percent to UA 862.8 million, compared to
UA 552.6 million in 2008. Allocations for
debt relief also increased significantly over
the same period, from UA 18.0 million in
2008 to UA 259.1 million in 2009.

which are principally ADB countries, accounted for 18.5 percent, while the share of multiregional operations was 10.8 percent. This
is consistent with the Bank Group's operational policy, whereby ADF resources are
mainly used for operations in low-income
and blend countries.

Loan Portfolio

As at December 31, 2009, the cumulative
loans and grants signed (net of cancelations),
amounted to UA 18.86 billion, compared to
UA 16.76 billion in 2008. Total outstanding loans stood at UA 5.43 billion at yearend 2009, compared to UA 4.87 billion at
year-end 2008. This 11.5 percent increase
was despite the debt cancelation under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative totaling UA
207.78 million for 2 additional completion
point countries. At the end of 2009, there
were 1,138 active signed loans and grants,
while 1,101 loans amounting to UA 6.43
billion had been fully repaid.

Disbursements

At year-end 2009, disbursements of loans
and grants amounted to UA 1.73 billion
compared with UA 1.13 billion in 2008 — an
increase of 53.1 percent. Cumulative disbursements as at December 31, 2009 stood
at UA 13.61 billion. A total of 1,583 loans
and grants were fully disbursed, amounting
to UA 10.67 billion, representing 78.4 percent of cumulative disbursements.

NTF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) was established by the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
to provide concessional financing to the
Bank's RMCs. The overall aim of the NTF is
to provide additional resources for projects
in various sectors, in order to enhance economic development and social progress in
Africa, particularly in the least developed
countries (LDCs).

In 2009 there was one loan approved under
the NTF window amounting to UA 5.0 million for The Gambia. In addition, UA 0.7 million was approved as debt relief under the
HIPC Initiative for Burundi and Togo.

Cumulative NTF Loan

and Grant Approvals by
Subregion, 1976-2009

During the period 1976-2009 the NTF
approved UA 309.6 million for 72 operations in 31 RMCs. The regional distribution
of NTF approvals shows that West Africa
received the largest allocation, followed
by East Africa, Southern Africa, and North
Africa. Multiregional projects accounted for
4.5 percent of NTF cumulative approvals
(see Figure 4.10).

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2009, rose slightly to UA
245.81 million, compared to UA 240.81 million at the end of 2008. At year-end 2009,
there were 32 active signed loans and 38Figure 4.10: Cumulative NTF

Disbursements

NTF disbursements decreased to UA 4.87
million in 2009, from UA 8.46 million in
2008, representing a decline of 42.43 percent. This fall was due to the absence of
loan approvals in 2007 and 2008 from this
window. As at December 31, 2009, cumulative disbursements amounted to UA 221.69
million. Sixty loans were fully disbursed for a
total UA 200.20 million, representing 90.31
percent of cumulative disbursements.

BANK GROUP
OPERATIONS BY
SUBREGION

Bank Group Loan and Grant
Approvals by Subregion

For operational purposes, the Bank divides
Africa into 5 subregions, namely, Central
Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern
Africa, and West Africa. In 2009 Bank Group

approvals for all 5 subregions (including multinational projects and programs) amounted to UA 7.51 billion, allocated as follows:
Southern Africa, UA 3.40 billion (45.2 percent); West Africa, UA 1.24 billion (16.6 percent); North Africa, UA 1.05 billion (14.0
percent); East Africa, UA 515.6 million (6.9
percent); and Central Africa, UA 274.9 million (3.7 percent). Approvals for multinational projects and programs in 2009 stood
at UA 1.03 billion (13.7 percent). The Bank
Group’s cumulative (1967-2009) loan and
grant approvals for the 5 subregions and
multinational operations totaled UA 52.26
billion, of which multinational operations
accounted for UA 3.39 billion (see Annex II-7).

Southern Africa

Southern Africa is made up of 12 countries, namely, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe. The countries eligible for ADB
resources are Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia,
South Africa, and Swaziland. The others have
access to ADF resources only, except for pri
Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

 

vate sector and enclave projects. Zimbabwe
as a blend country can access funds from
both ADB and ADF windows, although it has
been under sanctions since 2000. In 2009
Bank Group loan and grant approvals to the
subregion rose to UA 3.40 billion, from UA
475.9 million in 2008, representing a 614.4
percent increase (see Annex II-7).

The 11 beneficiary countries in 2009 were:
South Africa, UA 1.73 billion; Botswana,
UA 1.11 billion; Mauritius, UA 437.9 million; Malawi, UA 49.1 million; Mozambique,
UA 31.6 million; Lesotho, UA 17.4 million;
Angola, UA 12.0 million; Zimbabwe, UA 1.3
million; Madagascar, UA 1.1 million; Namibia,
UA 0.6 million; and Zambia, UA 0.3 million.
South Africa, which has consistently been
the largest beneficiary in the subregion since
2007, also received the highest share in
2009.

 

Some of the major approvals in 2009 for the
subregion were: the Medupi Power Project
in South Africa; the Economic Diversification
Support Program and the Morupule Power

Project in Botswana; the Competitiveness
and Public Sector Efficiency Program (CPSE)
or Mauritius; the Trunk Road Rehabilitation
Blantyre-Zomba Road in Malawi; and the
Niassa Provincial Towns Water Supply and
Sanitation in Mozambique (see Profiles of
Projects and Programs at the end of Part 1).

Approvals for the subregion supported 5
sectors in 2009: infrastructure at UA 1.94
billion (57.2 percent); multisector at UA 1.42
billion (41.9 percent); agriculture and rural
development at UA 17.5 million (0.5 percent), environment at UA 12.0 million (0.4
percent) and UA 0.6 million to the social
sector. This distribution reflects the Bank's
‘ocus on projects that support rapid economic growth and promote good governance in RMCs.

 

The Bank Group started its operations in
the subregion in 1969. From 1969-2009,
Southern Africa was allocated cumulative Bank Group loans and grants of UA
10.41 billion. This represents 19.9 percent

and industry (6.1 percent) (see Figure 4.11).

West Africa

West Africa comprises 16 countries: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, The
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tomé and
Principe (Sao Tomé and Principe is included in
West Africa for operational purposes), Senegal,
Sierra Leone, and Togo. It is the subregion with
the greatest diversity in terms of its linguistic,
geographical, and natural resources characteristics. All the countries in the subregion (apart
from Nigeria) are eligible to borrow only from
ADF resources, except for private sector and
enclave projects. As a blend country, Nigeria
can borrow from both ADB and ADF windows.
West Africa's allocation of Bank Group loan
and grant approvals increased by 96.1 percent from UA 633.5 million in 2008 to UA
1.24 billion in 2009, making West Africa the
second highest recipient of approvals in 2009,
after Southern Africa.

In 2009 approvals to West Africa represented
16.5 percent of total approved loans and
grants (see Annex II-7). All the 16 countries in the subregion benefited from loans
and grants. They include: Nigeria (UA 365.0
million); Céte d'Ivoire (UA 324.8 million);
Senegal (UA 169.5 million); Ghana (UA
117.4 million); Burkina Faso (UA 62.6 million); Mali (UA 49.5 million); Cape Verde
(UA 37.0 million); Sierra Leone (UA 36.3
million); Benin (UA 22.0 million); GuineaBissau (UA 14.1 million); Liberia (UA 13.8
million); Togo (UA 12.8 million); The Gambia

The major projects approved in 2009 for
the subregion include: the Economic and
Power Sector Reform Program (EPSERP),
LOCs to Intercontinental Bank PLC, Zenith
Bank PLC, and United Bank for Africa PLC,
all in Nigeria; the Ghana Cocoa Board First
& Second Phases, and the Sendou Power
Project in Senegal. In terms of the sectoral
distribution of 2009 approvals for the subregion, infrastructure received the largest
allocation at UA 485.6 million (39.1 percent), followed by multisector, UA 427.0
million (34.4 percent); finance, UA 263.0
million (21.2 percent); agriculture and rural
development, UA 59.5 million (4.8 percent);
and the social sector, UA 7.0 million (0.6
percent). This distribution underscores the
Bank’s selectivity and strategic focus on
projects that would enhance infrastructural
development, promote good governance,
and reduce poverty in RMCs.

The cumulative Bank Group loan and grant
approvals to the subregion (1967-2009)
amounted to UA 11.37 billion, representing 21.8 percent of total cumulative allocations. Nigeria received the largest share,

sector, UA 67.0 million (6.4 percent); agriculture and rural development, UA 50.0 million (4.8 percent); and urban development,
UA 0.6 million (0.1 percent). Since 2007,
the Bank Group has continuously accorded
infrastructure development a high priority
in the subregion, in line with its operational
focus in the MTS (2008-2012).

The Bank Group started operations in the
North Africa subregion in 1968 — a year
later than in the other subregions. From
1968-2009, North Africa received the highest cumulative loan and grant approvals of
UA 14.78 billion, accounting for 28.3 percent of Bank Group loan and grant approvals (see Annex II-7). Figure 4.13 presents
the cumulative Bank Group loan and grant
approvals for the subregion by sector for the

Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

period 1968-2009. The 3 key sectors were
infrastructure (39.9 percent), finance (21.4
percent), and multisector (17.1 percent).

East Africa

East Africa comprises 12 countries: Burundi,
Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania, and Uganda. Seychelles is eligible
to borrow from the ADB window, whereas
the other 11 countries are eligible for ADF
resources only, except for private sector and
enclave projects. In 2009 East Africa was
allocated UA 515.6 million of Bank Group
loan and grants, 9.5 percent less than the UA
569.9 million approved in 2008. The approvals for 2009 were earmarked for financing
operations in 9 countries representing 6.9
percent of total approvals (see Annex II-7).
The recipient countries were Tanzania (UA
152.0 million), Kenya (UA 135.0 million),
Uganda (UA 128.7 million), Rwanda (UA
57.3 million), Comoros (UA 15.9 million),
Seychelles (UA 13.7 million), Burundi (UA
10.7 million), Eritrea (UA 2.0 million), and
Djibouti (UA 0.3 million).

Bank Group approvals in 2009 for this subregion were directed mainly toward infrastructure at UA 386.0 million (74.9 percent),
followed by multisector, UA 62.2 million
(12.1 percent), agriculture and rural development, UA 56.0 million (11.0 percent),
and the social sector, UA 10.7 million (2.1
percent). The continued focus of the Bank
Group’s operations on infrastructure and
multisector in this subregion aligns with
the Bank's goal of creating the optimum
conditions to build a strong economy, by (i)
fostering a business-enabling environment
and (ii) promoting good governance as a
means of strengthening RMCs' institutional
capacity for sound and transparent fiscal
management that would lay a solid foundation for poverty reduction and economic
development.

Key infrastructure projects approved for the
subregion include: the Road Sector Support

Annual Report 2003

Central Africa

The Central Africa subregion consists of
7 countries: Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon.
Gabon and Equatorial Guinea are eligible
to borrow from the ADB window, while the
other 5 countries can borrow only from
ADF resources, except for private sector
and enclave projects. In 2009 the subregion received UA 274.9 million, representing
3.7 percent of total Bank Group loan and
grant approvals. The total approvals for this
subregion in 2009 represent an increase of
271.5 percent over the 2008 level, which
was UA 74.0 million.

The 6 countries that benefited from loan and
grant approvals in 2009 were Gabon, with
UA 102 million; the Democratic Republic
of Congo, UA 65.0 million; Cameroon,
UA 43.4 million; Chad, UA 32.2 million;
Central African Republic, UA 19.5 million;
and Congo, UA 12.8 million (see Annex |I-7).
Major projects approved in the subregion
during 2009 include: the Support Project
for the Improvement of Higher Education
and Vocational Training in Gabon; the
Emergency Program to Mitigate the Impact
of the Financial Crisis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo; the Semi-Urban Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation in Cameroon;
the Koumra—Sarh Road Development in
Chad; and the Brazzaville and Pointe Noire
Sanitation Project in Congo.

The sectoral distribution of 2009 approvals

for the subregion indicates that the social

sector received the highest allocation of UA
111.3 million (40.5 percent), followed by

infrastructure, UA 94.7 million (34.4 percent),
multisector, UA 65.0 million (23.6 percent),
and agriculture UA 3.9 million (1.4 percent).
The allocation of substantial resources to the

social sector, infrastructure, and multisector
is in harmony with the Bank's goal of assisting RMCs progress toward attaining critical

MDGs and promoting infrastructural development and good governance.

Chapter 008 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

During the year under review, the Bank Group continued to implement its institutional reforms in order to improve its corporate performance, the quality of its operations, and its development effectiveness. The Bank also pursued its vision of becoming the premier development institution for the continent, a center of excellence for knowledge and research, and the preeminent voice on Africa’s development
issues. This chapter provides the program of the Bank in the various functional areas toward realizing these strategic objectives.

INSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS

The Board of Directors approved a comprehensive set of institutional reforms in 2006
and 2007. Implementation of these reforms,
which continued in 2009, has: (i) strengthened the link between institutional priorities
and resource allocation; (ii) enhanced institutional budget flexibility through increased
fungibility and devolved authority; (iii) established a new accountability and performance framework by linking deliverables to
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); and (iv)
introduced a consolidated, multi-year programming and budgeting framework. The
institutional reforms cover enhanced corporate services delivery, budget reforms, decentralization, and improved operations busiNess processes, as detailed below.

Improved Coordination

and Corporate Performance
Monitoring

In 2009, in accordance with commitments
made in the 2008-2012 Medium-Term
Strategy (MTS), the Bank established and
filled the position of Chief Operating Officer.
The COO has the responsibility of ensuring
overall coherence and coordination across
Complexes, alignment of resources to strategic priorities, and enhanced monitoring
and management of corporate performance.

Coordination and review of management
and operational processes have been further
enhanced through strengthening the role
of the Senior Management Coordinating
Committee (SMCC) and the Operations
Committee (OpsCom). The SMCC has
played a pivotal role in ensuring that the
Bank Group's functions operate with optimal

Annual Report 2009

efficiency and effectiveness, and in arbitrating cross-Complex resource allocation in line
with strategic priorities. In 2009, a Task Force
was appointed to carry out a review of the
implementation of the Presidential Directives
on the operations review process, including
the establishment and operationalization of
OpsCom and country teams.

Key priorities for the COO Office include
the effective implementation and sustained
focus on the ambitious institutional reform
agenda approved by the Boards of Governors
in 2006 to boost the Bank's delivery capacity
and institutionalize a results-based culture.

Budget Reforms

Strengthened linkage between institutional
priorities and resource allocation: Country
Work Programs have now been developed
0 align to the institutional priorities set
out in the Bank Group's 2008-2012 MTS.
his Strategy took as one of its key objecives, to ensure that the Bank would be
recognized globally by 2012, particularly by
its shareholders, as a preferred DFI partner
in Africa, providing high-impact, sharplyocused development assistance and soluions. In line with the MTS, the Bank has
continued to focus on selected priority areas,
resulting in increased funding for infrastrucure development, improved governance,
private sector projects and programs, and
skills development through higher educaion. Underpinning the success is a greater
emphasis on results, rigor in implementation
and monitoring, continuing improvement in
business processes and efficiency, intensified
country dialogue, and a more systematic
matching of resources to priorities. These
are discussed more fully below.

 

Enhanced institutional budget flexibility
through fungibility and devolved authority:
Managers now have more discretion in the
use of their budgets and in ensuring costeffectiveness. This provides them with the
flexibility to adapt the mix of inputs as they
consider appropriate in line with service
requirements, instead of having to justify
their decisions and to seek approval from
Senior Management.

New accountability and performance monitoring framework: Performance and efficiency indicators have been developed at institutional and Complex levels, and performance monitoring is now the central tool for
enforcing accountability. The Bank no longer
uses the budget as a control mechanism but
rather as a way of ensuring that resources
are efficiently and effectively used to deliver
the agreed work programs.

KPIs monitoring: The new accountability and
performance system, linking program deliverables to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs),
is shown in Table 5.1. The table presents the
2009 results of monitoring the KPIs for institutional effectiveness, by comparing targets
to actual implementation results. Almost all
indicators show satisfactory results during
the year, with actual performance exceeding
the targets in some cases. As the Economic
and Sector Work (ESW) has fallen below
its target, the Bank will continue to closely
monitor this indicator.

Multi-year budgeting: A multi-year budgeting system was implemented in 2009, based
on the approval by the Boards of a 3-year
rolling Program and Budget Document (PBD)
for 2009-2011. The PDB aims to ensure that
the Bank grows and delivers results on theCorporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 005

Operational Program (IOP), Indicative NonOperational Program (INOP) and Budget
Document have been merged, thus providing a clearer picture of how resources are
aligned with the work program.

UA budgeting: The final phase of the budget
reform is the implementation of a strategy
and work program-driven Unit of Account
(UA) budgeting system, with expanded fungibility and fully decentralized resource management for delivery of the work program.
his is expected to enable Vice-President
Units (VPUs) to determine their staffing
needs and actions required to meet those
needs, and to mitigate the potential risk of
overspending on staff costs through staff
lanning, fixed cost ratio (FCR), and time
recording system (TRS).

Decentralization

n 2004 the Bank had approved a
Decentralization Strategy that paved the way
or the opening of 25 Field Offices (FOs) by
end-2006. By end-2009, 26 FOs including a
regional office (RO) in South Africa had been
opened. However, only 23 of these FOs were
ully staffed and functioning, although with
different levels of staffing mix and strategies.
he other 3 are now operational but not yet
ully functioning. Following the recommendations of an independent evaluation of
he implementation of the Decentralization
Strategy and the 10-point agenda for fastracking the implementation of the Strategy
roposed by a Presidential Working Group
in 2008, the Bank established a Task Force
© review the Decentralization Program in
2009. The recommendations of the Task
Force will be presented to the Boards of
Directors in 2010.

he 2009 evaluation shows that decenralization has had a positive impact on a
number of Bank Group KPIs. This includes:
(i) enhanced dialogue with RMCs; (ii) chairing or co-chairing thematic or budget support working groups in RMCs where there

 

Annual Report 2009

is a country office; (iii) improved portfolio
management, disbursements, and procurement processes; and (iv) closer coordination
with other partners in line with the Paris
Declaration commitments. There has also
been closer supervision of projects and better
monitoring of the attainment of MDGs by
RMCs.A significant milestone in decentralization in 2009 was the business model that
was launched by the Bank, which involves
the establishment of regional service centers
in Central, East, West, North, and Southern
Africa. Although the overall fiduciary responsibility rests with Bank Headquarters, the
regional service centers are making headway in facilitating procurement and financial
management services to clients.

Operations

Business Processes

Since the introduction of the reforms of the
Operations Business Processes within the
Bank Group in 2006, considerable progress
as been made in setting up and strengthening units responsible for sharpening the
Bank's strategic focus, thus reinforcing its
mandate and its emphasis on managingor-results. The Bank Group is in this way
shifting from an approvals to a results-based
culture. Positive outcomes of the reforms
include enhanced cross-Complex coordinaion, empowered country teams, and streamined processes for greater strategic alignment and delivery.

Furthermore, in order to improve service
delivery at the country level, a comprehensive revision of the Delegation of Authority
Matrix (DAM) has been carried out. Within
his framework, FOs now have delegated
authority for loan negotiations and signaure, loan administration, portfolio management, project supervision, dialogue and
communication with RMCs and cooperating partners. This is proving to be beneficial
in terms of reducing the average project
processing times, from 24 months in 2006
to 11.2 months in 2009. Similarly, the average procurement time declined from 70

 

weeks to 59 weeks over the same timeframe.
In 2009 the Bank introduced the monthly
“Outliers and Exceptions Report,” which enabled Management and task managers to
monitor portfolio performance. These efforts
should help to further strengthen the culture
of continuous monitoring and supervision of
operations and routine tracking of results.

COMPLIANCE REVIEW
AND MEDIATION

The Independent Review Mechanism (IRM)
was established as an expression of the
Bank's commitment to enhancing good governance and transparency, and to maintain
the highest standards of due diligence in
order to ensure operational effectiveness. In
2009 the Board endorsed the Management
Action Plan for addressing the findings and
recommendations of the Review Panel on
the Bujagali Hydropower and Transmission
Projects in Uganda.

Two of the 3 complaints registered in 2009
concerned the Gibe Ill Hydroelectric Power
Project in Ethiopia. The 2 complainants
alleged the following: (i) environmental and
social harm to Lake Turkana and the population living around the lake and downstream
of the Gibe Ill dam along the Omo river;
and (ii) violation of Bank policies, including
procurement rules. Mediation is underway
regarding the first complaint, and the eligibility review of the second awaits conclusion
of the first. The third complaint concerns the
Nuweiba Combined Cycle Project in Egypt,
alleging harm to marine life, local ecotourism,
and the livelihoods of tourism-beneficiary
communities. Mediation of the complaint
is still in progress.

 

In 2009 the Bank undertook sensitization
campaigns regarding the IRM process for
populations in RMCs where the Bank is
funding operations. Community awareness
meetings were held in 3 RMCs and national
workshops were conducted in 5 countries.
A regional workshop organized in Dakar forCSOs was attended by representatives from
7 countries. In mid-2009, the Bank commissioned an independent review of the operating rules and procedures of IRM, the findings of which were presented to an informal
Board meeting. Following their observations
and recommendations, the report will be
considered by the Board in 2010. The IRM
website (www.afdb.org/irm), the IRM annual
report, and a brochure produced in English,
French, Arabic, Portuguese, and Kiswahili,
provide further information on the IRM functions and procedures.

EVALUATION
OF OPERATIONS

he operations evaluation function of the
Bank was consolidated in 2009 by restructuring and recruiting additional staff to enhance
the Bank's evaluation capacity. This was
urther strengthened through appropriate
staff training. Operations staff increased
heir delivery of Project Completion Reports
PCRs) in 2009, with 91 percent of them
submitted on time.

n 2009 independent evaluations were
undertaken in a number of areas, notaly agriculture, education, decentralizaion, and quality-at-entry of operations, as
well as evaluation of selected projects and
country programs. A major evaluation of
jolicies and operations in agriculture and
rural development was undertaken jointly
with the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD). This evaluation underinned the development of the Bank's new
Agriculture and Rural Development (ARD)
Strategy. The findings and recommendations
of the evaluation are detailed in Chapter 3.

 

The Bank undertook 2 independent evaluations on the Bank Group's progress in implementing its Decentralization Strategy and
on the quality-at-entry of ADF interventions
during 2005-2008. The goal was to provide
evidence and analysis to inform the ADFXI! Mid-Term Review. The first evaluation

report indicated that good progress had
been achieved but that much remained to
be done to attain the desired operational
results. Although increased Bank presence
in the field has strengthened portfolio management and raised the institution's public
profile, it is too early to see improvements in
project performance linked to the decentralization process. The second evaluation report
revealed modest improvements in qualityat-entry, but it also raised concerns about
the treatment of poverty, gender, and environmental aspects in the design of projects
and programs.

An evaluation of AfDB assistance to Cape
Verde reported a success story. Bank assistance over recent years was satisfactory and
has contributed significantly to Cape Verde's
successful transition to MIC status. The joint
ADB/World Bank evaluation of assistance to
Uganda found that the Bank's assistance
had produced moderately satisfactory results.
It recommended increased country presence
with additional specialists for sectors where
the Bank plans to increase its engagement.

Knowledge development: Key lessons
learnt from high-level (corporate, country,
and sector) evaluations indicate the following:

(a) Critical success factors were: (i) good
governance and sustained commitment
to reforms; (ii) the institutional location
of a project management unit; and (iii)
robust management arrangements;

(b) Constraints to success were attributable to: (i) inefficient implementation
at both the Borrower and Bank levels;
(ii) underestimating the value of highquality analytical work and long-term
planning; and (iii) not addressing the
operational constraints on the Bank’s
effectiveness and impact, and not identifying and building on success with a
focus on results-based management.

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 005

INTERNAL AUDIT,
INTEGRITY, AND
ANTI-CORRUPTION

The Internal Audit of the Bank provides
independent and objective assurance,
advisory, and consulting services for Bank
Group operations, finance and corporate
administrative activities. In 2009 the Bank
conducted audits of: 11 finance and corporate Complexes; 20 trust and grant funds; 9
projects in RMCs; and 6 Field Offices. It also
provided training and advisory services to a
number of RMCs' project implementation
personnel and Bank staff on the auditing
of Bank-funded projects.

he Bank Group undertakes investigations
into allegations of fraud, corruption, and
other misconduct relating to its operations.
During 2009 the Bank received 41 such
complaints, of which 11 were reviewed and
closed, one was referred to the Corporate
Human Resources Department, another to
e Security Services for action, and the rest
re in the pipeline for review and/or invesigation. The Bank's Hotline received 339
tivolous or advance-fee fraud complaints.
e Bank’s policy is to review all complaints
at are received and determine whether to
proceed with full investigations or simply
ile them as frivolous. Complaints of a spam
nature are systematically referred to the
Security Service for action where necessary.

o

 

 

he Bank undertook 7 integrity and anticorruption awareness campaigns for Bank
staff in Tunis and in the FOs, held 2 anticorruption workshops for project implemenation personnel of NGOs in 2 RMCs, and
conducted regular induction sessions for
new Bank staff.

GENERAL COUNSEL
AND LEGAL SERVICES

During 2009 the Bank approved the restructuring of the Legal Services function into
4 divisions, thereby enhancing its ability
to deliver timely and quality legal services
throughout the Bank. The restructuring will
strengthen the Bank's capacity to mitigate
the growing risks arising from its increased
non-sovereign lending portfolio. The Legal
Services function has also been active in the
negotiation process of the Sixth General
Capital Increase of the Bank (GCI-VI), and
in the ongoing consultations for an early
ADF-XII Replenishment.

n 2009 the Bank organized a Constitutive
Assembly to launch the African Legal Support
Facility (ALSF). This is an autonomous international organization that seeks to assist
RMCs to negotiate complex commercial
ransactions, especially in the extractive
industries, energy, and infrastructure secors. ALSF also helps RMCs to defend their
interests against commercial vulture credi‘ors preying on countries through aggressive
itigation, based on the countries’ limited
experience and vulnerability. Such litigations
y vulture creditors erode the RMCs' benefits accruing from HIPC, MDRI, and other
comparable debt relief initiatives.

 

n response to the financial and economic
crisis, in 2009 the Bank, through its Legal
Services, concluded the following:

¢ A number of policy-based operations
(PBOs), while ensuring that the legal
risks inherent in its non-sovereign risk
portfolio were properly evaluated and
mitigated;

e =A multi-jurisdiction and multi-party bond

guarantee in favor of Seychelles to hedge
its public debt;

Annual Report 2009

¢ Collaboration with the International
Finance Corporation to establish a
Global Trade Liquidity Program (GTLP);
and

e The syndication of a Trade Finance
Facility in support of Ghana's cocoa
production and export sector.

During the year the Legal Services function
enabled the Bank to realize the following:

© Contracts for rehabilitation of the Bank
headquarters building in Abidjan, and
leasing or buying real estate properties
for Field Offices;

© Conclusion of host country agreements
with Algeria, Angola, and South Africa;

e¢ A Memorandum of Understanding
between the Congo Basin Forest Fund
and the Albert Il of Monaco Foundation;
and

¢ The implementation of the Bank's borrowing program, including the successful
completion of the Turkish Lira Uridashi
issue.

KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT AND
DEVELOPMENT

Development Research

Since the approval of the Knowledge
Management and Development (KMD)
Strategy (2008-2012) by the Board in
2008, significant progress has been made
in enhancing the Bank's knowledge capacity. In particular, the Bank has scaled up its
visibility, strengthened intellectual capacity,
as well as mainstreamed knowledge in its
operations. In the wake of the food and
financial crises, the Bank demonstrated the
importance of knowledge in facilitating swift
policy and operational decisions that have
a positive impact on the continent's development. During 2009 the Committee of

en Ministers of Finance and Central Bank
Governors (the C-10) set up a forum to monior the crisis and coordinate Africa's response
at various levels. This created an important
platform for building an African voice and
common position around key issues that
ed into the important G-10 global process.

he Bank also benefited from seminars
organized for the network of economists
and this helped improve the quality-atentry of projects in private sector operaions through the institutionalization of the
ramework for ex-ante Additionality and
Development Outcomes Assessment (ADOA)
(see Box 5.1).

 

Knowledge Generation from Economic
and Sector Work (ESW): As noted in
Chapter 3, the Bank has continued to build
its stock of knowledge to underpin its operational and country programming work. A
2009 Bank study on the international competitiveness of the Egyptian economy found
that it had performed impressively since the
reforms of 2004. The country’s international
competitiveness however has not kept pace,
largely due to chronic budgetary deficits,
inflation, and low labor productivity resulting
from the inappropriate skills mix combined
with labor market rigidities.

The study recommended Bank Group intervention in the following areas:

 

(i) Providing Technical Assistance (TA) and
institutional support; and

(i

Supporting entrepreneurial skills development by funding small- and mediumscale investments (SMIs) through lines of
credit from its own resources and leveraged funds from development partners.

Similarly, in 2009 the Bank undertook a
review of Nigeria’s Governance Profile (GP)
as a basis for formulating the Bank Group's
intervention strategy during the MTS period.
The review took into account recent eventsBox 5.1: Additionality and Development Outcomes Assessment (ADDA)

The Board approved the revised ADOA framework on September 8, 2009 and
emphasized the need for more economic and sector work (ESW) to guide private
sector operations. The first study being reviewed under ADOA maps the power sector
across Africa with a view to informing the financing of large energy projects. Findings
from this study will contribute to the design of better public-private partnerships.

The second study will investigate how short-term deposits in African banks can be
leveraged, while exploring the extent to which the Bank can play a catalytic role.
Under the ADOA framework, the Bank plans to investigate which sectors generate
the highest developmental returns, and this information will feed into the selection
of its private sector interventions. In addition, it will also embark on a mapping
exercise of the financial sector in each of the Bank's RMCs.

and findings of various relevant studies o
the Nigerian socioeconomic situation. It outlined key recent improvements in the countrys economic governance but also noted
that many weaknesses remain, especially
concerning the malfunctioning of the lega
system. The review underscored that the task
of improving governance in Nigeria needs
to involve donors, the Nigerian Government,
and communities at all levels. The study recommended that the Bank focus its interventions at the state and local governmen
levels on:

Capacity building to improve resource
management and the formulation an
implementation of policies for strengthened accountability and oversight;

i) Providing linkages between the Nationa
Economic Empowerment Developmen
Strategy (NEEDS) and the State Economic
and Empowerment Strategy (SEEDS);

(iii) Building capacity in agencies relate
to the Nigerian Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (NEITI), including promoting engagement of the civi
society to ensure accountability; and

(iv) Direct engagement with the private sector beyond the granting of lines of credit.

 

Capacity Building and
Training Activities in RMCs
Cognizant of the need for the Bank to provide credible capacity-building activities for
RMCs to drive the development process, the
Bank embarked on the preparation of a Bank
Group Capacity Development (CD) Strategy
in 2009. As part of the preparation of the
Strategy, the Bank organized a stakeholders’ validation workshop to undertake an
assessment of the CD needs of RMCs and
RECs. The CD Strategy aims at: (i) enhancing the development effectiveness of the
Bank's operations; (ii) strengthening RMCs'
capacity for policy dialogue and development
management; and (iii) building the Bank's
internal capacity. In order to better integrate capacity development efforts within
the Bank, the Board has also approved the
integration of the Joint Africa Institute (JAl)
within the Bank's structure.

Training and Capacity Development

The Bank has played a key role in capacity
building for RMC officials through its training
programs. It has organized a series of workshops to enhance Bank-funded projects in
order to achieve development impact. In this
regard, the Bank organized policy workshops
which were attended by 745 senior officials.
This included 16 Development Management
Training Workshops for RMC policymakers in

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 005

various key areas, namely, Public Financial
Management, Good Governance, Trade
Negotiation and Regulation, PerformanceBased Allocation, Public—Private Partnerships,
and the Global Financial Crisis.

Eminent Speakers

Four renowned personalities were invited
under the Eminent Speakers’ Program to
share their knowledge and experiences on
the development challenges facing the continent. Professor Ha-Joon Chang of Cambridge
University spoke on the “Economic History
of the Developed Worlds: Lessons for Africa.”
The next speaker was Professor Jacques Attali,
President of PlaNet Finance, on “Financial
Crisis and the Role of Microfinance,” followed by Dr Sadako Ogata, President of
the Japan International Cooperation Agency,
who spoke on “Peace and Development in
Africa: Upholding the Conditions.” The final
Guest Speaker in 2009 was Nobel Laureate
Professor Wangari Maathai, Co-Chairperson
of the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF), who
made a presentation on “Natural Resource
Management and Poverty Reduction:
Strengthening the Links.” The four seminars attracted 1,391 invited participants,
including members of the diplomatic corps
and the academia in Tunis.

Statistical

Support Activities

The Bank's statistical assistance to RMCs
in 2009 focused on: (i) enhancing operational effectiveness and financial services;
(ii) strengthening statistical capacity and
systems in RMCs; and (iii) improving
information dissemination through statistical
publications and online data access portal.

During 2009 statistical support to the Bank's
operational activities involved:

(i) Continued enhancement of the dissemination of operational and socioeconomic
data through the Bank’s Data Platform
(DP), including 6 publications on the
Bank's website;

Annual Report 2009Chapter 008 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

(ii) Providing data support for the African
Economic Outlook (AEO), including generating macroeconomic projections;

(iii) Establishing an infrastructure database, founded mainly on data collected
through the Africa Infrastructure Country
Diagnostic Study (AICD) in collaboration
with the World Bank;

(iv) Reviewing data issues in RMCs and
identifying the gaps that need to be
addressed to strengthen results measurement in Bank operations and country
systems; and

Ss

Establishing a database for the Africa
Bond Market Initiative and the study
on Making Finance Work for Africa to
develop domestic financial markets.

During the year, the Bank continued to
provide technical and financial support
to RMCs to improve statistical systems in
support of the results-based agenda, for
example in monitoring progress toward
the attainment of the MDGs. In this connection, the Bank was instrumental in
helping RMCs to design effective National
Statistical Development Strategies (NSDSs).
In addition, the Bank organized 20 training seminars and workshops in RMCs on
methodologies and internationally accepted
best practices for improving data quality
and building capacity.

INFORMATION

AND COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY

(ICT) MANAGEMENT

During the year, enhancements to the IT infrastructure aimed at building resilient local
and wide area networks (LAN/WAN) with
improved security to ensure stability and
connectivity between the TRA in Tunis and
the Field Offices (FOs). These initiatives are
the result of the IT infrastructure audit carried
out in 2009, which recommended immediate

Annual Report 2009

and short-term plans. These were implemented from the 4th quarter of 2009 to resolve
problems related to LAN/WAN design and
configuration, as a proactive approach to
the provision of IT services to the FOs. The
enhancements are in line with the MediumTerm Strategy (MTS) and the Decentralization
Strategy, which indicate that a substantial
number of staff from the Operations complexes would be field-based by 2012.

In 2009 the Bank carried out the Enterprise
Architecture (EA) study to develop an EA
framework to support the MTS and direct all
IT investments in the Bank. A skills assessment study was also carried out to support the MTS and the implementation of
the EA. New functions to strengthen IT in
project governance, business analysis, client
relationships, and business support functions have been established and the Skills
Assessment Study also recommended reclassification of job profiles to conform to IT
international standards.

The upgrading of SAP Human Resources
applications and SAP non-profit organization
(NPO) payroll for the FOs has been deployed
since August 2009. The TRA in Tunis continues to use SAP payroll in different currencies.
The HR Position Budget Control (PBC) interface which integrates the positions with the
budget module has also been implemented.

A project to upgrade the Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) System Application Product
(SAP) was initiated during the year. The
project will streamline business processes
and improve the functionalities and userfriendliness of the SAP modules used in the
Bank. The emphasis will be to reengineer
the project and loans management business
processes to effectively capture development results and outcomes. The IT strategy is
expected to be flexible yet robust, to enable
the Bank to respond swiftly and effectively
to the changing business environment, while
also consolidating all the studies undertaken
in 2009.

HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT

The Bank made good progress in providing
a quality service delivery and in attracting
and retaining a diverse workforce within the
context of the Human Resources Strategy
(2007-2011) and the ongoing Corporate
Services Reform agenda. The accelerated
and decentralized recruitment campaign
resulted in 286 new staff joining the Bank
during the year, including 22 young professionals (YPs). In addition, 247 staff were
promoted through internal competition and
in-situ recommendations.

he total staffing of the Bank stood at 1,654
at the end of December 2009. This includes
managerial/professional and General
Services staff in the Field Offices. Of the
otal staff, 1,022 were of Management and
Professional Level (PL), including advisors to
he Executive Directors. It is important to
note women make up 25.8 percent of this
‘otal. General Services staff (GS) numbered
632, of whom 54.4 percent are women
(see Table 5.2).

he implementation of the Bank's
Decentralization Strategy continued apace
in 2009, with the staffing of 25 Field Offices
(FOs) and the recruitment of 36 new staff.
his increased the number of locally recruited FO staff from 248 in 2008 to 284 in
2009. Furthermore, the Bank extended the
staff pension, education benefits, and the
Medical Plan to FOs, and also improved
Staff Retirement Plan benefits. In 2009 the
Bank adopted and enabled a new system of
performance evaluation, predicated on the
principles of results-based management and
multi-rater assessment. The result showed
that 86 percent of staff members received
feedback from their peers, while 50 percent of managers received feedback from
their subordinates. The Bank also developed
an improved Management and Leadership
Development program to build management
skills among staff.Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 005

Annual Report 2003ADMINISTRATIVE
SERVICES

The Bank continued to strengthen its administrative services in order to improve efficiency in its operational environment. In 2009 it
completed the outfitting of the newly leased
office building in Tunis. Other improvement measures included the adoption of a
new Travel Policy. In line with the Revised
Delegation of Authority, the Bank has decentralized its internal procurement process,
which has reduced transaction costs and
improved service delivery. This has resulted
in improved corporate procurement despite
a reduction in manpower.

The shift in procurement to framework
agreements, together with the availability
of purchasing cards and consolidation of
requirements, improved the average value
of purchase orders by 29 percent over 2008.
Similarly, as a result of shifting to strategic
and competitive procurement, direct purchasing fell from 37 percent in 2008 to 30
percent in 2009, while contractual procurement rose from 60 percent to 64 percent of
the overall spend in 2009. Following recommendations of the Purchase Order Study,
the Boards approved the building of the
Bank office in Nigeria and the purchase of
premises in Angola for the Field Office.

PROCUREMENT AND
PROJECT FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT (PFM})

 

The key objective of the PFM streamlining
and restructuring exercise was to support the
Operations Complexes in improving service
delivery, while minimizing fiduciary risks
and enhancing accountability. During 2009
the Bank continued its PFM reform initiatives and undertook the following activities,
among others:

(i) Revising and completing the PFM
Delegation of Authority Matrix (DAM)
in support of the Bank Group's initi
atives in conformity with the Bank's
Decentralization Policy. DAM strongly
supports the delegation of fiduciary
powers to skilled experts positioned in
the Field Offices;

Drafting of manuals, guidelines, and
standard bidding documents to help
project staff in the implementation of the
policies and ensuring consistent application of the rules; and

(iii) Developing new training materials and
undertaking training and sensitization
sessions to build the capacity of various
stakeholders.

The positioning of key PFM staff in Field
Offices has commenced and both international and local staff have been recruited.
It is expected that this will significantly
improve project delivery and effectiveness,
with the processing time of procurement
decisions cut by over 50 percent, leading
to a reduction in project completion periods.

A comprehensive Bank-wide training program was organized during 2009, as a result
of which 22 procurement specialists, 296
task managers and technical specialists, and
20 managers were schooled in the new procurement policies and instruments. In addition, training sessions were held for 397
staff of Executing Agencies from 15 RMCs.
Business Opportunities Seminars (BOSs)
were also organized for both regional and
non-regional member countries.

CORPORATE
COMMUNICATIONS

During the year under review the Bank
adopted its Communications Strategy, modernized its communications tools and platforms, and continued its program of staff
capacity building. This had a positive outcome, leading to increased Bank visibility
and operational transparency. Specifically,
the institution:

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 005

e Launched its modernized website, which
resulted in a 65.3 percent increase in
traffic, a 68.7 percent increase in unique
visitors, and a 129.3 percent increase in
page views;

e Expanded its range of products and multimedia services/video productions from
91 to 169, consolidated its partnerships
with television networks, and increased
its archival stock of photos;

¢ Improved its visibility at the Annual
Meetings (e.g. 251 journalists covered
the meeting in 2009, compared to 224
in 2008 and 105 in 2007) and launched
major publications and conferences;

¢ Increased Bank/development partner
interaction from 3 per week during 2008
to 10 per week during 2009;

¢ Increased FO involvement in Bank Group
communication activities;

e Provided media training to Senior
Management, Resident Representatives,
and staff; and

¢ Joined the OECD DevCom network to
expand its communications partnerships.

CORPORATE
ADJUDICATION SERVICES

The Administrative Tribunal
The Administrative Tribunal is an independent
organ of the Bank and the ultimate forum for
the resolution of disputes between members
of staff and the institution. It hears complaints made by a staff member contesting
an administrative decision, after exhaustion
of all other administrative recourse mechanisms within the Bank. The Tribunal’s decisions concern the non-observance of staff
members’ contract of employment, conditions of employment, or dismissal by the
Bank, and these decisions are binding, final,
and without appeal.

he Tribunal celebrated its tenth anniversary.
he occasion brought together former judges
of the Tribunal and General Counsels of the
Legal Department of the Bank, among others.

Ethics Office

An unwavering commitment to integrity and
igh ethical standards are indispensable to
he Bank Group's corporate governance and
key to its reputation for probity and impartiality in the eyes of its clients and development
partners. In 2009 the Bank Group established
he Ethics Office as the principal custodian of
he Bank’s core values and ethical standards.

 

Annual Report 2009

Activities carried out by the Bank in this area
during 2009 included the following; (i) developing programs and conducting training
sessions at Bank Headquarters and in some
FOs to increase awareness of ethical issues
and standards; (ii) conducting the required
annual disclosure exercise for all staff; and
(iii) helping to establish an internal culture
in which ethical issues are raised, discussed,
and resolved, free from acrimony and stigma.

The Ombudsman’s Office

In 2009 the Bank created the Value
Promotion Champions (VPCs) in pursuit of
its responsibility to establish an informal
conflict resolution process. The VPCs are
elected members of staff who are designated to provide peer support and assist
in conflict management in the FOs. A total

of 22 VPCs were inducted during the year,
thus speeding up and easing conflict management in the FOs.

The Bank received 86 complaints/cases in
the course of the year. Of these, 13 were
resolved, 70 are still at various stages of
completion, 3 were referred to the Staff
Appeals Committee, and 1 was resolved
through the mediation process. An Anger
Management Seminar for Bank management staff was held to provide skills and
knowledge of the informal and amicable
resolution of conflict in the workplace. In

for selected FOs were undertaken. New
Bank staff also received orientation on the
informal recourse process.ee LL at cde eT

Management’s Report Regarding the Effectiveness
of Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 24, 2010

The Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group") is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall integrity
of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, while those of the
African Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

The financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records and
related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes that all representations
made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditor's report accompanies the audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity with the basis
of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies identified. Internal
controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit and are revised as considered
necessary. \Vanagement believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or
overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance with respect
0 financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances.

he Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUF) to assist the Boards, among other things, in
heir oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group's accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of internal controls. AUFI,
which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection of external auditors and makes a
recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in turn makes a recommendation for the approval of the Board of Governors.
AUFI meets periodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance. The external auditors and
he internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and any other matter that may
require AUFI's attention.

he Bank's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that the Bank Group maintained effective internal
controls over its financial reporting as contained in the financial statements for 2009. Management is not aware of any material control weakness
hat could affect the reliability of the 2009 financial statements.

 

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2009, the external auditors of the Bank Group conducted
an independent assessment of the Bank Group's internal control framework and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group
regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2009

Scope

We have examined the internal controls over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting
and for assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting for 2009.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal controls over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether, in all material respects, effective internal controls are maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that

Chapter 006 African Development Bank Group

African Development Bank Group

Kec. Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting during the
year ended 31 December 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund

as of and for the year ended 31 December 2009, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed
unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

This chapter discusses the management of the financial resources of the Bank Group's windows—the African Development Bank (ADB),

for 2009 for the three windows, as well as the ADB and ADF Administrative Budgets for the financial year 2010.

 

THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK

Financial Management

Capital Subscription
The authorized capital stock of the Bank stood
at UA 22.12 billion as of December 31, 2009.
The latest increases in the authorized capital
of the Bank were the two special increases
approved by the Board of Governors, raising
the authorized capital from UA 21.87 billion
to UA 22.12 billion to allow the Republic of
Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
to become members of the Bank. The memberships of these two countries shall become
effective upon completion of the formalities
specified in the Agreement establishing the
Bank and in the General Rules governing
the admission of non-regional countries to
membership of the Bank. Authorized capita
is allocated to regional and non-regiona
members in such proportion that, when fully
subscribed, the regional members of the Bank
as a group would hold 60 percent of the total
capital stock and the non-regional members
would have 40 percent.

The capital stock of the Bank is compose
of paid-up and callable capital. The paidup capital is the amount of capital payable
over a period determined by the relevan
General Capital Increase (8 years for the
fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), 10
years for regional members and 5 years
for non-regional members under GCI-IV).
A member country's payment of the firs
installment triggers the subscription to
the entire callable capital portion. However, shares representing the paid-up portion of subscriptions are issued only as and

 

when the Bank receives the actual payments
for such shares. As of December 31, 2009
the paid-up capital amounted to UA 2.36
billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the portion
of paid-up capital that has been actually
paid) level of UA 2.35 billion. The Bank's callable capital was UA 19.46 billion including
UA 7.65 billion from non borrowing member
countries rated A- and higher. The callable
capital is subject to payment as and when
required by the Bank to meet its obligations
incurred, (a) by making or participating in
direct loans out of funds borrowed or otherwise acquired by the Bank for inclusion
in its ordinary capital resources or in special
resources; or (b) by guaranteeing in whole
or in part, loans made by other entities. It
is a protection of the Bank’s creditors and
olders of Bank's guarantees in the event
hat it is not able to meet its financial obli
gations. There has never been a call on the
capital of the Bank.

 

 

n accordance with the Shares Transfer Rules,
shares for which payments have become due
and remain unpaid by a member country are
orfeited after a prescribed period and offered
for subscription to other member countries.

he position of capital subscriptions at
December 31, 2009 is shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital Stock
and Voting Power, which forms part of the
Financial Statements included in this Report.

he financial crisis that started in 2008 has
ad a substantial impact on Africa. Demand
or lending from the Bank has scaled up. The
expected increase in operations and the faster than anticipated utilization of the financial
resources in response to the crisis could con
 

strain some of the Bank's prudential limits. As
a result, the Board of Governors has decided
to examine and consider the necessity for a
Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI). In
the interim, Canada and Korea have offered
to provide additional non-voting callable
capital by tripling their subscription to the
capital of the Bank.

Bank Rating

The rating agencies Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+
rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debts respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
the Bank's strong membership support, its
preferred creditor status, sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management
and policies.

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds from the
capital markets at the lowest possible cost
to support its lending activities. The topnotch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank
enable it to issue securities at low interest
rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by
client and cash flow requirements, assets
and liability management goals, and risk
management policies.

The impact of the financial crisis was fully felt
on the continent in 2009 and as the Bank
stepped up to play its countercyclical role,
the borrowing program envelope increased
during the year. The 2009 funding program
in capital markets was initially approved for
a maximum amount of UA 2.50 billion. In
July 2009, the Board approved an increase
of the amount to be funded in the capital

market by UA 3.90 billion to a maximum
of UA 6.40 billion in response to the rapid
increase of the Bank’s operations. The actual
amount raised was to be guided by the pace
of disbursements.

n terms of market conditions, the credit
markets gradually improved throughout the
year. The positive market sentiment in the
ast quarter of 2009 was helped by ongoing improvement in economic outlook and
he return of risk appetite. The Bank's borrowing cost also continued to improve over
he course of the year due to the better
conditions in capital markets globally and
as a result of the Bank's continuous effort
‘0 broaden its investor base as well as the
good performance of its bond issues in the
secondary market.

 

The Bank has used various markets and
instruments to meet its borrowing requirements. The Bank issued four USD 1 billion
global bond transactions during the year.
These transactions were supplemented in
the public markets by the Bank's maiden
Floating Rate Note issues and a return to the
Swiss Franc and Singapore Dollar domestic
bond markets. The Bank also reactivated
its Euro Commercial Paper (ECP) program
which has now been increased from Euro 1
billion to Euro 2 billion. Private placements,
Uridashi transactions, ECP borrowings and
African currency-linked bonds in Ghana Cedi
and Zambian Kwacha complete the range
of markets utilized for funding transactions
with a maturity of a year or longer.

Overall the Bank raised UA 5.14 billion
(including ECP) in the capital markets in
2009 and as at December 31, 2009, the
outstanding borrowing portfolio of the Bank
stood at UA 10.58 billion.

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments
(net of repurchase agreements) as of December 31, 2009 totaled UA 7.73 billion, compared to UA 5.17 billion at the end of 2008.

Annual Report 2003

Investment income for 2009 amounted to UA
222.96 million or a return of 3.50 percent
on an average liquidity of UA 6.37 billion,
compared to UA 202.88 million in 2008,
or a return of 3.76 percent, on an average
liquidity of UA 5.39 billion.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3
portfolios, namely operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio,
each with a different benchmark that reflects
the cash flow and risk profile of its assets
and funding sources. These benchmarks are
1-month LIBID for the operational portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR,
resetting on February 1 and August 1 for
the prudential portfolio. The equity-backed
portfolio is managed against a re-pricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the
Bank's net assets re-pricing uniformly over
a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2009 amounted to UA 25.13
billion. Total outstanding loans as at December 31, 2009 was UA 7.54 billion, UA 1.71
billion higher than the UA 5.83 billion outstanding as at the end of 2008. Undisbursed
balances at December 31, 2009 totaled UA
5.00 billion, an increase of UA 2.45 billion
from December 31, 2008. The number of
active signed loans stood at 279 for an outstanding balance of UA 7.54 billion. As at
December 31, 2009, 604 loans amounting
to UA 9.67 billion had been fully repaid. A
breakdown of the outstanding loan portfolio
by product type is presented below.

Disbursements

Loan disbursements during 2009 amounted to UA 2.35 billion, more than triple the
amount of UA 727.53 million disbursed in
2008. At December 31, 2009, cumulative disbursements (including non-sovereign loans)
amounted to UA 20.03 billion. Also at the
end of 2009, a total of 785 loans were fully
disbursed amounting to UA 17.55 billion,

Financial Products

Loans. The Bank offers 3 loan products: variable, floating, and fixed interest rate loans with

a selection of loan currencies, currently, US
Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and South Africa

Rand. To suit the long-term financing needs
of borrowers, loans have a maximum maturity
of 20 years, including a grace period on the

repayment of the principal amount, generally
not exceeding 5 years. For the single currency

variable interest rate loan, the base rate is

determined twice a year, on January 1 and
July 1, and is based on the Bank's average cost
of a designated pool of borrowings funding
the loans in the specific currency. This product was discontinued in December 2009.
The base rate for the floating interest rate
loan is derived from the 6-month market
reference rate in the specific currency, for
example, LIBOR, EURIBOR or JIBAR. The base
rate is reset on February 1 and August 1

each year and applies to the 6-month period following the reset date. For the fixedinterest rate loan, the lending rate in each
currency is the fixed amortizing swap rate
derived from the 6-month market reference
rates. Borrowers may select from a number
of rate-fixing alternatives, including fixing at
each disbursement or after all disbursements
ave been completed. Prior to rate fixing, the
currency-specific floating interest rate applies.
he pricing formula applicable to all 3 loan
products is the same. The applicable rate of
interest is the sum of the chosen base rate
plus a lending spread. Loans to sovereign
and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers enjoy
a lending spread of 40 basis points above
he 6-month market reference rate. For nonsovereign guaranteed borrowers in both the
rivate and public sector, the lending spread
is computed based on the Bank's risk-based
ricing framework.

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector enterrises can be extended directly or through
a private financial institution (PFI). In an
agency line (AL), the credit risk of the borrower is borne by the Bank. In addition, the
PFI acts as an agent for the Bank, to carry
out a variety of activities, including, but not
imited to, identifying projects within certain
parameters; appraising such projects on
ehalf of the Bank; when approved, underaking all of the administrative steps related
0 disbursement (billing, collection of Bank's
unds, filing of security); supervising projects,
monitoring the performance of the borrower,
submitting reports thereon; and transmitting
amounts related to the repayment of the
joan to the Bank.

 

 

 

Guarantees. Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its preferred
creditor status to assist eligible borrowers
to obtain financing from third party lenders,
including capital markets. Guarantees will
also enable borrowers to obtain financing
in their own local currency where the Bank
is not able to provide such financing directly
from its own resources.

Risk Management Products are offered
to enable borrowers to manage the market
tisks associated with their loans from the

Bank, including interest rate, currency, and
commodity price risks. These products assist
borrowers to manage their balance sheets
and their changing needs more efficiently over time. Risk management products
such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
interest rate caps and collars are available
to borrowers at any time during the life
of the loan.

Equity Participation or Quasi Equity
Products. The Bank's ability to provide risk
capital through equity investments is a
key element of its resource mobilization
role. Even though the Bank cannot be a
majority shareholder in a company, it can
participate in a project by acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred stocks
or debentures.

Other Financial Services. |n addition to
the products described above, the Bank

may offer loan syndication and underwriting
services through its private sector window.

Risk Management Policies
and Processes

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing development finance and
related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank's
tisk management policies, guidelines and
practices are designed to reduce exposure
to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal and other operational risks, while
maximizing the Bank's capacity to assume
credit risks to public and private sector clients, within approved risk limits.

The policies and practices employed by the
Bank to manage these risks are described in
detail in Note D to the Financial Statements.

Financial Results

To highlight the ordinary operations of the
Bank, the discussions and analyses below
focus on “Income before distributions
approved by the Board of Governors”.

African Development Bank Chapter 008

The highlights of the Bank's financial performance in 2009 include the following:

© Despite the continued difficult economic environment experienced during the
year, the Bank in 2009 earned income
before distributions approved by the
Board of Governors of UA 231.16 million, compared to UA 304.66 million in
2008. The decrease was due primarily to
a higher amount of impairment provision on loans as well as a higher level
of administrative expenses incurred in
2009 compared to 2008. Provision for
impairment on loans amounted to UA
11.29 million in 2009 compared to a
write back of provision in 2008 as a
result of the arrears clearance of a borrowing member country.

¢ Loan income decreased by UA 64.04
million, or 18.18 percent, in 2009 as a
result of general decline in interest rates
during the year. As a result of improved
market conditions investment income
increased by UA 20.08 million, or 9.90
percent from UA 202.88 million in 2008
to UA 222.96 million in 2009. Borrowing-related charges also decreased by
UA 84.58 million from UA 317.62 million in 2008 to UA 233.04 million in
2009. In 2009, the Bank earned income
of UA 7.68 million on investments in
debt instruments issued by entities in its
regional member countries.

¢ At December 31, 2009, three sovereign
borrowers were in arrears for six months
or more compared to four sovereign borrowers in arrears at the end of 2008.
At December 31, 2009 total accumulated provision for losses on principal
and charges in arrears was UA 227.39
million, which was 2.90 percent of
gross principal outstanding and charges
receivable at that date, compared to UA
218.27 million, or 3.47 percent of gross
principal outstanding and charges receivable at December 31, 2008.

Annual Report 2009

107Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Total Bank Group administrative expenses increased by 18.85 percent from UA
186.37 million in 2008 to UA 221.51 million in 2009. The increase came mainly
from manpower and mission expenses
due to increase in staffing as a result of
increased activities of the Bank Group. The
Bank's share of the Bank Group administrative expenses amounted to UA 63.06
million for 2009, compared to UA 46.78
million for 2008. Bank Group administrative expenses are allocated between
the Bank, the ADF and the NTF based
ona predetermined cost-sharing formula
driven primarily by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators.

Annual Report 2003

The Bank continues to earn levels of net
income sufficient to sustain its strong
financial position and also make contributions on behalf of its shareholders to
other development initiatives for Africa.
Total reserves plus accumulated loss provisions on outstanding loan principal and
charges at December 31, 2009 were UA
2.78 billion, compared to UA 2.69 billion at the end of 2008. As a percentage
of gross loans, reserves plus loss provisions on loan principal at December 31,
2009 represented 35.22 percent compared to 44.19 percent at December 31,
2008. The Board of Governors in 2009
approved distributions to various devel
opment initiatives in Africa amounting to
UA 162.68 million. The beneficiaries of
these distributions are listed under Note

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009

NOTE A- OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social
progress of its regional member states. The Bank's headquarters is located in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. However, since February 2003, the
Bank has managed its operations largely from its temporary relocation facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. The Bank finances development projects
and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to such development and,
where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs
designed to contribute to the economic and social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented
by those of the African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria
Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and
liabilities. There is no recourse to the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist
the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to promote cooperation and increased
international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and held by the
Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset
to the asset's net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.
Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank’s right to receive payment is established.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

he Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its member counties to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency Translation

ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are transated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2009 and
2008 are reported in Note W-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation differences are
included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. The

 

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the UA
amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included
in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever withdrawn
its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that
the members are independent African and non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009,
the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares. The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter referred
to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against the member's liabilities
on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to the
Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent
to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase price was
determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have
been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains
liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond
if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying a former
member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the risk had passed, and
indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made
until six months after the termination date.

 

 

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject to the
prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each member country.

 

Employee Benefits

1] Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit payments
to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation
of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual
inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. Past
service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line basis over the
average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet.
The liability represents the present value of the Bank's defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses.

Annual Report 2009

7ne

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to eligible
former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to the post-retirement
healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum
service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued
over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in
the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is
authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized
immediately in retained earnings in the year they occur. The medical plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the
balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank's post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value
of plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank’s balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual rights or
obligations.

1) Financial Assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its financial assets
at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement and gains and losses are reported in the income statement in
the period in which they arise. The investments in the trading portfolio are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ii) Loans and Receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However, incremental
direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred, as such amounts are considered insignificant. The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank's management has the intent and ability to hold
to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iv) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
The Bank has classified equity investments over which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future. Gains
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly in other comprehensive
income, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other
comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash
is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates. The Bank
receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors their fair value and if necessary may require additional collateral.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon acquisition of
three months or less.

2) Financial Liabilities

i) Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management
purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest
rates. The Bank's borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding.

In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management
purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost with
interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in profit or loss and include the
amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities
may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate and currency risks. The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D below.
Certain of the Bank's borrowings obtained prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interestfree loans. In accordance with the revised IAS 20 — Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such
borrowings represent a form of government assistance, the benefits of which are not quantified by the imputation of interest. Accordingly, such borrowings are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable on their due dates.

ii) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at
inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to borrowings that have
been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the borrowing at fair value through
profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise would have arisen if the borrowings were
carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

 

iii) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost. The
amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Annual Report 2009

ng120

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes.
These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the interest
rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established on the date the debt is issued and
maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

Although IAS 39 allows hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the Bank has elected not to apply hedge accounting to any qualifying hedging relationship, but rather classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all changes in fair value
recognized in the income statement. When the criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Impairment of Financial Assets

1) Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets with
similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an
impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted
at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment arises from delays that
may be experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate
of the non-collectibility, in whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income
statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the
current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears. When
a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

 

2) Available-for-Sale Assets
The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value,
net of any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is reclassified from equity to the income statement. Impairment losses
recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value are reversed through equity.

 

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an available-for-sale equity instrument that is carried at cost
because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying
amount of the impaired equity instrument and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market rate
of return for a similar equity instrument. Once recognized, impairment losses on these equity instruments carried at cost are not reversed.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded as quote
in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. If the above criteria are no
met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or
significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiguid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers
and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are no
necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current asking
prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques
that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, discounted cash flow
analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which
market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use o
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are
reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are
based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank's borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques based on
discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank's credit spread. Credit spreads are
obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank's new public bond issues.

The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated
derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation

models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is
inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are made to the relevant observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best estimate of the
price at which the Bank could have bought back the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments carried at fair value are periodically fair
valued both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises
is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods,
for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's equity participations is estimated as the Bank's percentage ownership of
the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools based on industry standard
pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest
rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject
to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported
in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans.
For multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year
end variable lending rate in that currency, adjusted for impairment. For all loans not impaired, fair value adjustments are made to reflect
expected loan losses. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note |.

Day One Profit and Loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received), if the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions
in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data
from observable markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not
incorporate data solely from observable markets. The Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they
arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price.

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is determined based on valuation models that use inputs that may not be market-observable as of the calculation date. Such financial instruments are initially recognized at the
transaction price, although the value obtained from the relevant valuation model may differ. The difference between the transaction price
and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss", is either: (a) amortized over the life of the transaction; or (b)
deferred until the instrument's fair value can be determined using market observable inputs or is realized through settlement. The financial
instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are
recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not control, over the entity's financial and
operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the
equity method be used to account for investments in associates. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee
after the date of acquisition. The investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement.
The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2009, such subscriptions
cumulatively represented approximately 1% of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and
has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

used to account for the Bank's investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed
for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity method are limited to the investment's original cost as the ADB has not
guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference between cost
and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Buildings: 15-20 years

- Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

- Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
- Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to
sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between proceeds and the asset's carrying amount
and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets
ntangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets
is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

Leases

he Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other regional memer countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made under
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an operating
lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as
an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Allocations and Distributions Approved by the Board of Governors

n accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations from
income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from prior years which
are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of distribution for specified uses have been
met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income Statement in the year of approval. Distriutions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously transferred to surplus account or from the current
year’s income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts allocated to surplus
after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year's net income, and expenses recognized directly
in equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results
could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant judgments
and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank's accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories. Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Held-for-Trading — In classifying financial assets or liabilities as “trading”, the Bank has determined that such assets or liabilities meet its
description and set criteria for classification as such.

Fair Value through Profit and Loss —\n designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has determined
that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Held-to-Maturity—The Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intent and ability to hold such investments
to maturity.

2) Significant Estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Loans and Advances — At each financial statements reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount
to the loan’s net carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a
group of loans with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group
of loans may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or
national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when
scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows
are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined by using
valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however, areas such
as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions
about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Equity Investments — The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when
there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below the carrying amount. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates any evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

Retirement Benefits — The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial assumptions used,
including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate to be used to determine the present
value of estimated future pension obligations, based on interest rates of suitably long-term high-quality corporate bonds in the currencies
comprising the UA.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year's amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications
did not affect prior year's reported result.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

1) Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective on or after January 1, 2009 but early adopted by the Bank
On February 14, 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1. The amendments
require an entity to classify as part of its equity those financial instruments that it issues that are either (a) puttable financial instruments,
or (b) financial instruments or components of financial instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rata share
of its net assets only on liquidation, if certain criteria are met. Prior to these amendments, such financial instruments were to be classified as liabilities. Subscriptions by the member countries to the Bank's capital described in Note B are puttable financial instruments that
meet the requirements for equity classification under the amended standards. Although the amendments are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2009, the Bank early adopted them starting with the 2007 financial statements.

On March 5, 2009, IASB issued amendments to the disclosure requirements under IFRS 7. These amendments which have an effective
date of January 1, 2009, require additional disclosures of fair value measurements in a three-level hierarchy reflecting the relative reliability of such measurements based on the significance of the inputs used. Under this hierarchy, the most reliable measurements are those
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Bank early-adopted the amendments in 2008.

2) Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective on or after January 1, 2009 and adopted in 2009
The Bank has adopted the following new and amended IAS/ IFRS in 2009:

IAS 1 (revised): “Presentation of Financial Statements”

A revised version of IAS 1 was issued in September 2007. The amendments to IAS 1 require the Bank to present in separate statements,
changes in equity related to its shareholders and those related to comprehensive income (i.e. non-shareholder-related components), including related reclassification adjustments of those components. It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as at the beginning of
the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial statements when the Bank applies an accounting policy retrospectively or
makes a retrospective restatement.

The adoption of IAS 1 (revised) has no effect on the Bank's financial position or performance as it relates solely to the presentation of the
financial statements. It resulted in certain presentation changes in the Bank’s financial statements including:

- the presentation of all items of income and expenditure in two statements: the income statement and the statement of comprehensive
income; and

- the presentation of the statement of changes in equity as a separate financial statement.

Comparative information has been re-stated to conform with the current period's presentation which is in conformity with the revised
standard.

IFRS 8: “Operating Segments”

IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and became effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009. The standard replaces the reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements
with those used internally by the chief operating decision maker in the allocation of resources and assessing performance.

The adoption of IFRS 8 has no significant impact on the Bank's financial position or performance as it only relates to disclosures. IFRS 8
disclosures are shown in Note T to the financial statements.

3) Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for application for the year ended December 31, 2009, and have not been applied in preparing these
financial statements. The following new standard is expected to be relevant to the Bank:

IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 as the first part of the IASB comprehensive project to replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 replaces those parts
of IAS 39 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the
entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow of the instrument, into two measurement
categories: those to be measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized cost
only if it is a debt instrument and the objective of the entity's business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows and the
asset's contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be measured at fair value
through profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are held for trading will be measured at fair value through profit or loss while for all other equity instruments the entity can make an irrevocable election
at initial recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

Adoption of IFRS 9 is mandatory from January 1, 2013 but earlier adoption is permitted. IFRS 9 will have an effect on the current classification of the Bank's financial assets. However, the Bank is still in the process of evaluating the full impact and the timing of its adoption.

 

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from its lending
and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk, and operational
risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank's capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk profile consistent
with the highest credit rating. The Bank's capital adequacy policy was revised in 2009, as further discussed in Note M under Borrowings.

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors, which
is chaired by the President. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors regularly review trends in the
Bank’s risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on the Bank's Finan
cial Products and Services (the FPS Authority), the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority) and the Bank's
Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for its borrowers and separate guidelines which prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for the Bank's sovereign
and non-sovereign loan and equity investment portfolios.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the Bank's
financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM Authority covers the Bank's
entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources. It also includes the interest rate and
currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and the Operations
Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control organ of the Bank’s risk management activities. It is the Bank's most senior
management forum on risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance. OPSCOM reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and
tisk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms country and project credit risk
ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues
including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies
and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential financial
loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign credit risk
on its portfolio of private sector, non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes,
which are described in more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through its policies related to
sustainable lending strategies, including individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These include
the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Bank’s statistical loss expectations as shown in the following table. The level of granularity
helps in measuring probabilities of default for internal grades in order to differentiate between obligors distinctly.

| Excellent Very Low Risk A-BBB/Baa
2 Strong Low Risk BB/Ba
8 Good .

7 Moderate Risk B/B
4 Fair
5 Acceptable oo

: High Risk ccCc/Caa
6 Marginal
7 Special Attention
8 Substandard oo.

Very High Risk CC-D/Ca-D
9 Doubtful
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance, debt
sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and Bank’s portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive
a composite sovereign country risk index and a composite non-sovereign country risk index which in turn are converted into separate
country risk rating for the sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk
ratings from different international rating agencies and other specialized international organizations. The ALCO reviews the country ratings
on a quarterly basis to ensure that they reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The ALCO also assesses whether the countries
are in compliance with their country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

The portfolio’s weighted-average risk rating at the end of 2009 improved to 2.42 compared to 2.68 at the end of 2008. The distribution
of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank's five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2009 44% 33% 6% 13% 4%
2008 37% 33% 6% 16% 8%
2007 37% 31% 8% 15% 9%
2006 28% 35% 10% 17% 10%
2005 26% 26% 18% 17% 13%
2004 28% 28% 21% 11% 12%

It is the Bank's policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes 30 days
overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid. These countries also
become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.50% on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties to service their debts to the Bank on a timely basis. As previously
described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with the assessment of the incurred
loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital
cushion for sovereign credit risks. The Bank's revised capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for public
sector and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities (guarantees and client
risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private sector operations which have a
higher probability of default and loss given default than public sector operations. At the end of 2009, the Bank's public sector loan portfolio used up to 32% of the Bank's total risk capital based on the Bank's revised capital adequacy framework approved in March 2009.
The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of translation adjustments. Callable capital is not
included in the computation of risk capital.

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees. The Bank may
also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses a uniform internal credit risk rating scale. Non-sovereign
transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) greenfield and expansion projects; b) financial institutions; and c)
private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of some pre-determined critical factors.

a) Greenfield and Expansion Projects

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower's financial strength. This assessment looks at:

i) capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company's operating performance and profitability; and
iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project company’s management with
particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the information on which the analysis is based.

 

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

b) Financial Institutions

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMEL model:

i) Capital adequacy — analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution's capital; ii) Asset quality, operating policies and
procedures and risk management framework; iii) Quality of management and decision making framework; iv) Earnings and market position
—an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy — an assessment focusing on the entity's ability to
access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk — an assessment of the impact of interest rate changes & exchange rate fluctuations.

c) Private Equity Funds
The assessment of a Private Equity Fund takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

e Investment strategies;

¢ Industry structure and regulatory framework;
¢ Management and corporate governance;

e Financial strength and fund performance; and
¢ Information quality.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

All new non-sovereign projects require a minimum initial credit rating and undergo rigorous project approval. The Non-Sovereign Working Group of the ALCO reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend for the ALCO's
approval, changes if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

In 2009, the Bank increased its exposure to the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios. The weighted-average risk rating improved from
3.66 at the end of 2008 to 3.14 at year-end 2009. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the Bank's five credit risk classes
is shown in the table below.

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2009 27% 18% 28% 24% 3%
2008 13% 16% A1% 28% 2%
2007 8% 10% 46% 31% 5%
2006 16% 15% 52% 6% 11%
2005 14% 20% 56% 7% 3%
2004 15% 14% 55% 10% 6%

In compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign portfolio.
For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment, or incurred loss, on
each loan. At the end of 2009, the impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired loans in the non-sovereign portfolio was
UA 11.89 million compared to UA 12.39 million in 2008 because of the stability in the size of the portfolio of impaired non-sovereign loans.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through investment
funds. To the extent possible, equity investments are carried at fair value. In the event that the fair value of an equity investment cannot be
reliably determined, it is carried at amortized cost, and periodically assessed for impairment. The Bank recognizes loss provision based on
accepted impairment tests measured against the carrying cost of the equity investment. At the end of 2009, the provision for impairment
on equity investment was UA 15.94 million compared to UA 20.77 million in 2008.

© cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk capital cushion
or non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel || Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At the end of 2009, the Bank's nonsovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 22 % of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still
elow the limit of 40% determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign operations. Out of the Bank's non-sovereign portfolio, Equity paricipations required as risk capital approximately 7% of the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the
statutory limit of 15% established by the Board of Governors for equity participations.

Credit Exposure Limits

he Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given point in
ime. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign guaranteed and non-sovereign portfolios)
y ensuring that in the aggregate, the total country exposure limit to any country does not exceed 15% of the Bank's total risk capital.
his threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s capital adequacy framework. Specifically, the country limits are determined for each of the RMC borrowers by differentiating them on the basis of their credit ratings; size of
he economy and the country’s economic potential. Country exposure limits are reviewed annually to support the Bank's medium term
country lending strategies.

 

he credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further controlled and managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit with
regard to the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of collateral
(security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to
fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial
instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank.
Given the nature of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Bank minimizes
this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank's minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For
local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate availability of investment
opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies. The ALCO approves counterparties

that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings are closely
monitored.

Trading counterparties are required to be rated at a minimum of A/A2.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government Agencies and NA? AA-IAa3 AAA/Aaa
Supranationals
Banks AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non NAD AA-Iha3 —AAA/Aaa
bank financial institutions
MBS/ABS No maturity limit, but repayment projections mandatory

The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa; money market mutual funds
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized securities repurchase agreements.

Asa tule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any
transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A- for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include
swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 8% of the Bank's total risk capital for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit
exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Bank's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

The counterparty credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be predominantly AA or higher rated as
shown in the table below. The level of the AAA rated exposure reflects the increase in investments in sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed,
agency and supranational securities and the flight to quality resulting from the worldwide financial crisis, which impact is also reflected in
the above-average exposure to lower rated counterparties.

AAA AA+ to AA- A+ and lower
2009 65% 25% 10%
2008 59% 21% 20%
2007 43% 54% 3%
2006 56% 39% 5%
2005 56% 36% 8%
2004 62% 36% 2%

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital cushion
for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of 2008 and 2009, the Bank's counterparty credit portfolio
including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 2.0% of the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises
when there is a maturity mismatch between liabilities and assets. The Bank's principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon without additional financing from the

capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, th

e Bank maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML)

based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The PML is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four

components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its risk bearing capacity, the Bank's principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation risk due to fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the currency composition of the SDR (UA).
The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any
one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which they were borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency
mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to the SDR),
the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates fluctuate. The Bank's policy
is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by matching, to the extent possible,
the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the Unit of Account). In line with this policy, throughout
2009 the Bank's currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band of the risk-neutral position in each of the currencies making up
the SDR composition. In keeping with the Bank's currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to realign
the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a revision to the SDR currency composition. As a result of these policies and practices,
despite sharp movements in the values of the major currencies during 2009, the Bank experienced translation adjustment gains of less
than 0.50% of net assets during the year.

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The distribution of the
currencies of the Bank's recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in Euros, USD and Tunisian Dinar.
For 2009, the Bank's strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to cover the estimated currency composition of expenses
mitigated the unfavorable impact of those currencies movements during the year.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies, namely the US dollar,
Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the International Monetary Fund every
five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2006. The SDR rate represents the sum of the interest rate of each currency
that is determined based on the weight and the representative exchange rate and interest rate of each currency.

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange rate of
the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes a separate 10%
appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change in the African currency holdings from 2008 to 2009, the 2009 table also includes the effect of a 10% appreciation/depreciation of each African currency against the
SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal change in net assets as a result
of currency mismatches.

Interest Rate Risk
The Bank's interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding such assets;
2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not overly sensitive
to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt
Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin on assets
funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost of
a dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds pass-through formulation
incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's pool-based loans has traditionally helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity
of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining demand for this product in favor of market-based loans,
he Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (market-based loans).
For the market-based loan products, the Bank's net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the
oans with that of the Bank's underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank may also provide borrowers with risk
management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of its market-based loan products. Although it retains
he credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche. The portfolio of
iquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank's liquidity policy and uses a six-month Libor floating rate
benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor
loating rate benchmark.

he Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding is required
or one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all new borrowings into
loating rate in one of the Bank's active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where the Bank issues structured debt,
he Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired six-month Libor-based floating rate
unding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one year
to 25% of the outstanding debt portfolio.

 

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of
the Bank’s assets with equity resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity resources (the SDR) affect
the net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower lending and
investment rates, which in the long-term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank's equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the net
interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the assets funded
by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark. The Bank's repricing profile
benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10% of the Bank's assets funded by equity reprice in each year. Using this benchmark,
the Bank's net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a ten-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

At the end of 2009 and 2008, the Bank's overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual buckets. For
net assets repricing within one year, the Bank had a manageable gap relative to the benchmark.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity

A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain of UA 7.55 million and UA 5.97 million as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fair Value Sensitivity

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements at
fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of the currencies in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2009 for assets and liabilities
denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps (2008: +/- 20 bps).

(UA thousands)

Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss)
Held-for-trading investments (18,664) (3,933) 21,812 4,294
Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios 148,876 177,141 (163,105) (182,492)

Prepayment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans committed
before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level of prepayments has
generally been within acceptable levels. In 2003 and 2004, however, driven by low market interest rates, contracting credit spreads for
emerging market borrowers and enhanced debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total loan prepayments increased sharply to
UA 471 million and UA 542 million, respectively. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70 million, due in large
part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk by
linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298 million
included an amount of UA 192 million in respect of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007; total prepayment amounted to UA
199 million, of which 98% related to market-based loans. Prepayment in 2008 amounted to UA 17 million while prepayment in the current
year was UA 20 million. The rate of prepayment is not expected to change significantly from the current level in the near to medium term.

Annual Report 2009Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Operational Risk
Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and functions. The interdependencies among
its departments and among its risk factors in general, could adversely impact its activities with consequential exposure to financial losses.

The Bank defines operational risks to include all aspects of risk-related exposure other than those falling within the scope of credit, market,
and liquidity risks. Specifically, this includes the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems,
and from external events which could negatively impact its reputation.

Following approval by the Board of Directors in 2004, the Bank established an Internal Control Unit (ICU) to among other duties implement the COSO internal control framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of its internal controls in
all significant business operations. As part of this process, Management's attestation on the adequacy of internal controls is published in
the Bank's annual report. Phase two of the implementation extending the COSO framework to other areas of operational risk management is still ongoing.

It is the responsibility of Senior management within each business areas to develop and implement controls to manage operational risks
within its area. This responsibility is supported by the development of overall institutional standards for the management of operational
risk in the following areas:

¢ Requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorization of transactions
¢ Requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions

¢ Documentation of controls and procedures

¢ Training and professional development

¢ Risk mitigation including insurance where this is effective

Compliance with institutional standards is supported by a program of periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General of
the Bank. The result of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the business unit to which they relate, with summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank's revised Capital Adequacy and Exposure Management framework approved by the Board of Directors in March 2009 provides
for a risk capital charge of 15% of the average operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basle Il recommendations for
operational risk.

Other control initiatives or activities in the other areas of the Bank Group which complement the work on operational risk management
include:

© Code of conduct and staff rules

e Fraud and investigation unit

¢ Whistleblower protection policy

¢ Business continuity planning and preparedness

Effects of Recent Developments in the Financial Markets

Although the Bank was also impacted by the global crisis that affected the world financial markets through 2008 and 2009, as a result
of its prudent risk management policies and practices, the impact on the Bank has been reasonably mitigated. With regards to the funding activities, notwithstanding the significant increases in credit spreads for all borrowers, there has been no serious adverse effect on
the Bank's ability to borrow competitively, consistent with the Bank's solid financial position as evidenced by the continued uniform top
rating by all the major rating agencies. The Bank continues to be well placed to play its intermediation role in support of the development
financing needs of its regional member countries.

Although the Bank believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead
to different fair value results. For fair value measurements in Level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used to reasonably possible alternative assumptions is not expected to have significant effect on the result for the year.

NOTE F - TREASURY INVESTMENTS

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, crosscurrency swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money
market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum credit rating of A. Over-thecounter (OTC) options on government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does not
exceed 1 year, and such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Cross-currency and interest
rate swaps including asset swap transactions are only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with minimum
credit ratings of AA-/Aa3 at the time of the transaction.

As at December 31, 2009, the Bank had received collateral with fair value of UA 344.98 million in connection with swap agreements. Of
this amount, a total UA 144.03 million was in the form of cash and has been recorded on the balance sheet with a corresponding liability
included in “Other accounts payable”. The balance of UA 200.95 million was in the form of liquid financial assets.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Bank terminated the external asset management program. Prior to the termination, the Bank used
external managers in the management of certain of its liquid assets in accordance with the Bank’s Asset and Liability Management Guidelines. The assets that were previously held with the external managers were either transferred back to ADB at market values for in-house
management or sold off and the proceeds transferred back to the ADB. Consequently, at December 31, 2009, there were no investments
under external management. Investments under external management included in held-for-trading portfolio as at December 31, 2008
amounted to UA 127.36 million.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Bank had no securities sold under repurchase agreements (repos).

Loan Swaps
The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable rate income.

Administrative Expenses Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were no open positions with respect to the
forward exchange transactions.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases
authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making their
payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local currency;
or

Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable, noninterest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Ye

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the Fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members — five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to the eighth installments shall be paid
in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

NOTE !-LOANS

The Bank's loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other freely
convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount
disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically
the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended
for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:

Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank's own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis
points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans to single currency variable terms or retain the terms
of their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The
other terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1, 1997, the Bank
as provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum of two components,
namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable
jase rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on January
1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank's selected reference interest
rate in each market. The Bank's standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR and
IBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency
ixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate

to

letermine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains

 

unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank’s assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, outstanding loans were as follows:

entities by third parties. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31, 2009, guarantees provided by the Bank to some of its borrowers amounted to UA 0.97 million.

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development
of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African countries, and to provide
financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original
State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected

by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share of
the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a
cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December
31, 2009 amounted to UA 157.65 million (2008: UA 138.10 million), representing 70.84 percent (2008: 72.13 percent) of the shareable
administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
provides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants in
proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2009, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.72% (2008: 0.78%).

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note W-2, the net asset value of ADF which
is the basis for determining the value of the Banks investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss on the Bank's investment.
he net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations plus disbursed and outstanding
loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points and are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations
he Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are
in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is to promote
he economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The Bank's equity
articipation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting
other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank's equity participation shall not exceed 25% of the equity capital of the
entity in which it invests. The Bank currently holds less than 20% of the total equity capital of most of the institutions in which it particiates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In the exceptional instances where the Bank has more than 20% but less than 50% ownership, such
investments are accounted for as investments in associates. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2009/10 of May
13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate amount of the Bank's
aid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

 

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building. The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions
owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments
are included in the income statement.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank's owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for
the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third
party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.

At December 31, 2009, the book value of such assets is not significant.

Annual Report 2009African Development Bank Chapter 008

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

Through to December 31, 2008, the Bank's policy was to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital
resources to 80 percent of the callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both
senior and subordinated debt to 80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries.

The revised capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2009 adopted the use of a single debt to usable
capital ratio to monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank's total outstanding debt at 100% of usable capital. Usable capital
under the revised capital adequacy framework comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members
rated A- or better. Applying the revised framework, usable capital at December 31, 2009 was UA 12,396.25 million.

As at December 31, 2009 and 2008, senior and subordinated borrowings were as follows:

 

(UA millions} 2009 2008
Senior borrowings 9,852.32 5,964.64
Subordinated borrowings 728.32 742.64
Total 10,580.64 6,707.28

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities and to lower
its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified dates prior to
maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put dates, rather than the contractual
maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain outstanding beyond their earliest redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings are
converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the two currencies in
order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2009 was UA 9,488.61 million (2008: UA
5,729.81 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31, 2009 was
UA 9,188.23 million (2008: UA 5,304.60 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional amount plus
accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net gain of UA 17.38 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December
31, 2009 (2008: UA 12.43 million). This included a gain of UA 37.31 million which was attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk
during the year ended December 31, 2009 (2008: UA 2.10 million). Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are
determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank's
credit spread on the relevant liquid markets for ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The
Bank's credit spread was not applied for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2009, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses to date
were UA 300.38 million (2008: losses of UA 425.21 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY
Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The Bank is
not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In
Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May
29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments
to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares
to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up
and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to
the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock
of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

 

Annual Report 2009

165Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the
authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

By its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized
Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120 million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to
become members of the Bank. The membership of these two countries shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified
in the Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the
Bank. As at December 31, 2009, such formalities had not been completed by either country.

he Bank's capital as at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:

ncluded in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 302.42 million at December 31, 2009, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing
he balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and
UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of
Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the
Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent
iabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or otherwise does
not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such
successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share
ransfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response
rom the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested nonregional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined
the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s Official Development Assistance its pro-rata
interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries
were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed
at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represents the value of the US Dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on July 1, 1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from
converting these currencies to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on
Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

 

(UA thousands} 2009 2008
Balance at January 1 161,028 160,075

NOTE Q - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself. The ADF
and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which
is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance sheet size for non-operational
expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s gross income.

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

NOTE R- EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989, became
effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on a full-time
basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of 6 months service without
interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November
2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee
contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child
benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost
associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and were recorded in 2004. Also, new members from the local field offices of
the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million were reported in the 2007 financial statements.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior service cost of
UA 8.12 million, which has been immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of regular
salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been eliminated. The Bank typically
contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the
provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s liabilities. At December 31,
2009, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index
as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the
returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Post-Employment Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17, 2002
and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute a percentage of
their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing of the MBP. Contribution
rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children, range between 0.70 percent to a
maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees
and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are
deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependants.

Annual Report 2009Chapter 006 African Development Bank

he expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected
ong-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium. The
discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

he medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced by a wide variety
of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilisation. For the purposes of these calculations, as in the last
two years, the initial medical cost inflation rate is assumed at 8% per annum between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, thereafter
reducing by 1% per annum each year until it reaches 5% per annum where a constant rate of 5% per annum will be used thereafter. This
evel rate of 5% per annum will be reached at January 1, 2013 under the current assumption.

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the Bank.

he following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31, 2009 and 2008 for the Staff Retirement Plan:

Total 302,248 210,294

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in time deposits.

The Bank's estimate of contributions it expects to make to the SRP and the MBP for the year ending December 31, 2010, are UA 13.13
million and UA 3.66 million respectively.

The health care cost growth rate can significantly affect the reported post-retirement benefit income or costs and benefit obligations for
the MBP.

NOTE W-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

(i)

(ii

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World
Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions
received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount
of DRC's arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present
value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The
new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors
considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b)
the magnitude of DRC's arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created
extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package
would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there
was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the
consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan.
Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from time to time make
to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation
is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank.
Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC loans in current earnings is transferred out of reserves to the special
account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Fragile States Facility

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts towards
re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The
framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations from the ADB's net income, and
contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill
financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection, the Board
of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) under the
administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors
also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income
as the second installment of the Bank's contribution to the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2007/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of
Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank's allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March
2008, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and
in addition provide broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF is to consolidate peace,
stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of the eligible countries.
By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary countries.

Annual Report 2009Chapter 006 African Development Bank

(iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this initiative,
creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their
debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by
the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or their nominal values, as calculated using
the methodology agreed under the initiatives. Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid
off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates
than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently,
affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values. The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater,
faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative
and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African
countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent
of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the
decision and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

At December 31, 2009, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 28 ADB borrowing countries, of which 19 had reached the
completion point.

(iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the International
Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that
ave reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

 

he main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered
y relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same
amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match

"dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

he MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and
outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in the ADF’s net
assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund. Subsequent write-down
of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI
joan cancellation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have
not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975, an
amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans refundable
directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2009, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2008: US$ 13.45 million) had been so repaid.

(iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance to African

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended 31 December 2009

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (“the Bank”) which comprise the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2009 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity
and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
as set out in notes A to W.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report

Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of the ADF primarily comprise
subscriptions by the State Participants and
the Bank, as well as other resources received
by the Fund including contributions by the
Bank. The cumulative subscriptions to ADF
amounted to UA 18.77 billion at December
31, 2009, compared to UA 18.37 billion at
the end of 2008.

The eleventh general replenishment of the
Fund (ADF-XI) became effective in May 2008
and covers the three-year operational period
starting in 2008 and ending in 2010. As of
December 31, 2009, State Participants had
subscribed a total of UA 3.37 billion representing 91.08 percent of the ADF-XI target
replenishment level of UA 3.70 billion.

Commitments under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI
or Initiative) became effective on September
1, 2006' and covers the period 20062054. To preserve the financial integrity
and the financing capacity of the African
Development Fund, donors have committed to fully compensate the Fund for debts
canceled under the MDRI.

As of December 31, 2009, the Fund had
received from donors aggregate commitments of UA 4.37 billion, representing 78.18
percent of the MDRI cost for the period
2006-2054 of UA 5.59 billion.

Investments

ADF cash and treasury investments amounted to UA 3.18 billion at December 31, 2009,
compared to UA 3.52 billion at the end
of 2008. Investment income for the year

amounted to UA 131.59 million, representing a return of 4.09 percent, on an average
liquidity level of UA 3.22 billion, compared
with an income of UA 109.88 million in
2008, representing a return of 3.17 percent
on an average liquidity of UA 3.47 billion.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancellations, at December 31, 2009,
amounted to UA 18.86 billion compared
to UA 16.76 billion at the end of 2008.
Total outstanding loans, as at December
31, 2009 was UA 5.43 billion, UA 567.28
million higher than the UA 4.87 billion outstanding as at the end of 2008. This increase
was in spite of debt cancellation under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, amounting to UA 207.78 million, for two additional
completion point countries.

At the end of 2009, there were 1,138 active
signed loans and grants. Also at December
31, 2009, a total of 1,101 loans amounting to UA 6.43 billion had been fully repaid.

Disbursements

Disbursements of loans and grants increased
by 53.10 percent from UA 1.13 billion in
2008 to UA 1.73 billion in 2009. As at
December 31, 2009, cumulative disbursements on loans and grants amounted to
UA 13.61 billion. A total of 1,583 loans and
grants were fully disbursed for an amount of
UA 10.67 billion, representing 78.40 percent
of cumulative disbursements.

Financial Results

The Fund earned a surplus of UA 4.70 million in 2009, compared to UA 4.66 million in
2008. Administrative expenses, which represent the Fund's share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB Group, increased by
UA 19.55 million, from UA 138.10 million
in 2008 to UA 157.65 million in 2009. The
Fund's share of the total shareable expenses

of the ADB group is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven
by the relative levels of certain operational
volume indicators and relative balance sheet
size. The Fund’s share of Bank Group shareable expenses was 70.84 % for 2009, compared to 72.13% for 2008. The increase
in the absolute amount of administrative
expenses was attributable to the overall
increase in Bank Group shareable expenses due to increased staffing as a result of
increased activities.

As a result of a higher average loan balance
and recoveries made of loan income arrears
from a borrowing member country during
the year, loan income increased by UA 7.43
million from UA 51.65 million in 2008 to UA
59.08 million in 2009. Investment income
also increased by UA 21.71 million from UA
109.88 million in 2008 to UA 131.59 million
in 2009 as a result of improved market conditions. Discount on the accelerated encashment of demand obligations amounted to UA
28.02 million in 2009 compared to UA 16.18
million in 2008. According to the Fund's nonaccrual policy, service charges on loans made
to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded
from loan income if principal repayment and
service charges are in arrears for 6 months or
more. As a result of this policy, UA 4.80 million of non-accrued loan income was excluded from 2009 income compared to UA 3.39
million in 2008. In addition, UA 6.87 million
of loan income previously not accrued was
recovered and recognized in income in 2009
compared to UA 5.33 million in 2008. The
number of borrowers in non-accrual status
at December 31, 2009 were 3 compared to
4 at the end of December 2008.

 

 

 

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying
debts under MDRI as the relevant countries
reach their HIPC completion points. A summary of the cumulative loan cancellations
under MDRI and HIPC is presented in Note E
to the Special Purpose Financial Statements.

 

' The effectiveness of the MDRI was triggered when the Fund received Instrument of Commitments representing at least 70% of the total cost of debt relief for 14
post-completion countries, of which not less than amounts equivalent to at least 75% of the cost of debt relief incurred during the ADF-X period, were unqualified

commitments for payments due in 2007.

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009

NOTE A- PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African Development
Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, promote cooperation and
increased international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

The ADF's Board of Directors has twelve (12) members, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President
of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred to as the
Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB
finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was
established under an agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB
regional member countries, particularly the lesser-developed countries. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate
and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates
are disclosed in the notes that follow.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other resources
received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of the Fund consisted
of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement establishing the Fund (the Agreement). Thereafter, the
resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose Financial
Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are not intended to be a
presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources represent resources available
o fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and demand obligations of State Participants.
hese special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund,
which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

he significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's special purpose financial statements are as follows:

Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements
he special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of Account as
having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of
MF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles

 

Annual Report 2009African Development Fund Chapter 008

of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This
was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund's Unit of Account
to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this
Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect of the Resolution, and
the Fund's UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank's UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at the rates prevailing at the date of the Statement of
Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment. Translation
gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

2009 2008
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentine Peso 6.106830 5.318560
Brazilian Real 2.728410 3.653610
Canadian Dollar 1.643990 1.890960
Danish Krone 8.106880 8.180030

Indian Rupee 73.179700 74.626300
Japanese Yen 143.797000 140.464000
Korean Won 1,830.440000 1,936.890000
Kuwaiti Dinar 0.449610 0.425038

Swiss Franc 1.615510 1.638390

United States Dollar 1.567690 1.540270

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could have been converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting from the rates indicated above.

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon
submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the ADF receives instruments of
subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the replenishment resolution. The portion
of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet
payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the
replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when
they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant's budgetary appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes. The
notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Annual Report 2009

197198

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

For the ADF-IX, ADF-X and ADF-XI replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with
the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income
generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the
cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on the cash received from State Participants
who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the
effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors of the
Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in that
regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and timely compensation for the
debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

i) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of
he total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs); and

ii) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitment from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five
ercent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-X period.

 

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with effect
from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the Initiative. Donors will contribute
additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for each replenishment period, by
submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in the
contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement establishing ADF. The contributions received from State Participants
under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which
such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately
disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings
Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement which
provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its foreign exchange
value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant shall pay to the
Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of
such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

 

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within that participant’s territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's
holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

 

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09, 2005-01 and 2008-01,
which in turn stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh
general replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms
of agreed parities ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when
received, into UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on
Subscriptions (CEAS).

Annual Report 2009African Development Fund Chapter 008

Investments
The Fund's investment securities are classified based on the Fund's intention on the date of purchase. Securiti
intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. He

les which the Fund has the
d-to-maturity investments

are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund's management has the positive

intention and ability to hold to maturity. The Fund assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists
ments. If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on held-to-maturity inves

or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized

cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the investment's carrying amount and the present

value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at
effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the investment is reduced through the use of an allowance acco
loss is recognized in the income statement. All other investment securities are classified as held-for-trading and

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading portfolio. Purchases and sales of invest
 

 

 

ments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell

he investments.

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans are not
included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future.
Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's
loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from
income on loans for that period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of such
charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the
resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth replenishment, grants
may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations of development resources and
are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under this
initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their
debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from
donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Annual Report 2009

199200

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary
country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net
present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received
and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it falls due with
funds received from the Trust Fund.

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the completion
point under the HIPC framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by additional contributions to be made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When MDRI becomes effective for
a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effectively take on
the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI are included in “Net Debt Relief” and reported in
the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current period's presentation.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the form of
non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing from the
date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per annum and from
years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent
per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date
of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a period of 10
years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or
others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2009, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 21.66 million (2008: UA 35.57 million).

As at December 31, 2009, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of UA
278.54 million (2008: UA 450.83 million) of which UA 73.85 million (2008: UA 33.24 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual status. If
these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2009, would have been higher by UA
2.07 million (2008: UA 1.94 million). At December 31, 2009, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted
to UA 30.83 million, compared to UA 35.36 million at December 31, 2008.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund’s lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10.00 percent
under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.50 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments were allocated
as grants and grant based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified
member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the ninth replenishment were set
aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share
of grants under the tenth and eleventh general replenishments is based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the
seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Annual Report 2009African Development Fund Chapter 008

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period, from the
date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible, the grace
period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement of the operations of
existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years
thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative
Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent
to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the signature of a HIPC
debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present value. The amount of the writedown, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million which was the write-down in respect of the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999
under the original HIPC framework is included in the amount stated as net debt relief in the Statement of Net Development Resources. The
outstanding balance and net present value of the loans owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04
million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing
the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework.
Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total net present value
(NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt
relief is granted between the decision and completion points. Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2009
amounted to UA 184.00 million and are shown as allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the International
Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that have
reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development Committee Communiqué of
September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed
with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

 

 

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries
worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously
safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation is delivered by relieving post-completionpoint HIPCs' repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial
integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal
and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded from net

development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund's balance of net development resources. Cancellation
of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

Annual Report 2009

203Chapter 006 African Development Fund

At December 31, 2009, a gross amount of UA 4.84 billion (2008: UA 4.62 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled under MDRI
for 21 (2008: 19) HIPC completion point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2008: UA 1,011.79 million) in nominal terms
were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71 million (2008: UA 728.71 million). As of
December 31, 2009, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

A summary of debt relief granted under HIPC and MDRI as at December 31, 2009 and 2008 follows:

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC - In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF, the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from
the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-IX) to clear the entire stock of the DRC's arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the
use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-VIII as a partial
payment against the DRC's arrears on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework - The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and integrated
framework for assistance to eligible states, typically regional member countries of ADB emerging from conflict or crisis. The purposes of FSF
are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth.
The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF), which was established as a
framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief
after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate
facility with contributions from the ADF, the ADB and private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to
genuine eligible fragile states not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to
the Bank Group. Contributions made by the Fund to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile states. Contributions by the Fund to the Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net
Development Resources.

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to
the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of a special
general increase and eleven general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions and Voting
Power in Note 0.

 

Annual Report 2009African Development Fund Chapter 008

Negotiations for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund (ADF-XI) were concluded on December 11, 2007 when the deputies agreed to a
replenishment level of UA 5.76 billion, of which UA 2.06 billion represents internally generated resources, for the three-year operational
period 2008 to 2010. ADF-XI came into effect on May 8, 2008 after the State Participants had deposited with the Fund instruments of
subscriptions exceeding the threshold of 30% of pledged subscriptions.

At December 31, 2009 subscriptions to ADF-X! amounted to UA 3.37 billion.

At December 31, 2009 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.58 billion of which UA 318.79 million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid entitle the
State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note O.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund or a member of the
Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of the
Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in
the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 292.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 290.30 million, and by the
Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of the
ortfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

 

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the Bank. While
he principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed
and outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of adminisering the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding loans.

NOTE! - RESERVES

Reserves as at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

NOTE J- TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to
receive other resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2009, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 4.37 million (2008: UA 5.48 million) representing the
balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.
NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's offices, staff,
organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing
formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects executed during the year by
he Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 157.65 million (2008: UA 138.10 million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

he general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 12-member Board of Directors, of which 6 members are selected by the Bank. The
Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF's voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. In accordance
with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB to carry out its functions, for which
it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers
rust funds entrusted to it by some of its State Participants.

Kec Independent Auditor's Report on the Special Purpose
Financial Statements of the African Development Fund

to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the

accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B of the special purpose financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2009.

Investments

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF
are denominated in US Dollars and amounted to UA 102.79 million at December 31,
2009, compared to UA 229.93 million at the
end of 2008. Investment income for 2009
amounted to UA 1.99 million, representing a
return of 1.06 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 187.15 million, compared
with an income of UA 5.35 million in 2008,
representing a return of 2.47 percent on an
average liquidity of UA 216.71 million.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2009, increased by UA 5.00
million to UA 245.81 million compared to
UA 240.81 million at the end of 2008. As at
the same date, there were 32 active signed
loans and 38 fully repaid loans amounting
to UA 53.24 million and UA 98.69 million
respectively.

Disbursements

Disbursements decreased to UA 4.87 million in 2009 from UA 8.46 million in 2008
representing a decrease of 42.43 percent.

Annual Report 2009

As at December 31, 2009, cumulative disbursements amounted to UA 221.69 million. 60 loans were fully disbursed for a total
amount of UA 200.20 million, representing
90.31 percent of cumulative disbursements.

Risk Management Policies and
Processes

Similar to the African Development Bank,
the Nigeria Trust Fund seeks to reduce its
exposure to risks that are not essential to
its core business of providing development
related assistance, such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risks. Note D to the
Financial Statements provides the details of
the risk management policies and practices
employed by the NTF.

Financial Results

The NTF's income before distributions
approved by the Board of Governors
decreased from UA 5.99 million in 2008 to
UA 3.17 million in 2009, due mainly to the
decrease in investment income. Investment
income in 2009 decreased by UA 3.36 million as a result of reduction in average investment funds during the year. Administrative
expenses, which represent the Fund's share
of the total shareable expenses of the ADB
group, decreased by UA 0.69 million from

UA 1.49 million in 2008 to UA 0.80 million
in 2009. The Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB group is based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which
is driven by the relative levels of certain
operational volume indicators and relative
balance sheet size. However, the Fund's total
administrative expense is subject to a ceiling of 20% of its gross income. The Fund’s
reserves net of cumulative currency translation adjustments decreased from UA 158.19
million in 2008 to UA 28.14 million in 2009,
as a result of the withdrawal of funds by
the Government of Nigeria during the year.Nigeria Trust Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

he Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between
he African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank, which is headquarered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund is to
assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect
or a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement expired on April 26, 2006 and has been extended twice for oneyear periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of the operations of the Fund. Following the successful completion of
he independent review, the Agreement has been extended for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by
he International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. The significant accounting policies of the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition
nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest method during the time an investment or loan
is outstanding and held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the
expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued in arrears for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading investments.

Functional and Presentation Currencies
he Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In accordance with Article
VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA).

he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one Special Drawing
Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At December 31, 2009, 1 UA
was equivalent to 1.56769 United States dollars ( 2008: 1.54027 United States dollars).

Currency Translation
ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are transated from U.S. dollars to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves under cumulaive currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity. Capital replenishments
are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses on conversion of currencies into
UA are included in the determination of net income.

 

 

Annual Report 2009222

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets
The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: held-for-trading financial assets, loans and receivables, and held-tomaturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments upon initial recognition.

i) Held-for-Trading Financial Assets
All held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio are
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Held-for-trading financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

ji) Loans and Receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides
money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management has the intent and ability to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Purchases and sales of held-for-trading and held-to-maturity investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon
acquisition of three months or less.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon
discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be
reliably estimated.

Annual Report 2009Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 008

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or held-to-maturity
investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial
asset's original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to
offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded as quoted
in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory
agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not
met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread
or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become
illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing
buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations
are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current asking
prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by using valuation techniques
that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, discounted cash flow
analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which
market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are
reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are
based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not

available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Annual Report 2009 223224

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash flows. Fair values
are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end market equivalent lending rate in that currency, adjusted for
estimated credit risk.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year net income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual
results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets
with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for
which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset
or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events)
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying
amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted
at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement.

ji) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Valuation
techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and
comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and
counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could
affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments

In making judgments to designate assets as held-to-maturity, the Fund makes a positive determination at the acquisition date as to
its intent and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

NOTE C - NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS
1) Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective on or after January 1, 2009 but early adopted by the Fund

IFRS 7: “Financial Instruments: Disclosures”

On March 5, 2009, the IASB issued amendments to the disclosure requirements under IFRS 7. These amendments, which have an effective
date of January 1, 2009, require additional disclosures of fair value measurements in a three-level hierarchy reflecting the relative reliability of such measurements based on the significance of the inputs used. Under this hierarchy, the most reliable measurements are those
based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Fund early adopted the amendments in 2008.

The Fund has adopted the following new and amended IAS/ IFRS in 2009:

Revision to IAS 1: “Presentation of Financial Statements”

A revised version of IAS 1 was issued in September 2007 and became effective for financial year beginning January 1, 2009. The amendments to IAS 1 require the Fund to present in separate statements, changes in equity related to its shareholders and those related to
comprehensive income (i.e. non-shareholder-related components), including related reclassification adjustments of those components.
It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial
statements when the Fund applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement.

The adoption of IAS 1 (revised) by the Fund has no effect on its financial position or performance as it relates solely to the presentation
of the financial statements. It resulted in certain presentation changes in the Fund's financial statements including the presentation of all
items of income and expenditure in two financial statements: the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income.

Comparative information has been re-stated to conform to the current period’s presentation which is in conformity with the revised standard.

IFRS 8: “Operating Segments”

IFRS 8 was issued in November 2006 and became effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009. The standard replaces the reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements
with those used internally by the chief operating decision maker in the allocation of resources and assessing performance.

The adoption of IFRS 8 has no significant impact on the Fund's financial position or performance as it only relates to disclosures. IFRS 8
disclosures are shown in Note K to the financial statements.

3) Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended December 31, 2009, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following new standard is expected to be relevant to the Fund.

IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 as the first part of the IASB’s comprehensive project to replace IAS 39. IFRS 9 replaces those parts
of IAS 39 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the
entity's business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow of the instrument into two measurement categories: those to be measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized cost only
if it is a debt instrument and the objective of the entity's business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows and the asset's
contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be measured at fair value through
profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are held for trading will

Annual Report 2009

225226

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

be measured at fair value through profit or loss; while for all other equity instruments the entity can make an irrevocable election at initial
recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

Adoption of IFRS 9 is mandatory from January 1, 2013 but earlier adoption is permitted. IFRS 9 will have an effect on the current classification of the Fund's financial assets. However since the Fund's assets are mainly project loans and investments and all the investments
are currently held for trading, the impact of adopting IFRS 9 is not expected to be significant for the NTF.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course of exercising
its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of the Fund through the Bank’s
General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority"). The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund's risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank's most senior management
forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. As part of ALCO’s key functions pertinent to the administration of the Fund,
it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and
confirms country credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups that
report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated to the relevant
business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies
and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund
arising from its lending and treasury operations and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending operations, and counterparty credit risk
from treasury operations. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are
described in more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a
country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit risk through financial policies
related to sustainable lending strategies, including individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These
include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

Annual Report 2009228

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The Fund currently lends only to public sector borrowers and such loans carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk rating
scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

| Excellent Very Low Risk A-BBB/Baa
2 Strong Low Risk BB/Ba
Good Moderate Risk BIB

4 Fair

5 Acceptable ee

6 arial High Risk ccc/Caa
7 Special Attention

8 Substandard vo

5 Doubtful Very High Risk CC-D/Ca-D
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic performance, debt
sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and the Fund's portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to
derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and other specialized international organizations.
The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The ALCO
also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

It is the Fund's policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that country,
or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved
loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member
country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

2) Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. The Fund utilizes various financial
instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable
to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Given the nature of the Fund's business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this
risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty
exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the Fund's minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by the ALCO.

Annual Report 2009Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 006

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government Agencies and NA2 AA-[Aa3 AAAIAaa

Supranationals
Banks AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

Corporations including non bank
financial institutions

MBS /ABS No maturity limit, but repayment projections mandatory

AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

The Fund invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa and money market mutual funds
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10% of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit
exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to be predominantly in the AA or higher rated class.

AAA AA A
2009 60% 37% 3%
2008 55% 34% 11%
2007 14% 85% 1%
2006 42% 54% 4%
2005 77% 19% 4%
2004 71% 25% 4%

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to mitigate
liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations.

Currency Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund's resources are denominated.

Annual Report 2009

229Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Interest Rate Risk

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund's loans have fixed interest
rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-month LIBOR in order to manage prudently the available resources.
Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund's equity resources, and is accordingly not hedged.

At December 31, 2009 the Fund had UA 24.12 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2008: UA 23.91 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2% to 4% per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were as follows:

Currency and Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the Fund's assets
are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an impact of approximately
40% on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading investment portfolio. The table below shows the effect
of a parallel yield curve movement of +/-100bps on the portfolio as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are carried out mainly outside the
continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on the basis of the above geographical
areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses ADB's offices, staff, organisation, services and facilities and therefore
has no fixed assets of its own.

Geographical information about income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2009 is detailed as follows:

(UA thousands)
2009
Income from loans - 428 135 308 1,150 2,021
2008
Income from loans - 454 129 311 1,182 2,076

 

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10% or more of the Fund's revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2009.

NOTE L - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 24, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The financial
statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank at its annual meeting in May 2010.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2009

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (“the Fund”) which comprise the balance sheet as
at 31 December 2009 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out
in notes A to K.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement
establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the
Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December
2009, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Origin of Supply (OOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursenment purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated as
evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract supporting an application for
withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for France.

The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditureshave been reported to
the Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

Source of Supply (SOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursement purposes means the country in which the supplier (the primary contractor) is located as
evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a
local dealer in Cote d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for Cote d'Ivoire.

The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to
the Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

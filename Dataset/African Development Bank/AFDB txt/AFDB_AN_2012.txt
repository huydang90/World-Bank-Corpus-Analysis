viii Annual Report 2012Message from the President of

the African Development Bank Group and

Chairperson of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African Development Bank Group

| am pleased to submit the Bank Group’s Annual Report for
2012. The world economy is still showing no significant signs of
recovery from one of the longest economic downturns in recent
memory. Despite this still difficult global context, Africa’s economic performance has maintained the dynamic path of recent
years. Human development indicators continue to improve as
millions are lifted out of poverty. This enthusiasm must be tempered nonetheless by increasing inequalities, issues of inclusion
and jobs. Equally, growth, while continuing to be strong, is still
dependent on a narrow range of growth drivers. Economic
ransformation, the ultimate prize, remains a challenge.

Despite global turbulence, the Bank continued to demonstrate
its remarkable underlying strength and resilience. The financial
results are strong and the risk bearing capacity very robust. This
is attested to by the major rating agencies, who once again reafirmed the AAA rating of the Bank’s senior debt, with a stable
outlook, thanks to strong shareholder support, and prudent
inancial and risk management policies.

n 2012, the Bank committed close to USD 6.3 billion - with the
argest share going to infrastructure. The quality of our portfolio

 

Annual Report 2012

 

continues to benefit from our selectivity and strategic focus. The
ey commitments to further strengthen the Institution made
under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-V1), and the ADF2 replenishment, have been largely delivered. The most recent

eing the launch of the Disclosure and Access to Information
Policy and enhanced decentralization, whose roadmap implementation is on course, with about 35 percent of Bank's operaions staff now managed from the field.

would like to express my appreciation to the Bank’s shareolders and the State Participants of the African Development
Fund for the continued strong support. Despite fiscal pressures,
he GCI-VI subscriptions and implementation are on course
with most countries being up to date. As we begin the ADF-13
negotiations, | look forward to a replenishment that will help
sustain the momentum of growth and poverty reduction, and
urther strengthen the African Development Fund.

Going forward, the Bank will be implementing the new TenYear strategy (2013-2022). The next ten years will be decisive
or Africa as the continent seeks to build on strong growth
hat is broad based and sustainable. Strategic focus on closing the infrastructure gap, economic integration, private secor development and support to fragile states will remain the
pillar of what we do.

 

Finally, the next twelve months will see the first steps in the
process of returning the Bank to its Headquarters in Abidjan. It
is an exercise which is being planned carefully, executed with all
the necessary care and attention, making sure that disruption
to our operational effectiveness is minimized. The strength and
resilience of our Institution, demonstrated at different points
in the past, will stand us well in this respect. As we look ahead,
we can do so with confidence and optimism that we are well
positioned, as demonstrated by our achievements in the last
year, to continue to fulfil the mandate entrusted to us.

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African Development Bank Group and
Chairperson of the Boards of DirectorsExecutive Summary

Africa’s Economic Performance and Outlook

Africa continued to demonstrate resilience in 2012, with its gross
domestic product (GDP) growing by 6.6 percent, compared to
3.5 percent in 2011 (Figure 0.1). In North Africa, Libya’s near doubling of its GDP in 2012, as its oil sector returned to pre-crisis
capacities, was a major factor. In West and Central Africa, net
oil-exporting countries averaged 6 percent growth. In Southern
and East Africa, with South Africa excepted, growth was about
4.5 percent. South Africa itself grew 2.5 percent.

Africa’s inflation averaged about 9.1 percent (only slightly higher than 2011). Bouts of high inflation, especially in East Africa,
showed that prudent fiscal and monetary policies are still
required. Continent-wide, fiscal deficits declined to 2.5 percent
of GDP in 2012 (from 3.1 percent in 2011), with noticeable differences between net oil-importers (4.9 percent) and oil-exporters
(0.8 percent). According to latest data (2011) Africa’s net foreign
direct investment (FDI) (USD 42.7 billion) and remittances (USD
41.8 billion) remained high, while net aid inflows were tepid.

Africa is projected to grow at 4.8 percent in 2013, but with
considerable regional variation. Commodity-rich economies
of West and Central Africa will grow at between 5-7 percent,
1-2 percentage points higher than East Africa and Southern
Africa. North Africa is expected to grow at less than 4 percent.
Countries will continue to explore innovative ways of raising revenue, including going to international markets as done recently
by Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia. Inflation is expected to
remain in single digits, and decline as the impact of the recent
drought subsides.

Achieving Millennium Development Goals

Africa has made progress on the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) and a number of targets will be met, but not all. Extreme
poverty, child mortality and maternal health have improved as
has the incidence of HIV/AIDS and malaria, but by less than
projected. There has been progress on universal primary education and many countries are on target, but quality has been
inadequate. The struggle for gender equality is making inroads,
including in politics and civil society. With respect to environmental sustainability, progress is mixed. There has been some
reduction in ozone-depleting substances, but less progress
towards reforestation. Africa’s good recent performance raises
hopes for a stronger capacity to address poverty and associated social challenges in the medium term.

Transforming the African Economies and

the Bank’s Response

Three Principles. Three broad factors or principles will be crucial
for Africa’s structural transformation: political leadership; the
quality of growth/inclusion of the population in the economic
mainstream, and the interconnectedness of the economies,
nationally, regionally and globally. Effective political leadership
is important for national planning, good investment climate,
provision of services, peace and security and private sector
development. For growth to be transformative, on the other
hand, it must enhance productivity, and lead to diversification.
Socioeconomic equality is a public good that is crucial for the
preservation of peace and harmony and for development. Finally,
Africa needs to increase its interconnectedness to benefit fully
from the opportunities for trade and innovation in the world today.
Infrastructure development will continue to be a key imperative.

Key Drivers. Among the key drivers/enablers are the promotion
of modern technologies, including information and communication technologies (ICT), and enhancement of technical skills
at all levels. Modern technologies are already helping propel

Africans into mobile banking and commodity exchanges. Africa’s
youthful population is a major asset for the continent which, if
well harnessed, could provide a large demographic dividend.
On the other hand, the encashment of resource rents is a major
policy challenge, but one that could be a great opportunity if
resources are deployed to initiate a self-sustaining development
process. Looking ahead, climate change and urbanization will

be important challenges. Careful thinking and planning will be
required to turn them into opportunities, including expanding the middle class and embarking on greener technologies.

Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy. The Bank's Strategy for 2013-2022
has two objectives: inclusive growth and the transition to green
growth. Core priorities are infrastructure development, regional
integration, private sector development, governance and accountability and skills and technology, while areas of special emphasis
include fragile states, gender and agriculture and food security.

Annual Report 2012Bank’s Response. Among specific initiatives for structural transformation is the Bank’s support to the Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA), which includes among its projects Inga, the proposed 40,000 MW power plant in Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). Finding innovative ways to raise
finance for these projects is equally important. In the area of
knowledge generation, the Bank has the determination and the
resources to become the first port of call on information and
analyses of the African economies. Broad collaboration with
regional member countries (RMCs), other multilateral institutions and think tanks is strengthening its role of knowledge
broker. Its flagship publications African Economic Outlook and
African Development Report have a broad readership.

Bank Group Operations by Priority Areas
Overview. |n 2012, the volume of Bank Group operations was
UA 4.25 billion compared to UA 5.72 billion in 2011. This relative
decline was because, at the African Development Bank (ADB)
window, some of the borrowers reached their prudential limits
or were otherwise not able to borrow, while some ADF-only
countries front-loaded resources and exhausted their allocaions. The promotion of infrastructure development continues
© characterize Bank Group operations: energy, transport, and
water and sanitation (Figure 0.2). But there were also substanial investments in agriculture, social, finance, and multisector,
he latter refers to programs involving more than one sector.

Infrastructure/Environment and Climate Change. |n 2012, the
Bank approved UA 891.9 million (about 21 percent of total investment) for 6 operations in the energy sector with the objective
of providing access to modern power for at least 1.2 million
jouseholds across seven countries. The Bank is the implementing agency of the Climate Investment Fund. Through the eight
projects under implementation it is expected that 6.9 million
onnes of CO, emissions will be avoided each year. The Bank
Group invested in transport and related infrastructure to the
une of UA 604.2 million (about 16.8 percent of total) in 2012.
Among others, transport corridors were targeted in West Africa
(Lomé-Cinkansé-Ouagadougou) and Southern Africa (Nicala,
Mozambique, to Lusaka, Zambia, through Malawi). In water and
sanitation, operations worth UA 294.0 million (about 7.5 percent)
were approved targeting beneficiaries across all five of Africa’s
regions. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, the
African Water Facility and the Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program have been instrumental in improving water supply,
enhancing sanitation, and promoting agricultural growth in many
RMCs. Activities in water and sanitation declined compared
to 2011, mainly caused by the frontloading of ADF resources.

 

 

 

Regional Economic Integration. Total approvals for multinational or regional operations amounted to UA 956.2 million
(over 25 percent of total investment), with a sizeable private
sector component (14 percent). Among low income RMCs, the

* Total loan and grant approvals exclude equity participations, HIPC debt relief, and Special Funds.

demand for multinational projects exceeds the resources available under the ADF.

Private Sector. The private sector has grown considerably in the
recent past, with an increasing share of low-income RMCs. Its
approvals in 2012 were some UA 753 million (about 18 percen
of total) for 21 new projects and additional funding to existing
ones. The Bank’s private sector is co-financing the Henri Konan
Bédié Toll Bridge in Céte d'Ivoire. Moreover, in industry ani
agriculture, the private sector has developed strong links with
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). AgVance Africa, a
USD 500 million equity fund was launched for agribusiness
targeting small and medium-size enterprises and is intended
to catalyse USD 7 billion in total investment.

Governance. The Bank approved 42 programs and projects in
support of governance in 22 RMCs, worth some UA 488.2 mi
lion. It continues to underline the importance of policy based
lending operations and institutional support programs coupled
with analytical and advisory services for raising transparency
and accountability and improving the business environment.
Support to Malawi on exchange rate alignment proved very strategic. Equally important was the support provided to regional
agencies in both East and West Africa to create platforms for
payment and settlement systems integration. The African Legal
Support Facility, hosted by the Bank, has provided important
support to RMCs to address litigation issues related to natural
resources extraction. Demand for its services expanded rapidly in 2012.

 

Social and Human Development. Promoting social and human
development, including skills development and science and technology for job creation, are key areas of Bank focus with many pro
xijects in all parts of Africa in 2012 and investment reaching UA 525
million. The Human Capital Strategy to guide Bank operations in
supporting job-creating growth, skills development, popular voice
in service provision and efficiency of public spending was completed. It also promotes the development of safety nets to protect
against economic and social shocks. The Bank has co-sponsored
major conferences in these areas, including a high-level meeting
onscience, technology and innovation in Nairobi and Ministers of
Health and Finance Conference held in Tunis, both in 2012. The
Bank supports universities and other national and regional centres
of excellence, particularly in science and technology.

Bank Operations by Areas of Special Emphasis. The Bank
approved 18 operations in agriculture and food security covering
16 countries and worth UA 381.7 million. The projects included
the rehabilitation of agricultural infrastructure, construction of
access and feeder roads, market infrastructure and storage facilities, strengthening capacity for delivery of agricultural services,
and support to climate change adaptation measures. The Bank
embarked on a Gender Strategy to inform women’s economic
opportunities and knowledge management and capacity building for gender equality. Internally, the Bank broadened its capacity building for gender mainstreaming, especially targeting task
managers. The Bank’s work in fragile states has expanded in
recent years, with offices opened in five countries, as has its total
commitment, about UA 1171 million in terms of budget support
and infrastructure rehabilitation. During the ADF-12 Mid-term
review, delegates commended the Bank’s work while indicating
areas for improvement, including improving clients’ capacity for
project preparation, notably in infrastructure. A recent review of
the Bank’s work in fragile states by the Evaluation Department
has provided further advice, including firmer strategies for institution building. Testimony by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of
Liberia shows that Bank support has been very useful in laying
a basis for full recovery. Notably, road construction has opened
up the countryside, allowing access to markets and raising rural
incomes. Support to public finance reforms has helped the government to manage the country’s scarce resources.

 

The Bank’s Key Corporate Reforms and Governance
Reform Momentum. The Bank in 2012 maintained reform
momentum to enhance results-oriented operational efficiency at headquarters and in the field, and increase capacity to
respond rapidly to client needs in accordance with its operational priorities. Field presence was increased and decisionmaking decentralized, new quality assurance and results tools
and systems have been developed, a framework for engagement
with civil society organizations adopted, and an online operational programming tool launched. Human resources have been
deployed to meet the needs of the Bank, notably the impetus
for decentralization. The Bank’s relative success was shown in
the recent Client Assessment Survey where RMCs reported
viewing the Bank as their “preferred partner”.

xii

Policies and Strategies. During the process leading up to GCI-VI
and the Replenishment of ADF-12, the Bank Group committed
to undertake a number of institutional reforms and to introduce new policies and strategies. Among the new policies are
an Energy Policy, Policy on Program-Based Operations, and a
Policy on Disclosure and Access to Information. The Policy for
Private Sector Development and the associated Strategy are
still under Board consideration. Looking forward, the Bank is
designing approaches to risk management and its engagement with civil society.

Decentralization. Regional Resource Centers were established
in Nairobi and Pretoria in January 2012, enhancing the Bank’s
regional outreach and implementation. With the addition of
South Sudan, 12 of the 18 fragile states now have their own country offices. Furthermore, a customized office was established
in Mauritius. The Bank now has established field presence in 34
RMCs with 573 personnel, of which 360 are professional staff.
An external representation office was also established in Tokyo
during 2012. The Delegation of Authority Matrix was updated
with enhanced business processes and substantial transfer of
operational decisions to field offices.

 

Development Effectiveness. |n 2012, the Bank recorded significant improvement in the quality at entry of its operations. The
quality of Country Strategy Papers increased as well as staff
proficiency in the use of the Results-based Logical Framework
in operational design and implementation. Gender issues were
better mainstreamed and more attention given to social and
environmental safeguards. The Bank is also contributing to
the institutionalization of a results culture in RMCs. However,
the Annual Development Effectiveness Review highlighted the
need for improvement in a number of areas, including human
development.

The ADF-12 Mid-term Review. The mid-term review was completed successfully in September 2012. It noted that the Fund has
demonstrated resilience to economic and security crises, was
responsive to the diverse and changing needs of its clients and
focused on results. Among challenges is the need to strengthen
clients’ capacity for projection preparation, especially in infrastructure, the quality of programmatic support to fragile states,
and ensuring the availability of resources for arrears clearance
in the second pillar of the Fragile States Facility. The ADF-13
replenishment was launched and it will play an important role
in the implementation of the Bank’s Strategy.

Agencies of Corporate Responsibility and Control. The Office
of the Auditor General was expanded in 2012, with increased
audit frequency of operations departments and field offices.
All field offices, including Regional Resource Centers, will be
audited at least once every two years. The Ethics Office undertook a number of initiatives in 2012, including the launching of

Annual Report 2012he Ethics Certification Program. The Office is preparing an
in-depth revision of the Bank’s Code of Conduct. The Integrity
and Anti-Corruption Department has also been strengthened,
enabling it to mainstream integrity programs in operations.
Jointly with other Multilateral Develooment Banks, the Bank
approved a sanctions regime process to be implemented in
accordance with the provisions of the Agreement for Mutual
Enforcement of Debarment Decisions.

Operations Evaluation. During 2012 the Operations and
Evaluation Department conducted evaluations of individual
public projects and project-clusters as well as private-sector
operations, and validated project completion reports. It underook a notable evaluation on Bank’s operations in fragile states.
n addition, it undertook a self-assessment and prepared a new
strategy for more effective evaluations; a rolling annual action
olan, including a results-based work program and a rationalized
budget; and a revised evaluation policy to make it more relevant
© the Bank’s overarching mission. It is encouraging the development of a knowledge and learning culture within evaluation.

 

Boards’ Oversight Functions. The Boards’ deliberations in 2012
were focused on positioning the Bank to effectively support a
ransforming Africa, help improve the quality of its growth and
sustain its benefits. From an institutional perspective, decenralization and the proposed return of the Bank’s operations
‘o its Headquarters in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, also received
significant attention. The Boards of Governors of the African
Development Bank and the African Development Fund met
in Arusha, Tanzania, on 31 May and 1 June during the Bank
Group Annual Meetings which had the theme “Africa and the
Emerging Global Landscape - Challenges and Opportunities”.
The Governors’ Dialogue focused on the Strategy of the African
Development Group then under preparation. The Governors
emphasized that African economies showed resilience in the
midst of continued economic uncertainty. On the other hand,
he Boards of Directors gave considerable time to strategic
operations and institutional matters. They approved the Energy
Policy, a revised Program-based Operations Policy and a new
Disclosure and Access to Information Policy.

 

Annual Report 2012

Sound Financial Management

Strong Financial Position. \n 2012 the Bank was able to weather
the unfavourable global financial environment through sound
financial management, with all four major rating agencies Standard & Poor’s, Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency -reaffirming their AAA and AA+ rating of the
African Development Bank’s senior and subordinated debts
respectively. These ratings have a stable outlook reflecting the
Bank’s strong financial position principally based on sound capital adequacy, prudent financial and risk management policies,
solid shareholder support, and its preferred creditor status. As
at December 31, 2012, the Bank’s paid-up capital amounted to
UA 4.96 billion compared with UA 3.29 billion in 2011, up by UA
1.67 billion representing an increase of 50.76 percent. The Bank’s
callable capital at year-end stood at UA 60.25 billion, including
UA 2118 billion from non-borrowing member countries rated
A- and higher, compared to UA 34.03 billion and UA 18.63 billion, respectively, as at the end of 2011.

=Chapter 1 Africa's Socio-Economic Performance

In 2012, Africa continued to demonstrate considerable resilience to external shocks,

while it also benefited from high commodity prices. This chapter provides a brief overview of

Africa’s performance during this year, including the causes of regional variation, and takes a look

at its medium-term prospects.

1.1 Africa’s Recent Performance

On the whole, African countries showed good performance in
2012. North Africa returned to some growth, reversing the sharp
decline caused by the revolution, while Sub-Saharan Africa
continued to reap the benefits of the natural resource boom.
Sustained policy improvements were a key factor.

Real GDP Growth. Africa’s growth in 2012 is estimated at 6.6
percent—up from 3.5 percent in 2011 (Figure 1.1)—though with
considerable variation across regions and countries. The recovery
and output expansion in Libya, as its oil returned to market, had
an important impact on Africa’s average performance, raising
overall growth by an estimated 2 percent. In its absence, average growth would have been lower than 5 percent. On the other
hand, five countries had negative growth in 2012, mostly due to
escalation in domestic instability including armed insurrection
and political unrest. When excluded, the remainder of Africa
averaged growth close to 7 percent. Excluding South Africa (2.5
percent), which accounts for over a third of the sub-region’s output, growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) exceeded 6 percent. The
natural resource boom—with high commodity prices and large
export volumes—was a major factor in Africa’s growth overall
(Figure 1.2). For example, oil-exporting countries grew 8.7 percent

(compared to only 2.8 percent in 2011). Net oil-importers, on the
other hand, grew only 3.9 percent (against 4.3 percent in 2011).
Africa’s rapid pace of urbanization and its expanding middle
class together also underpin the resilience of domestic demand.

Following the sharp decline in 2011 associated with the Arab
Spring, North Africa rebounded strongly in 2012. Libya grew
95.5 percent (reversing the contraction of 50 percent in 2011)
as full oil production and other economic activities resumed.
Tunisia grew 3.3 percent as its economy, especially tourism,
began a slow recovery. There was also growth in more populous Egypt (2.2 percent) and Algeria (2.5 percent) as well as in
oil-importing Morocco (3.2 percent).

The largest economy in West and Central Africa, Nigeria, grew
6.6 percent, with telecommunications, construction, and agriculture as well as oil providing impetus. Reflecting the commodity boom, Ghana grew 7.1 percent, while Equatorial Guinea and
Gabon grew more than 5 percent on higher oil prices.

East Africa grew at 4.5 percent, aided by increases in
domestic demand, especially investments in infrastructure,
mining, construction, and information and communications
technologies.

Annual Report 2012Africa's Socio-Economic Performance Chapter 1

© African Development Bank

 

In Southern Africa, growth in 2012 was only moderate. South
Africa, the regional growth motor, grew by only 2.5 percent in 2012
(down from 3.5 percent in 2011) under the impact of high unemployment and labour unrest. Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia
grew on average by over 7.5 percent with the commodity boom.

Macroeconomic Performance. Average inflation in Africa, at 9.1 per- Africa m Euro Area m Emerging and Developing Countries
cent in 2012, was slightly higher than 2011 (Figure 1.3) and above
that of comparable regions in the developing world, where inflation
was about 6 percent, and the Eurozone, where it was only about 2
percent. In contrast to past decades, African inflation was mostly
below 10 percent during the 2000s, a reflection of the strength
of macroeconomic management in recent years. However, a further downward trend in inflation is projected in the medium term,
reflecting generally weak global demand, anti-inflation policies
pursued by some African governments, and the fading impact of 2000 ©2002» 2004» 2006» 2008» 2010 2012(e) 2014(p)
the drought that ravaged parts of the continent in 2011.

Africa's fiscal balances moderated in 2012 (Figures 1.4 and
1.5)—with deficits averaging 2.5 percent of GDP (down from
3.1 percent in 2011)—but with big differences between (net) oil
importers (averaging 4.9 percent) and oil exporters (averaging only 0.8 percent). High commodity prices helped boost
government revenues in oil- and metal-exporting countries,
but also enabled them to increase government outlays on fuel
subsidies, among others. Reflecting the commodity boom,
Africa’s current account was robust, with real exports growing
6.9 percent (even as the terms of trade for Africa as a whole
deteriorated as commodity prices moderated while those for
manufactures rose). Current account surpluses of oil exporters
Libya, Congo, Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, and Gabon increased
over 7 percent, while those of mineral exporters Botswana and
Zambia were lower, at about 6.5 percent. On account of higher
import costs for oil and food, the rest of Africa had large current account deficits.

External Financing. Despite the sovereign debt crisis in the
Eurozone, net aid flows to Africa have not fallen in absolute
terms (Figure 1.6). However, because of the global economic
slowdown and fiscal difficulties in many donor countries, aid
flows are expected either to stabilize at current levels or decline
in the near term. Net foreign direct investment flows remained
fairly high (USD 42.7 billion in 2011, the latest year for which
there is sufficient data), though lower than the peak of close
to USD 60 billion in 2008. Remittances grew to USD 41.8 billion
in 2011 (from USD 38.5 billion in 2010).

1.2 Africa’s Economic Prospects

Africa’s medium-term prospects are favourable: commodity
prices will continue to be good, though not reaching recent
peaks, FDI flows will continue to be high in response to the
decreasing macro-risk associated with the African economies,
South-South trade and investment, and good policy frameworks. Risks include domestic political instability and external
price and weather shocks.

Africa’s GDP is expected to grow by 4.8 percent in 2013, slightly
higher than 2012, adjusted for the Libyan effect discussed above.
Growth will be underpinned by:

* expanding domestic demand;

* moderate to high commodity prices;

* increasing South-South trade and investment; and

* investment in energy and transport infrastructure, telecommunications, and social services.

A number of formerly fragile countries in both West and East

Africa are expected to perform well, with positive impacts on
their regions (Map 1.1).

Inflation is expected to recede to single digits in most countries
(averaging about 7.4 percent overall), owing to anti-inflation
policies and projected bountiful harvests in many parts of the
continent. Given narrow tax bases, however, revenue generation will remain a challenge for many countries. A number of
countries are already exploring innovative approaches to raising
resources for domestic investment, especially for infrastructure.
Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Kenya, Namibia, and Zambia have
gone to global markets, and will be followed by many others.

Despite robust recent performance, Africa continues to face
risks and vulnerabilities, including:

* domestic political instability;

* derailed or postponed fiscal reforms; and

* protracted industrial disputes, partly arising from perceived
domestic inequalities.

 

Adverse weather conditions could also again undermine growth
in some countries. And globally, Africa cannot insulate itself
from the risks tied to sluggish recovery, nor the slowdown in
emerging economies including China. The risks need to be
addressed, experience has shown that if ignored they could
erode confidence and reverse progress.

Africa's Socio-Economic Performance Chapter 1

1.3 Africa’s Progress Towards
Achieving Millennium
Development Goals

MDGs are still a work in progress. Although most African countries will not attain them, a key benefit has been the incorporation of the MDG toolkit into their policy frameworks, enabling
efforts to proceed after 2015.

Africa’s recent economic performance has enhanced its chances of reaching some Millennium Development Goals. The
MDG Report 2012, a joint publication by the Bank, Economic
Commission for Africa, African Union and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), notes that most African
countries have made progress on a number of MDG goals and
targets, even though many will not be met by 2015 (Table 1.1).
The Report notes that progress on several indicators is accelerating: universal primary education—total enrolment is now
above 80 percent, with gender parity—though quality remains
poor, and many countries will likely not meet school-completion
targets. Gender equality has received a boost from unlikely
quarters, including women ascending to top positions in governments and as members of parliaments, even in some fragile
states. Attendance at tertiary levels, especially in the sciences,
remains skewed in favour of men, although the share of women
employment outside agriculture is increasing.

 

Progress has been made on environmental sustainability, at least
in terms of minimizing greenhouse-gas emissions and reducing the local consumption of ozone-depleting substances. But
few countries have established full-fledged reforestation plans.

Though many of these targets will not be met, there has been
progress in:

* maternal health;

* child mortality;

* eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; and

* combating the disease burden, including HIV/AIDS and malaria.

For example, poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa—measured as subsisting on less than USD 1.25 a day—declined from 56.5 percent
in 1990 to 47.5 percent in 2008, with more recent data for individual countries showing further improvement. Furthermore,
HIV/AIDS is declining, especially in Southern Africa, as behaviours change and antiretroviral therapies become more available. Looking ahead, resources will be crucial to ensure further
improvements and to address the post-MDG agenda. The
MDG Report 2012 argues that ultimately African countries will
have to transform their economies in ways that support inclusive growth, while generating enough domestic resources to
reduce dependency on external financing, and the implications
of its variability.Chapter 1 Africa's Socio-Economic Performance

Annual Report 2012Chapter 2. Towards the Structural Transformation of Africa's Economies

This chapter discusses the challenges and opportunities linked to structural transformation. It

points at the key drivers, underlines a number of important strategies, and argues that to succeed

the process must be accompanied by visionary leadership. The “structural transformation” of

Africa that we discuss in this chapter means diversifying the sources of economic growth and

opportunity in a manner that promotes higher sector productivity, resulting in sustained and

inclusive economic development.

2.1 Challenges and
Opportunities

A major policy challenge for Africa today is how to broaden
access to economic opportunities for its expanding population,
including the most vulnerable groups. Africa requires structural
transformation to propel it towards inclusive growth.

In Africa, unemployment and underemployment is high overall
but for the youth and women they are especially acute. Although
the size of the middle class on the continent has increased
markedly in the past decade, generating a consumer boom
and higher domestic investment, many poor people struggle to
make a living in urban and rural areas, with little or no access to
social services. In some countries, urban dwellers are worse off
than the cousins they left in the countryside. Addressing these
issues adequately will require the structural transformation of
the African economies.

The global economic and trade environment, including the
international political economy that determines the terms of
trade for Africa, especially for agriculture, continues to impose
constraints on its progress. But Africa cannot afford to remain
isolated from the global economy. It will need to be strategic
and agile in interpreting changes in the global rules of the game
and take advantage of any emerging opportunities. Experience
indicates that trade becomes a real motor for growth only when
it involves goods with high domestic value added, notably manufactures. Also important, regional export and import markets
are crucial for learning how to compete globally. Africa has
shown that it can acquire the skills required to harness modern
technologies, including ICT, to help it leapfrog to development.
It must put these to use in carving out niches for itself in the
global value chain.

2.2 Africa’s Economic Transformation:
Three Key Principles

Africa’s structural transformation will be influenced by three
broad factors. political leadership; the quality of growth, including inclusion of the population; and the degree of economic integration or interconnectedness—nationally, regionally and globally.

Africa’s economic transformation is going to be driven by many
factors not least regional political events, weather, and international price shocks. We can identify three interrelated factors
or principles to which African countries should adhere as they
embark on structural transformation.

Political Leadership. There is no single model for successful
economic development and poverty eradication, as demonstrated by countries from Asia to Latin America. However,
success comes from leadership that has vision and capacity
to implement its program. It is important to underline that the
quality of the political leadership required will become even
more important as African countries develop not less. This
is because political stability is critical for national planning,
sustaining macroeconomic policies and for creating a good
investment climate. Likewise, good leadership will be crucial in
guiding economies to middle income status, while minimizing
income inequalities and social tensions. Political leadership
must be accompanied by stronger institutional capabilities,
which are important for the provision of social services, maintenance of peace and security, and private sector participation
in the economy.

Quality of Growth/Inclusion. For growth to be transformative, it must enhance productivity, add value, support innovation, including in the use of domestic resources, and lead to
economic diversification. Africa will need to harness all available opportunities to attain a more dynamic growth process.
Incorporating the population into the socio-economic mainstream has always been, at least nominally, the goal of most
African governments. But it must happen in fact to make a

Annual Report 2012difference. The exclusion of women, the youth and other vulnerable groups from the mainstream development process has
consequences. The Arab Spring and similar uprisings indicate
hat although deep economic disaffection could exist side by
side with apparent affluence for a while, eventually serious
social tensions break out. Socio-economic equality is thereore a public good that is crucial for the preservation of social
peace and harmony—which are in turn important for growth
and wealth generation. Climate change impacts will also be a
ey factor on the quality of growth in Africa.

Economic Integration—National, Regional and Global. Africa
jas Opened up to the world in the past few decades as never
efore—with the private sector taking the lead. Africa’s Diaspora
sends home resources every year that exceed total Official
Development Assistance (ODA) for some countries on a per
capita basis. The mobile phone and associated ICT innovations
ave enhanced the interconnection of many individuals and
usinesses, and led to a new industry comprising e-services.
Modern travel has also greatly expanded all over Africa. However,
ogistical and policy impediments to economic integration at
he national and sub-regional levels, and by implication into the
global economy, persist. Without addressing them, Africa will
not benefit fully from its increasing global economic importance.
Africa's economic infrastructure remains a key constraint to interconnectedness and hinders countries from linking and benefit
 

 

Towards the Structural Transformation of Africa's Economies Chapter 2

ting from domestic, regional and global opportunities. Railways,
a common and cheap form of transportation elsewhere in the
developing world, has been slow to develop in Africa. The existing railway infrastructure is old and little investment has been
attempted in the last decades. The road infrastructure, though
vaster, is uneven and concentrated in urban areas. Rural parts
of the countries are poorly served and spatial inequalities continue to fuel disaffection and sometimes dissent in many RMCs.
Infrastructure and related skills development will be important
for connecting Africa within and to the rest of the world. Above
all it will support the economies of agglomeration that have
propelled other regions of the world to rapid development.

2.3 Key Drivers of Economic
Transformation

Above we mentioned three interrelated principles around
which Africa’s economic transformation is revolving and will
continue to do so in the decades to come. The key message is
that Africa should accelerate its structural transformation by
boosting the potential of its youthful population, investing in
science and technology and innovation, speeding up its rate
of economic integration, greening the economy and supporting private sector enterprise. To provide some granularity, we
have identified 9 key drivers that will be most important in this
regard (Figure 2.1).

 

Box 2.1

Example of Bank Support to Payment and Settlement Systems Integration

The Bank has provided financing to payment systems reforms to the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and more
recently to the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ). This was in response to plans by leaders of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), which covers most of West Africa, to introduce a monetary union. In 2012, the Bank approved
a similar project for the East African Community (EAC), focusing on payment and settlement systems. Even in this case the
ultimate goal is the introduction of a monetary union for the EAC.

The Bank’s support to payment and settlement integration projects in both East and West Africa illustrates the importance
it attaches to ICT innovations for financial systems harmonization, economic integration and growth. The projects revolve
around an ICT-based technological platform that provides a common foundation for the countries in the region and a basis for
further enhancements and development. The projects also have a capacity development component to ensure sustainability.

Among the benefits have been the following:

* Technical upgrade to payments systems, making cross-border settlements faster and safer, and providing a basis for regional
currency convertibility;

* More effective implementation of monetary policy and hence promotion of macroeconomic stability and mitigation of systemic risk;

+ Increased cross-border trade;

¢ Better financial market regulation and greater predictability to financial transactions; and

* Policy dialogue and movement toward economic integration.

Box 2.2
Harnessing ICT Innovation for Economic Development

Many African governments are attracted by ICT opportunities and are moving forward with concrete plans. Kenya's state-ofthe-art business and science park Konza Techno City—nicknamed Silicon Savannah—is being developed to attract technology
companies and financial services firms, innovative thinkers and entrepreneurs, and multinationals looking for a low-cost, highquality outsourcing destination. Also near Nairobi is iHub—associated with Ushahidi, the best-known African-created software
platform—which is part of a much larger African movement providing space for young technology entrepreneurs to network

while receiving mentorship. Kenya’s iHub success in bringing together tech companies and investors has been widely copied
elsewhere. There are now technology labs—focusing on young entrepreneurs, web and mobile-phone programmers, designers,
and hackers—in Kampala (Hive CoLab); Dar es Salaam (Kinu); Dakar (Bantalabs); Tshwane (mLabs Southern Africa); Douala
(ActiveSpaces); and coming soon in Accra and Lagos.

 

12 Annual Report 2012Governance/Investment Climate. There has been a drastic
change in how investors perceive the macro-risk associated
with doing business in Africa, as a result of improved governance, better macroeconomic policies—lower debt, low inflaion and stable exchange rates. The growing middle class and
more peaceful conditions are additional positive factors. Many
African countries are taking advantage of this by issuing bonds
on international markets, which has created strong momenum that is expanding and developing the continent’s nascent
inancial markets.

ICT Innovations. Africa has shown that it can acquire the skills
required to harness modern technologies, including ICT, to
elp it leapfrog to greater development. Investments in ICT
ave greatly improved public access to information, spurring
a knowledge economy and innovative approaches to microinance and the mobilization of rural producers. An example is
M-PESA, Kenya’s innovative mobile banking platform, which
as influenced similar developments on the continent and
elsewhere. Today, the mobile phone industry represents some
4 percent of Africa’s GDP and employs directly or indirectly
over 5 million people. Broadband penetration is projected to
cover over 50 percent of the African population in the next 20
years (from 7 percent in 2010). This is bound to revolutionize
commerce on the continent.

 

Natural Resources. |t is estimated that Africa’s natural
resource extractive industries will contribute over USD 30 billion per annum in government revenues in the next 20 years.
Governments will need to maximize value-added while limiting
negative environmental and macroeconomic impacts.

Box 2.3
Transforming Agriculture in Nigeria

Towards the Structural Transformation of Africa's Economies Chapter 2

Infrastructure. Africa’s infrastructure financing needs—about
USD 390 billion in the medium term, mostly for power and energy—are in the USD trillions in the longer term. Natural resources could finance a substantial part of Africa’s infrastructure
development. Many countries have already issued Eurobonds
for infrastructure, on the basis of natural-resource revenues.
And better infrastructure—including especially access to clean
water and proper sanitation, electricity, as well as better roads
to markets—can play an important role in reducing poverty.

Demographics. Young people comprise the bulk of Africa’s one
billion population. To convert this “youth bulge” into a “demographic dividend” will require the creation of job opportunities
ona large and unprecedented scale by focusing on skills and
entrepreneurship development. Parallel urbanization—and
expansion of Africa’s middle class—create opportunities for
investment in consumer goods industries and services, as well
as in modern agriculture, with potential for employment creation. To break cycles of intergenerational poverty and increase
social mobility, governments will need to raise their outlays on
education while protecting the rights of women, children, and
other vulnerable groups.

Agriculture. Promoting agriculture—which provides direct inputs
to the agro-processing value chain, supplies food to urban areas,
and is a source of household savings for investment (the “agricultural surplus”)—continues to be the most effective way of
driving inclusive growth and poverty-reduction in Africa. The
continent needs its own green revolution. Reforms to improve
land use—and policies aimed at overcoming barriers to women’s
ownership of land—are key, as well as commercialization of agri
 

 

Though its share of GDP has been eclipsed by oil and allied services plus government since the 1960s, Nigeria’s agricultural
economy is still the key source of livelihood for the majority of the population, and Nigeria’s government is targeting it
—in an effort worth NGN3 trillion (70 percent private funding)—as an important basis for economic diversification and growth.
The strategy is a government-enabled but private sector-led initiative—to which American and Chinese firms have already
pledged USD billions—to:

* improve agricultural yield to engender food security while reversing food imports and boosting exports, raising rural incomes
and welfare and reducing poverty;

* restore variety and depth of agricultural production while creating employment; and

* boost higher value-added manufacturing in agro-processing.

The focus is on improvements in financing (especially private lending), investment, inputs (especially fertilizer and improved
seeds), and marketing. Rice, cassava, sorghum, cotton, and oil palm are especially targeted. The government has also improved
extension services and provided high-yield seeds and other inputs while in some cases (cassava and oil palm) helping link
local producers to foreign buyers.

 

Annual Report 2012 13Chapter 2. Towards the Structural Transformation of Africa's Economies

culture, which will require the develooment of better extension
services, improved technology, and irrigation systems as well
as feeder roads to industrial hubs and other marketing infrastructure. The introduction in Ethiopia of a digitalized agricultural commodity exchange—offering real-time information on
prices and quantities—has greatly boosted farmer confidence
and productivity by reducing market risk. This technology is
now being sought by many other African countries.

Climate Change. The impact of climate change on Africa’s
agricultural productivity, food and water security, disease control, bio-diversity, and land degradation may be devastating.
Countries as well as regional economic communities must incorporate climate change as a crosscutting issue in their development strategies, focusing adequate financing on mitigation
and especially adaptation, while also emphasizing technology
transfer, research and dissemination of findings.

 

The Private Sector. As Africa’s economies expand, the private
sector—with currently 90 percent informal employment—wil
become even more important, especially in industry. There
has been a fundamental shift in policies—many countries now
consider private enterprise a key partner in development—bu
there are still obstacles, including high rates of taxation and
inadequate access to financing, as well as to electric power.
Governments must remove obstacles to formal firms while ameliorating conditions for informal ones. Foreign investment an:
associated technology transfers will continue to be importan
for the development of private enterprises. Some African firms
are also borrowing best practices from China and other Asian
countries. In the wake of the global economic recession, many
regions of the world are rethinking their approach to industria’
policy. This is well worth consideration in Africa too.

Urbanization. Africa's cities, with 40 percent of the popula
tion in 2010—projected to be 50 percent in a generation, an

65 percent by 2060—are increasingly the drivers of growth. The
50 largest cities (currently with 13 percent of the population

 

Box 2.4
Key Strategies for Africa’s Socio-Economic Transformation

and 25 percent of GDP) are expected to grow to 50 percent of
the population and contribute nearly 40 percent of total GDP
by 2025. Africa’s roughly 150 “middleweight” cities (currently 7
percent of the population) will increase to about 20 percent in
a decade, with a similarly increasing share of GDP. Urban concentrations of population allow for specialization—via industry
clusters and economies of scale—enhancing productivity and
export competence. Industrial clustering has been critical for
Chinese manufacturing growth, and could be for Africa as well.
But urban areas also provide serious challenges to government,
especially in supply of housing, infrastructure, and services,
including controlling pollution and crime. Strategies will be
needed to ensure that benefits of urbanization are maximized
while negative effects are minimized.

2.4 Strategies for Africa’s
Economic Transformation

Strategies for Africa’s economic transformation are not beyond
the reach of African governments. But they will require a conducive and peaceful environment, dedicated implementation
and monitoring and evaluation.

Strategies to unlock Africa’s potential—including better nutrition
and improved access to basic services (including education),
then matching the skills of the youthful population to dynamic,
self-reinforcing, value-adding industrialization—are neither radical nor new (Box 2.4). Peace is indispensable. Africa’s leaders
will need to sustainably harness the continent’s human and
natural resources, yet strategies and policies must be crafted
and driven by citizens. Policy ownership will be crucial. Africa
must devote adequate financial and human resources to building capacities and mobilizing its rural and urban populations for
development. Africa must remove gender barriers and allow
for the full participation of its women in politics and economics, eliminating constraints to ownership of property, including
land. In the next chapter, we look at examples of how the Bank
is supporting Africa’s structural transformation.

* Peace and elimination of causes of national and regional conflict;

+ Visionary leadership, without which reforms and development roadmaps are likely to flounder;

* Strong and effective government institutions, while empowering women and youth;

* Human development, including education and training, science and technology, and improvements in basic services;

+ Diversification, especially in agriculture and rural areas, including sustainable greening of the economy and promotion of

manufacturing; and

+ Trade, especially within Africa, with domestic and regional investment in infrastructure as the backbone for economic integration.

Annual Report 2012© African Development BankChapter 3 The Bank's Response to the Challenges of Economic Transformation

The Bank is keenly following the progress of its regional member countries in their pursuit of

structural transformation. This chapter provides examples of policy and operational measures

undertaken in recent years to bolster these transformation efforts at country as well as regional

levels. Of key importance is the recent adoption of a Ten-Year Strategy for the Bank’s operations.

3.1 The Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy

The overarching goal of the Strategy is to promote socially
inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth.

The Bank envisions a stable, integrated, and prosperous Africa
with competitive, diversified, growing economies participating
fully in global trade and investment. The Bank sees Africa as the
next emerging market. As Africa adjusts to the emergence of
the South—especially China—and the real possibility of Africa’s
achieving economic transformation in a generation, the Bank’s
role and modalities also require adjustment. Global trade patterns as well as flows of FDI and remittances have changed.
The financing of Africa's development—traditionally based on
ODA—will also have to change.

The Bank has developed a strategy for supporting and promoting Africa’s economic transformation during 2013-2022.
It has two objectives—inclusive growth and the transition to
green growth. They relate to the promotion and maximization of opportunities from economic growth through building
resilience, promoting sustainable infrastructure and managing
natural resources efficiently and sustainably, including enhancing agricultural productivity. The Strategy continues to focus
on the Bank’s core operational priorities such as infrastructure
development, regional integration, private sector development,
governance and accountability, and skills and technology. It
underlines areas of special emphasis including fragile states,
agriculture and food security, and gender.

 

Box 3.1
Elements of the Bank Group’s Ten-Year Strategy

Goal: Improving the quality of growth—for inclusive and green development

Core operational priorities:

+ Infrastructure development;

* Regional integration;

+ Private sector development;

* Governance and accountability; and
* Skills and technology.

Areas of special emphasis:

+ Fragile States;

+ Agriculture and food security; and
* Gender.

Financing the Strategy:

+ The Bank will seek new and creative ways of mobilizing resources, especially by leveraging its own resources.

16

 

Annual Report 2012The resources required to implement the Strategy will be enormous and the Bank’s finances will only account for a small fraction of the requirements. The Strategy envisages creative ways
of mobilizing resources for Africa's development, including
the Bank’s use of its own resources to leverage private sector
financing for RMCs.

3.2 Specific Initiatives Targeted
at Enabling Economic
Transformation

Looking ahead, regional infrastructure, support to the private
sector, human development and strategic partnerships will be
key ingredients of the Bank’s approach.

The Bank has decentralized with newly-created, dedicated
service centres in Nairobi and Pretoria—which will facilitate
implementation of Bank projects—and more field offices and
staff, especially in fragile states. Bank initiatives and programs
are contributing to Africa’s economic transformation. A few
current and planned initiatives are highlighted here.

At continent level, the Program for Infrastructure Development
in Africa (PIDA)—conceived by the Bank, the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), the African Union Commission
(AUC), and the New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD), and whose full cost by 2040 is estimated at USD
360 billion—intends to connect African roads, railways, oil and
gas pipelines, power networks, and ICT. There is broad agreement that such infrastructure connecting Africa will be transformational:

* promoting regional economic integration;

* bringing about a dramatic reduction in energy costs while
increasing access;

* reducing transport costs;

* enhancing water and food security; and

* boosting ICT services and connectivity.

PIDA has initiated a Priority Action Program for 2012-20 to
embark on its initial phases. Inga—the 40,000 MW power plant
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)—is a PIDA project.

Financing Africa's economic transformation will require innovative thinking. The Bank is planning two important initiatives:

* an infrastructure bond managed by the Bank but financed by
African governments and central banks; and

*a Green Africa Fund focusing on adaptation to climate
change—as opposed to mitigation—the current focus of
international programs.

Annual Report 2012

The Bank's Response to the Challenges of Economic Transformation Chapter 3

 

In 2012 the Bank launched AgVance Africa—a USD 500 million equity fund of funds for agribusiness—targeting small and
medium-size enterprises (SMEs), the backbone of job creation
in many African countries. It is expected to catalyse USD 7 billion in total investment. The Bank will also embark on tradefinance operations which have potential to open up markets
for small-scale operators in Africa, encouraging innovation and
increasing competitiveness.

Sustaining Africa’s economic transformation will require a
well-educated labour force. The Bank has emphasized skill
enhancement at the primary and tertiary levels. The Bank’s support to Africa’s universities and national and regional centres
of excellence, especially in science and technology, is crucial.
The Bank—jointly with the AUC, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA), and the International Labour
Organization (ILO)—also launched an Africa-wide initiative to
accelerate countries’ responses to youth unemployment.

3.3 The Bank as a Knowledge Broker

The Bank has the determination and the resources to become
the first port of call on information and analyses on the African
economies. Broad collaboration with the RMCs, other multilateral institutions and think tanks is strengthening this further.

Though it is Africa’s premier development finance institution,
the Bank does more than just finance, including seeking solutions to Africa’s challenges and sharing its analyses broadly.
The Bank has strengthened the Chief Economist Complex, enabling staff to undertake recent cutting-edge analyses on both
Africa’s middle class and youth unemployment. Analyses often
require a wide variety of robust data, for which the Statistics
Department (ESTA) has been vital. Its support to statistics offices in African countries is one of the most important capacity

enhancement efforts that the Bank has undertaken. The Bank
has also become the best source for Africa's consumer price
index, and it is increasingly being used as a source of statistical data and indicators for African countries (See http://www.
afdb.org/en/knowledge/statistics/data-portal/). The Bank's
new information disclosure policy allows full online access to
its internal information.

The nature and extent of capacity building dictate how successfully best practices in operations and knowledge-generation
can be replicated by others. The Bank’s African Development
Institute plays a critical role in capacity building both at headquarters and in the field, where its vast network of national
and regional think tanks is crucial to its mission of enhancing
Africa’s capacity for economic development.

The Bank is collaborating with the AUC and the ECA on a framework document for Africa’s economic transformation entitled
“Africa in 2063’—i.e., one hundred years since formation of the
Organization of African Unity—which will be presented at the
2013 African Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa in May.
The Bank's African Development Report 2012 is focused on
greening the economy. It’s African Economic Outlook 2012—
published jointly with the OECD, ECA and UNDP, and focused
on youth unemployment—attracted much attention. The Banksponsored African Economic Conference (held in Kigali in
November 2012) attracted researchers from throughout the
world to discuss Africa’s economic transformation. The Bank's
High Level Dialogue Seminars—already held in Tunis, Lusaka,
and Cairo, and planned elsewhere—have been praised for their
relevance and candour.

 

Part Il of the report, which follows, focuses on the Bank’s operations and policies and its internal administration. It provides
good examples of what needs to be done on the ground to
transform Africa, and how the Bank is streamlining its operations to enhance its capacity to deliver.

This chapter discusses Bank Group operations during 2012. It begins with a global overview and

then looks specifically at Bank Group operations by window that is the ADB, ADF, and the Nigeria
Trust Fund (NTF), as well as the Special Funds. The presentation then proceeds to discuss approvals
by sub-region, priority areas and areas of special emphasis.

4.1 Overview of Bank Group
Operations

In 2012, the volume of Bank Group operations was UA 4.25 billion
compared to UA 5.72 billion in 2011. At the ADB window, some
borrowers reached their prudential limits, while some ADF-only
countries front-loaded resources and exhausted their allocations.
Selectivity and focus continue to reflect the lending outcomes,
with infrastructure leading at about 50 percent of tota/—but
much higher if infrastructure related interventions in other
sectors are included.

Overview. Total Bank Group approvals for 2012 were UA 4.25
billion, representing a significant decline from 2011, when approvals totalled UA 5.72 billion (Figure 4.1). The impact of the Arab
Spring explains to a large extent both the increase seen in 2011
and the lower uptake in 2012. Countries such as Tunisia and
Morocco received sizeable urgent support in 2011 to relieve
pressure on their economies. This continued in 2012 for Morocco,
which received UA 754 million, more than double the amount of
UA 355 million approved in 2011. The amount to Tunisia declined
in line with the lending limits for the country in place in 2012.
Negotiations with Egypt for support have not yet been concluded. The other middle income countries (MICs) Cit is mainly

he ADB window’s uptake that fell off in 2012) did not increase
heir borrowing. Improvements in their fiscal conditions as a
result of the commodity boom, and therefore in no immediate
need of financing, is a possible additional factor. Furthermore,
he Bank Group’s outlay on heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPC) debt relief operations witnessed a sharp decline. Of the
otal approvals for 2012, UA 3.60 billion (84.7 percent) were in
he form of loans and grants, compared to UA 4.13 billion (72.5
ercent) in 2011. A total of UA 650.9 million (15.3 percent) went
o debt relief, private sector equity participation, and special
unds allocations.

During 2012, approvals at the ADB window amounted to UA
2.08 billion (48.9 percent of total approvals) a decline of about
44.0 percent compared to 2011. ADF approvals reached UA 1.89
illion (44.4 percent of total), a 3 percent increase, while those of
he NTF, UA 14.1 million (0.3 percent of total), saw a 30 percent
increase. Special Funds increased by 43 percent, amounting to
UA 269.0 million (6.3 percent of total).

(34.7 percent). NTF disbursements were UA 1.76 million (0.3
percent). The Bank's better streamlined business process, including reducing the time gap between loan approval and first disbursement, has been an important factor. So too is the Bank’s
enhanced field presence, accompanied with the delegation of
authority to field staff and increasing use of country systems. In
particular, project dedicated project implementation units (PIUs)
have been reduced. The introduction by the Bank of fiduciary
Clinics for its own staff and those of its clients has also contributed positively. However, notwithstanding these improvements,
the Bank is yet to meet its own ambitious target to reduce the
time elapsed between loan approval and first disbursement
to ten months. Further improvements in quality at entry, and
strengthening country systems through policy dialogue and
targeted technical assistance will be required in the years ahead.

4.2 Bank Group Operations
by Window

Aside from lending to public sector projects in MIC countries,
the ADB window also lends to the private sector in all RMCs,
including fragile states. Also for ADF clients, lending for infrastructure is the largest component, over 50 percent.

African Development Bank. The ADB is the Bank Group's nonconcessional window. It was newly replenished under the 6th
General Capital Increase. It finances operations in 15 MICs and
one blend country, Nigeria, which can borrow from the ADB
and ADF windows. The ADB window also finances the private
sector operations of the Bank Group (without government
guarantee) and multinational projects.

In 2012, the ADB window had 48 operations (worth UA 2.08 billion) compared to 59 (worth UA 3.69 billion) in 2011 (Figure 4.4).
The decline, as indicated earlier, was not due to low demand,
rather to the reaching of sustainable lending thresholds for the
year by some countries. Sectors registering decline included
finance, multisector operations, and industry.

Figure 4.5 shows the distribution of the ADB’s loan and grant
approvals by sector during 2012 with infrastructure as the
dominant sector followed by finance, social sector, multisector,
industry and agriculture. Within infrastructure, energy forms the
highest component, with 74.2 percent, followed by the water
supply (19.4 percent) and transport (6.4 percent). Investment
in water and sanitation declined in 2012 due to reaching prudential limits by some ADB countries.

 

Figure 4.6 shows the distribution of ADB’s loan and grant approvals during 2012, by country. Morocco was by far the most active
borrower on the ADB window, followed by Tunisia, which received
an Economic Recovery and Inclusive Development Support Loan
aimed at social rehabilitation. South Africa received public and

private support, while the remaining countries received only
private sector financing from the ADB window.

African Development Fund. The ADF is the Bank Group’s concessionary window. It provides financing for low-income RMCs
using a Performance-Based Allocation (PBA) system to ensure
efficiency and equity.

In 2012, ADF total approvals comprising loans, grants, project
preparation facility resources, and HIPC debt relief operations,
amounted to UA 1.89 billion, compared to UA 1.83 billion in
2011 (Figure 4.7). Grant approvals in 2012 were UA 612.6 million, compared to UA 567.4 million in the previous year. In 2012,
HIPC debt relief operations financed by ADF declined by some
35 percent to UA 112.2 million, consistent with the reduction in
the number of countries in the HIPC process.

Figure 4.8 shows the distribution of ADF loan and grant approvals, by sector, in 2012. The infrastructure sector recorded the
highest share (54.6 percent) followed by multisector, agriculture
and social at 22.6, 12.3 and 10.5 percent, respectively. Within
infrastructure, transport was dominant followed by energy
and the water and sanitation. The relative low share of water
and sanitation was due to frontloading of ADF resources and
changes in some countries’ priorities.

Figure 4.9 shows the distribution of ADF loan and grant approvals during 2012 by beneficiary. However, it should be noted
that a substantial amount of ADF resources was allocated
to multinational projects, amounting to UA 683.1 million (UA
310.8 million in grants and UA 372.3 million in loans). Ethiopia,
Tanzania, Ghana and Uganda are highest on the list. Important
to note also is that a number of fragile states benefitted from
grant resources. In countries as diverse as Zimbabwe and Sierra
Leone, ADF grants enabled governments to embark on important projects in infrastructure rehabilitation.

The Nigeria Trust Fund. The NTF was established in 1976 by the
Federal Republic of Nigeria, with an initial capital equivalent of

25Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

USD 80 million (NGN 50 million) with the aim of accelerating
economic development and social progress in Africa, particularly
in the low-income countries. It provides concessional resources
for projects in various sectors and debt relief to eligible countries. During 2012, it provided two loans for Malawi and Zambia,
both amounting to UA 12.9 million. In addition, UA 1.2 million
financed HIPC debt relief for Guinea.

Given the relatively small size of the window, we look at the
cumulative number of operations over the past 37 years to
provide some trends. During 1976-2012 cumulative NTF loan
and grant approvals totalled UA 333.2 million for 76 operations
in 34 RMCs. Figure 4.10 shows that the West Africa sub-region
received 37.5 percent, followed by East Africa, 26.9 percent,
Southern Africa, 26.8 percent, North Africa, 3.1 percent, and
Central Africa, 1.5 percent. Multiregional projects received 4.2
percent of NTF cumulative approvals.

Leveraging Resources and Partnerships. The Bank has consciously reached out to bilateral, multilateral and non-traditional
artners to leverage its own resources. This takes many forms,
ranging from co-financing operations to creation of trust funds
or thematic initiatives. While donor countries continued to
‘ace serious economic challenges during the global crises, their
commitment to the Bank remained strong. In 2012, a total of UA
99.3 million was mobilized from donors to replenish existing
hematic (UA 84.6 million) and bilateral Trust Funds (UA 14.7
million, namely Korea, to the tune of UA 13.8 million and Finland
or an amount of UA 0.9 million). In terms of the sector distriution of Trust Fund resources (Figure 4.11), 51.7 percent was
mobilized for water, 15.8 percent for regional integration, 13.9
ercent for knowledge sharing, 13.1 percent for climate change
and 5.4 percent for cross-cutting issues. A matrix of trust funds
resources available for commitment as of 31, December 2012 is
rovided in Annex IV.

 

Figure 4.10
Cumulative NTF Approvals by Sub-region, 1976-2012

In 2012, the Bank and the Government of Korea co-hosted
the 4th Korea Africa Economic Technical Cooperation Fund
(KOAFEC) Ministerial Conference in Seoul, Korea, whose theme
was “inclusive growth.” During the meetings, an amended
Agreement of KOAFEC was signed between Korea and the
African Development Bank, for an additional amount of USD 15
million for the 2013 and 2014 work program. In 2012, the African
Development Bank opened the Bank’s External Representation
Office for Asia in Tokyo, Japan. This is the Bank's first representation outside Africa. The main objectives of the Office are to foster
dialogue and partnerships and strengthen the Bank’s advocacy
role on African development issues in the Asia and Pacific region.

The Bank Group and the HIPC Process. The Bank Group is a
key participant of international debt relief programs under the
Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The objective of these initiatives is to reduce the external debt burden
of eligible countries to a sustainable level, freeing resources
for development programs and poverty reduction. At the end
of 2012, 29 of the 33 regional member countries potentially
eligible for HIPC/MDRI debt relief assistance had reached the
completion point and qualified for irrevocable HIPC debt relief
and MDRI debt cancellation.

As at 31 December 2012, out of a total commitment of US 6.0
billion, the Bank Group has provided, in nominal terms, USD 3.5
billion to 30 post-decision point RMCs under the HIPC Initiative.
Financing sources of the Bank Group’s share of HIPC debt relief
comprise: (i) USD 416.2 million from internal resources; (ii) USD
608.9 million from arrears clearance; and, (iii) USD 3.0 billion
contributed by donors through the World Bank Debt Relief Trust
Fund. During 2012, the Boards of Directors approved MDRI debt
relief of USD 34.4 million, USD 204.5 million and USD 94.4 million for Comoros, Cédte d’lvoire and Guinea, respectively.

Annual Report 20124.3 Bank Group Operations
by Sub-region

Operations in North Africa and Southern Africa mainly rely on
funds from the ADB window, and other regions mostly from the
ADF. The private sector window of the ADB provided additional
resources to all regions—but with a higher share per country
going to MICs. In Southern Africa lines of credit to the banking
sector played an important role.

Bank Group Loan and Grant Approvals by Sub-region. For
illustrative and not strictly operational purposes, the Bank’s
operations in 2012 can also be split among five sub-regions:
Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and
West Africa. During 2012, Bank Group loan and grant approvals
for all five sub-regions and multinational projects and programs
amounted to UA 3.60 billion (Annex I). The distribution was as
follows: North Africa, UA 112 billion (31.0 percent); Southern
Africa, UA 464.0 million (12.8 percent); East Africa, UA 447.2
million (12.4 percent); West Africa, UA 441.2 million (12.2 percent); and, Central Africa, UA 323.0 million (8.8 percent). Loans
and grants approvals for multinational projects and programs
amounted to UA 812.0 million (22.5 percent).

North Africa. North Africa includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia. With the exception of
Mauritania, which is an ADF-only country, the rest are “ADB
countries”, that is they can only borrow from the ADB window. Algeria and Libya have little tradition of borrowing from
the Bank. However, Mauritania can also borrow from the ADB
for enclave projects and non-sovereign entities in that country can access the private sector window. Several operations,
covering all sectors, were approved for countries in the North
Africa sub-region during 2012. Infrastructure (water and sanitation, energy, communication and transport) at UA 596.1 million
(53.4 percent) had the largest share of the resources, social, UA
326.9 million (29.3 percent), multisector, UA 103.1 million (9.2
percent), agriculture UA 88.7 million (7.9 percent), and finance,
UA 0.7 million (0.1 percent).

West Africa. West Africa comprises Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape
Verde, Céte d'Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo.
With the exception of Cape Verde and Nigeria, all the countries
in the sub-region are ADF-eligible only, and only borrow from
the ADB window to finance private sector and enclave projects.
As acategory “C” country, that is one that has graduated from
the ADF, Cape Verde can only access resources from the ADB
window while Nigeria, as a blend country, can access resources
from both the ADF and ADB windows. Bank Group total loan
and grant approvals for West Africa were UA 441.2 million in
2012 a decline of 57 percent relative to 2011. The difference in
performance can be explained by a line of credit of UA 432

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

million guaranteed by the government to Nigerian Banks in
2011. This was not repeated in 2012. Besides a number of other
countries in the region Burkina Faso, Cape Verde and Guinea
did not borrow in 2011 for various budgetary reasons. With
respect to sector distribution, infrastructure (transport, water
and sanitation and energy) received the largest share, UA 209.2
million (47.4 percent), multisector, UA 83.3 million (18.9 percent), agriculture and rural development, UA 76.5 million (17.3
percent), and social, UA 71.2 million (16.4 percent).

East Africa. East Africa comprises Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, South
Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Seychelles is the only
ADB country in the sub-region, the rest are ADF only, except,
as already indicated for other sub-regions, for private sector
and enclave projects, which can be financed from ADB resources. As in other regions, resources were mainly channelled to
infrastructure (water and sanitation, irrigation schemes and
roads) (UA 157.5 million), which accounted for 35.2 percent
of the approvals; multi-sector (adjustment policies and pubic finance management related operations) amounting to UA
94.0 million (43.4 percent), while social received UA 95.6 milion (21.4 percent). In addition, there was a multinational road
project involving Rwanda and Burundi and an emergency assisance operation for flood victims.

Southern Africa. Southern Africa comprises Angola, Botswana,
Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Of these,
Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland are
category "C" countries that is only eligible for ADB resources.
he other seven countries (Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
jozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe) are only eligible for ADF
resources, except in the cases already mentioned for other
regions. In contrast with other regions, “finance” received the
largest allocation here, UA 273.1 million (58.9 percent), essentially
ines of credit extended to banks for on-lending to public and
rivate sector activities. Infrastructure (energy and transport)
was allocated UA 100.4 million (21.6 percent); multi-sector, UA
42.6 million (9.2 percent); social, UA 28.3 million (6.1 percent);
and agriculture, UA 19.6 million (4.2 percent).

 

Central Africa. The Central Africa sub-region has Cameroon,
Central Africa Republic, Chad, Congo Republic, Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Sao
Tomé and Principe. Moreover, the region has a high concentration of fragile states. Two countries, Gabon and Equatorial
Guinea are category “C” countries, i.e. only eligible to borrow
from the ADB window. The rest can only borrow from ADF
resources or from the ADB for non-sovereign operations and
enclave projects. Even here, infrastructure (transport, energy,
water and sanitation) is the leading sector in terms of resource
allocation UA 191.8 million (59.4 percent of the total); followed

4.4 Bank Group Operations
by Priority and Areas
of Special Emphasis

The promotion of infrastructure development runs through
the bulk of Bank Group operations, addressing energy provision, income generation—notably in agriculture, trade and
economic integration, and climate change. But private sector operations have expanded rapidly in recent years (over 20
percent of total for 2012). Joint financing of operations and use
of dedicated trust fund resources (as in water and sanitation),
are important features. Policy dialogue—including on human
development—continues to be a crucial focus. The Bank’s work
in fragile states and its support of RMCs through the African
Legal Support Facility were important and interconnected parts
of its operations.

Energy, Environment and Climate Change. The Energy,
Environment and Climate Change Department has 61 projects
in its portfolio, totalling UA 5.2 billion. In 2012, the Bank approved
UA 891.9 million for 6 operations in the energy sector through

estimated 12,000 GWh by 2025. The project involves the construction of an electricity highway between Ethiopia and Kenya,
consisting of about 1,068 km of High Voltage Direct Current at 500 kV, with power transfer capacity of up to 2,000 MW. The
integration of the power systems of Ethiopia and Kenya will enable in the mid-term export of the large hydropower production in Ethiopia throughout the region and link the power grid in the East to that of Central Africa. The improvement of the
energy mix in Kenya is expected to avoid close to 5 million tonnes of CO, emission.

The project is one of the 11 infrastructure projects selected by the G20 as exemplary regional projects. It is also included in the
Priority Action Plan in energy of the PIDA, endorsed by Heads of States and Government of the Africa Union in January 2012.

The project is expected to achieve significant develooment impacts: in Ethiopia it will contribute the implementation of the
country’s Growth and Transformation Plan, whereby Ethiopia will tap in its vast renewable energy potential for domestic
consumption and to generate revenues in export of surplus clean energy. In Kenya alone, the additional power injected into
the national grid will enable the supply of electricity to an additional 870,000 households by 2018, and a cumulative total
of 1,400,000 additional households by 2022 (of which 18 percent will be located in rural areas). Businesses and industries
in Kenya will also benefit, with around 3,100 GWh of additional energy by 2018, increasing to around 5,100 GWh by 2022.

the public sector window with the objective to provide access
to modern power for at least 1.2 million households across seven
countries (see Map 4.1 for details). Five energy projects were
completed in the public sector 2012 totaling UA 262.6 million.
The rural electrification project in Benin has helped to extend the
grid with 972 km of transmission lines. It connected an additional
16,000 households and increased the rural electrification rate
from 20 to 28 percent. The Ethiopian-Djibouti power interconnection project has increased the household connection rate in
Djibouti from 50 percent to 60 percent, while reducing tariffs
by more than 60 percent. It now connects 4 towns and 8,500
households on the Ethiopian side of the border.

The Bank is an implementing agency of the Climate Investment
Fund (CIF) a global facility worth USD 7.6 billion which is expected to channel some USD 1 billion - more than a third of the
CIF’s projected investments in Africa - to 17 countries. Projects
underway in 2012 included Kenya, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger
and South Africa backed by USD 420 million from the CIF and
USD 11 billion of the Bank’s own funding. Through the eight projects now under implementation, it is expected that 6.9 million
tonnes of CO, emissions will be avoided every year, 1.3 million
households and businesses will get new access to power, nearly
42,000 hectares of land will be dedicated to climate-resilient
activities, and 150,000 farmers will gain access to climate information, including 50,000 women farmers and 3,000 villages.

Spatial Development Initiative Southern Africa: The Nacala Road Corridor

The Bank approved in December 2012 the Nacala Road Corridor Phase Ill in Mozambique. The project will help Mozambique
reduce its infrastructure gap by improving national and regional connectivity, within the country’s efforts to reduce poverty
and accelerate economic growth. The Nacala Road Corridor is one of the strategic regional corridors in the Southern Africa

region. It will provide the key regional link between the Nacala Seaport in Mozambique and Lusaka, Zambia, through Malawi.
The project will be co-financed by the ADF (UA 38.83 million), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (UA 49.34 million), and the Government of Mozambique (UA 11.49 million).

 

Transport, ICT and related infrastructure. Transport, ICT and
related infrastructure made a substantial call on Bank resources
in 2012, some 16.8 percent of total, amounting to UA 604.2
million (including UA 50.2 million channelled through the
private sector window). Half of the projects approved in the
transport sector were for regional infrastructure. During the
year, the Bank approved the Lomé-Cinkansé-Ouagadougou
CU9 Corridor, a major transport link forming part of the priority highways of the West African Economic and Monetary
Union (WAEMU).

Water and Sanitation. Water and sanitation were key investment
areas for the Bank Group in 2012, amounting to UA 294 million,
including UA 269.7 million in the form of loans and grants and
operations of the three complementary initiatives, namely the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the African
Water Facility (AWF) and the Multi-donor Water Partnership
Programme (MDWPP). The latter three have provided vital
resources for scaling up access to safe water and sanitation,
promoting innovative technologies, and supporting knowledge
management activities in RMCs (Box 4.3).

Box 4.3
The Three Water Initiatives

The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative

RWSSI aims to accelerate access to drinking water and sanitation in rural Africa to attain the African Water Vision of 2025
and the MDG targets for 2015. Since its launch in 2003, the Bank has invested UA 0.8 billion in financing 37 programmes in 26
countries. The Initiative has leveraged over UA 2.7 billion from other donors, governments and communities while the RWSSI
Trust Fund (TF) has contributed UA 97 million. This funding has so far provided water supply and sanitation access to 54 million and 31 million people, respectively. In 2012, six new RWSSI projects (worth about UA 50 million of which UA 16 million
was from the TF) were approved by the Bank for the Gambia, Chad, Liberia, Central African Republic, Djibouti and Mauritania

The African Water Facility

The AWF, an initiative of the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW), administered by the Bank, was established in
2004 as a Special Water Fund to help African countries achieve the objectives of the Africa Water Vision 2025. A total of 74
projects have now been approved since inception of operations in 2006, amounting to UA 77 million (€90.5 million). By the
end of 2012, the AWF’s active portfolio comprised 48 on-going operations worth around UA 60 million (€70.5 million). The
new Strategic Plan has sharpened the AWF’s focus on the preparation of bankable projects, with significant impact on leveraging investment. On average, each euro contributed by the AWF now attracts 20 more euros in additional investment. In
2012 the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Australian Government Overseas Aid Program (AusAID)
gave a further UA 12.5 million (CAN$ 19 million) and UA 2.3 million (AUS$ 3.4 million), respectively, triggered by the adoption of the Facility’s Strategic Plan 2012-2016. Six African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Céte d’lvoire, Republic of Congo,
Chad, Niger and Nigeria, pledged new contributions totalling UA 13 million (€15 million). Six projects were approved in 2012
amounting to UA 8.0 million (€9.4 million) in AWF grants.

The Multi-Donor Water Partnership Programme

The MDWPP is the core facility for developing Bank and RMC capacity in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) as
well as promoting learning and innovation in a range of water sector issues. In 2012, the following activities were completed:
(i) dissemination of the outputs of the study on Development Aid and Access to Water and Sanitation in Sub-Saharan; (ii) a
study that will lead to the development of the Bank’s operational framework for Urban Water Supply and Sanitation interventions; (iii) support to the RWSSI donor conference held in Marseille which culminated in pledges of over USD 115 million;
and (iv) the independent evaluation of MDWPP which highlighted its relevance and advocated for continued support. The
Bank started developing a new strategy to guide the implementation of the next phase of the programme.

Regional Economic Integration. |n 2012 total approvals for mulinational operations amounted to UA 956.2 million (including
UA 812.0 million for loans and grants, UA 133.6 million for private
equity and UA 10.6 million for special funds). The loan and grant
component saw a 10.4 percent increase between 2011 and 2012.

percent), followed by transport (26.0 percent), finance (25.7 percent), agriculture (12.9 percent), multi-sector, industries, environment and water (8.3 percent) (Figure 4.12). Included in the mulinationals are 7 private equity investments undertaken by the
Bank's private sector, to finance projects in low-income countries.

he demand for multinational projects continues to grow and
now clearly exceeds available resources under the ADF-12. A
otal of UA 993 million or 85 percent of the resources was
allocated to priority projects in the ADF-12 pipeline. The distribuion per sector and sub-region is shown in Figures 4.13 and 4.14.

 

Private Sector Operations. |\n 2012, total approvals for private
sector operations amounted to UA 753 million (excludes UA 77.6
million public line of credit extended to Land and Agricultural
Development Bank of South Africa) for 21 new projects and
additional financing for two existing operations. Middle Income
Countries (MICs i.e. those only eligible for ADB resources) received

Supporting Economic and Governance Reforms. |n 2012, the Bank
continued to support economic policy and governance reforms
through Policy Based lending operations (PBOs), Institutional
Support Programs (ISPs), and non-lending activities, including
analytical and advisory services. In 2012 the Bank Group approved
a total of 42 programs and projects in support of good governance across 22 RMCs, worth UA 488.2 million. Support was given
to Benin and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to improve
financial management and related legislation. In Comoros, Ghana,
and Senegal, Bank interventions sought to improve the business environment by enhancing institutional capacities for service provision. Another example is the Bank’s rapid response to
Malawi's request for budget support to alleviate foreign exchange
shortages, and allow for fiscal and macroeconomic reform while
protecting critical social spending.

Annual Report 2012

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

To help RMCs improve the governance of natural resources and
O ensure greater accountability and transparency over revenue flows, the Bank provided financing for better regulatory
rameworks. During 2012, the Bank supported the Extractive
ndustries Transparency Initiative (EIT|) implementation across
en RMCs, including Mozambique and Zambia.

he Bank also hosts the Making Finance Work for Africa
(MFW4A) initiative, which expanded its outreach to RMCs ina
id to strengthen partnerships for financial sector development
and share knowledge and information. The Bank is also a straegic partner of the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM),
and provided technical support to Tanzania’s review.

Promoting Social and Human Development. |n 2012, the Bank
ad an active portfolio of 69 projects totalling UA 1.4 billion, with
newly approved projects totalling UA 525 million. The bulk of the
approvals in 2012 went to North Africa (62 percent) owing toa
large budget support operation for Tunisia. The Human Capital
Development Strategy (2013-2017) was completed, focusing
on job-creating growth, skills development, giving voice to all
citizens for improved quality of public services and efficiency of
public spending. It also supports in particular, the development
of safety nets to protect against economic and social shocks.

 

Skills development and science and technology for job creation
are key areas of focus and the projects approved in 2012 in Ghana,
Malawi, Kenya, Tunisia and Uganda focused on them. The Bank
also organized in partnership with the African Union Commission,
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) and the Association for the Development of Education
in Africa (ADEA) a high level conference on science, technology
and innovation (STI) in Kenya in April 2012. (See http://www.
adeanet.org/STlforum/en/content/about-lst-africa-sti-forum).
In July 2012, the Bank organized an innovative conference of
Ministers of Finance and Health in Tunis to discuss value for
money, sustainability and accountability in the health sector.

Agriculture and Food Security. During 2012, the Bank Group
approved 18 operations covering 16 countries and amounting to UA 381.7 million including loans and grants and special
funds. The projects included the rehabilitation of agricultural
infrastructure, construction of access and feeder roads, market infrastructure and storage facilities, strengthening capacity
for the delivery of agricultural services, and support to climate
change adaptation measures. The operations included two multinational programmes: one supporting agricultural research
institutions and the other focused on building drought resilience
in the Horn of Africa. The approvals also included two emergency relief operations in Mauritania, the Gambia and Senegal
for approximately UA 1.8 million.

33Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

The Bank has been successful in soliciting and leveraging funds
from the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP)
for RMCs. The Gambia, Malawi and Senegal, the three countries
that chose the Bank as supervisor, obtained grants amounting
toa total of USD 107.6 million. The portfolio of Bank projects cofinanced with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) increased
in 2012 and now covers 13 countries with total resources of
USD 39 million, targeted at land degradation, climate change
adaptation, international waters and biodiversity. The Mano
River Union Forest Ecosystem Conservation project for USD
6.2 million was approved.

Gender. |n 2012, the Bank continued to pursue a number of initiatives in RMCs and at Headquarters, often in collaboration with
other agencies, with the aim of enhancing the gender focus of
its operations as well as that of its own institutional culture. In
the field, the Bank has continued to undertake “country gender profiles,” most recently for Burundi, Gambia, Mali, Central
African Republic and Sierra-Leone. The profiles have helped
countries to focus better on areas where gender benefits can be
achieved quickly and at relatively low cost, such as rural-based
antenatal and maternal care. In a number of Bank-supported
projects, notably support to maternal health in Uganda, the

African Legal Support Facility

 

 

The African Legal Support Facility (ALSF), hosted by the
African Development Bank, is an international organization
dedicated since 2010 to providing legal advice and technical assistance to RMCs. It was established at the request of
Africa’s Ministers of Finance for assistance in three key areas:
(i) combating the nefarious impact of vulture fund litigation
on debt sustainability; (ii) assisting regional member countries in negotiating complex commercial transactions; and
(iii) building the capacity of regional member countries in
these and related activities. In 2012, the ALSF Management
Board approved 11 projects in 9 countries (and one panAfrican project) with commitments of USD 5.23 million.
Among notable projects, is the support provided to the DRC
in defending itself against vulture fund litigation. Requests
for assistance in negotiating gas production sharing agreements have been received from a number of countries.

Bank’s Work in Fragile States. Africa’s fragile states are making
steady and visible progress, with the Bank providing support
across a range of areas. In 2012, UA 1171 million was approve:
for projects in these countries in the form of budget support,
economic governance reform and infrastructure rehabilitation.
Two examples of the Bank’s work on fragile states include
Liberia (see testimonial by country’s President—Box 4.5) ani
South Sudan. In South Sudan the Bank has helped the country
to develop an infrastructure action plan, which explores appro

Box 4.5
Bank’s Engagement in Liberia

 

After decades of neglect, the state of Liberian roads has left many communities and regions of the country isolated from
the capital, from markets and Government services. Our south-eastern region has been particularly isolated due to its distance from Monrovia, and has faced extra challenges with thousands of refugees and ex-combatants in the area. While other
partners hesitated to work on major infrastructure in the region, the African Development Bank took the risk of rehabilitating the 130-kilometer Harper to Fish Town road. The rehabilitated road has improved the quality of life for people in the area
by reducing the travel time from several days to just a couple of hours. This allows farmers to sell their produce at markets,
parents to take their children to clinics, and students to attend schools that were previously unreachable. With an unusually
prolonged and heavy rainy season, a laterite road will only last a few years. Recognizing this, the African Development Bank
has further committed USD 50 million under ADF-12 to help upgrade the road to an all-weather paved road. The paved road
will ensure that the improvements already seen are sustained.

Additionally, the African Development Bank was one of the first partners to provide much needed budget support to Liberia
after the end of the conflict. This helped us deal with the food, fuel and financial crisis of 2006-2008. The Bank’s second
budget support program, the Economic Governance and Competitiveness Support Program, has helped our Government
improve the use of scarce resources through public financial management reforms. In particular, it has supported the extension of the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA). ASYCUDA has been extended from the Freeport of Monrovia—
which accounts for 85 percent of all imports—to all 4 ports in urban Monrovia, our international airport, and one rural port
as well as the head office of the Ministry of Finance. It has helped reduce the time to clear goods at the port from 60 days
previously to less than 10 days. The relatively short turnaround time for clearance of goods at the port reduces a bottleneck
to our country ‘s development. ASYCUDA has also helped increase our revenue collection at 3 ports, from about USD 4 million monthly before its installation to USD 10-12 million every month. This gives our Government additional scarce revenues
to invest in the projects to improve the livelihoods of our population.

Annual Report 2012 35yueg juswdojaneg uedijy @Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

This chapter provides an overview of the policies and strategies introduced by the Bank in the recent
past to spur institutional efficiency and coherence. It then looks at Development Effectiveness and

Quality Assurance, the results of the ADF-12 Mid-term review, and recent activities in the Bank’s
evaluation function. Crucial institutional reforms during 2012, including those involving human
resources and decentralization, are outlined as well as a brief overview of agencies for internal

control and risk mitigation.

5.1 Policies and Strategies

The Bank completed a number of policies and strategies during 2012 as part of its commitments to its shareholders and to
enhance its operational effectiveness.

During the process leading up to GCI-IV and the Replenishment
of ADF-12, the Bank Group committed to undertake a number of
institutional reforms and to introduce new policies and strategies.
The latter have since been formulated following broad stakeholder
consultations throughout the continent. A major challenge arising from the consultations was the extent to which the Bank was
willing to expend human and financial resources to ensure that its
good policies and strategies would be implemented. Stakeholders
also pointed out that the Bank’s outreach effort should become
a permanent feature of its operations and that it should continue
to play critical advisory and advocacy roles for RMCs, especially
in the increasingly complex policy environment that they are
witnessing. Looking forward, the Bank is designing approaches
for risk management and its engagement with civil society.

Energy Sector Policy. The new Energy Sector Policy aims to
support Africa’s efforts to improve access to modern, affordable
and reliable energy services. The Bank will help RMCs develop
their energy sectors in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner. The Policy’s key guiding principles
include: (i) ensuring energy security and increasing access for
all; Gi) moving responsibly towards a cleaner energy path in
response to the exigencies of climate change; (ili) enhancing
governance at the national level; (iv) promoting innovations
that increase financial flows to and within the energy sector;
(v) results focus; (vi) fostering knowledge transfer; and (vii)
mainstreaming gender in all Bank Group energy operations.
To ensure effective implementation of the Policy, the Bank is
articulating medium-term energy sector strategies. It will also
propose operational action plans and a program of activities
for investments and support. (See http://www.afdb.org/PolicyDocuments/Energy Sector Policy )

38

Policy on Program-Based Operations (PBO). The Bank’s PBOs
policy now provides a single comprehensive framework for
formulating reforms in a dynamic policy environment, ranging
from traditional budget/import support to responding to the
special needs of fragile states and those of countries affected by
financial crises. The guiding principles include: (i) the cardinality
of country ownership, especially of the policies and measures
to be implemented; (ii) results focus: consistent with the Bank
Group’s results measurement framework, PBOs have explicit outputs and outcomes indicators; (iii) alignment and predictability:
the Bank will engage in multi-year programming to enhance the
predictability of resources and to ensure effective, credible and
reliable budget planning; (iv) use of country systems; (v) mutual
accountability, which entails Bank and recipient commitment to
reinforcing participatory approaches by involving other development partners and civil society; and (vi) flexibility: to ensure that
PBOs respond sufficiently to changing country circumstances,
government priorities and crises. (See http://www.afdb.org/
Policy-Documents/Bank Group Policy PBO)

Policy on Disclosure and Access to Information. The launch
of the new Policy on Disclosure and Access to Information fulils a key commitment to shareholders made during negotiaions for the 6th General Capital Increase (GCI) of the African
Development Bank and Twelfth Replenishment of the African
Development Bank (ADF-12). It reaffirms the centrality to the
Bank of good governance, with emphasis on transparency,
accountability and information sharing. The key objectives of
he policy are sevenfold: (i) maximize disclosure of informaion within the Bank Group’s possession and limit the list of
exceptions; (ii) facilitate access to and share information on the
Bank Group’s operations with a broad range of stakeholders;
(iii) promote good governance, transparency, and accountability to provide leadership in these areas to RMCs; (iv) improve
on implementation effectiveness and better co-ordinate the
information disclosure processes; (v) accord visibility to the
Bank Group’s mission, strategies and its overall activities; (vi)
support the consultative process; and (vii) strengthen harmo
 

Annual Report 2012nization with other Development Finance Institutions (DFls)
on information disclosure. As of 3rd February 2013, the Policy
became fully effective. (See http://www.afdb.org/en/disclosureand-access-to-information)

Action Plan for ICT. The scope of the 2008 Bank Group’s ICT
Operations Strategy has been reviewed and expanded. This has
led to the development of an ICT Operations Action Plan for the
medium term (2012-2014). The Plan has three pillars, namely:
(i) Regional/National ICT infrastructure aimed at improving
connectivity; (ii) policy and regulatory frameworks for an enabling environment to leverage private investment and forging
public private partnerships (PPPs) for improved connectivity
and affordable access to broadband services; and (iii) ICT applications for integration of ICT in the delivery of services in government, key economic sectors and regional integration. The
Bank will pay special attention to the ICT needs of low income
and post conflict/fragile states.

Climate Change Action Plan. |t articulates the Bank’s climate
change objectives, principles, areas of focus, major activities, and
investment plan—i.e. its climate smart development approach
over the period 2011-2015. This action plan rests on three pillars: low-carbon development, climate change adaptation and
establishment of a climate change funding platform to be implemented through a mix of several financing options. In implementing this Action Plan, the Bank group intends to invest about UA
4.15 billion over a 5-year period. The Energy, Environment and
Climate Change Department of the Bank is advancing priority projects already identified by African countries themselves
that will support “climate compatible” development in Africa.

In addition the Board is yet to approve the Private Sector
Development Policy and the related Strategy:

Private Sector Development Policy. The Bank has prepared a

Private Sector Development Policy, also part of its GCI-6 commitments, aimed at rationalizing and strengthening the Bank

Group’s support to private sector development in Africa. It
encompasses the Bank Group’s sovereign operations in support
of policy reforms and institutional development, and infrastructure and other sector investments, as well as the Bank's private

sector and other non-sovereign operations. The Policy has three

overarching objectives: (i) improvement of the investment and

business climate in African countries; (ii) access to quality economic and social infrastructure; and (iii) enterprise development,
with special attention to value chain development, African local

entrepreneurs, micro, small and medium scale enterprises, and

social business. Crosscutting issues to be addressed include

gender and youth, climate change, and regional integration.

Private Sector Development Strategy. Several factors will distinguish the new Private Sector Development Strategy being

finalized (to accompany the new Private Sector Policy) from
those which have come before it. It promises significant support
to small businesses - key elements of any economy - while not
forgetting larger ones. It is aligned with the Bank’s overarching
vision, by putting two objectives at its core: the quest for inclusiveness and gradual transition to green growth. The three priority areas are (i) building regional as well as national economies
- especially through infrastructure projects, and developing the
systems that facilitate trade and investment between countries;
(ii) supporting fragile states as much as robust, resilient states
- with a commitment to take risks for them where necessary,
being both flexible and versatile in order to achieve quick and
tangible results; and (iii) empowering women, as half of the
workforce, to achieve their full economic potential.

5.2 Development Effectiveness and
Quality Assurance

In 2012, the Bank made further progress in enhancing the quality of its operations, mainstreaming gender, ensuring social
and environmental safeguards, and strengthening its ability to
measure and manage for development results.

The Bank’s Annual Development Effectiveness Review (ADER)
notes that the quality at entry of public sector operations continued to improve in 2012, from 4.4 in 2011 to 4.7 (scale of 1-6).
The rating of Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) improved from 4.2
in 2011 to 4.7 in 2012 on a similar scale. Significant efforts were
undertaken in 2012 to train staff on the quality assurance tools,
among others the Results-based Logical Framework (RLF) and
the new evidence-based and results focused Implementation
Progress and Results Report (IPR). A gender dimension of
quality-at-entry is planned to be adopted in February 2013 as
a supplementary document to be included in the Readiness
Review of the Bank’s public projects and programs.

The new Results Reporting System developed in 2012 supports
new reports and automates results data. It will be rolled out for all
operations in 2013. The combination of stronger data, enhanced
reporting and interactive results mapping that has been made
possible by geocoding all active projects, will allow the Bank to be
much more transparent and accountable with respect to results
it is achieving on the ground. To bring about a results culture in
Africa and enhance regional integration, the Bank is providing
support to mainstreaming managing for development results
across countries and Regional economic communities (RECs).

Annual Report 20125.3 ADF-12 Mid-Term Review

The mid-term review of ADF-12 took place in Praia, Cape
Verde in September 2012. While the Bank’s focus remains on
ensuring a sizeable replenishment of the ADF, it continues to
explore other ways of leveraging additional resources for its
low-income regional members, for example through improvements in domestic resource mobilization strategies, advocating
for an Africa infrastructure bond and other similarly innovative
financing instruments.

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

The mid-term review noted that the Fund had demonstrate
resilience to economic and security crises, was responsive to
the diverse and changing needs of its clients, and demonstrate:

an exemplary focus on results in delivering its ADF-12 com
mitments. The Fund will continue to ensure that Africa’s voice
is heard in global forums such as the G-8 and G-20. However,
challenges remain and are being addressed as shown in Box 5.1.

The replenishment of ADF-13 comes at a key juncture, with less
than 3 years left to the 2015 MDGs target date. The ADF-13

 

Box 5.1
Highlights of the ADF-12 Mid-term Review

Key Achievements

« At mid-term of the ADF-12 cycle, 91 operations had been approved, valued at UA 2.68 billion, and representing 49 percent
of the total value of operations in the ADF-12 pipeline (UA 5.43 billion) in the Fund’s strategic priority areas (infrastructure,
regional integration, governance and fragile states) and cross-cutting themes (private sector development, climate change,
gender and human-capital development, agriculture and food security);

Innovations during the ADF-12 period have included the implementation of the Regional Operations Selection and Prioritization
framework; rolling out of new financing instruments such as the Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG); development of public-private
partnerships (PPPs); and increased use of climate change financing;

A determined program of continuous reforms implemented by the Bank has deepened and improved the institution’s
capacity to deliver development results as well as its operational efficiency;

Progress under the enhanced Results Measuring Framework confirms that the Bank’s investments are changing the lives
of Africans across the continent, while delivering a high proportion of its planned outputs and outcomes and benefiting
the most vulnerable people in Africa;

ADF-12 resources have been allocated in a timely manner and according to the agreed resource allocation framework. The
performance-based allocation system has recognized the best performing countries, while the Bank is positioned to play
an important role in discussions on potential improvements to the system; and

Despite the financial deficits reported in the last 2 years and the challenging external environment, the long term financial
capacity of the Fund remains sound.

Key Challenges and Measures to Address Them
Despite significant achievements, challenges remain. Bank Management is determined to tackle the unfinished business, and
has undertaken or planned measures in the following areas:

* Strengthening clients’ capacity for project preparation and timely implementation, especially in the infrastructure sector,
by providing technical, financial and advisory support for project preparation. Measures have also been taken to improve
internal business processes and portfolio management;

* Continuing to deepen ADF’s programmatic and financial support to fragile states, regional operations, private sector development and human capital development;

* Ensuring smooth implementation of operations, particularly timely disbursement. Measures include improving project
readiness, better assisting clients and using decentralization;

* The Bank manages itself efficiently, but needs to improve administrative budget utilization and human resource management
(particularly the staff vacancy rate and continuing the development of the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF);

* Completing the move from measuring results to managing for results, and engendering a results culture at country level; and

« Ensuring the availability of sufficient resources for arrears clearance as and when countries become eligible for such support.
Maintaining the current resources in Fragile States Facility (Pillar II), as proposed by Management, would contribute to the
availability of ADF resources to clear AfDB arrears if Sudan and/or Zimbabwe meet the conditions during the ADF-12 period.

 

 

Annual Report 2012 43Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

replenishment discussions got off to a good start in February
2013 and are expected to conclude by October 2013. As an instrument, the ADF has been focused and selective, concentrating its
resources on areas which constitute Africa’s own priorities and
in light of the Fund’s comparative strength. The ADF-13 will play
an important role in implementing the Ten-Year Strategy, providing vital investments in infrastructure, regional integration, governance, private sector development, and skills and technology.
Support to fragile states will be especially important, given the
regional dimension and impact of state fragility. Moreover, gender
will be addressed with a more results-oriented focus.

5.4 Operations Evaluation

The Operations Evaluation Department (OPEV) undertook a
major self-evaluation, as well as evaluations at many levels—
including of Bank support to fragile states—which have had a
substantial impact on operations.

To better understand its weaknesses, opportunities, and
strengths, to ensure that its work supports the Bank’s overall
vision to enhance the strategic relevance of independent evaluation in response to stakeholders’ needs OPEV commissioned a
self-evaluation in early 2012 (undertaken by independent consultants) which led to a revised Independent Evaluation Policy as
well as a new Independent Evaluation Strategy. Both the policy
and the related strategy are still under Board consideration.

The new strategy—which informs OPEV’s rolling work-program
for 2013-2015, including resource requirements—aims at OPEVs
three policy objectives for enhancing development effectiveness:

* accountability (especially strengthening self-evaluation
throughout the Bank's operations);

* learning (both direct and indirect, including dissemination
and outreach); and

* promotion of an evaluation culture (across the Bank and in
RMCs, including building RMC evaluation capacity).

The first of its kind among the multinational development banks,
the strategy links long-term institutional priorities, evaluation
skills and activities, and resource requirements, with focus
increasingly on evaluations by country, region, sector, or theme—
i.e., evaluations of clusters of projects, rather than of individual
ones—plus evaluations of Bank operations overall. The new
strategic direction focuses on balancing accountability with
learning and en enhanced emphasis in supporting an evaluation culture across the Bank and RMCs. Meanwhile OPEV also
undertook 5 evaluations—at a higher (sector, thematic, country) level and 78 project level evaluations. The higher level
evaluations include: Public Financial-Management Reforms;
Multinational Operations; and assistance to fragile states. In
response to requests from the Board and Management, OPEV

44

also launched evaluations of the private sector portfolio, trustfund management and Bank procurement. Findings generated
significant interest in the Bank and the Board. Implementation
of recommendations is underway.

OPEV also launched a highly-participatory process for planning its work program—involving consultation with Executive
Directors, Management, and staff—and stepped up knowledgesharing with a highly-lauded Evaluation Week—inaugurated by
the President—which celebrated 25 years of OPEV by bringing together international experts and senior policy-makers
for week-long discussions of development issues. A lessonslearned database and a new OPEV website were launched
concurrently. (See http://operationsevaluation.afdb.org/en/
evaluations-publications).

5.5 Institutional Reforms

The Bank maintained reform momentum in 2012 in efforts to
enhance results-oriented operational efficiency at headquarters and in the field, and increase capacity to respond rapidly
to client needs in accordance with priorities in the Long-Term
Strategy. Field presence was increased and decision-making
decentralized, new quality assurance and results tools and
systems developed, a framework for engagement with civil
society organizations adopted, and an online operational programming tool launched. Success was shown in the recent
Client Assessment Survey where RMCs reported viewing the
Bank as their “preferred partner”.

Transitioning to the Ten-Year Strategy. The Medium-Term
Strategy covered 2008-2012 so the Bank is transitioning to
the Ten-Year Strategy (covering 2013-2022). It will have annually updated and approved 3-year rolling programs—including
operational objectives, budgets, and expected outputs and
outcomes. The annual budgets will be overseen by the Budget
and Policy Departments, based on related results monitoring
system. Country strategy papers—informed by the Ten-Year
Strategy, and developed in consultation with sector departments—will be at the centre of planning and budgeting.

Budget Management. 2012 marked the first year of the implementation of phase 3 of the Budget Reform, which focuses on
the Bank’s Cost Accounting System (CAS). The objectives of
the phase are to (i) establish an effective budget methodology
and ensure efficient utilization of Bank resources based on the
real cost of activities and deliverables; (ii) determine the actual
cost attributable to ADF, ADB and NTF activities, based on
which a transparent cost sharing formula can be established;
and (iii) to implement a Country Budgeting System in order
to ensure an effective Work Program Agreement between the
sector and regional departments. The launch of the Activity
Time Recording System in July 2012, a key component of CAS,

Box 5.2
Empowering Field Offices

The Delegation of Authority Matrix was thoroughly revised to decentralize decision-making to country offices yet enable the
geographically-spread institution to operate as “One Bank”. While the new Delegation Authority Matrix will be reviewed after
a first experimental 6-month period, preliminary feedback from the Residents Representatives is positive:

+ Field office task managers, resident representatives, and other staff members feel empowered by their greater authority
to effect activities in their countries of operation;

* Origination of activities at country - level results in better integration of projects into the rest of the pipeline, better oversight as well as more proactive response to issues arising;

* Turn-around time for project procurement has been reduced, improving the project cycle and hence the Bank’s responsiveness to clients;

« Redundancies in portfolio management have been eliminated, resulting in better utilization of resources and reduced costs; and

* Service delivery especially in the case of corporate procurement in support of core business has dramatically improved
with the increase of the thresholds for Resident Representatives and RRC Directors. This has eliminated the waiting period

for approvals from the headquarters (HQ).

 

marked a significant move forward in gathering the data for
estimating the real cost of activities.

Decentralization. Field presence has increased (35 percent of
operations staff are now field-based)—including pilot Regional
Resource Centers (RRCs) in Nairobi and Pretoria to enable
faster response to RMCs requests for technical and specialized skills—while the Delegation of Authority Matrix (DAM)
was updated, moving decision-making closer to clients. A
framework for engagement with civil-society organizations
was also introduced. The new South Sudan Country Office (in
Juba) increased field presence to 12 of the 18 countries eligible
for support from the Fragile States Facility. In total there are
offices in 34 countries—29 Country Offices, the 2 RRCs, and 3
customized liaison offices—including the latest liaison office in
Mauritius, which spurred plans for ones in Congo-Brazzaville,
Equatorial Guinea, Mauritania, and Benin in 2013. Strengthened
field presence is resulting in improved portfolio management,
enhanced country dialogue, and greater visibility.

Information Technology. An Information Technology Strategy
(2013-2015) aligned with the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy was adopted to increase capabilities to meet operational needs while
serving as a catalyst for change. It aims to position the Bank as
a technology and knowledge hub for the continent by focusing
on IT governance, IT management, infrastructure, connectivity,
business solution partnerships and knowledge platforms for the
Bank. An online operational programming tool was introduced,
as well as new quality-assurance tools and systems. A 2014 midterm review of the ITS will help the Bank draw lessons and reorient effort during the final year of implementation.

Annual Report 2012

 

5.6 Audit, Ethics and Integrity Functions

The Office of the Auditor General, the Ethics Office and the
Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department play important roles in
the Bank Group as agencies of corporate restraint and responsibility. The three offices work at arms-length from the rest of the Bank.

Audit. Office of the Auditor General provides independent objective assurance, advisory, and consulting services to improve the
Bank’s governance, operations, risk management, and control. It
has increased the audit frequency of departmental operations,
the treasury, and field offices (the latter now to be audited at
least once every two years). A computerized audit-compliance
system is being established to improve efficiency.

Ethics. The Ethics Office—part of the overall effort to inculcate
a culture of ethical behaviour (and as a means to mitigate reputational risk)—undertook team-building seminars at headquarters and in the field, and also launched an Ethics Certification
Program along with Human Resources and the Information and
Technology Department. It is also revising the Bank’s Code of
Conduct to harmonize it with Staff Rules and Regulations (also
under review) and with international best practice.

Integrity. The Integrity and Compliance Department has been
re-organized—with a new Integrity and Prevention Division and
Investigations Division—and its staff enhanced to enable mainstreaming of integrity programs in Bank operations. Through a
new sanctions process, the Bank is also jointly implementing
(with other multinational development banks) the Agreement
for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions.

Box 5.3
Bank’s Return to Abidjan

At the 2012 Bank Group Annual General Meeting in Arusha, Tanzania, the Board of Governors took note of the Governors’
Consultative Committee (GCC) Report and the recommendation that the return of the Bank’s operations to its Headquarters
should be contingent on the approval of a detailed Roadmap by the Board of Governors. The draft Roadmap was discussed
by the GCC at its meeting in Tokyo, October 2012, which endorsed the document's submission to the Board of Governors
during the Annual Meetings in Marrakech, Morocco, in May 2013.

Subject to the approval of the Roadmap by the Board of Governors, the Bank Group and the Ivorian Government will proceed to implement the Roadmap including resolving any legal issues, security, office infrastructure, housing, health and education. In February 2012, the Boards of Directors held their first meeting in Abidjan since the relocation of the Bank Group's
operations in 2003.

5.7 Deployment of Human Resources

The Human Resource Department is being re-organized using a
client-focused model to ensure increased operational efficiency
and a competitive workforce.

The Human Resources Strategic Framework and Action Plan
(2007-2012) aimed to improve service, increase operational
efficiency, and support decentralization. Accordingly, in 2012
the HR Department—supported by a centre of excellence anda
shared services centre, including a new employee Help Desk—is
being reorganised using a client-focused model with “business
partners”. Total Bank staff increased 5.4 percent to 2005—1308
professional staff (353 female) and 697 general service staff
(393 female)—including 67 local staff in field offices. There
were 33 female managers (29.2 percent), including two Vice
Presidents. As part of decentralization, 55 international staff
were transferred from headquarters to the field. Details of Bank
Staffing Ratio by country are presented in Table 5.3. Internal
capacity was enhanced by 154 promotions through internal

46

 

competition and 71 through in-situ promotion. The first cohort
of 160 management and professional staff in the Leadership
and Management Development Program (LMDP) graduated,
while an Executive Leadership Program was conducted for
senior management. Training in technical capacities, including
ICT, was made available to staff and virtual language classes
increased the participation of staff in language training.

Askills survey was conducted in September 2012 with the aim
of generating a baseline of the current skills in the Bank, and
providing a platform for discussion on areas of AfDB’ s strengths
and weaknesses, potential gaps in relation to future needs,
as defined by the Ten-Year Strategy, and employee mobility.
Cognizant of the imminent expiry of the HR Strategic Framework
and Action Plan (2007-2012), Management engaged an independent consultant to help assess strengths and weaknesses of
this framework, and support the design of appropriate mechanisms to enhance the integration of the different HR initiatives
launched over the past five years. Following this review, the
foundation was laid for a refreshed People Strategy (2013-2017).

48 Annual Report 2012© African Development BankChapter 6 Oversight Functions and Activities of the Boards

Shareholder representation and oversight is ensured through the Boards of the Bank. The 77-member
Board of Governors is the apex policy-making organ with a representative from each of the
member states. The resident Board of Directors has 20 members, each generally representing a
constituency of member states (in the case of the Fund, the Board of Governors has 78 members,
and the Board of Directors, 14). The Board of Directors sets policies and guidelines and oversees
the general operations of the Bank, in addition to financial and administrative matters. The Boards’
deliberations in 2012 were focused on positioning the Bank to effectively support a transforming
Africa, help improve the quality of its growth and sustain its benefits. From an institutional
perspective, decentralization and the proposed return of the Bank’s operations to its Headquarters
in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire, also received significant attention. This chapter outlines the Boards’
activities during the year.

6.1 Boards of Governors

The Boards of Governors lauded the Bank Group for holding
fast in the midst of global turbulence.

The Boards of Governors of the African Development Bank and
African Development Fund met in Arusha, Tanzania, on May
31 and June 1 during the Bank Group Annual Meetings, which
had as the theme "Africa and the Emerging Global Landscape Challenges and Opportunities”. The Governors’ Dialogue focused
on the Ten-Year Strategy, then in preparation. The Governors
emphasized that—even in the midst of continued global economic uncertainty—African economies showed resilience, dynamism, growth, and promise, and the Bank's recent reforms would
make it an even stronger partner for Africa’s development. In
connection with the Strategy, they urged the Bank to continue
its emphasis on infrastructure as well as climate-change adaptation and mitigation and promotion of inclusive and green growth.
They requested the Bank to develop innovative initiatives to
tackle the infrastructure deficit on the continent, particularly, the
preparation and financing of infrastructure projects. The Board
of Governors of the Bank, during the meetings also adopted the
Resolution approving the membership in ADB of Africa’s newest
state, the Republic of South Sudan, as well as the related special
capital increase. In October 2012, the Governors Consultative
Committee of the Board of Governors of the Bank (GCC), which
is the forum for policy dialogue, considered a Roadmap for the
return of Bank Group operations to the headquarters in Abidjan,
and endorsed its submission to the Board of Governors during
the 2013 Annual Meetings in Marrakech.

 

50

6.2 Boards of Directors

Key operational policies and strategies as well as the proposed
return to Abidjan were the main areas of focus during 2012.

he Boards of Directors gave considerable time to strategic
operations and institutional matters. The most notable and
ar reaching discussions pertained to the Strategy of the Bank,
2013-2022, in particular the two objectives of inclusive growth
and transitioning to green growth, and the areas of operational
priority. In adopting the Bank Group Energy Policy, the Boards
sought to balance Africa’s dire energy deficit with the need for
sustainable development. A revised Program Based Operations
Policy was also adopted by the Boards to guide Bank Group
support to RMC policy reforms, and dialogue, as well as budget
support in fragile states. The Boards also laid the foundations
or anew and comprehensive approach to private sector development during discussions on the Bank Group Private Sector
Development Policy and Strategy. To further instil the principles of good governance, in particular transparency, openness
and accountability, the
Boards approved a bold
and comprehensive new
Disclosure and Access
o Information Policy,
and to better promote
stakeholder engagement, adopted a Civil
Society Organizations
Engagement Framework.

Management’s Report Regarding the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 27, 2013

he Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentaion and overall integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and
he Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board, while those of the African Develooment Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

he financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to
all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board.
j|anagement believes that all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The
external auditors’ report accompanies the audited financial statements.

j|anagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conormity with the basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken
‘o correct deficiencies identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by
management and internal audit and are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the
integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and
he circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as
opposed to absolute, assurance with respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control sysem can change with circumstances.

he Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUF) to assist the Boards, among
other things, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the
effectiveness of internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees
he process for the selection of external auditors and makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors,
which in turn makes a recommendation for the approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management
‘o review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors
regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and any other matter that may
require AUFI’s attention.

 

The Bank’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that the Bank
Group maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the financial statements as of December 31,
2012. Management is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2012 financial statements.

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2012, the external auditors of the Bank
Group conducted an independent assessment of the Bank Group’s internal control framework and their opinion thereon is pre
sented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group regarding the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2012

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) as of 31 December 2012, based on criteria established in
"Internal Control — Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls
over financial reporting as of 31 December 2012.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal control was maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
tisk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial state

African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

ments in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December
2012, based on criteria established in "Internal Control — Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund

as of and for the year ended 31 December 2012, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed
unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

58 Annual Report 2012THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

  

ising from the
global financial and economic crisis over the past few years and
he intensification of the Eurozone debt crisis over 2012. The
past year has been characterized by credit rating downgrades
in many parts of the world across both sovereign and banking
entities. The year has also highlighted increased inter-linkages
between countries’ creditworthiness, the banking sector and
economic performance, all of which could amplify systemic risks.

Despite these challenges, the Bank’s investment strategy has
adapted to the changing global financial market environment.
The Bank utilizes a range of financial instruments to meet the
needs of its borrowers, manages its balance sheet to minimize
he impact of fluctuations in market interest rates and exchange
rates and temporarily invests its liquid resources prior to disbursement. Its primary objectives are to strengthen credit quality and the liquidity profile of the investment portfolios while
imiting the volatility of their returns. The Bank has progressively
revised and implemented a more defensive asset mix by targeting high credit quality counterparties and investing in low yield
but secure investments, including holding a significant cash
cushion, often with Central Banks, while concurrently reducing the average maturity of the trading portfolios. The Bank
as benefited from its conservative investment strategy. It has
allowed its treasury portfolio to significantly outperform last
year’s performance; both from an absolute (total investment
income) and relative (performance measured versus benchmark) points of view. This is borne out by the financial results
discussed in the rest of this section.

 

 

Adaptation to the Risks of a Changing Portfolio
The Bank’s operating environment continued to be significantly
challenged by the continuing socio-political developments in the
orth Africa region where the Bank has a significant concentraion of its portfolio. The situation was further exacerbated by
he impact on important clients of the Eurozone crisis through
reduced trade, FDI flows and tourism. As a result some of the
Bank’s clients experienced sharp declines in their credit risk
profiles, triggering sequential rating downgrades from rating
agencies and the Bank’s own internal rating system. The disressed lending environment faced by some of the clients of
he Bank impacted the growth of the public sector portfolio.
n addition, the private sector portfolio that is riskier than the
public sector portfolio continued to grow at a faster pace than
he public sector, albeit at a lower rate than in previous years.

 

 

 

To mitigate potential risks, the Bank has over the past few years
considerably enhanced its risk management framework and

Annual Report 2012

African Development Bank Chapter 7

end-to-end credit processes to ensure its risk management
functions are robust. Specific measures taken included: the
improvement of the Bank’s risk governance framework through
the establishment of Credit Risk Committee; the enhancement
of the credit risk assessment skills through increased hiring of
experienced and competent credit officers; the implementation of robust and optimized credit risk assessment models; the
strengthening of the credit risk infrastructure to improve quality
at entry; and implementation of best of breed solutions in the
form of an integrated and workflow-driven software platform
that allows all stakeholders involved in the credit risk assessment
process to streamline their work in order to enhance efficiency.

The Bank strengthened the monitoring of the current portfolio
and continued to proactively undertake portfolio restructuring
measures including cancelation of long standing “signed but
undisbursed” loans to free up capital for new lending.

Moreover, the Bank established capital buffers to provide it
some flexibility in continuing its countercyclical financing role,
while covering any potential unexpected losses. Close collaboration with sister institutions (the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund) was enhanced to improve coordination of
future interventions in those countries. The Bank continues to
explore measures to increase portfolio diversification in order
to mitigate the concentration risk of the portfolio mentioned
above. Besides, the Bank improved its collateral management
framework to ensure that adequate collateral value is maintained.

 

Given the increasingly risky operating environment over the
course of the year, there was increased stress testing and reporting to senior management and the Board. This approach was
greatly enhanced with the completion of the first phase of the
risk dashboard project, which aims to provide a basis for quick
and informed risk assessment. The Bank continues to be well
capitalized and stress testing of its capital adequacy shows that
it is able to withstand a number of shock scenarios.

Capital Su ption
The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and callable
capital. The paid-up capital is the amount of capital payable over
a period determined by the specific Board of Governors’ resolution approving the relevant General Capital Increase. The Bank's
callable capital is subject to payment only when required by the
Bank to meet its obligations on borrowing of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or guarantees chargeable
to such resources. This acts as protection for the Bank's bond
holders and holders of guarantees issued by the Bank in the
unlikely event that it is not able to meet its financial obligations.

There has never been a call on the callable capital of the Bank.

 

 

Following the Board of Governors’ approval of a 200 percent
increase of the Bank’s capital base in 2010, the authorized

59Chapter 7 African Development Bank

capital of the African Development Bank was increased to UA
67.69 billion following the creation of 4,374,000 new shares
with a par value of UA 10,000 each. Six percent of the shares
created under this Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), (UA
2.62 billion) are paid-up, while ninety-four percent (UA 41.12 billion) are callable. In accordance with the resolution governing
this capital increase, the new GCI-VI shares were allocated to
regional and non-regional members in such proportions that,
when fully subscribed, the regional group holds 60 percent of
the total capital stock and the non-regional group 40 percent.
As at December 31, 2012, the subscriptions of 71 member countries (49 regional countries and 22 non-regional countries) have
become effective.

In 2010, Canada and Korea had responded favorably to the
Bank’s need for expanded financial capacity pending decisions
on GCI-VI, by offering a temporary increase of their callable
capital with no attached voting rights. Following the adoption
of the Board of Governors’ resolution to retire and cancel the
63,296 non-voting callable shares subscribed by Canada under
his arrangement, the number of authorized shares of the Bank
decreased from 6,768,746 shares to 6,605,450 shares in 2011.
This cancelation reduced the total authorized capital of the Bank
0 UA 66.05 billion. The authorized capital was decreased further
0 6,586,036 shares after the cancelation of the 19,414 shares
hat was also temporarily allocated to the Republic of Korea
ollowing the effectiveness of Korea’s subscription to GCI-VI.

n 2012, there was a special capital increase of 111,469 shares to

ermit the membership of South Sudan following which the
otal authorized capital of the Bank was raised to UA 66.98 bilion at December 31, 2012.

The paid-up portion of the GCI-VI subscription is payable in eight
equal annual installments for non-regional member as well as
regional member countries eligible to borrow from ADB, and
welve equal annual installments for Regional Member Countries
eligible to borrow only from ADF. Some member countries have
elected to pay their subscription in fewer installments, opting
or an advance payment scheme, and will receive a discount
on their GCI-VI subscription payment accordingly.

 

 

 

Authorized and Subscribed Capital, 2010-2012

A member country's payment of the first installment triggers
the issuance of the shares corresponding to the entire callable
capital portion, and shares representing the paid-up portion of
subscriptions are issued only as and when the Bank receives the

actual payments for
evolution of the Ba
scribed capital as a

such shares. Table 7.1 below summarizes the
nk’s authorized, paid-up, callable and subthe end of the three past financial periods.

As at December 31, 2012, the paid-up capital of the Bank amounted to UA 4.96 billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the portion of

paid-up capital tha
compared with UA
and paid-in capital,

has been actually paid) of UA 2.84 billion,
3.29 billion and UA 2.51 billion of paid-up
respectively, at the end of 2011. The Bank’s

callable capital at December 31, 2012 stood at UA 60.25 billion

including UA 2118
tries rated A- and h

illion from non-borrowing member counigher, compared with UA 34.03 billion and

 

UA 18.63 billion, res

ectively, as at the end of the previous year.

In accordance with the Bank's Share Transfer Rules, shares for
which payment have become due and remain unpaid are forfeited after a prescribed period and offered for subscription
to member countries within the same membership group (i.e.
regional or non-regional).

Details of the Bank’s capital subscriptions at December 31, 2012
are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital
Stock and Voting Powers, which forms part of the Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

In addition to the stringent monitoring and management of
the key metrics related to its financial strength, the Bank is
rated by four major rating agencies. For 2012, all the four rating
agencies: Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch Ratings, and the
Japan Credit Rating Agency have reaffirmed their AAA rating
on the senior debt and AA+ rating on the subordinated debt
of the African Development Bank. These ratings have a stable
outlook and reflect the Bank’s strong financial position, including strong capital adequacy and liquidity, prudent financial
management and policies, solid membership support and its
preferred creditor status.

Annual Report 2012In November 2012, Standard & Poor’s published its updated
rating methodology for multilateral lending institutions which
assesses the impact of shareholder support as well as an institution’s stand-alone credit profile. Based on the revised rating
methodology, in January 2013, the Bank’s rating was reaffirmed
at AAA with a stable outlook after considering support from
shareholders.

 

The Bank strives to raise funds from the capital markets at the
lowest possible cost to support its lending activities. The topnotch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank enables it to issue
securities at competitive interest rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by client and cash flow requirements, asset
and liability management goals, and risk management policies.

The 2012 funding program in capital markets was approved for
amaximum amount of UA 3.5 billion including up to UA 70 million to be drawn under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance
(EPSA)' for Africa initiative. During the year, the Bank raised a
total of UA 2.5 billion with a weighted average maturity of 5.9
years. No amount was drawn under the EPSA initiative. The
actual amount raised was guided by the pace of the project
disbursement needs.

In January 2012, the Bank successfully executed one global
benchmark bond with a 5-year maturity and for an amount of
USD 1 billion. The bond was increased in November by an amount
of USD 500 million. These transactions are in line with the strategy of maintaining presence in the dollar market by providing
investors with at least one new liquid reference bond every year.
n addition, the Bank was highly active in the Australian dollar
(AUD) market through kangaroo bonds raising a total of AUD
.2 billion. This included a 10-year kangaroo bond which was
issued in March with a size of AUD 500 million that has since
grown to AUD 1 billion through increases to the transaction.

Building on the strength of these public transactions, other
issuances in key markets as well as privately placed notes and
uridashis provided funding at very competitive levels. The Bank
indeed enjoys good access to funding across all segments of
he capital markets. The average cost of funds raised in 2012
remained below the respective 6-month USD LIBOR, 6-month
EURIBOR and 3-month JIBAR benchmarks.

n 2012, the Bank achieved a major breakthrough in the capi‘al markets in Uganda. The Ugandan Shilling (UGX) was designated as one of the Bank’s lending currencies in September
2011. In this regard, a UGX 125 billion Medium Term Note (MTN)

 

 

1 =EPSA is a joint initiative with the Government of Japan (GOJ) under which
the GOJ has made funds available to the Bank through Japan International
Cooperation Agency to be drawn down in order to support Private Sector
projects in the continent.

Annual Report 2012

African Development Bank Chapter 7

program was established to issue bonds in the Ugandan capital markets and in July 2012, the Bank issued a UGX 12.5 billion bond. Proceeds of this transaction were on-lent to HFB, a
Uganda mortgage lender.

In addition, during the 2012, the Bank and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) signed an International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement to enter into
cross-currency transactions to facilitate local currency lending
and bond issuance in Africa. It is the first ISDA Master Agreement
either institution has signed with another multilateral financial
institution. The agreement will enable the Bank and the IFC to
collaborate and benefit from each other’s local currency bond
issues, enhancing each other’s local currency funding capacity
to support development projects.

 

The Bank also conducts regular buyback operations of its
bonds to provide liquidity to investors. In 2012, the total amount
of these repurchases amounted to UA 120.9 million as against
UA 75.50 million in the previous year. As at December 31,
2012, the Bank’s outstanding borrowing portfolio stood at
UA 13.28 billion compared with UA 12.9 billion at the end of
the previous year.

The borrowing program for 2013 has been approved by the
Board of Directors for a maximum amount of UA 3.76 billion
with up to UA 3.63 billion to be raised from the capital markets and an envelope of UA 130 million under the EPSA facility.

le Urid: Ss

socially Responsib d
In 2012, the Bank saw a marked increase in demand out of Japan
for socially responsible bonds. Japanese retail investors were
predominantly focused on notes linked to the theme of education and indeed, during the year, the Bank issued eight such
education-linked uridashi bonds for a total amount of UA 64
million across a diverse range of currencies including BRL, TRY
and ZAR. The Bank was also able to attract socially responsible
institutional investors in Japan through the issuance of a USD
20 million clean energy bond.

   

The proceeds of these (and previous) socially responsible uridashi bonds were included in the ordinary capital resources of
the Bank. Under the terms of these bond issues, the Bank is
expected to and does use its best efforts to direct an amount
equal to the net proceeds to lending to projects related to the
relevant theme, subject to and in accordance with the Bank’s
lending standards and guidelines.

61Chapter 7 African Development Bank

A snapshot of the Bank’s activity in these sectors is presented
in Table 7.2 below.

The Bank utilizes a range of financial instruments to meet the
needs of its borrowers, manage its balance sheet to minimize
the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates and exchange
rates and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. The Bank is therefore not immune to the various
events arising from the global financial and economic crisis
over the past few years and the intensification of the so-called
Eurozone debt crisis in 2012.

The past year has been characterized by credit rating downgrades across both sovereign and banking entities and has also
highlighted the increased inter-linkages between countries’
creditworthiness, banking sector and economic performance
which could amplify systemic risks.

Despite these challenges, the Bank’s investment strategy has
regularly been adapted to the rapidly changing global financial
market environment with the primary objectives of strengthening the credit quality and liquidity profile of the investment portfolios while limiting the volatility of their returns. Indeed, preservation of available capital is more important than attempting
to generate higher income by taking additional risks. The Bank
has progressively revised and implemented a more defensive
asset mix by targeting high credit quality counterparties and
investing in low yield but secured investments, including holding
significant cash cushion, often with Central Banks, while concurrently reducing the average maturity of the trading portfolios.

 

Despite a continuing stressed and sometimes volatile financial
market environment, the Bank benefited from its conservative
investment strategy that allowed its treasury portfolio to significantly outperform last year’s performance; both from an
absolute (total investment income) and relative (performance
measured versus benchmark) point of view. The Bank’s cash
and treasury investments (net of repurchase agreements) as
of December 31, 2012 totaled UA 7.37 billion, compared to

 

Socially Responsible Uridashi Bonds
(Amounts in UA millions)

UA 7.94 billion at the end of 2011. Investment income for 2012
amounted to UA 197.65 million or a return of 2.31 percent on
an average liquidity of UA 8.57 billion, compared to an income
of UA 168.85 million in 2011, or a return of 2.14 percent, on an
average liquidity of UA 7.89 billion. The higher return in 2012
is primarily due to capital gains in portfolios held for trading,
driven by tighter credit spreads over the period. Such positive
contribution compensated for the negative effect of the coninuing low level of interest rates.

he ADB’s liquid assets are tranched into 3 portfolios, namely
operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed
portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the cash
low and risk profile of its assets and funding sources. These
enchmarks are 1-month LIBID for the operational portfolio,
and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR, resetting on February
and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The operational and
rudential portfolios are held for trading. The equity-backed
portfolio is managed against a repricing profile benchmark with
O percent of the Bank’s net assets repricing uniformly over a
eriod of 10 years, and is held at amortized cost.

he Bank makes loans to its regional member countries and
public sector enterprises guaranteed by the government. Loans
are also extended to private sector enterprises without government guarantee.

 

he Bank’s development operations are undertaken within a risk
management framework which includes: (i) a clearly defined risk
appetite statement for lending credit risk, (ii) a capital adequacy
and exposure management policy (iii) credit policy; (iv) risk
management governance framework; (iii) credit risk management guidelines; and (iv) an end-to-end credit process. During
the year, the Bank established a Credit Risk Committee to take
over the risk management oversight of development financing
activities that was in the past carried out by ALCO. The Credit
Risk Committee’s responsibility is to ensure effective implementation of the Bank’s credit policies and oversee all credit
risk issues related to sovereign and non-sovereign operations

he ADB offers an attractive and diversified menu of financial
roduct options that allow borrowers to tailor their financing
requirements to their circumstances. The Bank’s financial products comprise loans (including those denominated in African
currencies, and syndicated loans), lines of credit (including for
rade finance), agency lines, guarantees, equity and quasi-equity,
and risk management products. In addition, the Bank provides
echnical assistance to its clients through grant funds. Each of
hese products is briefly discussed below:

The ADB provides loans to its clients on non-concessional terms.
he Bank's standard loans are categorized either as SovereignGuaranteed Loans (SGLs) or Non-Sovereign-Guaranteed Loans
(NSGLs). SGLs are loans made to regional member countries
(RMCs) or public sector enterprises from RMCs supported by
he full faith and credit of the RMC in whose territory the borrower is domiciled. Multinational institutions are eligible for
SGLs if they are guaranteed by an RMC or by RMCs in whose
erritory or territories the projects will be executed.

SGLs are loans made either to eligible public sector enterprises, without the requirement of a sovereign guarantee, or
‘o private sector enterprises.

he Bank's standard loan product has evolved over time, with
erms that are increasingly more accommodating and responsive to client needs.

The standard loan product now offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients is the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan
(EVSL) which gives borrowers a high degree of flexibility to
manage their interest rate risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed
clients the loan product offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The interest rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base (6-month
LIBOR for USD and JPY, 6-month EURIBOR for EUR and 3 month
JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is a function of the Bank’s
cost of funding relative to LIBOR, EURIBOR or JIBAR computed
every six months, and a contractual spread that was set at 60
bps with effect from January 1, 2011. At a borrower's request,
e terms of the EVSL may offer a free option to convert the
floating base rate into a fixed rate. The repayment period for
sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans is up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

 

The interest rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and JPY, 6-month EURIBOR for EUR
and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating until maturity date or a fixed base rate (amortizing swap rate set at borrower’s request for disbursed loan balances) plus a risk-based
credit spread. NGSLs have repayment periods up to 15 years
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel and
A/B loan syndications, and local currency loans. In December
2012, the President approved the introduction of five additional
African currencies - Franc CFA currencies (XOF and XAF),
anzanian Shilling, Zambian Kwacha and Ghanaian Cedi to the
existing selection of lending currencies of regional member
countries. Lending in these currencies is only offered if the Bank
is able to fund efficiently in the relevant local currency market.
hese local currency loans are offered under the FSL pricing
ramework with a cost pass through principle for the loans to
ensure that the overall cost of funds is fully covered.

he development of a dynamic small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) sector in the continent is an important objective
of the Bank as is the development of private financial institutions
(PFls). To this end the Bank offers lines of credit for loans to PFls
or on-lending to SMEs. The terms of the lines of credit specify the
conditions under which Bank funds will be provided to the PFI for
on-lending. The credit risks of the sub-loans are borne by the PFls.

rade finance lines of credit (TF LOC) are a variation of the Bank’s
standard long-term lines of credit. The Bank developed the TF
LOC as acomponent of the Trade Finance Initiative which was
designed to quickly respond to the liquidity squeeze in Africa’s
rade markets as a result of the global financial crisis. The TF LOC,
which has a maturity of up to 3.5 years, is available to African
inancial institutions (commercial banks and developmental

 

Annual Report 2012financial institutions) that are engaged in trade finance operations. Given the short-term nature of trade finance, the recipient
financial institutions are permitted to “re-use” or “revolve” the
proceeds until the contractual repayment dates of the facility.

A. Lines

The Bank makes capital resources available for SMEs under
agency arrangements with local financial intermediaries. The
selection of individual projects for Bank support is largely delegated to the intermediaries, which draw on Bank resources
to make loan or equity investments for the Bank’s account in
projects meeting pre-agreed criteria. As part of an agency
agreement, financial intermediaries are required to commit their
own funds in each investment in parallel with the Bank and to
supervise the investee companies. The financial intermediary
acts only in an agency capacity for the Bank when investing
the latter’s funds and assumes no risk in this regards. The credit
risk of the borrower is borne by the Bank.

Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to obtain
financing from third party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their
own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide such
financing directly from its own resources. The Bank’s guarantees
can generally be classified into two categories: Partial Credit
Guarantees (PCGs) and Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs). PCGs
cover a portion of scheduled repayments of private loans or
bonds against all risks. PRGs cover private lenders against the
risk of a government, or a government owned agency, failing
to perform its obligations vis-a-vis a private project.

Risk Ma emel ts

The Bank offers Risk Management Products (RMPs) to its borrowers only in respect of obligations outstanding to the Bank
or new Bank loans to enable them to hedge their exposure to
market risks including interest rate, currency exchange and
commodity price risks, thus allowing them to optimize their
debt management strategies. RMPs offered by the Bank include
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity swaps and
interest rate caps and collars. These products are available to
borrowers at any time during the life of the loan.

 

  
 

In addition to its participation in ADF the Bank takes equity
positions in qualifying business enterprises in its RMCs as part
of its strategic development financing mandate. The Bank’s
ability to provide risk capital through equity and quasi-equity
investments is a key element of its resource mobilization role.

tion, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and
lenders to financially viable projects as well as promoting new
activities and investment ideas. The Bank may invest in equities either directly or indirectly, through appropriate funds
and other investment vehicles. Additionally, it may choose to
invest via quasi-equity instruments through redeemable preference shares, preferred stock, subordinated loans or convertible loans. During 2012, a total of six (6) equity participations
were approved amounting to UA 73.36 million compared to UA
102 million in the previous year. Disbursements towards equity
participations during the year reached UA 83.84 million. The
details of the Bank’s equity interest in various enterprises are
included in Note J to the Financial Statements.

In addition to the products described above, the Bank may
offer technical assistance through grant funds to supplement
its financial products for both the public and private sector
windows. The Bank’s technical assistance is primarily focused
on raising the effectiveness of project preparation which is vital
in ensuring the best developmental and poverty-reducing outcomes for projects that receive Bank financing. In addition, the
technical assistance also aims to foster and sustain efforts in
creating enabling business environment in order to promote
private sector investment and growth.

 

isk Mar t licles Processes

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are not
essential to its core business of providing development finance
and related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank’s risk management policies, guidelines and practices are designed to reduce
exposure to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal
and other operational risks, while maximizing the Bank's capacity to assume credit risks to public and private sector clients,
within approved risk limits.

The policies and practices employed by the Bank to manage
these risks are described in detail in Note D to the Financial
Statements.

Corporate governance within the Bank is supported by appropriate financial and management reporting. The Executive Board
of Directors makes strategic decisions and monitors the Bank’s
progress toward achievement of set goals. While senior management manages the Bank’s day-to-day operations and activities,
the Board provides oversight, advice and counsel on issues as
wide-ranging as long-term strategy, budgets, human resources,
benefits management and new product development. Based
on the COSO internal control framework, senior management
has put in place a robust and functioning mechanism to be
able to certify the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal controls
over external financial reporting. This annual certification state

ment is signed by the President and Vice President - Finance
as well as the Financial Controller. A separate attestation is also
provided by the Bank’s external auditors. In 2012, the Board of
Directors approved the Operational Risk Management (ORM)
framework with the overall objective of strengthening the overall
risk management capability of the Bank whilst ensuring that a
well-structured and disciplined approach is adopted in the management of operational risks inherent in the business processes
of the Bank. In addition, the Bank has a comprehensive system
of reporting to the Board of Directors and its committees. This
includes reporting by the Office of the Auditor General to the
Audit and Finance (AUF!) Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank’s external auditors are appointed by the Board of
Governors, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
for a five-year term. Under Bank rules, no firm of auditors
can serve for more than two consecutive five-year terms.
The external audit function is statutory and is regulated by
the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), issued by the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The
external auditors perform an annual audit to enable them to
express an opinion on whether the financial statements of the
Bank present fairly the financial position and the results of the
operations of the Bank. They also examine whether the statements have been presented in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as described above,
the external auditors also carry out a comprehensive review

Key Performance Indicators: Financial, 2011 and 2012

and provide opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal controls over financial reporting. This attestation is given
as a report separate from the audit opinion. At the conclusion
of their annual audit, the external auditors prepare a management letter for Senior Management, which is reviewed in detail
and discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee of the
Board. The management letter sets out the external auditors’
observations and recommendations for improvement on internal controls and other matters, and it includes management’s
responses and actions for implementation of the auditors’ recommendations. The performance and independence of the
external auditors is subject to review on an annual basis by the
Audit and Finance (AUFI) Committee of the Board.

There are key provisions in the Bank’s policy regarding the independence of the external auditors including a requirement for
the mandatory rotation of the Engagement Partner, in cases
where the term of the audit firm is renewed for a second and
final five-year period. The external auditors are prohibited from
providing non-audit related services, subject to certain exceptions if it is judged to be in the interest of the Bank and if it is
approved by the Audit and Finance Committee.

In managing its operations the Bank uses quantified performance measures and indicators that reflect the critical success
factors in its business. These are monitored on a continuous
basis and results achieved are used to assess progress attained
against stated objectives and to inform required action in order

Highlights of the African Development Bank’s financial performance in 2012 include the following:

* The Bank in 2012 earned income before allocation and distributions approved by the Board of Governors of UA 198.62
million compared to UA 164.51 million in 2011. As shown in
Figure 7.3, the increase in 2012 is primarily from loan and
investment income which increased from UA 489.18 million
in 2011 to UA 553.64 million in 2012;

* Total Bank Group administrative expenses increased from UA
239.21 million in 2011 to UA 290.45 million in 2012. Total manpower expenses increased by UA 4011 million (i.e. 22.2 percent) from UA 180.14 million in 2011 to UA 220.2 million in 2012.
This was mainly due to increases in headcount and annual
perfomance-based salaries and benefits. Other administrative expenses increased by 18.8 percent from UA 59.07 million in 2011 to UA 70.2 million in 2012 due mainly to increased
operations;

The Bank’s share of the total Bank Group administrative
expenses amounted to UA 104.64 million in 2012 compared to
UA 79.5 million in 2011, an increase of 31.6 percent. Bank Group
administrative expenses are allocated between the Bank, the
ADF and the NTF based on a predetermined cost-sharing
formula driven primarily by the relative levels of operational
volume indicators and relative balance sheet size.

Annual Report 2012

African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank continues to maintain a strong capital position while
its income continues to be sufficient for the Bank to make contributions, on behalf of its shareholders, to other development
initiatives in Africa. The Bank’s reserves plus accumulated loss
provisions on outstanding loan principal and charges stood
at UA 2.99 billion in 2012 compared to UA 2.84 billion at the
end of 2012.

In 2012, Board of Governors approved distribution from the 2011
income to various development initiatives in Africa amounted
to UA 110 million. The beneficiaries of these distributions are
listed under Note N to the financial statements. In accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies, such distributions
are reported as expenses in the year they are approved by the
Board of Governors. The Board of Directors has also agreed to
recommend to the Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting
in May 2013, distributions totalling UA 107.5 million from the
2012 income to development initiatives in RMCs. If approved
by the Board of Governors, such distributions and any others
that may be approved by the Board of Governors during 2013
will be reported as expenses in the 2013 financial statements.

The Bank has the responsibility and commitment to ensure
maximum efficiency in the management of administrative and
capital expenditures, to help maximize the resources available
for development financing and technical assistance activities for
its clients. Accordingly, in the management of its administrative
and capital expenses, the Bank continues to enforce a high level
of budgetary discipline, effective cost controls and proactive
cost-recovery programmes. For the year ended December 31,
2012, the Bank Group’s general administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were UA 290.45 million,
compared to UA 239.21 million in 2011 against a budget of UA
292.55 million representing a utilization rate of 99.28 percent.
For 2013 the Bank’s administrative expenditure is budgeted
at UA 298.3 million. Management will continue to explore and
implement effective and transparent cost management strategies with a view to ensuring that cost outcomes are effectively
tracked against the Bank’s long-term strategic objectives.

Outlook for 2013

Despite the positive signs of economic recovery in the Bank’s
external environment, particularly in the US and emerging marets and including in particular Africa’s own performance, the
global macro-economic, political and reporting environment
remains uncertain and challenging. The Bank will continue to
ut the needs of its Regional Member Countries (RMCs) at the
centre of its business operations. It will continue to support economic growth in RMCs more broadly and generate the required
arget financial returns over time.

Significant Volatility Expected in 2013

he Bank’s financial results are sensitive to changes in the
economic environment within the continent and in the global
inancial markets. Changes within the continent have direct
impact on the volume of lending and timing of repayments on
he Bank’s loans. On the other hand, changes in global financial markets will create volatility in interest rates on the Bank’s
reasury investments, thereby affecting the Bank’s income. It
is anticipated that the financial markets will continue to show

 

68

significant volatility throughout 2013. Moreover, any downgrade
in the credit rating of its member countries could impact the
Bank’s future performance and results. All these are expected
‘0 cause variability in the Bank’s income statement and reserves,
both in terms of actual results and movements in the fair value
of the Bank’s investments and treasury portfolio.

Bank has the required Balance and Flexibility

The Bank continues to take steps to reduce costs and improve

operational efficiency. The Bank’s recent upgrade of its SAP
ERP system is expected to provide a useful tool for cost monioring and reduction, while delivering faster and more efficient
service both internally and to clients. And finally, the “one Bank”
business model as well as the Bank’s solid capital, liquidity and

unding positions provide the Bank Group—including the African

Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund—a strong basis,
balance and flexibility to meet the challenges ahead.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic
and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire. However, since
February 2003, the Bank has managed its operations largely from its temporary relocation facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. The Bank
finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and preparation
of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank also promotes
investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and social progress
of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Develooment Fund (ADF or
the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing
to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to promote cooperation and increased international
trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and its operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any obligation to pay,
withhold or collect any tax or duty.

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated
y the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convenion except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.
nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
eld by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life

of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

Dividends are recognized in income statement when the Bank’s right to receive the dividends is established in accordance with
AS 18 - Revenue.

 

76 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

J ione 1d Curre

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of
all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005, as it was concluded that the UA most faithfully
represented the aggregation of economic effects of the underlying transactions, events and conditions of the Bank conducted in
different currencies. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of the Unit of Account
is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one Special Drawing Right
(SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

ation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31,
2012 and 2011 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation
differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at
the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements
as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount
at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other
currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

 

M I
Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever
withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership
reflects the fact that the members are African and non-African countries, committed to the purpose of the Bank to contribute to
the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and jointly. Accordingly,
as of December 31, 2012, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member country withdrawals.

ntrie iptions

 

 

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member’s shares.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member,
hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against
the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations
and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date
are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently
taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the
amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the
repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date,
for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred
and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying
a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the
risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered
by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors.
In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

 

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each
member country.

Annual Report 2012 77Chapter 7 African Development Bank

 

Employe

 

Pension Oblig ns

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit
payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that
an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable
service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately
in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. Past service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits
are already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The
pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value

of the Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

 

eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to
the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age and
the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to
the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the
Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both
the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year
they occur. The medical plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents
the present value of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

 

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual
rights or obligations.

1) Fi cial Assets
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank manages its financial assets in line with the applicable business model and, accordingly,
classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss (FVTPL); and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). In accordance with the
Bank's business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net interest
margin or for liquidity management. The Bank’s investments in the equity of enterprises, whether in the private or public is for
the promotion of economic development of its member countries and not for trading to realize fair value changes. Management
determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

 

) Fina | Asse imortized
A financial asset is classified as at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Bank’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in debt investment are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

 

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

78 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

Financial assets at amortized cost include some loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain debt
investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other amounts receivable. Loans and receivables meeting the two
criteria above are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However, incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred; as such amounts are considered insignificant.
The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Debt instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes as well as certain loans for which either of
the criteria for recognition at amortized cost is not met. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in the income

statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

In addition, debt instruments that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A debt instrument
may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses
on them on different bases.

iii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
On initial recognition, the Bank can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments not held for trading as financial assets measured at FVTOCI.

Equity investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value
with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative gains or
losses are not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments and no impairments are recognized in profit or loss.
Dividends earned from such investments are recognized in profit and loss unless the dividends clearly represent a repayment
of part of the cost of the investment.

Recognition and Derecognition of Financial Assets

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried
at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized
when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has transferred substantially all
risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities Purchased under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold under Repurchase Agreements

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates.
The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors their fair value and if necessary may require additional collateral.

Cash and Cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity
upon acquisition of three months or less.

 

Annual Report 2012 79Chapter 7 African Development Bank

 

n the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed
or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash
low requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks,
and providing cost-effective funding.

n addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at
amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in
rofit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using the effecive interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate and currency risks.

he Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D to these financial statements. Certain of the Bank’s borrowings obtained
prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free loans. In accordance with the

rovisions of the amendments resulting from the improvements to IFRS issued in May 2008 relating to the revised IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such borrowings are carried at the amounts
at which they are repayable on their due dates.

 

 

hrough profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the
borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise
would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried
on the balance sheet at fair value.

In accordance with IFRS 9, fair value changes for financial liabilities that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss,
that is attributable to changes in the Bank’s “own credit” risk is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair
value attributable to the Bank’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

 

iii) Other L 2S

All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost.
The amounts include certain borrowings, accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are
used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established
on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

The Bank classifies all derivatives at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the crite
ria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in the income statement.

80 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank assesses its hybrid financial assets (i.e. the combined financial asset host and embedded derivative) in its entirety to
determine their classification. A hybrid financial asset is measured at amortized cost if the combined cash flows represent solely principal and interest on the outstanding principal; otherwise it is measured at fair value. The Bank did not hold any hybrid
financial assets as at December 31, 2012.

Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics were not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract was not carried at fair value
with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives were stripped from the host contract and measured at
fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

 

ccount

 

ated with its fixed rate loans. Under fair value hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the income statement.

At inception of the hedge, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Bank documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Bank revokes the
hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged
risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.

Impairment of Fi

 

 

ried at nort
The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of
financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed
for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of
impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments carried
at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment
representing present value losses arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereignguaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the non-collectability, in whole or in part, of amounts
due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in
the income statement. If a loan or investment carried at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on
all loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease
in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

Annual Report 2012 81Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Offsetti i nstr

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Fair Value Disclosure
n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
asis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuaion process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

 

he fair values of quoted assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using
valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length
ransactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
articipants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
janagement believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a
sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

 

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Leve/ 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs
are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank's credit spread.
Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank’s
new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to
value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves,
exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are made to the relevant
observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best estimate of the price at which the Bank could have bought back the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

82 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

For borrowings on which the Bank has elected fair value option, the portion of fair value changes on the valuation of borrowings
relating to the credit risk of the Bank is reported in Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IFRS 9.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments are periodically fair valued both
by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises
is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate
methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated as the Bank’s percentage ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use
market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for
valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its sovereign loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for these loans. The fair value
of loans reported in these financial statements represents Management’s best estimates of the expected cash flows of its loans.
The fair valuation of loans has been determined using a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates
in currencies, including impairment percentages when applicable and credit spreads for non-sovereign loans. The changes in
fair value of loans carried at fair value through profit and loss are reported in the income statement. However, the estimated fair
value of loans carried at amortized cost is provided in the notes to the financial statements for disclosure purposes only. The
estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note I.

 

 

 

1e Profit and
The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the
consideration given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair
value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument
(i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable
markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate
data solely from observable markets. The Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they
arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price.

   

 

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is determined based on valuation models that use inputs that may not be market-observable as of the calculation date. Such financial instruments are initially
recognized at the transaction price, although the value obtained from the relevant valuation model may differ. The difference
between the transaction price and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized
over the life of the transaction; or (b) deferred until the instrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs
or is realized through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day
one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate
reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

Investment in 4 te

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered
associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not control, over the entity's
financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is described in more detail in Note J.
IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor’s
share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee is
recognized in the investor’s income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974
and 1990. At December 31, 2012, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1 percent of the economic interest
in the capital of the ADF.

   

 

Annual Report 2012 83Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972, the
revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in
accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the
equity method are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable
to the acquisition of the iterns. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset,
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

* Buildings: 15-20 years

* Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

* Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
* Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between
proceeds and the asset’s carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

jible As

   

 

Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. An intangible asset is
recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to it will flow to the Bank. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the
cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.

Leases
The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other
regional member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to
the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

 

 

 

! | y ‘d of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations
from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from
prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of distribution
for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income
Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously
transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

2d Earnings
Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts allocated to
surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income, and expenses
recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

84 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

  

Critical Ac

 

ting J c ion Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, Management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

 

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significan S
The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories.
Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Fair Value through Profit and Loss - |n designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has
determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Amortized Cost for Embedded Derivatives - The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 9 on classifying financial assets with embedded derivatives in their entirety as at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss. In making this judgment, the Bank considers whether the cash flows of the financial asset are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and
classifies the qualifying asset accordingly without separating the derivative.

 

The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost - At each financial statements reporting date, the Bank
reviews its financial assets measured at amortized cost for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of
impairment exists for individual assets. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected
future cash flows using the asset’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the asset’s net carrying amount.
Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired assets requires significant judgment. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed asset, that asset is included in a group of assets with
similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of assets
may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or
national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on
historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the
portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and
timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are
calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use
only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

 

Retirement Benefits - The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial assumptions
used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate to be used to
determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations, based on interest rates of suitably long-term high-quality
corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the Bank’s UA.

Sheet Date
The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

 

Annual Report 2012 85Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment
of the financial statements themselves.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

Standards, Amendments and Interpretations issued but not yet effective

At the date of issue of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for application, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following new standards and amendments are expected to be relevant to the Bank:

IFRS 10: “Consolidated Financial Statements”.

IFRS 10 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. IFRS 10 introduces a new
control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated. This IFRS defines the principle of control and establishes control as the sole basis for determining which entities should be consolidated by the reporting entity. It also establishes
principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity has determined that it controls one or more other entities.

The adoption of IFRS 10 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance.

IFRS 12: “Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities”

IFRS 12 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 12 requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and
risks associated with, its interests in other entities; and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance
and cash flows. IFRS 12 is required to be applied by an entity that has an interest in any of the following entities: subsidiaries; joint
arrangements; associates; and unconsolidated structured entities. This standard requires disclosures of interests in subsidiaries
and associates and also expands the disclosure requirements for unconsolidated structured entities.

The adoption of IFRS 12 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance as it only
relates to disclosures. However, the Bank will be required to make appropriate additional disclosures in its financial statements,
upon adoption.

IFRS 13: “Fair Value”

IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements.

IFRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards
and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However, this standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value are required
under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair valuation hierarchy.

The adoption of IFRS 13 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance. However,
the Bank will be required to make appropriate additional disclosures in its financial statements, upon adoption.

86 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

IAS 19 Revised: “Employee Benefits”

The amendments to IAS 19 was issued in June 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with
early adoption permitted. The key changes in the amended standard correspond to the elimination of the option to defer the
recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the ‘corridor method’. Accordingly, under the amended standard, all actuarial gains and losses have to be recognized immediately in OCI. In addition, an entity is no longer able to recognize in profit or
oss the long-term expected return on assets held. Finally, the amended standard requires enhanced disclosures about defined
benefit plans.

The adoption of the amended IAS 19 is not expected to have any significant effect on the net income of the Bank in terms of
recognition of actuarial gains and losses because the Bank already recognizes such gains and losses in OCI under the option
provided in the current version of IAS 19. The main impact will arise from the expected change in the measurement principles of
he expected returns on plans assets upon adoption of the amended standard.

 

IFRS 7: “Financia ruments: Disclosures” and IAS 32: “Financial Instruments: Presentation”

n December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entity's
inancial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new requirements are set out in “Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IFRS 7), and are related to
inancial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the IASB also published “Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and

Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

 

 

These amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2013 and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, respectively.

The adoption of such amendments is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk,
and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This
institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank’s capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk profile consistent with the highest credit rating. In 2011, the Bank through a comprehensive exercise, re-defined its risk appetite
and revised the capital adequacy policy. As a result of this exercise, the Bank allocates its risk capital between non-core risks
(10 percent), with sovereign and non-sovereign operations sharing equally the remaining balance (45 percent each). As part of
the revision, the Bank’s rating scale was also revised as explained under systematic credit risk assessment below.

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit,
product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Bank’s risk
profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

 

The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its risks are governed by the General Authority on the Bank’s Financial
Products and Services (the FPS Authority), the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority) and the
Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

Annual Report 2012 87Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for
its borrowers and separate guidelines prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for the Bank’s
sovereign and non-sovereign loan, guarantee and equity investment portfolios.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the
Bank’s financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank’s interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM
Authority covers the Bank’s entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources,
including the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank's lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed
operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO)
and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control organ of the Bank’s finance and treasury risk
management activities. It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on finance and treasury risk management issues and is
chaired by the Vice President for Finance. OPSCOM is chaired by the Chief Operating Officer and reviews all operational activities
before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. In June 2012, the Bank also created the Credit Risk Committee
(CRC), to ensure effective implementation of the Bank’s credit policies and oversee all credit risk issues related to sovereign and
non-sovereign operations prior to their submission to OPSCOM.

The ALCO, CRC and OPSCM meet on regular basis to perform their oversight roles. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and treasury risk management reports and financial projections and approves strategies to manage the
balance sheet. The Credit Risk Committee took over the Credit Risk responsibilities previously handled by ALCO including the
coverage of the end-to-end credit risk governance, credit assessments, portfolio monitoring and rating change approval amongst
others. ALCO and CRC are supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk,
non-sovereign credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

 

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day
compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

it Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential for
financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

 

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk in its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign
credit risk in its portfolio of non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk in its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions used for asset and liability management purposes. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the sections below.

88 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk before collateral received or other credit enhancements is as follows:

Equity participations 488,467 359,229
Other debt securities 76,537 79,990

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising
from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through its
policies related to the quality at entry of project proposals, exposure management, including individual country exposures and
overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These include the assessment of the country’s risk profile as determined by its
macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political conditions and the conduciveness of its business environment.

(1) The outcome of the referendum conducted in South Sudan in January 2011 supported the creation of an independent state of South Sudan. After the split of the state of Sudan into two separate nations became
effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a basis agreed upon following the ongoing negotiations between
representatives of the North and South Sudan. At the end of December 2012, no decision has been taken by the states of North and South Sudan regarding the terms and conditions of such exchange.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management is a systematic credit risk assessment framework, through underlying models and their associated risk factors that have been optimized to ensure more predictive power of the rating parameters and to
better align with international rating scales and ensure consistency with best practices. The credit risk assessment is measured
using a uniform internal 22-grade Master Scale, optimized to provide: (i) increased granularity; (ii) better differentiation between
obligors; (iii) smoother grade distribution to alleviate the current grade concentration; and finally (iv) to create a common framework when communicating credit risks to risks takers. The level of granularity helps in measuring probabilities of default in order
to better differentiate between obligors.

The credit ratings at the sovereign level are derived from a risk assessment of five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and the Bank’s portfolio performance. These five risk
indices are combined to derive a composite country risk index. The country risk ratings are validated against the average country
risk ratings from different international rating agencies and other specialized international organizations. The CRC reviews the
country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The CRC also assesses
whether the countries are in compliance with their country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if required.

The weighted average risk rating of the Bank’s sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed portfolio was 2.38 at the end of December
2012, compared to 2.52 as of December 31, 2011. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s five credit risk
classes is shown in the table below.

Annual Report 2012 91Chapter 7 African Development Bank

It is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
30 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the
Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such
countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have
been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.5 percent on the commitment
fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on nonperforming sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their debts to the Bank on a timely
basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with
the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential Expected Losses (EL) and Unexpected Losses (UL) related to credit, the Bank maintains a prudent risk capital
cushion for credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for public sector
and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities (guarantees and
client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private sector operations
which have a higher probability of default and loss-given default than public sector operations. At the end of December 2012, the
Bank's public sector loan portfolio used up to 24.2 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital based on the Bank’s capital adequacy
framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital net of exchange adjustment, plus accumulated reserves.
Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

     

2 gn Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers and to enclave projects, it does not benefit from sovereign guarantees. The Bank
may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.

 

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses several models to assess the risk of every project at
entry. The models are tailored to the specific characteristics and nature of the transactions. The result of the credit risk assessment is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale as described above.

Non-sovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) project finance; b) financial institutions; and
C) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of some pre-determined critical factors.

 

a) Pre +t Finance
The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower’s financial strength. This assesses:

Primarily, i) the capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating performance and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project company’s
management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the information on
which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

 

b) F utions

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model: i) Capital
adequacy- analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution’s capital; ii) Asset quality, operating policies and
procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision-making framework; iv) Earnings and market position - an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy - an assessment focusing on the entity’s ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk - an assessment of the impact of interest rate
changes and exchange rate fluctuations.

92 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

The assessment of Private Equity Funds takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

* Financial strength and historic fund performance;
* Investment strategy and risk management;

* Industry structure;

* Management and corporate governance; and

* Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require an initial credit rating and undergo a rigorous project approval process. The Non-Sovereign
Working Group of the CRC reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend
changes for approval by CRC if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its non-sovereign loan and equity exposures. The weighted-average risk rating was
3.47 at the end of 2012 compared to 3.44 at the end of 2011. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s

five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

In compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign
portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment,
or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2012, the cumulative impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired
loan principal in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 34.96 million compared to UA 23.73 million in 2011.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel || Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At the end of
December 2012, the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 30 percent of the Bank’s total onbalance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 45 percent determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign
operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, equity participations required as risk capital approximately 10.4 percent
of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources, below the statutory limit of 15 percent established by the Board of
Governors for equity participations.

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given point
in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign-guaranteed and non-sovereign
portfolios) by ensuring that in aggregate, the total exposure to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the Bank’s total risk
capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s capital adequacy
framework.

Annual Report 2012 93Chapter 7 African Development Bank

In the revised capital adequacy and exposure management approved by the Board in May 2011,

the 15 percent (of the Bank’s

total risk capital) global country concentration limit is meant to allow for adequate portfolio diversification. However, in order to

ensure that: (i) the allocation in aggregate does not exceed 100 percent of risk capital available
(ii) there is fairness of allocation among RMCs, a Performance Based Adjusted Country Limits for:

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit with regard to
the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of collateral

The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored for compliance with established criteria.

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

The Bank may also invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and collateralized securities repurchase agreements.

The Bank uses derivatives in the management of its borrowing portfolio and for asset and liability management purposes. As a
rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/
A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Lower rated counterparties may
be used exceptionally for local currency transactions. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO. Approved transactions
with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

The financial and economic crisis over the past few years has resulted in the downgrading of banks worldwide. The Bank’s derivatives exposures and their credit rating profile are shown in the tables below. Daily collateral exchanges enable the Bank to maintain net exposures to acceptable levels.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital (equity and reserves)
for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank’s credit limits
after considering the benefits of any collateral.

The credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be dominated by highly rated counterparties as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA-rated entities increased from the previous year as a result

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk
capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2012, the Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 1.9 percent of the Bank’s
total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

 

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity risk
arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon without
additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The PML is
updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net loan
disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; and
4) undisbursed equity investments.

Annual Report 2012 95Chapter 7 African Development Bank

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to meet
the Bank’s short-term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are included in
the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the Bank maintains
a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to cover its expected
medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity resources, is held
in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective of stabilizing the Bank’s net
income. In determining its level of liquidity for compliance with the PML, the Bank includes cash, deposits and securities in all
the treasury investments, with appropriate hair-cuts based on asset class and credit rating.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its
risk-bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation risk
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the currency
composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange
exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily
y holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which they were borrowed
(after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to service their loans in the
currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are denominated in Units of Account (equivaent to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates
luctuate. The Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account
yy matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the Unit
of Account). In line with this policy, during the year ended December 31, 2012, the Bank’s currency alignment was adjusted to
maintain it within an acceptable band of the composition of the currencies making up the SDR. In keeping with the Bank’s currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time
here is a revision to the SDR currency composition.

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The disribution of the currencies of the Bank’s recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in Euros,
USD and Tunisian Dinar.

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency
composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies, namely
the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) every five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2011 based on the value of exports of
goods and services and international reserves. The SDR rate represents the sum of specific amounts of the four basket currencies valued in U.S dollars, on the basis of the exchange rates quoted at noon each day in the London market.

Annual Report 2012 99Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange
rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes a
separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change
in the African currency holdings, the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/depreciation of each African
currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal
change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

The Bank’s interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding
such assets;

2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not overly
sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends

Interest Rate Risk on s Fund oy Debt

Over half of the Bank’s interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin
on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding
liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost
of funds pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s pool-based loans has traditionally
helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining
demand for this product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (marketbased loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank
may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of
its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market
risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche.
The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity policy and
uses a six-month Libor floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational
cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all
new borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where the
Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired
six-month Libor-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative
to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of debt
at will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio.

 

ca

 

t Rate Risk on Assets Fun lity
The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of the Bank’s assets with equity resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank’s equity resources
he SDR) affect the net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result

in lower lending and investment rates, which in the long term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

>

e Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity
f the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile
f the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark.
e Bank’s repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s assets is funded by equity
reprice in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a 10-year
moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

At the end of 2011 and 2012, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual buckets.

104 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain in income statement of UA 5.67 million and UA 5.55 million as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements
at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each
of the currencies in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2012 and
2011, respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in
2012 and 2011 for assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps.

Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios 66,451 114,578 (77,118) (126,498)

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans
committed before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level
of prepayments has generally been within acceptable levels. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70
million compared to the amounts in prior years, due in large part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans
issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying
the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298 million included an amount of UA 192 million in respect
of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007, total prepayment amounted to UA 199 million, of which 98 percent related to
market-based loans. Prepayment in 2008 amounted to UA 17 million while prepayments in 2009 and 2010 were UA 20 million
and UA 67 million, respectively. No prepayments were received in the year ended December 31, 2011. Prepayments in the year
ended December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 21.71 million.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes.

Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems, and
from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse reputational impact. Operational risk is present in virtually all the Bank’s transactions and includes losses attributable to failures of internal processes in credit and market operations.

The Internal Control Unit (ICU) of the Bank is responsible for implementing the Integrated Internal Control Framework (IICF) which
consists of two phases. Phase one relates to the implementation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) based on the
COSO Framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s internal controls in all significant business processes with financial statement impact. As part of this process, Management’s attestation on the adequacy of
internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s annual report.

Annual Report 2012 105Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Phase two of the IICF entails the implementation of Operational Risk Management Framework which is intended to address risks
inherent in other business processes not covered by ICFR. The Operational Risk Management Framework (ORM) was approved
by the Board of Directors in March 2012 as the first step in addressing risks related to business processes and the implementation process is ongoing. The implementation of ORM will ensure a structured and well-coordinated approach to risk identification
and assessment, risk mitigation and control as well as risk reporting across the Bank. It will also provide the basis for applying
advanced measurement approach in measuring operational risk capital. Currently, the Bank’s Capital Adequacy and Exposure
Management Framework provides for an operational risk capital charge of 15 percent of the average operating income for the
preceding 3 years, in line with Basel Il recommendations for operational risk.

It is the primary responsibility of the management of each business unit to implement adequate controls in their respective business processes. This responsibility is supported by institutional standards in the following areas:

* Requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorization of transactions
* Requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions

* Documentation of controls and procedures

* Training and professional development

* Risk mitigation including insurance where this is effective

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General of
the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and non-borrowing),
bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in its office locations
Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive Crisis Committee, chaired
by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from the Operations Crisis Committee
(OCC); Cii) the OCC that closely monitors all developments affecting the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate
the relevant risks; and (iii) the business continuity Unit (BCPU) that follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is
also responsible for periodic tests of the overall business continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management practices include compliance with the Code of conduct and staff
rules, the work of the Fraud and Investigations Department and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

Annual Report 2012

mChapter 7 African Development Bank

Loan Swaps
The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable
rate income.

Futures contracts

The Bank has entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December 31,
2012, the Bank had 2,934 contracts in Euro and 2,703 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million
of each currency unit, except for 83 contracts with a nominal value of Euro 100,000 for each contract.

Administrative Expenses Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the
principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP, TND and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward
exchange transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no open
positions with respect to the forward exchange transactions.

Hedge Accounting

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge its interest rate risk exposure associated
to fixed rate loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments are recognized in profit or loss. The hedged
item is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with the gain or loss attributable to the
hedged risk being recognized in profit or loss.

The fair value of the loan swaps designated and effective as hedging instruments as at December 31, 2012 was a liability of UA
128.87 million. The fair value loss on these loan swaps for the year ended December 31, 2012 was UA 30.76 million. The fair value
gain on the hedged loans attributable to the hedged risk was UA 30.77 million. Therefore, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized
in profit or loss was a gain of UA 0.01 million.

Hedge accounting treatment for swaps at the designation date requires the amortization of the difference between the net carrying amount of loans and their fair value as at January 1, 2011. For 2012, the amortization of fair value adjustment on the hedged
risk amounted to UA 5.51 million.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital
increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options
for making their payments:

1. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local
currency; or

2. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/1l relating to the
Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members - 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes
of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five
(5) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

n2 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

2) Non-Regional Members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely
convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and
consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to
the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-V1), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2010/08
of May 27, 2010 each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund only shall pay for the
paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while Middle Income Countries,
Blend countries and Non-Regional member countries shall pay for the paid-up portion of their respective subscribed shares in
eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments.

Payments for shares under GCI-VI are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes encashable on or
before the due date for payment.

 

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other nonsovereign-guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or
in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall
be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a
grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary
market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered multi-currency variable
rate loans to its borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank’s own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans to single currency variable terms or retain the
terms of their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1,
1998. The other terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements.Since October 1,
1997, the Bank has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum
of two components, namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

 

Annual Report 2012 n3Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually
on January, 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and the reset frequency is based on the Bank’s selected reference interest rate in each market. The Bank’s standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY
LIBOR, EURIBOR and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month
period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single
currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule of the loan. The funding spread comprises a funding cost margin and a market risk premium as determined
by the Bank.As part of the fixed lending rate, the funding spread remains fixed for the maturity of the loan for which the lending rate has been fixed. Prior to fixing the lending rate, the single currency fixed rate loan is essentially a variable spread loan.

Fixed Spread Loans: In January 2005, the Bank reviewed the entire set of products and lending processes and adjusted the
pricing of its market-based loan products for the first time since their introduction in October 1997. To this effect, the Bank
simplified the pricing for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers and suspended variable spread loans by eliminating
the funding cost margin and market risk premium.The simplification resulted in a single lending product known as the fixed

spread loan with a simple pricing based on a fixed spread over Libor and no other cl

Others: Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel co-financing and A/B syndications. Through syndications the
Bank is able to mobilize co-financing by transferring some or all of the risks associated with its loans and guarantees to other
financing partners. Thus, syndications decrease and diversify the risk profile of the Bank’s financing portfolio. Syndications
may be on a funded or unfunded basis, and they may be arranged on an individual, portfolio, or any other basis consistent
with industry practices. During the year ended December 31, 2012, the equivalent of USD 810 million was approved for the first
syndication transaction by the Bank through B-loans. The Bank’s A share of this loan was USD 400 million of which an amount
of UA 84.13 million was disbursed at the end of December 2012.

 

The Bank also offers its RMCs local currency loans if the Bank is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The local
currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loan pricing framework with a “cost-pass-through” principle for local currency loans to ensure that the overall cost of funds is compensated.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, the Bank disbursed a loan that is measured at FVTPL due to the existence of a conversion option in the loan that could potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely payments of principal and interest as required by IFRS 9. The fair value of this loan has been determined using the expected cash flows model
with inputs including interest rates and the borrower's credit spread which was estimated based on the Bank’s internal rating
methodology for non-sovereign loans.

loans amounted to UA 2.98 million (2011: UA 2.06 million). The accumulated provision on interest and charges receivable on private sector loans at December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 15.15 million.

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or other parties for goods and services
to be financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2012, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the
Bank to commercial banks on undisbursed loans amounted to UA 3.29 million (2011: no guarantees).

Also, the Bank may provide repayment guarantees to entities within its regional member countries for development loans granted
to such entities by third parties. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are
not made. Guarantees provided by the Bank to some of its borrowers outstanding at December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 14.27
million (2011: UA 10.43 million).

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social
development of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African
countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund’s original subscriptions were pro

vided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement
since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General
Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and 7 members
selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of
the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a
share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually
on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred
by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 185.27 million (2011: UA 159.33 million), representing 65.91 percent
(2011: 68.76 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate
and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its
participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2012, the Bank’s pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.58 percent (2011:
0.63 percent).

 

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note V-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Bank’s investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss on
the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations
plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points
and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

   

Other Equity Participations
The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in such equity
investments is to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of
their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African
participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external
resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank currently holds less than 20 percent of the total equity capital of most of the
institutions in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests,
but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2009/10 of May 13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate
amount of the Bank’s paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

Under IFRS 9 equity investments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, where the equity investment is
not held for trading, an entity has the option to take fair value changes into other comprehensive income (OCI), with no recycling
of the change in fair value to profit or loss if the investment is subsequently derecognized. As the Bank’s equity investments are
currently held for strategic purposes rather than for trading, the Bank has opted to designate all its equity investments as at fair
value through other comprehensive income.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank’s owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used
for the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The land on which the buildings stand are owned by the Government
who granted unlimited right of occupancy to the Bank. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to
a third party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to
the host country. The Government would pay the Bank the value of the building as assessed at the time of the surrender.

The capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors adopted the use of a single debt to usable capital ratio to
monitor the Bank's leverage. The ratio caps the Bank’s total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable capital. Usable capital
comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s usable
capital at December 31, 2012 was UA 26,616 million

As at December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank’s borrowings were as follows:

The Bank’s borrowings as at December 31, 2012 included subordinated borrowings in the amount of UA 760.80 million (2011: UA
795.21 million).

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities
and to lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified dates
prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put dates, rather

122 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain outstanding
beyond their earliest redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the
two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform
a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

Asummary of the Bank’s borrowings portfolio at December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2012 was UA 12,175.96 million (2011: UA
11,756.42 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31,
2012 was UA 12,262.95 million (2011: UA 10,943.87 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional

amount plus accrued finance charges.

Annual Report 2012

125Chapter 7 African Development Bank

As per Note P, there was a net loss of UA 30 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended
December 31, 2012 (2011: net loss of UA 13 million). The fair value gain attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk included
in the other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2012 was UA 79.98 million (2011: loss of UA 63.51 million).

Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for
the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid markets for
ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread was not applied
for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2012, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses
to date were UA 935.04 million (2011: losses of UA 812.55 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY

Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The
Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase
and six General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of
the Bank on May 29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force
of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by
35 percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of
567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent
(94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed,
the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of
4O percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Prior to the sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of
Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120
million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. The membership
of these two countries shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the
Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank. As at December 31,
2012, such formalities had not been completed.

In 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea offering to subscribe, temporarily, to
additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and UA 0.19 billion, respectively. This proposal
was adopted by the Board of Governors on February 22, 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of the Bank increased
from UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710 non-voting shares. These non-voting callable
shares were to be absorbed by the subscriptions of Canada and the Republic of Korea to GCI-VI when they become effective.

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 27, 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital stock
of the Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares created are
to be allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the regional group shall
hold 60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The new shares and the previ
126 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

ous ones described above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of 6 percent paid-up shares an
94 percent callable shares.

Following the Board of Governors’ resolutions, the temporary non-voting callable shares of Canada and Korea described above
were effectively retired in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Consequently, the authorized capital of the Bank reduced by 163,296 an
9,414 shares representing the retired non-voting callable shares for Canada and Korea, respectively.

Following its Resolution B/BG/2012/04 of May 31, 2012, the Board of Governors authorized a Special Capital Increase of the author
ized share capital of the Bank to allow for: (i) subscription by a new regional member country (the Republic of South Sudan) o
he minimum number of shares required for it to become a member; and (ii) the resulting subscription by non-regional members
of the number of shares necessary to comply with the 60/40 ratio requirement between the shareholding of regional and non
regional members. Accordingly, the Board of Governors decided to increase the authorized capital of the Bank by the creation
11,469 new shares, out of which 66,881 shall be available for subscription by the Republic of South Sudan, and 44,588 shal
available for subscription by non-regional members. The additional shares are subject to the same terms and conditions as
he shares authorized in the GCI-VI. The membership of the Republic of South Sudan shall become effective upon completion
of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Regional
Countries to Membership of the Bank. As at December 31, 2012, such formalities had not been completed.

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 1,760.01 million at December 31, 2012 was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia
to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the
event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares
of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested nonregional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will
however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may,
under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested non-regional member states and credit
the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for
membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the
proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

The subscription position including the distribution of voting rights at December 31, 2012 reflects the differences in the timing of subscription payments by member countries during the allowed subscription payment
period for GCI-VI. After the shares have been fully subscribed, the regional and non-regional groups are expected to hold 60% and 40% voting rights, respectively.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member
countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US
dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represented the value of the US Dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on July 1, 1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices,
losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in
the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

(UA thousands)

2012 2011
Balance at January 1 160,633 162,572
Net conversion losses/(gains) on new subscriptions 6,192 (1,939)
Balance at December 31 166,825 160,633

Reserves consist of retained earnings, fair value gains/losses on investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income and gains/losses on fair-valued borrowings arising from “own credit”.

Retained earnings included the net income for the year, after taking into account transfers approved by the Board of Governors,
and net charges recognized directly in equity. Retained earnings also included the transition adjustments resulting from the
adoption of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011.

million (2011: loss of UA 63.51 million) and was included in the other comprehensive income.

The net unrealized gain on derivatives on non-fair-valued borrowings and others for the year ended December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 20.28 million. This included the income statement effects of hedge accounting, consisting of an unrealized gain of UA
0.01 million, representing hedge ineffectiveness and UA 5.51 million of amortization of fair value adjustment on the hedged risk
(see Note G).

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself.
The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance
sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s
gross income.

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to five (5) years and rentals are fixed for an average of one (1)
year. Leases may be extended for periods that are not longer than the original term of the leases.

  

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the
Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of
6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In
November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor,
changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year
of service. The past service cost associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and were recorded in 2004. Also,
new members from the local field offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service costs of UA 1.07
million were reported in the 2007 financial statements.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior service
cost of UA 8.12 million, which was immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of
regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been eliminated.
The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual
actuarial valuations.

In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the mandatory staff retirement age in the Bank from 60 to 62 years
effective January 1, 2012. Participants of the Plan as of May 11, 2011 were given up to December 31, 2012 to make the election on
either to retire at 60 years with no penalty for early retirement or accept the extension and retire at age 62. The option to retire at
age 60 is not available to staff joining the Bank from January 1, 2012, the date of effectiveness of the change. Most of the existing
participants opted for the revised retirement age. The impact of the change on the actuarial valuation of SRP was a curtailment
of UA 10.90 million and was reported in the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other
than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or for the satisfaction of the SRP’s
liabilities. At December 31, 2012, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested
in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan
Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b)
Bond portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the
currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17,
2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute
a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing
of the MBP. Contribution rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children,
range between 0.70 percent to a maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers
of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The
contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the
Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided
to them and their recognized dependents.

The pension and post-employment medical benefit expenses for 2012 and 2011 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined

he expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and
equity securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as
orward-looking expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real
earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflaion, real bond yield, and risk premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to
he long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

he medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced by a wide
variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of these calculations,
he initial medical cost inflation rate is assumed at 6 percent per annum between January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, thereafter
a constant rate of 5 percent per annum will be used.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in short-term deposits and bonds.

The Bank’s estimate of contributions it expects to make to the SRP and the MBP for the year ending December 31, 2013, are UA
18.50 million and UA 4.72 million, respectively.

The following related parties have been identified:

The Bank makes or guarantees loans to some of its members who are also its shareholders, and borrows funds from the capital
markets in the territories of some of its shareholders. As a multilateral development institution with membership comprising
53 African states and 24 non-African states (the “regional members” and “non-regional members”, respectively), subscriptions
to the capital of the Bank are made by all its members. All the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, which
consists of the Governors appointed by each member of the Bank, who exercise the voting power of the appointing member
country. Member country subscriptions and voting powers are disclosed in Note N. The Board of Directors, which is composed
of twenty (20) Directors elected by the member countries, is responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank,
and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the Board of Governors. The Bank also makes or guarantees
oans to certain of the agencies of its regional member countries and to public and private enterprises operating within such
countries. Such loans are approved by the Board of Directors.

n addition to its ordinary resources, the Bank administers the resources of other entities under special arrangements. In this
regard, the Bank administers the resources of the ADF. Furthermore, the Bank administers various special funds and trust funds,
which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social progress of its
regional member countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the NTF as well as certain multilateral and bilateral donor
unds created in the form of grants.

 

he ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of the ADF
is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors of which 7 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent
of the voting power in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry out its functions,
he ADF utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses the Bank based on an
agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed during the year.

The Bank’s investment in the ADF is included in Equity Participations and disclosed in Note J. In addition to the amount reported
as equity participation, the Bank periodically makes allocations from its income to the Fund, to further its objectives. Net income
allocations by the Bank to ADF are reported as Other Resources in the Fund’s financial statements. Net income allocation to the
Fund in 2012 amounted to UA 35 million (2011: UA 35 million).

 

Annual Report 2012 137Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors conducts
the general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in this regard, the Bank consults with the
Government of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for which it reimburses to the Bank its share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses reimbursed to
the Bank by both the ADF and NTF is disclosed in Note Q.

Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other entities
are generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction operations
and technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such grant funds at
December 31, 2012 and 2011 are disclosed in Note V-5.

The Bank charges fees for managing some of these funds. Management fees received by the Bank for the year ended December 31,
2012 amounted to UA 1.78 million (2011: UA 1.77 million).

The Bank also administers the SRP and MBP. The activities of the SRP and MBP are disclosed in Note R.

Compensation paid to the Bank’s management personnel and executive directors during the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011 was made up as follows:

 

 

(UA thousands)

2012 2011
Salaries 18,973 19,024
Termination and other benefits 7,205 6,926
Contribution to retirement and medical plan 3,798 3,704
Total 29,976 29,654

The Bank may also provide personal loans and advances to its staff, including those in management. Such loans and advances,
guaranteed by the terminal benefits payable at the time of departure from the Bank, are granted in accordance with the Bank’s
rules and regulations. At December 31, 2012 outstanding balances on loans and advances to management staff amounted to
UA 4.71 million (2011: UA 4.63 million).

   

The Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its regional member
states. The Bank’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.

Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s operations, management has determined that ADB has only one reportable segment since

the Bank does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net income
from individual borrowers.

NOTE V-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

    

 

i) Der atic Republic of Congo (DRC)
In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears
owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into
new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that
were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In
approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan
is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out
conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created extensive destruction of physical assets, such that
the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage
between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility.
In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently,
the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

   

 

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from
time to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of
such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the
annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC loans in current earnings is
transferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the
Board of Governors of the Bank.

 

   

ii) Post-Conf Countrie ) gile States Facility
The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts
towards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to
the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations
from the ADB's net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt
relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this
connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income
of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to the facility and by its
resolution B/BG/2007/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank’s
allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors approved the establishment
of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and in addition provide broader and integrated
framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the
foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary countries.

   

wily In d Poor Countries (F ) Initiative
The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this
initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended
period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or

In ve

Annual Report 2012 141Chapter 7 African Development Bank

their nominal values, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives. Following the signature of a HIPC debt
relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying value. On average,
loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net
present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund
at book values. The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This
was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much
earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt
relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service
obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and
completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

At December 31, 2012, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 30 ADB borrowing countries, of which 29 had reached
the completion point.

 

iv) Multilatera Relief iative (MDRI)
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help
38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation
would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance
flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed
and outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in
the ADF’s net assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank’s investment in the Fund.
Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are
declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancelation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

NOTE V-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.

At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development
Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from
the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to the Government of Nigeria
upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006, the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations and an independent evaluation of the NTF.

Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years starting
from April 26, 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each,
in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976,
and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

142 Annual Report 2012African Development Bank Chapter 7

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment
of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was
received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.

Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.71 million) was made
to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund. A second request for withdrawal of US$ 200 million was disbursed

to the Government of Nigeria in July 2009.

ii) The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution
20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in
1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields
are likely to facilitate the Bank’s objective of meeting the needs of regional member countries in those fields. The resources of
this Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These
funds, held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific
currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby Mr.
Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of
Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August
11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which
loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2012, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2011: US$ 13.45 million)
had been so repaid.

iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU)
held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving
assistance to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended 31 December 2012

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (“‘the Bank”’) which comprise the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2012 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity
and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
as set out in notes A to V.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of the
Agreement establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to
the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;
selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

African Development Bank
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2012,
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Subscri
AD its

The resources of the African Development Fund (the ADF or the
Fund) primarily consist of subscriptions by the Bank and State
Participants, as well as other resources received by the Fund. The
cumulative subscriptions to ADF amounted to UA 22.50 billion at
December 31, 2012. These, together with other resources received
by the Fund, constitute the Fund’s primary development resources.

 

ations

 

Subsequent to the initial subscriptions, additional resources have
been provided to the ADF through periodic replenishments,
typically done every three years. The twelfth, which is the latest
replenishment of the Fund (ADF-12) was adopted by the Board
of Governors on January 20, 2011 and became effective on May 3,
2011. The replenishment covers the three-year operational period
starting in 2011 and ending in 2013. The total resource envelope
for ADF 12 amounts to UA 611 billion and includes an Advanced
Commitment Capacity, or internally generated resources of UA
2.01 billion. As of December 31, 2012, State participants had subscribed a total amount of UA 3.57 billion, representing 95 percent
of the ADF-12 pledged amounts.

   

C , ral Debt Re: e
The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) became effective
on September 1, 2006 and covers the period 2006-2054. Under
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, donor countries agree to
compensate the ADF for the cancelation of its loans to Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that have reached, or will reach
the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. To preserve the financial integrity and the financing capacity of the
Fund, the terms of the MDRI require donors to fully compensate
the Fund “dollar for dollar” for debts canceled under the MDRI.
Such compensations are made in the form of new funds provided
by donors and credited to them as additional subscriptions to
the resources of the Fund. Donors have also agreed that periodic adjustments would be made under the initiative to reflect
changes in the actual and estimated costs to the Fund resulting
from debt forgiveness.

 

 

The aggregate commitments received by the Fund from donors
as of December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 4.78 billion representing 81 percent of the MDRI cost for the period, 2006-2054, of
UA 5.94 billion.

Fir 1 Pro ts
The ADF is the concessional financing window of the Bank Group
that provides low income regional member countries with concessional loans as well as grants for projects and programs, and support through technical assistance for studies and capacity building.

Annual Report 2012

 

African Development Fund Chapter 7

 

ADF loans. Instead they carried a service charge of 0.75 percent
per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of
0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments. These
ADF loans have a maturity period of 50 years, including a 10-year
grace period.

However, for ADF-12, the Board of Directors approved differentiated ADF loan lending terms to ADF-eligible countries classified as
blend, gap and graduating under the African Development Bank
Group country classification. Accordingly, new loans extended
under ADF-12 and beyond to blend, gap and graduating countries
will have a maturity period of 30 years, including an 8-year grace
period with an interest rate of 1 percent per annum. In addition,
the standard commitment and service fees that apply to all ADF
loans will be charged.

 

low income countries, the ADF Partial Risk Guarantee (ADF-PRG)
instrument was introduced as part of ADF-12, on a pilot basis, to
leverage resources from the private sector and other co-financiers
for ADF countries, including fragile states. This pilot phase of the
ADF-PRG program will be reviewed as soon as the aggregate
amount of committed and outstanding guarantees reaches UA
200 million. The ADF-PRG will insulate private lenders against
well-defined political risks related to the failure of a government
or a government-related entity to honor certain specified commitments and will incentivize governments to undertake policy
and fiscal reforms necessary to mitigate performance-related risks.

 

Investments
ADF cash and treasury investments amounted to UA 3.42 billion
at December 31, 2012 compared to UA 3.09 billion at the end of
2011. Investment income for the year amounted to UA 87.96 million, representing a return of 2.70 percent, on an average liquidity
level of UA 3.25 billion, compared with an income of UA 68.45 million, representing a return of 2.17 percent on an average liquidity
of UA 3.15 billion in 2011. The higher return in 2012 is primarily the
result of the stabilization of interest rates, although at lower levels
as well as the slightly reduced volatility that led to the narrowing
of credit spreads.

 

an Portfolio

lative loans and grants signed, net of cancelations, at
December 31, 2012, amounted to UA 24.12 billion compared to UA
21.48 billion at the end of 2011. Table 7.6 presents loans approved,
disbursed and undisbursed balances from 2008 to 2012. As the
table shows, the level of loan disbursements and approvals peaked
during 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis. However,
they have subsequently returned to, and stabilized at levels comparable to pre-2009.

Total outstanding loans, as at December 31, 2012 was UA 7.21
billion, UA 335.37 million higher than the UA 6.88 billion outstanding as at the end of 2011. This increase was in spite of debt
cancelation under the MDRI, amounting to UA 342.10 million,
for 2 additional completion-point countries.

At the end of 2012, there were a total of 1,046 active signed loans
and grants compared with 1,074 in 2011. Also at December 31,
2012, a total of 683 loans amounting to UA 5.50 billion had been
fully repaid or canceled including cancelations through MDRI.

Loans and grants disbursed by the Fund decreased by 9.80
percent to stand at UA 117 billion in 2012 from UA 1.30 billion
in 2011. As at December 31, 2012, cumulative disbursements
on loans and grants amounted to UA 17.20 billion compared
to UA 16.04 billion in the previous year. A total of 1,918 loans
and grants were fully disbursed for an amount of UA 13.80 billion, representing 80.23 percent of cumulative disbursements.
Figure 7.4 below tracks the evolution of loan disbursements
and repayments over the past five years.

Loan repayments for the Fund amounted to UA 55.06 million in
2012 compared to UA 46.26 million received in 2011, representing an increase of 19 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of December 31, 2012 stood at UA 7.07 billion.

As with the African Development Bank (the Bank) management
monitors performance measures and indicators which reflect
the critical success factors in the ADF’s business. To the extent
that the ADF extends grants in addition to lending at highly
concessional rates, the conventional profitability and financial
ratios are not deemed to be an appropriate means of determining its effectiveness in delivering development resources
to regional member countries. One proxy for measuring effective delivery of development resources is the level of disbursements made to RMCs from one period to another. As already
noted previously, during the year under review a total of UA
117 billion was disbursed for loans and grants as compared to
UA 1.30 billion made in 2011; an amount slightly lower than the
level achieved in 2011.

The highlights of the Fund’s financial performance in 2012
include the following:

* The Fund reported a deficit of UA 64.61 million in 2012, compared to a deficit of UA 58.46 million in 2011 (Figure 7.5). The
persistent reported losses over recent years are principally
due to structural changes to the Fund, including the cancellation of loans to some beneficiaries under the MDRI initiative (described in Note F to the financial statements) and
the increased grant elements in the ADF resource allocation;

* The Fund’s administrative expenses increased during the same
period due to increased operational activities;

* Although Fund's share of the total shareable administrative

expenses of the Bank Group increased by UA 25.94 million
from UA 159.33 million in 2011 to UA 185.27 million in 2012,

Annual Report 2012the Fund's percentage share of the Bank Group total administrative expenses decreased from 68.76 percent for 2011 to
63.79 percent for 2012;

Investment income increased from UA 68.45 million in 2011 to
UA 87.96 million in 2012. The increase in investment income
is due to the combination of an increase in average investment balance in 2012, the slightly improved market conditions
compared to the prior year and the adoption of a new investment strategy during the year to track the discount/returns
realized on accelerated encashment of notes. The increase in
loan income was due primarily to an overall higher average
outstanding loan balance in 2012. Discount on the accelerated
encashment of promissory notes amounted to UA 31.87 million in 2012 compared to UA 29.23 million in 2011 (Figure 7.6).

African Development Fund Chapter 7

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy, service charges on
loans made to or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from
loan income, if principal instalments or service charges on any
such loans are in arrears for 6 months or more, until such time
that payment is received. As a result, of this policy, UA 3.86
million of non-accrued loan income was excluded from 2012
income compared to UA 2.13 million in 2011. The number of borrowers in non-accrual status at December 31, 2012 were three
(3); which was the same level as at the end of December 2011.

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying debts under MDRI as the
relevant countries reach their HIPC completion points. A summary of the cumulative loan cancelations under MDRI and HIPC is
presented in Note F to the Special Purpose Financial Statements.

159Chapter 7 African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members,
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of May 27, 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors of
ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State
Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank
is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
to as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member
countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the
selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries, particularly the lesser-developed countries. The
assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not
liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates, where there are, are disclosed in the notes that follow.

 

 

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of
the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund
(the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and
contributions.

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources
represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and
demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article
35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its
financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's special purpose financial statements are as follows:

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of
Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

160 Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the
currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the
provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time
of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund's Unit of
Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect
of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the
Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation
Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are
included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2012 and 2011 are as follows:

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the
ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the
replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are
recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund.
The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with
an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant’s budgetary appropriation process.

Annual Report 2012 161Chapter 7 African Development Fund

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Starting with the ADF-9 replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are
credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are
invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face
value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on
the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over
the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above
the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors
of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and
timely compensation for the debt cancelation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent
(70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs);
and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with
effect from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancelation, the
ADF governing bodies endorsed Management’s proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the Initiative.
Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for
each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will
take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing
ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted
as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the
same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

 

 

ent, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its
foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that
participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the
time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within
that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value
of the Fund’s holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts
have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ successive Resolutions governing the Second through to the twelfth general replenishments of the Fund, which stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to these general replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the date these
replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into UA are applied
against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).

162 Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

 

Fin ats

The Fund's financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s business model. In accordance
with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net
interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

Fi ial /

 

i) Fil al Asse st
A financial asset is classified at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold the
asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial assets are
considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal

outstanding and are not accounted for separately.
If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified at ‘fair value through profit or loss’.

Financial assets at amortized cost include mainly demand obligations and accrued income on loans and receivables and certain
investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Demand obligations are non-negotiable, non-interestbearing notes payable on demand deposited for subscription payment.

The Fund also classifies at amortized cost, investments of the proceeds of accelerated encashment of notes. This is consistent
with the business model of the Fund of collecting contractual cash flows. The primary objective of such financial assets is to
recoup the discount granted to State Participants on the accelerated encashment program.

  

cial s at lue thre it or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category includes
all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

 

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments
hat are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time
‘oO maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or
sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Income on investments includes interest earned
and unrealized gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund
as transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Inves
The Fund's investment securities are classified either as financial assets at amortized cost or as at fair value. Investments classiied as financial assets at amortized cost include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All other investment securities are classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and measured at market value.

 

ncome on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio held at fair value through profit
or loss. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits
‘o purchase or sell the investments.

 

Annual Report 2012 163Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Country eligibility is determined by assessing gross national income per capita, creditworthiness and performance. Annual Debt Sustainability
Analysis is used to determine the risk of debt distress of each beneficiary country and set appropriate financing terms.

The following categories of countries are eligible to ADF loans:

* Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing and whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off.

* Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are above
the operational cut-off (blend countries) will have access to ADF funds with modified financing terms at par with those of
blend countries.

* Category B countries are those deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are below the
operational cut-off with access to a blend of ADB and ADF resources.

Graduating countries are those that are graduating from the category of ADF borrowing countries to the category of ADB borrowing countries and the graduating policies are determined for each new ADF replenishment.

Disbursed and outstanding loans are not included in Net Development Resources as they represent an allocation of development
resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. Loans reported at amortized cost in the special purpose
financial statements are treated as allocation of development resources.

Loan income arising from interest, service and commitment charges is recognized on an accrual basis. The Fund places all loans
to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments, interest or service charges on any of the loans to such
member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue amount will be
collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by
6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet
date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower’s loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid interests and charges that had
previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for that period. Interests and charges on
loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of such charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth
replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations
of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

HIPC Debt Ir >
The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund,
(the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their
overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

  

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to
their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference
between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it
falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

164 Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

Mu al D R f Initiative (M )

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC
framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by additional contributions to be
made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When MDRI becomes effective for a
country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effectively
take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI are included in “Net Debt Relief”
and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources, with a corresponding
offset to loans outstanding.

Financial L
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon discharge, cancelation or expiration.

 

  

Impairment o

 

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets included in its Net Development Resources is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and
impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated
future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on its receivable or treasury
investments held at amortized cost (described in prior years as held-to-maturity investment), the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding
future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations
reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and
recognized in the income statement. If a treasury investment at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Loans are not included in Net Development Resources and are therefore not subject to impairment.

F lue Discl re

The fair values of quoted financial assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based
on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets, the Fund establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions,
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments
could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management
believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might be
different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input, is not based on observable market data.

Annual Report 2012 165Chapter 7 African Development Fund

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available, using the bid prices. If
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government
and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed
securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits,
certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by
banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Fund also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use
market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for
valuing the Fund's financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

 

Events after the Balance Sheet date

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the date of the Statement of Net Development
Resources and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that
existed at the date of the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the date of the Statement of Net Development resources are disclosed,
but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

 

Reclassific
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect the prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Fund seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk,
and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Fund is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its commitment capacity. The
Fund's overall risk management strategy is to minimize the exposure of its replenishment resources (the Commitment Capacity)
to the risk of over-commitment and also to protect its Net Development Resources from currency translation losses that could
negatively affect the Fund's long-term capacity to meet its develooment needs.

The policies, processes and procedures which the Fund uses to manage its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Fund's Board of
Executive Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Fund’s
risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Fund manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on Asset
Liability Management (the ALM Authority) approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

166 Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
the Fund's liquid assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund’s interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM
Authority covers the Fund’s entire array of ALM activities.

Under the umbrella of the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guideines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The ALCO, chaired by
he Vice President for Finance, is the oversight and control organ of the Fund’s finance and treasury risk management activities.

The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups that
report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products
and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Fund’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines are
delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-today compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Cred

 

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
inancial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund arising essenially from its lending and treasury operations.

 

he Fund’s credit risk arises from two principal sources: (i) sovereign credit risk arising from lending to its qualifying RMCs and
(ii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions.

     

gn cr t RISK

The Fund provides concessional loans in order to fund economic and social development of its member countries which generally have a lower credit quality than ADB borrowers. Although loans are included in the financial statements as resources already
allocated for development and therefore not included in the Net Develooment Resources, the Fund still manages sovereign
credit risks to ensure equitable allocation of resources to eligible beneficiaries and ensure that expected reflows from loan repayments are properly monitored and managed. Country eligibility for loans is determined by assessing among other things, gross
national income per capita, credit worthiness and performance. The Fund uses the International Monetary Fund/World Bank
Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for low-income countries, to make performance-based allocation (PBA) of ADF resources
among the many competing needs in the continent and to ensure the funds are directed to areas they will be used most effectively. The PBA process, which is reviewed regularly, is also used to determine the proportion of ADF resources that is allocated
in the form of grants to each qualifying borrower. On the basis of the debt sustainability analysis, certain countries are allocated
grants-only resources, while others may receive a combination of loan and grant resources or loan resources only.

The outcome of the referendum conducted in Southern Sudan in January 2011 supported the creation of an independent state of Southern Sudan. After the split of the current state of Sudan into two separate

nations became effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a basis agreed upon following the ongoing
negotiations between the North and South Sudan. At the end of December 2012, no decision has been taken by the states of the North and South Sudan regarding the terms and conditions of such exchange.

Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

In the normal course of business, the Fund utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its
exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement.
All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to
meet its obligation to the Fund. Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty
credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank Group's Vice President
for Finance. ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored by the Risk Management Department.

For trading counterparties, the Fund requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

Maturity
6 months 1year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Mad AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/Aad AAA/Aaa

AAA
MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in the UK and

40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life
for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund uses derivatives in the management of its assets and liabilities. As a rule, the Fund executes an ISDA master agreement
and collateral exchange agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with whom the
Fund has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO. Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a stipulated maximum for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures
are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Fund’s credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow
needs for between 50 and 75 percent of the three years moving average of expected disbursements.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if the
need arises, the Fund divides its investment portfolio into two tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The
Fund's core liquidity portfolio, which is fair valued, is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if the need
arises to meet the Fund’s short-term liquidity needs. In addition to the trading portfolio, the Fund maintains a second tranche
of liquidity under the broad category of amortized cost portfolio, which is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended
to earn contractual cash flows.

Currency E ge Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in the
Fund's Net Assets, including its Net Development Resources (NDR) and outstanding loans, the Fund’s principal currency risk
management objective is to ensure that it is able to provide the disbursement currencies requested by borrowers while minimizing the exposure of its net development resources to adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent possible, the Fund
shall maintain the alignment of the currency composition of its Net Assets with the UA as the primary benchmark of its currency
composition. The Fund may conduct currency exchange transactions for the following two reasons: (1) to align the currency
composition of its Net Assets (loan and investment portfolios) with the UA, (2) for the purpose of providing ADF borrowers with
the disbursement currencies requested.

 

Interest rate risk is the potential for loss due to adverse movements in market interest rates. In seeking to earn a stable and reasonable return on invested liquidity, the Fund’s principal interest rate risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of the Fund's
investment returns to changes in market interest rates. To achieve this objective, the Fund’s investments are managed in two
portfolios: (1) an actively managed portfolio (the “Operational” Portfolio); and (2) a passively managed portfolio (the “Investment”
Portfolio).

The Operational Portfolio provides a readily available source of liquidity to cover both expected and unexpected disbursements
as well as any other probable cash outflows. The Operational Portfolio is managed against a 3-month LIBOR reference benchmark in each currency. Generally, investments in the Operational Portfolio are held for trading and are regularly marked to market.

The Investment Portfolio consists of funds that are not immediately required for loan disbursements and therefore may be invested for a longer horizon. Generally, investments in the Investment Portfolio are purchased with the intention to hold them until
their maturity and are not marked to market. The Investment Portfolio comprises two sub-portfolios, (1) an investment portfolio
for income stabilization for the purpose of generating a stable income for the Fund and reducing the Fund’s investment income
sensitivity to interest rates. This portfolio is managed against a ten-year uniform re-pricing profile for each invested currency, and
(2) an investment portfolio for accelerated encashments for the purpose of investing proceeds from accelerated encashments
to recoup the discount granted to State Participants, minimizing or eliminating interest rate risk on accelerated encashments.
This portfolio is managed against a target rate, which is the discount rate agreed with State Participants.

Futures Contracts

The Fund has also entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December
31, 2012, the Fund had 317 contracts in Euro and 2,397 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million
of each currency unit, except for 56 Euro contracts with a nominal value of 100,000 for each contract.

NOTE E - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the
form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed
that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE F - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund’s loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing
from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per
annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on
the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved after
June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences
to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement. With effect from the ADF 12 replenishment, loans to
blend, gap and graduating countries carry differentiated financing terms of thirty (30) years’ maturity, grace period of 8 years
and interest rate of 1 per cent, in addition to the existing standard 0.50 percent commitment fee and 0.75 percent service charge.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2012,
outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 13.83 million (2011: UA 7.11 million).

As at December 31, 2012, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of
UA 283.56 million (2011: UA 286.01 million) of which UA 98.10 million (2011: UA 91.10 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2012, would have
been higher by UA 3.84 million (2011: UA 2.13 million). At December 31, 2012, the cumulative charges not recognized on the nonaccrual loans amounted to UA 39.47 million, compared to UA 35.92 million at December 31, 2011.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of
20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

At December 31, 2012, outstanding loans amounted to UA 7,213.99 million (2011: UA 6,878.62 million)

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10 percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.5 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments
were allocated as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or
programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the
ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth, eleventh and twelfth general replenishments is based on a
country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period,
from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible,
the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

Annual Report 2012 175Chapter 7 African Development Fund

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment
period of 5 years thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price
equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the
signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present value.
The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown
as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million which was the write-down in respect of the debt
relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework is included in the amount stated as net debt relief in the
Statement of Net Development Resources. The outstanding balance and net present value of the loans owed by Mozambique
and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by
reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the
original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they
come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided.
Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2012 amounted to UA 184 million and are shown as allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Develooment Resources.

Multilatera tR litiative

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development
Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for the MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation is delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the
same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF
to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded from
net development resources, the debt cancelation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development resources.
Cancelation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2012, a gross amount of UA 5.52 billion (2011: UA 5.15 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled under
MDRI for 28 (2011: 26) HIPC completion-point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2011: UA 1,225.99 million) in nominal
terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71 million (2011: UA 942.71
million). As of December 31, 2012, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC - In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF,
the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA
36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-9) to clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears
to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing
Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-8 as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework - The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically regional member countries of ADB emerging from conflict or crisis.
The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and
long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their arrears and prepare
them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails
the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF, the ADB and private donors.
Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible fragile states not yet receiving debt relief to
fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. Contributions made by the Fund
to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state. Contributions by the Fund to the
Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

 

 

The Fund’s initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the
form of a special general increase and twelve general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement
of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note M.

The Board of Governors, by its resolution F/BG/2011/01 of January 20, 2011, approved the twelfth general replenishment of the
Fund (ADF-12), following the Deputies agreement for a replenishment level of UA 6.10 billion, of which UA 2.01 billion represents
internally generated resources, for the three-year operational period, 2011 to 2013. ADF-12 came into effect on May 3, 2011 after
the State Participants had deposited with the Fund, enough instruments of subscriptions to meet the threshold of 30 percent
of pledged subscriptions. At December 31, 2012, subscriptions to ADF-12 amounted to UA 3.57 billion.

Annual Report 2012 izChapter 7 African Development Fund

At December 31, 2012, cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.94 billion of which UA 583.52
million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid
entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note M.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

     

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund
or a member of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part
of the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 412.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 410.30 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund’s activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

 

Reserves as at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

(UA thousands)

2012 2011
Reserves at January 1 56,224 114,688
Deficit for the year (64,614) (58,464)
Reserves at December 31 (8,390) 56,224

The Fund has available resources entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to receive other
resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2012, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 2.68 million (2011: UA 3.75 million) representing
the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

178 Annual Report 2012African Development Fund Chapter 7

NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund’s relative share of the number of programs and projects
executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA
185.27 million (2011: UA 159.33 million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by the
Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the
Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB (the
Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the
resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by one of its State Participants.

African Development Fund

Independent Auditor's Report on the special purpose
financial statements of the African Development Fund

to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the special purpose financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2012.

Annual Report 2012 183The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) is a special fund administered by
the Bank. Its resources primarily consist of subscriptions by
the Federal Government of Nigeria. The NTF was established
in 1976 when an agreement establishing the NTF was executed
between the Bank and the Federal Government of Nigeria for
an initial period of 30 years, with a provision for extension by
mutual agreement. After two annual extensions in 2006 and
2007, the operation of the NTF was extended for ten years with
effect from April 25, 2008, following a positive evaluation of its
performance during the initial thirty (30) years of operation.

NTF provides financing in the form of loans to the least developed and low income regional member countries at concessionary rates in order to enhance economic development and
social progress in Africa. While in the past the NTF has provided
financial support exclusively to public sector operations, for the
extension period from 2008, NTF will expand its financial support to cover private sector operations as well, including the
microfinance subsector.

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF, all denominated in
US Dollars, amounted to UA 126.57 million at December 31, 2012,
compared with UA 106.33 million at the end of 2011. Investment
income for 2012 was UA 0.98 million, representing a return of
0.93 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 105.71 million,
compared with an income of UA 0.17 million in 2011, representing a return of 0.16 percent on an average liquidity of UA 107.14
million. Although the very low level of the USD Libor rates still
weighed on the absolute performance in 2012, the slightly less
volatile and stressed financial environment led to the tightening of credit spreads during the year which translated into a
much higher performance compared to 2011.

Loans signed, net of cancelations, as at December 31, 2012,
increased by UA 14.88 million to UA 260 million compared with

amounting to UA 229.99 million were fully disbursed as at
December 31, 2012, representing 96.98 percent of cumulative
disbursements on that date. Figure 7.7 shows the evolution of
oan disbursements and repayments over the past five years.

 

Loan repayments amounted to UA 6.28 million in 2012 compared with UA 5.81 million in 2011, representing an increase of
7.92 percent over the previous year. Cumulative repayments as
at December 2012 were UA 154.32 million.

185Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF, similar to the Bank, seeks to reduce its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development related assistance, such as liquidity, currency and
interest rate risks. The Fund follows stringent risk management
procedures in managing these risks. Note D to the Financial
Statements of the Fund provides the details of the risk management policies and practices employed by NTF.

The highlights of the Nigeria Trust Fund’s financial performance
in 2012 include the following:

* NTF’s income before distributions approved by the Board of
Governors increased by UA 0.65 million from UA 1.52 million
in 2011 to UA 2.17 million in 2012, mainly due to the increase
in investment income (Figure 7.8). Investment income in 2012
increased by UA 0.81 million due to the slightly improved market conditions and increase in the average investment funds;

Administrative expenses representing NTF’s share of the total
shareable expenses of the ADB Group, increased by UA 0.15
million from UA 0.39 million in 2011 to UA 0.54 million in 2012.
The NTF’s share of the total shareable expenses of the Bank
Group is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula,
which is driven by the relative levels of certain operational

186

volume indicators and relative balance sheet-size. However,
NTF’s total administrative expense is capped at no more than
20 percent of its gross income in any year;

+ The NTF’s reserves net of cumulative currency translation
adjustments increased from UA 34.15 million at the end of
2011 to UA 36 million on December 31, 2012, a 5.42 percent
increase over the previous year.

Annual Report 2012Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank,
which is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria.
The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement
stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such
sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement
expired on April 26, 2006 and was extended twice for one-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review
of the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of the independent review, the Agreement has been extended
for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

 

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the his‘orical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Fund are summarized below:

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
eld by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life
of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.

The Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States Dollars
(USD). In accordance with Article VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements are presented
in Units of Account (UA).

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one Special
Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At December
31, 2012, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.53692 United States dollars (2011: 1.53527 USD)

ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabiliies are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses
on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

 

Annual Report 2012 193Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Fund classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized
cost; and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s
business model. In accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income
through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its
financial assets at initial recognition.

 

 

Fin A mortiz
A financial asset is classified as ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold the
asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial assets are
considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

\f either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments that
meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued income and
receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts receivable. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial
assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides money,
goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. Incremental direct
costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are considered insignificant.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financia ts at Fé 2 throug! ofit or TPL)
Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category includes
all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time

to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or
sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

194 Annual Report 2012Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

 

2) Finan ities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized
upon discharge, cancelation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial A
The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if,
here is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

 

 

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or held‘o-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred),
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may
e experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management’s best estimate of the effect of
such delays.

 

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and
recognized in the income statement. If a loan or other investment held at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount
rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges
are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

      

Off al Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

19 Financ

F lue Discl re

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on
current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by
using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length
transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale
might be different from the fair values disclosed.

Annual Report 2012 195Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the expected cash flows of its loans. The fair
valuation of loans has been determined using a discounted cash flow model based on year end market lending rates in USD,
including impairment percentages when applicable.

 

Re 2 nings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year

net income.

 

Critical Acc ting Judgment Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical

experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

he most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

 
 

y at Amori Cost

he Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines
hat no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of
inancial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.

   

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after
he initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows
of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
een incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

 

196 Annual Report 2012Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement.

ii) Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas
such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes
in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

1) Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective

At the date of issue of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for application, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.

The following new standards and amendments are expected to be relevant to the Fund:

¢ IFRS 10: “Consolidated Financial Statements”.

IFRS 10 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. IFRS 10 introduces a new
control model to determine whether an investee should be consolidated. This IFRS defines the principle of control and establishes control as the sole basis for determining which entities should be consolidated by the reporting entity. It also establishes
principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity has determined that it controls one or more other entities.

The adoption of IFRS 10 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

¢ IFRS 13: “Fair Value”

IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements.

IFRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards
and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However, this standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value are required
under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair valuation hierarchy.

The adoption of IFRS 13 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

Annual Report 2012 197Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

 

¢ IFRS 7: “Financial Instrume Disclosures” and IAS 32: “Financial Instruments: Presentation”

In December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entity's
financial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new requirements are set out in Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (amendment to IFRS 7), and are related to
financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the [ASB also published Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

These amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2013 and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, respectively.

The adoption of IFRS 7 and IAS 32 are not expected to have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course of
exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of the Fund
through the Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority sets out
the guiding principles for managing the Fund’s risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit
risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines
as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s most
senior management forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

In June 2012, the Bank also created the Credit Risk Committee (CRC); to ensure effective implementation of the Bank's credit
policies and oversee all credit risk issues related to sovereign and non-sovereign operations.

The ALCO and CRC meet on regular basis to perform their oversight roles. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and
ad-hoc finance and treasury risk management reports and projections and approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet. The
Credit Risk Committee takes over the Credit Risk responsibilities previously handled by ALCO including the coverage of the endto-end credit risk governance, credit assessments portfolio monitoring and rating change approval amongst others. ALCO and
CRC are supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit
risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated to
the relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk
for the Fund arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending operations, and counterparty credit risk. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and
processes, which are described in more detail in the following sections.

198 Annual Report 2012Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses
arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. Country credit risk is managed through
financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessment.
These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future
growth prospects.

The Fund’s loans outstanding at December 31, 2012 were to the following countries:

As at December, 2012, all the Fund’s loans were made only to public sector borrowers, and such loans generally carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state.

Annual Report 2012 199Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk
rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund’s statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

International Ratings

 

Risk Class Revised Rating Scale S&P - Fitch Moody’s Assessment

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices
are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized
international bodies. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure
limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that
country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any
previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to
or guaranteed by that borrower country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. Various financial instruments are used to manage the fund’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid
resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to
the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

200 Annual Report 2012Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, this risk is
minimized by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards,
counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum
credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that are rated below
the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

Maturity

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government A/A2 AA-/ha3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/had AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/ha3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/had AAA/Aaa

AAA

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in the UK and 40-year

maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the
time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund’s total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits
of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to
be predominantly in the AA- or higher-rated class:

Credit Risk Profile of the Investment Portfolio

 

AAA AA+ to AA- A+ and lower
2012 63% 19% 18%
2011 50% 2% 21%

2009 60% 37% 3%
2008 55% 34% 1s
2007 14a 85% th

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to

mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund's investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement
obligations.

Annual Report 2012 201Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed
interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently the
available resources. Re-pricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is accordingly
not hedged.

At December 31, 2012, the Fund had UA 22.86 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2011: UA 9.73 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2012 and 2011 were as follows:

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the
Fund's assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an
impact of approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the effect

NOTE G - LOANS

Loans originated prior to September 22, 2003; carry an interest rate of four per cent (4%) on the outstanding balance. With
effect from September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of June 3, 2003 and the protocol agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated September 22, 2003, the interest rate on loans was
changed from a flat 4 percent per annum to a range of 2 percent to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding balance
and future undisbursed loans. Furthermore, a 0.75 percent commission is payable on undisbursed balances commencing 120
days after the signature of the loan. Loans approved prior to the extension of the Agreement are granted for a maximum period
of twenty-five years including grace periods of up to five years.

Following the extension of the Agreement in April 2008, the terms of the NTF loans were further modified in line with the
terms of financing in the operational guidelines of the Fund, approved pursuant to the Board of Directors’ resolution ADB/BD/
WP/2008/196 of December 2, 2008 which stipulates that the resources of the Fund will henceforth be deployed in accordance
with the following three options:

Financing
Financial terms for the first option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum
on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on un-disbursed commitments; and (iv) a 20-year
repayment period with a 7-year grace period.

 

ms

Financial terms for the second option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum
on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on un-disbursed commitments; and (iv) a 15-year
repayment period with a 5-year grace period.

Financial terms for the third option would be the same terms as for the ADB private sector financing, taking into consideration
the risk analysis of the project.

For all the above mentioned options, the grace period starts from the date of signing of the financing agreement or at a date
agreed amongst co-financiers, in the case of co-financed projects.

 

For private sector operations, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum on un-disbursed balances will be charged from 120
days after the signing of the loan agreement.

The NTF shall provide financing to suit the needs of its borrowers.

 

Loan Ceilings

In order to promote broader coverage of the NTF resources, utilization will be subject to a ceiling for each operation. For both
public and private sector operations, a ceiling of US$10 million per project will apply. Project proposals of more than US$10 million may be considered if there is strong justification. This will be subject to review as appropriate depending on the recommen
dations of the mid-term reviews of the NTF.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At December 31, 2012,
all loans disbursed were repayable in U.S. dollars.

OTE J - ADMINISTRATIVE E

 

According to the Agreement establishing NTF, the Fund shall pay to the Bank the expenses incurred in the management of the
Fund as follows:

a) Separately identifiable costs incurred by the Bank for the Fund; and
b) Indirect costs incurred by the Bank in the management of the Fund.

However, the annual payment for the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Bank shall not exceed 20 percent of the Fund’s
gross income during the course of each year. The administrative cost-sharing formula may be reviewed from time-to-time by
mutual agreement.

The amount of UA 0.54 million charged for the year ended December 31, 2012 (2011: UA 0.39 million) represents the Fund’s share
of the Bank Group expenses.

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF
on the basis of the terms of the Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the offices,
staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such facilities, based
on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula (see Note J). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2012 in respect of Fund’s share
of administrative expenses was UA 0.23 million (2011: UA 0.07 million) and is included in Accounts Payable on the balance sheet.

  

The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB regional member countries for development purposes.
The Fund's products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.
Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB regional member countries and
treasury investments. External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 is detailed as follows:

 

(UA thousands)

2012 2011
Interest income and charges on loans 1,700 172
Treasury investment income 980 173
Total external revenue 2,680 1,945

The Fund’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are carried out
mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on the basis
of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses ADB's offices, staff, organization,
services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own.

On March 27, 2013, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors.
The financial statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank at its annual
meeting in May 2013.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank in respect of the
Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2012

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (“the Fund”) which comprise the balance sheet as
at 31 December 2012 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set
out in notes A to M.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by Section
8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance
with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of
Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December 2012,
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

227Annexes

Annex V
The African Development Bank Group

The African Development Bank (ADB) resources, which are
generally obtained through capital market borrowings, are
used to provide loans to its RMCs on non-concessional terms.
Resources from this window are also used to support private
sector projects in all RMCs through direct loans, LOCs, trade
inance facilities, equity and quasi-equity participations, and
guarantees to financially sound and viable private enterprises,
and multinational projects that support regional integration.

The ADB's standard loan product has evolved over time, with
erms that are increasingly more accommodating and responsive to client needs.

he standard loan product now offered to sovereign and sovereign guaranteed clients is the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan
(EVSL) which gives borrowers a high degree of flexibility to
manage their interest rate risks. For Non-sovereign guaraneed clients the loan product offered is the Fixed Spread Loan.

 

he interest rate on the EVSL is comprised of a floating base
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for Euro
and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is a funcion of the Bank's cost of funding relative to LIBOR, EURIBOR or
IBAR computed every six month, and a contractual spread of
60 bps. At a borrower’s request, the EVSL offers a free option
‘o convert the floating base rate into a fixed rate.

he standard repayment period for sovereign and sovereign
guaranteed loans is up to 20 years, including a grace period
not exceeding 5 years.

he interest rate on the FSL is comprised of a floating base
rate (6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR
or Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating
until maturity date or a fixed base rate (amortizing swap rate
set at borrower's request for disbursed loan balances) plus a
risk-based credit spread.

 

Non sovereign loans have standard repayment periods up to
15 years including a grace period that does not exceed 5 years.

The African Development Fund (ADF) resources emanate
from contributions and periodic replenishments by ADF-State
Participants, usually on a 3-year basis. No interest is charged on
ADF loans. The loans, however, carry a service charge of 0.75
percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment
fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans span a 50-year repayment period, including a

228

O-year grace period. Lines of credit (LOCs) have a 20-year
repayment period, which also includes a 5-year grace period.
he Fund also provides grants to RMCs, and these do not carry
any interest charges. For blend countries (see Appendix IV),
owever, the lending terms have been made more stringent
during the ADF-12 (2011-2013) period, as follows: 30 years’
maturity, a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1
ercent on project loans. The other terms remain the same,
namely: 0.75 percent service charge on outstanding balances
and 0.5 percent commitment fee on undisbursed commitments.

he Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) resources are provided entirely
y the Federal Republic of Nigeria under an Agreement signed
with the Bank in 1976 for an initial period of 30 years. Following
its revision in April 2008, the Agreement provides that the
resources of the Fund shall be used in accordance with the
erms of the following three options:

 

+ First option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a service
charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances;
(c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 20-year repayment period,
including a 7-year grace period.

Second option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 15-year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period.

Third option: Same terms as for the ADB private sector loans,
taking into consideration the provisions of the Guidelines for
the Bank’s private sector financing as well as the risk analysis
of the project.

Loans granted prior to the revision of the Agreement carried

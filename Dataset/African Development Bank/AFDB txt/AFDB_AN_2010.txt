Annual Report 2010THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

Comprises

The African Development Bank
The African Development Fund
The Nigeria Trust Fund

The overarching objective of the African Development Bank Group is to spur sustainable economic development and social

progress in its regional member countries (RMCs), thus contributing to poverty reduction. The Bank Group achieves this objective

by: (i) mobilizing and allocating resources for investment in RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice and technical assistance to

support development efforts.

The African
Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development
bank whose shareholders comprise
53 African countries (regional member countries - RMCs) and 24 non-African countries (non-Regional Member
Countries - non-RMCs). It was established in 1964 and officially began operations in 1967. The Bank’s headquarters is
in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. However, as a
result of political instability in the country, the ADB Board of Governors in 2003
decided to move the Bank to the current
Temporary Relocation Agency (TRA) in
Tunis, Tunisia.

The Bank Group’s primary objective is to
contribute to the sustainable economic
development and social progress of its
regional members, individually and jointly.
This objective is met by financing a broad
range of development projects and programs through: (i) public sector loans
(including policy-based loans), private
sector loans, and equity investments; (ii)
providing technical assistance for institutional support projects and programs; (iii)
public and private capital investment; (iv)
assistance in coordinating RMC development policies and plans; and (v) emergency assistance grant not exceeding
US$ 1.0 million per operation, up to a
maximum of two operations per country

Annual Report 2010

in any one year. The Bank's priorities are
national and multinational projects and
programs that promote regional economic cooperation and integration.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement)
designates the Board of Governors as
the Institution’s highest policy-making
organ. The Board of Governors is made
up of one representative from each member country and it issues general directives on the Bank’s operations, approves
amendments to the Agreement, oversees
the admission of new members and any
increases of the Bank’s capital. The Board
of Governors of the ADB meets at least
once a year. The ADB Board of Governors
elects a 20-member Board of Directors
to which it delegates its powers, with the
exception of those expressly reserved to it
in the Agreement. Thirteen Directors are
elected from RMCs and seven from nonRMCs for a 3-year term which is renewable for one term. The Board of Directors
oversees all Bank operations.

The Boards of Governors elects the
President of the Bank Group for a
5-year term, renewable for one term.
The President, who must originate from
an RMC, chairs the Board of Directors,
appoints Vice-Presidents - in consultation with the Boards - and manages the
Bank’s daily operations.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on
non-concessional terms. In 1997, it introduced three new loan products to meet
the needs of its clients, namely: a single-currency variable-rate loan, a singlecurrency floating-rate loan and a singlecurrency fixed rate loan. The interest rate
for the single-currency variable-rate loan
is based on the quarter’s average cost of
all outstanding Bank borrowings specifically allocated to fund these loans. The
interest rate for the floating-rate loan is
based on the 6 month LIBOR in the basket of currencies offered by the Bank. The
rate for fixed-rate loans is based on the
Bank's cost of borrowing to fund them.
The repayment terms for Bank loans are
as follows:

« Arepayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years for public sector loans;

*« Arepayment period of up to 14 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
4 years for publicly guaranteed Lines
of Credit (LOCs); and

* Arepayment period of 5 to 20 years,

including a grace period of 1 to 3 years
for private sector loans.

xiThe African
Development Fund

he ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973
and became operational in 1974. Its main
objective is to reduce poverty in RMCs by
roviding low-income RMCs with concessional loans and grants for projects and
programs and support through technical assistance for studies and capacityuilding activities.

he Agreement Establishing the African
Development Fund (ADF) designates
he Board of Governors as the Fund’s
ighest policy-making organ. The Board
of Governors meets at least once a year.
he ADF Board of Directors, which oversees the general operations of the Fund,
includes seven Executive Directors from
non-RMCs - nominated by their constituencies and seven Executive Directors
representing the ADB.

 

The Fund's resources come from contributions and periodic replenishments by
participants, usually on a 3-year basis. For
ADF-12 (2011-2013), Deputies agreed to
a replenishment of UA 6.10 billion, which
represents a 10.6 percent increase over
the ADF-11 level.

xii

No interest is charged on ADF loans. The
loans, however, carry a service charge of
0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50
percent per annum on undisbursed commitments. Project loans span a 50-year
repayment period including a 10-year
grace period. Lines of Credit (LOCs) have
a 20-year repayment period which comes
with a 5-year grace period. The Fund also
provides RMCs with grants that do not

The Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF is a special ADB fund created in 1976 by agreement between the
Bank Group and the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria. Its objective
is to assist the development efforts of
low-income RMCs whose economic and
social conditions necessitate concessional
financing. The NTF became operational
in April 1976 following the approval of
the Agreement Establishing the Nigeria
Trust Fund by the Board of Governors.
Its initial capital of US$ 80.0 million was
replenished in 1981 with US$ 71.0 million.

Under the terms of the Agreement
Establishing the NTF, the operations of

he Fund were envisaged to come to
an end 30 years after the Agreement
came into force. At the attainment of
his 30-year period on April 25, 2006,
he Bank and the Nigerian authoriies agreed to two 1-year extensions of
he Agreement. During that period, in
lovember 2006, an independent evaluation of the activities of the Fund was
commissioned and the exercise was
completed in July 2007. On the basis of
ositive findings and recommendations
rom the evaluation and resulting from
meetings held between the Bank and the
igerian authorities in November 2007,
he Nigerian authorities agreed to extend
he life of the NTF for a further 10 years.

 

Following the approval of the NTF extension by the Board of Governors of the
Bank on May 15, 2008, and the subsequent approval of the N7F Operational
Guidelines in December 2008 by the
Board of Directors, the NTF lending program recommenced in 2009.

xvMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP AND
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African
Development Bank Group

lam pleased to submit this 2010 Bank
Group Annual Report which looks back
at yet another successful year for the
Bank and most of its member countries.
As | began my second term in September
2010, together we undertook to strive
every day to consolidate the Bank’s
achievements as a world-class organization capable of responding to Africa’s
needs while maintaining focus and avoiding strategic drift. In making this under
xvi

taking, we were fully aware of the complexity of the challenges ahead but very
much encouraged by the opportunities
now available to Africa as a result of the
profound structural shifts in the global
economy. Looking ahead, | see the Bank's
key challenge as not only to foster strong,
sustained growth but also to promote
inclusiveness. The tremors and tectonic
shifts in the political landscape of North
Africa are a clear signal that economic
growth that is not inclusive, that does
not expand human opportunities and
horizons, cannot be sustained.

Our ability to consolidate our achievements in a rapidly evolving and often
uncertain external environment must
begin by anchoring the financial soundness of the institution, whose robustness
was demonstrated during the financial
crisis. We continue to pursue the prudent financial and risk management policies and practices that have allowed the
Bank to enjoy sound financial health and
good results. The major rating agencies
have reaffirmed the triple-A rating for the
Bank’s senior debt. The recently concluded General Capital Increase and ADF-12
replenishment resources will reinforce our
capacity to deliver on the Bank Group’s
mandate. This significant achievement, at
atime of stress in the world economy and

ough fiscal situation among our members, highlights strong shareholder suport for the Bank.

wish to thank our shareholders for this
unequivocal support to the Bank and in
urn undertake to ensure the commitments entered into are fulfilled.

Lastly, | would like to express my appreciation to our Boards of Directors and

anagement of the Bank for guiding
he institution with skill and commitment
hroughout the year. | pay specific tribute
0 the staff of the Bank for their devotion
‘o duty and for delivering credible results,
even in the face of special challenges at
he Bank’s Temporary Relocation Agency
in Tunis as well as at our Headquarters
in Abidjan. While looking forward to a
successful year for our member counries and the Bank Group, | commend
his report.

African Development Bank Group and
Chairman of the Boards of Directors

Annual Report 2010EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

During 2010, the Bank Group continued to implement its Mediurn-Term Strategy (2008-2012) by focusing on the operational
priority areas of infrastructure development, private sector development, governance, higher education, technology and
vocational training, while pursuing selectivity in its operations. The institution also consolidated its role as a knowledge bank for
the continent, not only by widely disseminating research findings, publishing flagship reports, and updating its Data Portal, but
also by undertaking economic and sector work (ESW), and eliciting lessons learned to inform its future operations. The Bank’s
role as a voice for Africa at major international fora was reinforced by its active participation at the Third Korea-Africa Economic
(KOAFEC) meeting in September and later at the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November. Another major achievement during the
year was resource mobilization, as the Bank tripled its capital resources through a 200 percent Sixth General Capital Increase
(GCI-VI), while securing a 10.6 percent increase in contributions from State Participants for the ADF-12 replenishment over the
ADF-11 level. Bank Group approvals in 2010 amounted to UA 4.10 billion compared to UA 8.06 billion recorded in the previous
year. The approvals in 2010 signaled the lending trend returning to its normal level after the unprecedented demand for Bank
Group resources in 2009 due to the global financial crisis.

Overview of the Economic
Situation and Outlook

Africa’s recovery from the global economic and financial crisis began in 2010
and has been driven by higher domestic
demand, stronger export revenues, and
increased inflows of foreign direct investment, remittances, and official development assistance. Real GDP growth rose
to 4.9 percent in 2010, from 3.1 percent
a year earlier, at the peak of the global
financial crisis. Growth is expected to fall
back to 3.7 percent in 2011 as a result of
the sociopolitical unrest in some African
countries, before recovering to 5.8 percent in 2012.

Inflation declined from 10.0 percent in
2009 to an estimated 7.7 percent in 2010,
as aggregate demand remained subdued.
However, the short-term forecast is that
it will increase marginally to 8.4 percent
in 2011 before improving to 7.4 percent
in 2012. This positive outlook may be at
some risk, however, if the increases in
global commodity prices experienced
during the second half of 2010 continue
into 2011.

Annual Report 2010

The continent's fiscal deficit narrowed
from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to 3.3
percent in 2010. However, owing to the
recent sociopolitical unrest in some
African countries and the repercussions
in other neighboring countries, the forecast is for a fiscal deficit of 3.9 percent in
2011, but narrowing to 3.2 percent in 2012.

Similarly, the current account balance
of the continent improved from a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to a
surplus of 0.4 percent in 2010. However,
the projection is that the surplus will turn
to a deficit of 0.2 percent in 2011 before
reverting to surplus of 0.2 percent in 2012.
Major variations exist between RMCs in
terms of economic performance. Both
the fiscal and current account balances
of oil-exporting countries strengthened
considerably, while oil importers continued to post fiscal and current account
deficits well above pre-crisis levels.

 

All the African subregions posted positive GDP growth rates in 2010. Of the five
subregions, East and West Africa were
the best performers in 2010, with GDP
growth of 6.2 and 6.7 percent respectively.

This reflected a similar growth pattern to
2009, when East Africa’s growth was 5.7
percent and that of West Africa was 5.6
percent. For most African economies,
growth is yet to return to pre-crisis levels
and this subdued trend is set to continue
in the short term. Those African countries
that are primarily commodity exporters,
which had experienced a marked slowdown in 2009, benefited from revived
commodity prices and trade in 2010. The
rebound in several low-income countries and fragile states was more muted.
Overall, more than half the African economies grew at a lower rate in 2010 than
during the period 2001-2008.

Bank Group Activities

The Bank Group’s current operational focus is shaped by its Medium-Term
Strategy (MTS), 2008-2012. The launch
of the MTS in 2008 coincided with the
onset of the fuel, food, and financial crises, which had a major impact on regional member countries (RMCs). The Bank
responded swiftly and flexibly to the
pressing needs of its clients during this

xviiperiod. It frontloaded resources, restructured its loan portfolio, and offered fastdisbursing instruments to helo RMCs
cope with the short-term effects and to
reduce the longer-term impacts. Total
Bank Group lending amounted to UA 8.06
billion in 2009 - an increase of 160.3 percent over the 2007 level, and far higher
than had been originally planned, prior
to the onset of the crisis.

Between 2008 and 2010, the Bank’s total
investment in the core priority areas of
infrastructure, private sector development,
governance, and higher education, technology, and vocational training amounted
to 88.4 percent of the Bank’s commitments. Of the total investments in the
core areas, sovereign infrastructure operations during this period accounted for 51.3
percent; private sector, 25.0 percent; and
governance, about 22.0 percent. This is
broadly in line with the thrust of the MTS.
However, operations approved for higher
education, science and technology (HEST)
were less than 2.0 percent of the total
lending, and this needs to be addressed.

 

The rapid expansion of private sector operations, including those in lowincome countries, has characterized the
Bank's activities since 2008. A review
of the Bank’s policy for Private Sector
Development is underway, and this will
help to fine-tune interventions for the
short term. Work has continued in fragile
states, with Bank Group support proving
crucial to countries’ economic and social
stability. Investments in regional operations constituted 14.0 percent of total Bank
Group lending during the 2008-2010 period, in accordance with MTS expectations.

During the year under review, the Bank
Group maintained its focus on the core
operational areas of infrastructure development; private sector development; governance; higher education, technology
and vocational training. The attention given to these four core areas enabled the
Bank to scale up its support for regional
integration, fragile states, middle-income
countries (MICs), and agricultural and rural

xviii

development. The crosscutting themes
of gender, environment, climate change,
and knowledge management were also
mainstreamed into its operational agenda.

One of the Bank’s achievements during
the year 2010 was the strengthening of
its capital base, as detailed below. It was
also a year of consolidation, with the Bank
implementing its corporate reforms in
order to improve its performance, the
quality of its operations, and its development effectiveness. The Bank also
enhanced its role as a center of excellence for knowledge development and
management, while serving as the preeminent voice on Africa’s development issues
in international fora, for example at the
KOAFEC meeting in September and at the
G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010.

Resource Mobilization

A milestone during the year was resource
mobilization, as the Bank tripled its capi‘al resources through a 200 percent Sixth
General Capital Increase (GCI-VI). This
substantial increase will allow the Bank to
sustain a high level of lending, in response
‘o an overwhelming demand from its
RMCs. The GCI-VI raised the Bank’s
authorized capital from UA 24.00 bilion (US$ 35.00 billion) to UA 67.69 bilion (US$ 100.00 billion). Furthermore,
he Bank Group secured a 10.6 percent
increase in contributions from State
Participants for the ADF-12 replenishment. This brings the ADF-12 replenishment level to UA 6.10 billion (US$ 9.50 bilion) for the three-year period 2011-2013.

hrough its strategic partnerships at both
international and regional levels, the Bank
as leveraged additional funding. As a
result, cofinancing accelerated, reaching
UA 19.16 billion in 2009, with the Bank
contributing 20.3 percent. In 2010, a total
of 28 cofinancing projects were approved
for UA 8.41 billion, with the Bank Group
contributing UA 1.28 billion.

 

The Bank Group’s Operational Activities
Bank Group total approvals in 2010
reached UA 4.10 billion, which is a

decrease from the peak of UA 8.06 billion recorded in the previous year. This
signaled a return to a more regular lending volume as the global financial crisis
receded. Nonetheless, approvals in 2010
were 16.1 percent higher than in 2008.

In terms of the financing from the Bank
Group windows, (i) the ADB approved
UA 2.58 billion (63.0 percent) (of which
UA 1.21 billion was for private sector operations), (ii) the ADF approved UA 1.46
billion (35.5 percent), and (iii) the NTF
approved UA 29.5 million (0.7 percent).
The Special Funds (covering the African
Water Facility, the Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation Initiative, and the Global
Environment Facility) accounted for UA
32.4 million (0.8 percent) of the approvals.

The distribution of total approvals among
he various sectors during 2010 reflected the Bank’s adherence to its policy of
selectivity, project focus and effectiveness. It also aligned to the rising demand
or infrastructure support from RMCs.
n line with the Medium-Term Strategy
(MTS), infrastructure ranked first, with
an approvals’ allocation of UA 2.60 bilion (70.9 percent), followed by finance
(mostly comprising private sector operaions) with UA 319.9 million (8.7 percent),
hen multisector (which includes support for governance and public sector
management, etc.) with UA 301.2 milion (8.2 percent). These three sectors
jointly accounted for 87.8 percent of the
otal operational loans and grants (see
Figure 0.1).

The emphasis on infrastructure reveals
he Bank's selectivity in targeting highimpact projects that will create an enaling climate for private sector investment, improve competitiveness and productivity in its RMCs, enhance employment opportunities, and support sustainable economic growth.

 

Bank Group loan and grant approvals
for the five subregions (including multinational projects) totaled UA 3.67 billion,
compared to UA 7.51 billion approved in

East Africa, UA 560.3 million (15.2 percent); Southern Africa, UA 492.8 million
(13.4 percent); Central Africa, UA 234.6
million (6.4 percent); and multinational,
UA 319.1 million (8.7 percent).

African Development Bank (ADB)

The approvals from the non-concessionary ADB window in 2010 totaled UA 2.58
billion for 59 operations, compared to
UA 5.60 billion in 2009 for 84 operations, which is a 53.9 percent decrease.
Notwithstanding, the approvals level for
2010 was 42.8 percent higher than that of
2008. Project lending and private equity
participation declined from UA 3.94 billion in 2009 to UA 2.30 billion in 2010,
representing a decrease of 41.6 percent.
Similarly, policy-based lending decreased
significantly over the same period, from
UA 1.52 billion to UA 128.6 million.

With respect to grants, these decreased
from UA 251 million in 2009 to UA 11.0
million in 2010. Regarding debt relief
to support low-income countries, the
Bank’s allocation under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative increased by 27.7 percent
from UA 112.8 in 2009 to UA 144.1 million
in 2010. The distribution of ADB approv

als in 2010 by financing instrument shows
that project lending and private equity
participations accounted for the greatest
share, at 89.0 percent, while debt relief
accounted for 5.6 percent, policy-based
lending for 5.0 percent, and grants for
0.4 percent.

During the year, private sector operations
increased slightly to UA 1.21 billion, compared with UA 1.16 billion in 2009. The
share of private sector operations in ADB
and Bank Group total approvals in 2010
stood at 46.7 percent and 29.4 percent
respectively. Private, non-publicly guaranteed project loans and lines of credit
(LOCs) jointly accounted for UA 1.02 billion of total ADB approvals, while private
equity accounted for UA 189.9 million.
In general, the project loans were used
for accelerating economic growth and
reducing poverty, while the LOCs aimed
at deepening domestic financial markets
for onlending to small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs). Bank Group investments in many sizeable multinational
projects and programs took the form of
loans, LOCs, and private equity; these
supported economic cooperation and
regional integration, thereby improving
the investment climate in the continent.

 

 

 

Disbursements from the ADB window
in 2010 amounted to UA 1.34 billion,

which is a 43.0 percent decrease from
the UA 2.35 billion disbursed in 2009.
As at December 31, 2010, cumulative
disbursements (including nonsovereign
loans) totaled UA 21.31 billion. By yearend, 810 loans had been fully disbursed
for an amount of UA 18.75 billion, representing 88.0 percent of cumulative disbursements.

African Development Fund (ADF)

ADF total approvals in 2010 amounted to
UA 1.46 billion, compared with UA 2.43
billion in 2009. The two main beneficiary
sectors were infrastructure, which attracted UA 1.10 billion (77.1 percent) and multisector, with UA 214.8 million (15.1 percent).
This is consistent with the the MediumTerm Strategy’s emphasis on investing
in high-impact areas, which will boost
growth and encourage investment flows.

Disbursements of ADF loans and grants
otaled UA 1.117 billion in 2010, compared to UA 1.73 billion in 2009, which
represents a decrease of 32.4 percent.
Cumulative disbursements at endDecember 2010 amounted to UA 14.77
billion. A total of 1,673 loans and grants
were fully disbursed, amounting to UA
1.75 billion, which represents 80.0 percent
of cumulative disbursements.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)

During the year, one loan amounting to
UA 0.7 million was approved under the
‘TF window for Sierra Leone. In addition,
UA 28.8 million was approved as debt
relief under the HIPC Initiative for Liberia.

TF disbursements increased to UA 5.02
million in 2010, from UA 4.87 million in
2009, representing a rise of 3.1 percent.
By end-December 2010, cumulative
disbursements amounted to UA 226.7
million. Altogether, 61 loans were fully
disbursed for a total UA 205.3 million,
representing 91.0 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

 

xixInstitutional Reforms and
Development Effectiveness

Improved Coordination and Corporate
Performance: The Senior Management
Coordinating Committee (SMCC) has a
pivotal role in ensuring that the Bank
Group’s corporate functions operate
with optimal efficiency and effectiveness. It also arbitrates cross-Complex
resource allocations in line with strategic priorities. In addition, the Operations
Committee (OpsCom) has stepped up
its efforts to ensure quality-at-entry in
operations, which includes strengthening
the upstream peer review and country
team structures.

Budget Reforms: |n January 2010, the
Bank launched its Unit of Account (UA)
Budgeting system which is a key component of Phase II of the ongoing budget reforms. UA Budgeting has further
decentralized budget management and
has also introduced a more rigorous staff
planning process aimed at better alignment of staff numbers and profiles to
Work Program needs.

Decentralization: By year-end 2010,
the Bank had signed Host Country
Agreements for its targeted 26 field offices, of which 23 are fully equipped and
functional, with differing levels of staffing mix. A comprehensive revision of the
Delegation of Authority Matrix was carried
out during the year under review, which
empowered field offices with the authority to negotiate, sign and administer loans,
manage portfolios, supervise projects, and
dialogue with RMCs and partners.

 

Operations Business Processes: As part of
its ongoing efforts to improve operations
business processes, the Bank undertook
an organizational fine-tuning exercise
to set up and/or streamline those units
responsible for sharpening the Bank’s
strategic focus, reinforcing its mandate,
and supporting its Managing for Results
agenda. This exercise included: establishing the Energy, Environment, and Climate
Change (ONEC) department and the

xX

new Strategy Office (STRG) within the
Presidency; as well as placing the Quality
and Results (ORQR) department within the oversight of the Chief Operating
Officer. The Bank also put in place a “One
Bank” Results Measurement Framework
(RMF), which will review progress at
four levels: (i) development outcomes
in Africa; (ii) contribution to development
outcomes; (iii) operational effectiveness;
and (iv) organizational efficiency.

Knowledge Development
and Management

Operational Knowledge

Knowledge derived from the Bank’s
operational activities provides lessons
to guide the Bank’s future interventions
and improve its efficiency and development effectiveness. In this regard, the
knowledge development products can
be grouped into three categories: (i)
economic and sector work (ESW), (ii)
strategic products and events, and (iii)
operational lessons and best practices.
Examples of all three types of knowledge
products are given below.

The ESW undertaken in 2010 included
a portfolio review of the “Evaluation of
Public Revenue Potential” in Senegal.
This review revealed that between 2009
and 2010, adequate institutional arrangements and enhanced training in financial management and procurement for
Project Implementation Units resulted
in a number of positive outcomes. For
example, there were significant reductions in time-lines for processing procurement documents and in the number
of projects at risk, which led to improvements in project effectiveness. There was
also an overall increase in disbursement
and supervision rates.

Turning to the second category of strategic knowledge products, a number
of thematic background studies were
undertaken to feed into the preparation
of the Regional Integration Strategy
Paper (RISP) for Southern Africa, 2011
2015. These in-depth studies, conducted
through a wide consultative process with
stakeholders in the subregion, related to:
(i) trade performance, challenges, and
opportunities; (ii) economic performance
of countries in the subregion; (iii) private
sector financing of infrastructure; and (iv)
development in the sectors of transportation, energy, and ICT.

As an example of the third category of
operational knowledge development, a
review of private sector development in
Gabon furnished a number of recommendations for the Bank to consider:

a) ultifaceted support needs to be
given to streamlining private enterrise structures, so as to improve
heir performance, thereby reducing
costs and boosting their productivity.
ii) ~The quality of appraisal reports
should be improved through a clariication of objectives and activities,
and by the preparation of detailed
implementation schedules.
nstitutional support should be provided, including the training of project managers before the official
launch of projects, to strengthen
he capacity for procurement and
or the supervision of works.

he physical and financial monitoring of projects should be enhanced.

(iv)

 

Research and Capacity Building
Development Research: Significant progress has been made in enhancing the
Bank's visibility through the mainstreaming of knowledge development in Bank
Group operations. The process encompasses the following:

* research on the development challenges facing the continent;

* strengthening the network of economists through more frequent interactions, and professional exchange
(seminars and workshops); and

* increased collaboration with the
Operations Complexes, especially in
the preparation of knowledge products related to ESW.

Annual Report 2010The Bank made a major contribution
to policy dialogue in RMCs during the
year, providing analytical and policy
support to the Committee of Ten (C-10)
African Ministers of Finance and Central
Bank Governors. This helped to build an
African consensus for the Third KoreaAfrica Economic Cooperation (KOAFEC)
meeting in September 2010 and the G-20
Summit in Korea in November. In addition,
the Bank made significant improvements
to the quality of its flagship reports, the
African Economic Outlook (AEO), the
African Development Report (ADR),
and the African Competitiveness Report
(ACR), which provide useful information
for development policy analysis.

Capacity Building and Training in RMCs:
Activities in this area centered on the two
key pillars of the Bank Group Capacity
Development (CD) Strategy, namely:
Pillar 1 - enhancing the development
effectiveness of Bank Group operations;
and Pillar 2 - strengthening the capacity
of RMCs for policy design and development management. Altogether, 1,395 participants attended the Bank's seminars
and workshops delivered under Pillars |
and Il of the CD Strategy.

Statistical Capacity Building and Data
Dissemination in Support of Results
Measurement: The statistical activities of
the Bank focused on: (i) building capac

ity in 52 RMCs, five subregional organizations, and six regional training centers,
(ii) mainstreaming results measurement
in Bank operations, including developing
the Data Portal (DP); and (iii) deepening
collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral partners for the coordination of
statistical activities in the region. During
the year, the Bank collaborated with the
Economic Commission of Africa (ECA),
the African Union Commission (AUC),
and the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) in preparing the 2070
MDGs Progress Report for Africa. The
Bank also continued to coordinate the
data collection under the International
Comparison Program (ICP) statistical initiative in RMCs. In addition, the process
of preparing Country Statistical Profiles
(CStPs) was launched, to provide the necessary baseline data for country programming in the Bank’s Data Portal. To this end,
nine CStPs and one Regional Integration
Statistical Profile (RIStP) were prepared.

Support to Fragile States

Under the Fragile States Facility (FSF), the
Bank approved UA 110.7 million for budget support, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of basic infrastructure, governance,
capacity building, and human resource
development in six states (Burundi,
Guinea Bissau, Democratic Republic of

Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Togo).
The results from these commitments cannot yet be fully quantified, partly because
they are at differing stages of implementation. However, early indicators show
improvements in Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings
and in portfolio performance indicators,
such as disbursement ratios and the number of operations supervised.

At the final ADF-12 replenishment consultations in September 2010, the ADF
Deputies agreed to a replenishment
amount of UA 764.0 million to be transferred to the FSF, for the ADF-12 period
(2011-2013). Then in October, the Bank
operationalized the Zimbabwe Multidonor
Trust Fund (the Zim-Fund). By the end of
December, an estimated UA 26.6 million
(US$ 42.0 million) had been paid into the
fund by donors.

Support to
Middle-Income Countries

During the year, the Bank Group's approvals for operations in middle-income countries (MICs) (excluding multinational projects and programs) amounted to UA
1.88 billion. Although this falls below the
2009 level, it represents an increase of
69.4 percent over 2008, thereby reflecting the Bank’s commitment to enhance
its engagement in MICs.

The sectoral distribution for Bank Group
lending to MICs in 2010 confirms infrastructure to be the largest recipient,
attracting 72.7 percent of all financing, followed by industry (7.9 percent),
social (7.7 percent), finance (7.1 percent),
and multisector (4.6 percent). The geographic distribution of financing to MICs
shows that North Africa accounted for
the largest share (78.3 percent), while
Southern Africa received 21.7 percent.
Regarding financing instruments, project lending continued to predominate in
2010, accounting for 92.8 percent of total
approvals for MICs, compared to the 65.3
percent share in 2009. On the other hand,

 

xxithere was a significant decline in policybased loans, from 34.1 percent in 2009
to 6.9 percent in 2010. Grants from the
MIC Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF),
the African Water Facility (AWF), and the
Special Relief Fund (SRF) represented

a marginal 0.4 percent of the financing.

2011 Administrative
Expenses and Capital
Expenditure Budgets

In December 2010, the ADB Board of
Directors approved an Administrative
Expenses and Capital Expenditure
Budget for 2011 comprised as follows:
Administrative Expenses of UA 289.1
million, a Capital Expenditure of UA
40.0 million, and a contingency budget of UA 2.9 million. The ADF Board
of Directors approved an indicative
Administrative Budget of UA 201.3 million for the Fund for the financial year
ending December 31, 2011.

Income Allocation and
Distribution

The 2010 financial statements highlight
the robustness of the Bank Group’s financial position. Despite the volatile market
conditions and a low interest rate environment experienced in 2010, the Bank
generated a level of income reasonably
comparable to the strong results of 2009.
The Bank earned income before distributions approved by the Board of Governors
of UA 213.7 million and allocable income
of UA 236.1 million in 2010, compared to
the income before distribution of UA 231.2
million and allocable income of UA 238.7
million earned in 2009. Distribution from
income for other development initiatives
in the Bank’s regional member countries
is approved by the Board of Governors,
typically at the Annual Meetings.

Having been satisfied that adequate provisions have been made to reserve, the
Board of Governors, during the Annual
Meetings in May 2010, approved an allo
xxii

cation of UA 27.8 million from the 2009
income to Surplus Account. The Board of
Governors also approved the distributions
from the 2009 allocable income to the
following development initiatives: (i) UA
50.0 million for ADF-11; (ii) UA 66.0 million for the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) Special Account; and (iii) UA 5.0
million for the Technical Assistance
Fund for the Middle Income Countries.
During the course of 2010, the Board of
Governors also approved income distribution from the Surplus Account to
other development initiatives for a total
amount of UA 25.4 million. In addition,
the Governors approved the distribution
of UA 0.3 million from the 2009 income
of NTF to the HIPC initiative.

Credit Ratings

The ratings agencies, Standard & Poor’s,
Moody’s, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan
Credit Rating Agency reaffirmed their
AAA and AA+ rating of the African
Development Bank’s senior and subordinated debt, respectively, with a stable outlook. Their ratings reflect the Bank’s strong
membership support, its preferred creditor
status, sound capital adequacy, and prudent financial management and policies.
Ratings agencies have noted positively
the approval by the Board of Governors in
May 2010 to triple the Bank’s capital base
as asign of strong shareholder support for
its develooment mandate, and growing
franchise value in the continent.

Borrowings

The 2010 funding program in capital
markets was approved for a maximum
amount of UA 3.62 billion, including up
to UA 140.0 million under the Enhanced
Private Sector Assistance for Africa
(EPSA) initiative. The Bank raised UA
2.82 billion during the year, including UA
14.9 million under the EPSA initiative. At
December 31, 2010, the outstanding borrowing portfolio of the Bank stood at UA
11.98 billion.

The Bank has used various markets
and instruments to meet its borrowing requirements. The Bank issued its
annual USD 1 billion global bond transacions during the year in February. Private
lacements, uridashi transactions (public
issues sold to the Japanese retail market),
hemed bond transactions (described
elow), and African currency-linked
ionds in Zambian Kwacha complete the
range of markets utilized in 2010.

Themed Bond Transactions
The retail bond market in Japan has seen
a flurry of activity where investors wish
0 invest in bond issues that have a social
heme and carry top-notch credit ratings. In 2010, the Bank established its
own niche by issuing bonds under the
hemes of clean energy, education, and
water. During the year, the Bank issued 16
hemed bond transactions, with maturiies ranging from 3 to 10 years, raising
UA 398.9 million to support projects in
hese priority areas. Of this total, UA 261.5
million was issued as clean energy/green
jonds; UA 98.1 million as bonds linked to
education; and UA 39.3 million as bonds
inked to water.

 

Under the terms of these bond issues,
he Bank will use its best efforts to direct
an amount equal to the net proceeds to
rojects related to the relevant theme,
subject to and in accordance with the
Bank’s lending standards. Further, it is
specified that the proceeds of the bonds
will be included in the ordinary capital
resources of the Bank and will be used
for the general operations of the Bank.

This chapter provides an economic overview of Africa during 2010 and the short-term outlook. It outlines progress on the
implementation of the Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012) and highlights some of the Bank's major achievements to date.
These include: its swiftness and flexibility in responding to the fuel, food, and financial crises; the institution's role in representing

a unified voice for Africa in G-20 deliberations; and the new resources mobilized under the GCI-VI and the ADF-12 for the
continent's growth and development. The chapter also highlights some of the emerging socioeconomic and political risks and

their potential impacts for the future.

OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMIC
SITUATION AND OUTLOOK

Africa's recovery from the global economic and financial crisis is now well underway. Real GDP growth rose from 3.1 percent in 2009 at the height of the financial
crisis, to a level of 4.9 percent in 2010. It
is projected to fall to 3.7 percent in 2011
as aresult of the emerging sociopolitical
unrest in some RMCs, before recovering
to 5.8 percent in 2012 (see Table 1.1).

The observed GDP growth in 2010 has
been driven by higher domestic demand,
stronger export revenues, and increased
inflows of foreign direct investment,

remittances, and aid. The growth performance is most pronounced in resourcerich countries that can benefit from the
revival in commodity demand, oil and
non-oil commodity prices, and trade.
Oil-exporting countries, such as Nigeria,
are expected to experience economic
expansion with GDP growth of around
6.9 percent in 2011, but with a moderate decline to 6.7 percent in 2012. Some
non-oil commodity exporters, such as
Zambia and Botswana, are also likely to
show strong growth of about 6.5 and up
to 7.0 percent in 2011 and 2012 respectively, as gains from high export prices
and volumes offset losses from higher
oil and food import bills.

Inflation in Africa reduced from 10 percent in 2009 to an estimated 7.7 percent
in 2010. Forecasts indicate a rise to 8.4
percent in 2011 before improving to 7.4
percent in 2012. Inflation may, however,
worsen if food and fuel prices continue
their recent hikes.

As a result of the economic recovery and
prudent fiscal policies, Africa’s fiscal deficit
of 5.2 percent of GDP in 2009 narrowed
to 3.3 percent in 2010. This is expected
to widen to 3.9 percent in 2011 as a result
of the sociopolitical environment, before
improving to 3.2 percent in 2012. However,
several oil-importing countries, such as
Kenya and Senegal, will continue to record

Annual Report 2010high budget deficits in the short term. For
example, forecasts for Kenya’s fiscal balance indicate deficits of 6.8 and 71 percent in 2011 and 2012 respectively, while
Senegal’s deficit is also projected to widen
to 6.9 percent in 2011, before narrowing to
6.3 percent in 2012. These deficits could
deteriorate further where governments
are responding to higher food and oil prices by increasing subsidies. Overall, Africa’s
current account balance improved from
a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to
a surplus of 0.4 percent in 2010. However,
this surplus is projected to turn to a deficit
of 0.2 percent in 2011, before improving to
a surplus of 0.2 percent in 2012.

Trade and current accounts have improved
in resource-rich countries due to the
rebound in commodity prices and rising
export volumes. At the same time, higher
oil and food import bills are contributing
to a worsening of external balances in
resource-poor countries, and food security in these countries could become a
major problem. While oil-exporting countries tend to run current account surpluses, oil-importers tend to post deficits.

Overview of the Economic Situation and the Role of the Bank Chapter 1

Table 1.1 provides a summary of the macroeconomic indicators and outlook for
the continent over the period 1990-2012.
A more detailed analysis of the macroeconomic situation and prospects for
Africa is presented in the Bank's African
Economic Outlook 2011.

Subregional Macroeconomic
Indicators, 2010

All the five subregions in Africa achieved
higher growth in 2010, averaging 4.9 percent, compared to 3.1 percent in 2009.
Nonetheless, the recession has undoubtedly left its mark and for most African
economies, growth has yet to return
to pre-crisis levels. The economies that
are most open to trade (e.g., commodity exporters), which slowed markedly in
2009, benefited from revived commodity
prices and trade in 2010, and recorded a
relatively sharp V-shaped recovery. The
rebound in several low-income countries
and fragile states was more muted. Overall,
more than half the African economies grew
at a lower rate in 2010 than during the
period 2001-2008.

Over the course of the year, Africa’s
economic performance varied considerably across subregions and countries
(see Table 1.2). The West Africa and East
Africa subregions recorded the highest
real GDP growth rates of 6.7 and 6.2 percent respectively in 2010. This mirrored
a similar growth performance to 2009,
when East Africa’s GDP growth was 5.7
percent, and West Africa’s was 5.6 percent.
These two subregions represent the fastest-growing groupings of countries on the
continent. North Africa and Central Africa
posted real GDP growth rates of 4.6 and
4.7 percent respectively. The lowest real
GDP growth in 2010 was recorded for the
Southern Africa subregion, at 3.3 percent.
However, this masks the fact that the subregion experienced the strongest rebound
of 3.8 percent in its real GDP growth rate
between 2009 and 2010 (from a negative
growth rate of 0.5 percent in 2009).

Consumer price inflation remained in single digits in four of the five subregions for
the year under review. The exception was
West Africa, where it increased marginally from 10.3 percent in 2009 to 10.4 percent in 2010. Significant decreases were

recorded over the same timeframe in East
Africa (from 16.7 percent to 9.3 percent)
and in Central Africa (from 10.0 percent
to 5.5 percent). In terms of fiscal balance,
Central Africa was the only subregion that
achieved a surplus (0.5 percent) in 2010,
while the others recorded deficits.

The current account position improved
in all subregions except East Africa,
over the period 2009-2010; however,
only two subregions recorded surpluses. West Africa’s surplus improved from
6.4 percent to 7.0 percent, while North
Africa’s improved from 0.1 percent to
3.2 percent. Two subregions continued
to record deficits but at a reduced level.
In Central Africa the deficit narrowed
from 6.0 percent to 3.1 percent, while
in Southern Africa it reduced from 5.7
percent to 3.1 percent during the same
timeframe. For East Africa, however, the
deficit widened from 7.4 percent in 2009
to 8.3 percent in 2010.

 

Risks to the Socioeconomic Outlook
Major risks to the African economic outlook are emerging. These relate to the
drivers of global recovery and to the
demand for minerals and hydrocarbons,
as well as the state of the world food
market. While grain prices are still below
their historic peaks, the recent rises in
food and fuel prices give cause for concern. Furthermore, food price hikes and
the economic slowdown in low-income
countries could impose extreme hardship
on already vulnerable populations, which
could trigger or exacerbate sociopolitical
unrest, thus further curtailing economic
growth.

The recent political upheavals in the last
quarter of 2010, which spilled over to 2011,
in countries such as Céte d'Ivoire, Tunisia,
Egypt, and Libya, are likely to slow the
economic growth not only of these economies, but also of neighboring countries. In
particular, if the crisis in Cote d’lvoire deepens, it is likely to have regional repercussions, especially for countries like Burkina
Faso, Mali, and Niger - through financial
transfers, investment, trade, and foreign

exchange reserves of the Central Bank of
West African States (BCEAO). Similarly,
the emerging political changes in North
Africa are generating the so-called “domino effect,” with the unrest spreading widely to engulf other states in the subregion.

These major events in West and North
Africa may lead to production losses, the
undermining of investor confidence, and
a severe contraction in tourism, which is
a major revenue earner for countries like
Tunisia and Egypt. The severity and longevity of the resulting slowdown will, toa
large extent, depend on how quickly the
political situation stabilizes, and how long
it takes for investor confidence to return,
along with the inflow of tourists. These
countries also face budgetary pressures
and growing social demands, for example,
to create employment opportunities for
the youth and to improve living standards
of the poor, all of which will require the
Bank’s targeted support.

There is, therefore, a need for the Bank
and development partners to support the
governments involved in these crises to
accelerate the process of economic recovery and to create jobs and opportunities,
particularly for the urban youth and college graduates. The priority areas for Bank
support could include: fast-disbursing
budget support programs to tackle the
social problems related to youth unemployment; to assist the poorest population
in the least favored regions of the country;
as well as to support governance reforms
in the form of increased transparency,
democratic elections, and anticorruption
policies. More importantly, greater attention should be paid to the issues of social
inclusion, such as the establishment of
social safety-nets for the most vulnerable
segments of the population.

THE ROLE OF THE BANK

The Bank’s Operational Core Areas. The
Bank Group’s operational focus is guided by its Medium-Term Strategy (MTS),
2008-2012. The launch of the MTS in

2008 coincided with the onset of the
fuel, food, and financial crises. The Bank
displayed swiftness and flexibility in
responding to the evolving needs of its
clients during this period. It frontloaded
resources, restructured its loan portfolio, and offered fast-disbursing instruments to help RMCs cope with the shortterm effects and to reduce the longerterm impacts. Total Bank Group lending amounted to UA 8.06 billion in 2009,
an increase of 160.3 percent over that
of 2007, and far higher than originally
planned, prior to the onset of the crises.

Between 2008 and 2010, the Bank's total
investment in the MTS core priority areas
of infrastructure, private sector development, governance, and higher education, technology, and vocational training, amounted to 88.4 percent of the
Bank’s total commitments. Of the total
investments in the core areas, sovereign
infrastructure operations accounted for
51.3 percent; private sector, 25.0 percent;
and governance, about 22.0 percent.
This broadly aligns to the operational
selectivity outlined in the MTS. However,
approvals for higher education, science
and technology (HEST) were less than
2.0 percent of total lending. While this is
a new area of intervention for the Bank,
nonetheless this needs to be urgently
addressed, given the importance of HEST
to bolster Africa's competitiveness.

Bank resources leveraged additional
funding with its strategic partners during 2008-2010. Cofinancing accelerated,
reaching UA 19.16 billion in 2009, with the
Bank contributing 20.3 percent. However,
in 2010 total cofinancing decreased to
UA 8.41 billion, with the Bank contributing 15.2 percent.

The rapid expansion of private sector
operations, including in low-income countries, has been a significant characteristic of the Bank’s activities since 2008. A
review of the Bank’s policy for Private
Sector Development is underway, and will
help fine-tune interventions for the short
term. Work continues in fragile states,

Annual Report 2010with Bank Group support proving crucial
to countries’ economic and social stability.
Investments in regional operations constituted 14.0 percent of total Bank Group
lending during the 2008-2010 period, in
accordance with the MTS.

A Voice for Africa. During 2008-2010, the
Bank took the initiative of bringing together African Finance Ministers and Central
Bank Governors to consider Africa’s
response to the crises, to provide advice
to African Heads of State and Government,
and to input African perspectives into the
G-20 discussions. The resulting Committee
of Ten (C10) continues to meet regularly to
discuss economic priorities for Africa and
strategies for the continent’s engagement
with the rest of the world.

Knowledge Development and Management. The Bank has stepped up its role
in knowledge development and management, and in disseminating the results of
its research as widely as possible. Its flagship publications rank among the leading sources of information on African
development, eliciting broad collaboration from, among others, the OECD, the
World Bank, and the World Economic
Forum. The African Economic Conference,
organized jointly by the Bank and ECA,
is now a major international forum for
African development.

Annual Report 2010

Overview of the Economic Situation and the Role of the Bank Chapter 1

The “One Bank” Framework and Institutional Reforms. As the global financial crisis emerged in late 2008, it soon
became apparent that the demand for
Bank resources exceeded available funds.
Coincident with the increase in lending
operations, negotiations for a General
Capital Increase began, concluding in
mid-2010 with a 200 percent increase
in the GCI-Vl. Concurrently, ADF-12
Replenishment consultations were taking place, which concluded in September
2010 with an agreement to increase the
level by 10.6 percent over the ADF-11 level.
The simultaneity of the two exercises, the
GCI-V| and the ADF-12, highlights the
interdependence of the Bank’s two main
windows and the importance of the “One
Bank” concept.

Turning to its corporate agenda, during
2008-2010, the Bank Group implemented
a number of institutional reforms and
policies and undertook a fine-tuning of
its management structure. More progress is now required, in particular, to
deepen decentralization and to tailor it
to particular country circumstances. The
move toward a policy- and outcomesbased approach, rather than instrumentled, has important implications for Bank
Group policies and operations, which
will be addressed over the next few
years. Country Strategy Papers (CSPs)
are becoming more formalized, and will
be adjusted further to ensure the main
streaming of private sector operations.
The introduction of the new Regional
Integration Strategy Papers (RISPs) reinforce selectivity and prioritization.

The Way Ahead. Current events in some
RMCs underline the challenges of development for Africa and the Bank. The process of adjustment to changing circumstances and to new demands will require
the Bank to show the same flexibility and
responsiveness going forward as it has
done in the past. Now that the global
financial crisis has receded, the Bank
needs to refocus on its core business of
addressing the structural bottlenecks to
Africa’s economic growth. These include:
the massive infrastructure deficit; shallow and fragmented markets (due to
limited integration); the paucity of skills
needed to build a competitive economy; weak institutions and poor governance; building capable states; promoting
private sector development; economic
diversification; and the long-term challenges of climate change and energy
generation. The Bank has a role to play
in further integrating climate change
mitigation measures into its interventions, and mainstreaming action, in collaboration with its development partners. In this respect, the Bank has been
asked by African leaders to host a “Green
Fund for Africa,” to mobilize resources
for renewable energy projects across
the continent.Chapter two

During 2010, the Bank Group continued to implement its Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012) by targeting the four core areas of
infrastructure development, private sector development, governance, and higher education, technology, and vocational training
This enabled the Bank to scale up its support for regional integration, fragile states, middle-income countries (MICs), and agricultural
and rural development. The crosscutting themes of gender, environment, climate change, and knowledge management were
mainstreamed into its operational activities. The institution also consolidated its role as a knowledge bank for the continent, not
only by widely disseminating research findings, publishing flagship reports, and updating its Data Portal, but also by undertaking
economic and sector work (ESW), and eliciting lessons learned to guide its future operations. The Bank’s role in articulating
a coordinated African voice at major international fora was underscored by its active participation at the Third Korea-Africa
Economic (KOAFEC) meeting in September and later at the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November. A further major achievement
during the year was resource mobilization, as the Bank tripled its capital resources through a 200 percent Sixth General Capital
Increase (GCI-V1), while securing a 10.6 percent increase in contributions from State Participants for the ADF-12 replenishment. The
Bank also continued to enhance its partnership and cooperation activities with other key players in Africa’s development agenda

INTRODUCTION

The year 2010 was one of operational consolidation and highly successful resource mobilization for the Bank
Group. Operational consolidation meant
that the institution strengthened its
focus on country ownership and performance criteria, the establishment of
new financing facilities, addressing the
challenge of climate change, and on
knowledge creation and dissemination.

During the year the Bank concluded
a 200 percent Sixth General Capital
Increase (GCI-VI), which significantly
raised its authorized capital from UA
24.0 billion (US$ 35.0 billion) to UA
67.69 billion (US$ 100.0 billion). This was
accompanied by an agreement by State
Participants to set the ADF-12 replenishment level at UA 6.10 billion (US$
9.50 billion) for the three-year period
2011-2013.

This major increase in the resource
base of the Bank Group was one of
the Bank Group’s landmark achievements during 2010. Others include the
conceptualization and approval of a
number of key operational strategies
and policy documents, including: the
Bank Group Capacity Development
Strategy, the Legal Note Concerning the
Implementation of the Fragile States

10

Facility, the Bank Group Agriculture
Sector Strategy 2010-2014, and the
Bank’s equity participation in the African
Agriculture Fund (AAF), among others.

The Bank's successful implementation of
targeted operational policy reforms and
its establishment of special facilities over
the past few years have upgraded the
quality-at-entry of Bank Group operations, as well as its delivery capacity,
thereby boosting development effectiveness and results on the ground.

DEVELOPMENT
EFFECTIVENESS AND
MANAGING FOR RESULTS

The “One-Bank” Results

Measurement Framework (RMF)

The Bank has made steady improvements in the use of Results Measurement
Frameworks (RMFs) to assess the performance of its three financing windows: the ADB, the ADF, and the NTF.
In September 2010, the Bank adopted
the “One Bank” RMF, founded on the
tenet that the planning, monitoring, and
assessing of results should be implemented as a continuum across all areas
and sectors of the institution. The RMF
includes indicators to measure policybased operations, regional operations,
and private sector operations as part of

a single reporting framework that covers
all the Bank’s interventions. By combining output and intermediate outcome
reporting in one single framework, the
new RMF offers a more accurate gauge
of the Bank’s effectiveness in promoting sustained development in RMCs. The
One-Bank RMF also provides the anchorage for the new Annual Development
Effectiveness Report (ADER), which will
be launched in 2011.

Roadmap for Aid Effectiveness

The Bank strives to ensure that its core
effectiveness principles are translated
into concrete actions across the spectrum of its many Complexes and operations. To this end, it is formulating a roadmap to improve its performance on aid
effectiveness, thereby operationalizing its
endorsement of the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda
for Action. The roadmap will set out specific actions to be implemented in five
mutually reinforcing areas: (i) building
corporate priorities and institutional
arrangements; (ii) monitoring the institution’s progress on aid effectiveness; (iii)
reviewing Bank policies, practices, and
incentives; (iv) operationalizing guidance
on policies, processes, and practices; and
(v) extending the Bank's outreach on aid
effectiveness.

Annual Report 2010Managing for

Results at the Country Level

Building RMCs’ capacity to manage for
development results constitutes one
of the three pillars of the Bank Group’s
results agenda. The Bank supported the
establishment in 2007 of the African
Community of Practice on Managing
for Development Results (AfCoPMfDR) as one of the channels to disseminate knowledge and best practice
on how to manage for the sustainability of development results. The AfCoPMfDR comprises more than 1,600 members from 91 countries - 43 of these in
Africa. Members include practitioners
from public administrations, parliament,

Annual Report 2010

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

civil society, the private sector, academia,

the media, and local donors.

During the year, the Bank supported the
creation of eight national Communities
of Practice in Burkina Faso, Céte
d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Kenya, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and
Zimbabwe as autonomous bodies in
partnership with the local Ministries
of Finance and Economy. These
Communities of Practice serve as change
agents to instill the results culture at the
country level and to support national
development processes that will make
their organizations more performanceoriented. In this way it is envisioned that

 

 

they will produce measurable outcomes
in the drive to eradicate poverty.

Managing for Results

at the International Level

The Bank is an active member of several
working groups under the umbrella
of the OECD’s Working Party on Aid
Effectiveness. In this context, it is helping to formulate the agenda of the Fourth
High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness,
which is scheduled to take place in Busan,
Korea, in late 2011. As a contribution to
this agenda, the Bank organized jointly
with NEPAD and the AUC, the Second
Regional Meeting on Aid Effectiveness,
South-South Cooperation and Capacity

Development. This event was held in Tunis
on November 4-5, 2010 and adopted a
new perspective: namely, to promote a
different vision of develooment that puts
finance for development rather than aid at
its core. The meeting was well attended
by about 170 senior representatives from
across Africa, including ministers, senior
government officials, members of parliament, and leaders from civil society
organizations.

Introduction of Quality Assurance and
Results-Oriented Operational Tools

Strengthened Quality-at-Entry Assessment. Substantial progress has been
made in firming up tools and procedures for enhancing the quality-at-entry
of Bank Group operations and country
strategies. Based on the accumulated
experience of the 2009 pilot phase and
Bank-wide consultations, the Readiness
Review (RR) tool was rolled out in 2010
to all lending operations. Furthermore,
quality-at-entry standards and related
technical guidance were developed to
assist project teams in the design of
quality operations, while an RR tool for
assessing the quality-at-entry of Country
Strategy Papers (CSPs) was developed
for implementation in early 2011. A pilot
initiative was launched to promote a better understanding of post-approval readiness issues, especially those related to
delays in first disbursement.

Enhanced Quality and Results Orientation throughout the Project Cycle. To
support results-oriented reporting and
quality project implementation, two
new initiatives were conducted in 2010:
the revision of the results-based logical
framework (RLF) for operations, and the
preparation of revamped Implementation
Progress and Results (IPR) reports. The
newly introduced RLF, simplified and
harmonized with the OECD/DAC results
chain terminology, will facilitate participatory project design and results-based
monitoring throughout the project cycle.
The IPR will promote a project monitoring
approach focused on results, based on

12

quantitative evidence, and on dynamic
and outcome-oriented actions. It will be
supported by a revised project performance rating system. The new approach
will also support the decentralization process and enhance the roles and responsibilities of field offices with respect to
project performance monitoring.

Information Technology (IT) Support.
The Bank has undertaken a number of
initiatives to strengthen its information
systems in support of more dynamic
portfolio management. The SAP functional upgrade is ongoing and will allow
operations to capture information on
the achievement of outputs and outcomes and to report on Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) (e.g., indicators on procurement, disbursement, aging projects,
and intensified risk monitoring) in real
time. In addition to the SAP upgrade, the
Bank is developing a Results Reporting
System to track its contribution to development outcomes.

INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE

During the year under review, Bank Group
approvals by sector continued to reflect
the institution’s alignment to its MediumTerm Strategy (2008-2012), which positions the infrastructure sector as a core
operational area. The Bank selectively
targets high-impact projects in its infrastructure portfolio, to stimulate an investment-friendly climate, strengthen RMCs’
competitiveness and productivity, create
jobs, and promote sustainable economic growth. In particular, the Bank is well
placed to lend its support to large, transboundary infrastructure projects and programs that promote regional integration.

Approvals in 2010 for infrastructure projects amounted to UA 2.60 billion, representing 70.9 percent of all Bank Group
loan and grant approvals for the year - the
largest sectoral allocation. In terms of the
subsectoral breakdown, transportation
attracted the most funding (47.6 percent),

followed by energy supply (34.1 percent),
water supply and sanitation (171 percent)
and communication (1.2 percent) (see
Figure 2.1). The prioritization of infrastructure not only in the MTS, but also in RMCs’
national agendas, demonstrates the crucial role that modern, reliable, and affordable infrastructure plays in achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction.

Support to the Transportation
Subsector in 2010

Transportation infrastructure projects in
Africa face several challenges, exacerbated
largely by the global financial and economic crisis. The overrun of project costs is
acommon problem in many RMCs, and in
extreme cases may threaten the cancelaion of the projects. The Bank continued
its efforts in 2010 to ensure that these projects stayed on track and achieved their
development objectives, for example by
artnering with other donors and providing supplementary loans. The Bank has
also begun to review the practice of project procurement and implementation in
RMCs, to reduce exposure of these projects
0 volatile international construction costs.

Moreover, the Bank started aligning its
ransportation infrastructure portfolio
with the objectives of its Agriculture
Sector Strategy (AgSS) (2010-2014),
which was approved in 2010. Eight road

Annual Report 2010projects approved during the year include
as one of their main objectives the development of RMCs’ agricultural productivity, which should also help to improve
ood security in the region. For instance,
new road projects approved in Burundi,
Ghana, Mozambique, and Zambia are
ocated in areas where over 85 percent
of the population are engaged in agriculture. These projects seek to reduce
ransportation costs, thus lowering the
costs of agricultural inputs, improving
accessibility to markets, and increasing
arm gate prices of products. Through this
approach, road projects frequently boost
agricultural productivity and production,
hereby raising income levels and the living conditions of the rural communities.

While most of the transportation projects approved by the Bank in 2010 target
national or international roads, five provide for the construction of rural roads,
‘0 ensure better connectivity to the main
road network for rural populations. These

 

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

projects also include related activities,
such as the construction of water provision and storage systems, the rehabilitation of rural markets, the creation
of storage infrastructure, as well as the
provision of agro-processing equipment
to local communities (particularly associations of women) in order to reduce
post-harvest losses. The selection and
design of these related activities adopt
a participatory approach, in association
with local communities, to boost ownership of projects and so enhance development outcomes.

The key transportation infrastructure projects approved during the year include:
(i) the South Africa Transnet project (for
railroads, national ports, and pipelines)
(UA 271.3 million); the Morocco TangiersMarrakech Railroad Capacity Increase
project (UA 255.6 million); the Tunisia
Road VI project (UA 198.3 million); and
the Ghana Fulfusio-Sawala Road project
(UA 109.7 million). Box 2.1 contains a brief

description of the Tangiers-Marrakech
Railroad Capacity Increase Project, which
represents the largest single project undertaken to date by the Bank in Morocco.

Other transportation infrastructure projects approved in 2010 include: national
road projects for Benin, Burundi, Kenya,
Mozambique, Senegal, and Togo, as well
as two air transportation sector projects
(DRC and Senegal). Details on all projects
can be found in the Profiles of Projects
and Programs approved during 2010 at
the end of Part |.

Support to ICT Subsector in 2010

Two ICT projects were approved during
the year for a total of UA 32.4 million.
One is for the Satelite O3B multinational
project (UA 32.1 million), which provides
private sector funding for the construction and operation of a constellation of 8
middle earth orbit (MEO) satellites over
Africa. This project is in line with the Bank
Group ICT strategy to promote infrastruc
 

Context: This is the largest approved transportation project in 2010 for an ADB country and the Bank’s largest single project to
date in Morocco. It aligns to the Bank’s Medium-Term Strategy and the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) in its focus on developing
infrastructure to promote economic growth, trade, and the business-enabling environment.

Objective: To improve rail transportation competitiveness, particularly in the freight transportation market between Tangiers
and Marrakech.

Bank’s role: To design, finance, and supervise the project’s implementation in partnership with Morocco’s National Railway
Company (ONCF), which is the executing agency. The Bank will provide funding of UA 255.5 million toward the total project cost
of UA 375.0 million, with ONCF providing the rest.

Timeline: 2011-2016.

Expected Outcomes:

(i) A significant increase in rail travel supply starting in 2016, with an improvement in rail traffic fluidity and increased frequency
of shuttle, mainline, and freight trains;

(ii) Increased population mobility in the project area; and

Ciii) Employment creation (direct and indirect jobs) during the project implementation and operational phases, especially in
the logistic zones created.

ture development and regional integration. The second was the Data Center
Project in Cape Verde, financed with an
MIC grant of UA 0.30 million, to undertake a feasibility study for a Technology
Park in Praia, for enhancing the business
climate through improvement of the ICT
infrastructure in the country.

Support to the

Energy Subsector in 2010

The Bank serves as a lead financier for
energy-related investments in Africa. The
Bank approved UA 887.6 million for 14
new operations in the energy sector during the year. Of these projects, 11 were
public sector operations, for a total commitment of UA 753.5 million. The remaining three, the Dibamba Power Project
in Cameroon, the Tunisia Hasdrubal Oil
and Gas Field Development Project, and
the Cabeolica Wind Power Project in
Cape Verde (see Box 2.2), which jointly

amounted to UA 134.1 million, were private sector operations. The two largest energy projects were the Suez 650
MW Steam Cycle Thermal Power Plant
in Egypt and the Semi-Urban and Rural
Electrification Project in the Democratic
Republic of Congo. Among the other
approved projects were the Tanzania
lringa-Shinyanga Transmission Line,
the Ethiopia Electricity Transmission
System Improvement (two projects), and
the Kenya Power Transmission System
Improvement. The aim of the latter project is to increase both the capacity and
the reliability of the Kenyan energy supply
to address the chronic power shortages.
It will also strengthen the Eastern African
regional power grid, and facilitate power
exchange within the subregion.

The Water Initiatives
In the context of increasing water scarcity
exacerbated by climate change, envi
ronmental degradation, rapid population growth, and urbanization, the Bank
places a high priority on supporting the
water sector. The agricultural sector’s
productive capacity and its ability to
feed the continent’s population relies
on an adequate water supply. Moreover
the resilience of this sector directly
impacts Africa's progress toward other
Millenniurn Development Goals (MDGs),
such as those relating to GDP growth,
poverty, health (including child mortality and maternal health), education, and
gender.

The Bank’s interventions in this area focus
on water resource sustainable development and management across the continent. By year-end 2010, the Bank was
financing 69 ongoing water and sanitation operations in 32 African countries, totaling about UA 1.80 billion. Total
approvals of loans, grants, and special

 

Context: This represents a public-private partnership (PPP) project in an ADF country and is the only renewable energy project

to be approved by the Bank in 2010.

Objective: To utilize the island’s considerable wind and solar resources and increase the use of renewable sources of energy to
50 percent by 2020, thereby helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Project Components: The project comprises the construction and maintenance of four offshore wind farms on Santiago, Séo
Vicente, Sal, and Boa Vista islands with a combined installed capacity of 25.5 MW. The project has five components: (i) towers,
wind turbines, and transformers; (ii) an onsite substation; (iii) a command center; (iv) an underground transmission line linking
the onsite substation to the existing network; and (v) an access road to the project site.

Expected Outcomes:

(i) Contribute to the development of the country’s legal status for PPPs and improve the climate for foreign investment and

development assistance;

(ii) Increase sufficiency in energy requirements by 25 MW of renewable clean power;
Enable the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and benefit from the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); and
Reduce dependence on inefficient and expensive diesel generation units, resulting in reduced cost to consumers.

Annual Report 2010funds for all water and sanitation operations in 2010 amounted to UA 473.6 million. The interventions cover drinking
water supply, water resources management, sanitation and hygiene, capacity
building, and policy reform programs.

Urban Water Supply and Sanitation:
This subsector is targeted by the Bank
through such interventions as rehabilitation and service expansion, reduction of high levels of unaccounted-forwater (UFW), and promoting private
sector activities to address the growing
needs of the urban sector. In 2010, six
new urban and peri-urban water supply
and sanitation programs/projects were

Annual Report 2010

approved for Céte d'Ivoire, Kenya, Liberia,
Mauritania, Morocco, and Sierra Leone, in
addition to one multinational project, for
total financing of UA 371.3 million.

Water Supply & Sanitation to Fragile
States: The Bank has intensified its
engagement in fragile states and, in
collaboration with the Fragile States
Unit, is undertaking a study to develop guidelines and tools for improved
delivery of water supply and sanitation
(WSS) systems in these most vulnerable
countries. During the year under review,
three projects were approved for Céte
d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which
combined ADF and Fragile State Facility

(FSF) funds for a total financing of UA
53.7 million.

The Three Water Initiatives: |n addition
to the above-mentioned projects and
programs, the Bank continues to host
three complementary initiatives: namely,
the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Initiative (RWSSI), the African Water
Facility (AWF), and the Multi-Donor
Water Partnership Program (MDWPP)
Together, these initiatives provide vital
resources for increasing access to safe
water and sanitation, promoting innovative technologies, and supporting
knowledge management activities (see
Box 2.3).

 

15Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

Box 2.3
The Three Water Initiatives

1. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)

The RWSSI remains a flagship initiative, with the objective of accelerating access to safe water and sanitation coverage to 80 percent of the rural population by 2015 at an estimated cost of UA 9.22 billion. Since its inception in 2003, 28 programs/projects
have benefited from RWSSI funds in 22 RMCs, totaling UA 2.6 billion. Of this total, the Bank contributed UA 695.2 million from
ADF/ADB resources, while the RWSSI Trust Fund contributed UA 74.1 million. The remainder was leveraged from other development partners, African governments, and the beneficiary communities.

In 2010, the Bank approved three operations under the RWSSI in Cameroon, Mozambique, and Tanzania for UA 89.8 million, of
which UA 74.3 million was sourced from the ADF and UA 15.5 million from the RWSSI Trust Fund. RWSSI interventions are mainstreamed into governments’ water sector programming, and the initiative also places emphasis on gender throughout the entire
cycle of projects. As of end-2010, over 33 million people had gained access to drinking water and nearly 20 million had improved
sanitation as a result of the initiative.

2. The Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP)

The Water Partnership Program (WPP) was established in 2002, between the Bank and the Dutch government, with the objective of promoting effective water management policies and practices, and operationalizing the Bank’s 2000 Integrated Water
Resources Management (IWRM) policy. In 2006, the WPP was transformed into a Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program
(MDWPP) with the participation of the Canadian and Danish governments. The MDWPP was instrumental in the establishment of
the RWSSI, the African Water Facility (AWF), ClimDev Program in Africa, and Agricultural Water Management in Africa (AgWA).
To date, a total of 60 activities, valued at UA 7.4 million, have been funded under the MDWPP.

3. The African Water Facility
The African Water Facility (AWF) was established through the initiative of the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and
is managed and administered by the Bank. Its objective is to mobilize resources to finance water sector facilitation and investment activities in Africa. Donors have pledged about UA 102.0 million to the AWF, of which UA 10.0 million was paid in by the
Bank. To date, the AWF has leveraged approximately UA 215.0 million to finance water sector interventions.

The AWF portfolio continues to grow; by year-end 2010, it included 66 projects valued at UA 68.1 million. Among these, the
Bank approved, in 2010, UA 14.0 million for nine special fund projects (including four transboundary initiatives) for the Gambia,
Ghana, Malawi, and Mali on the preparation of water supply and sanitation programs/projects, the introduction of innovative
technologies, and knowledge management.

 

DEEPENING PRIVATE
SECTOR INVESTMENT

Private sector development is widely recognized by the international development
community as the engine for economic
growth and poverty alleviation. During
2010, the Bank continued to make significant investments to stimulate private
sector growth in Africa. To this end, it
has at its disposal a number of financial

16

instruments of different risk classes, ranging from senior secured debt to direct
equity, including guarantees and quasiequity instruments. While the Bank holds
some direct equity positions in financial
institutions, the majority of the equity
investments are channeled through private equity funds.

The ADB's involvement in facilitating
trade finance is also growing and the

Bank is currently developing its strategy and modalities to enhance support
in this area. These include trade facilitation institutions (Such as trade guarantee
and insurance corporations), unfunded
portfolio guarantees for international
trade finance, as well as the provision
of short-term revolving trade finance
lines of credit (LOCs) to regionally active
African banks.

Annual Report 2010nits private sector operations, the Bank
ocuses on three areas: infrastructure;
industries, mining and quarrying; and
inance. The latter encompasses corporate loans and equity participations in
inancial institutions, as well as LOCs for
onlending to small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), which form the backbone of many African economies. The
Bank also invests in microfinance instituions, thereby extending its outreach to
he very small and informal enterprises
hat traditionally encounter difficulties
in accessing credit, a problem that has
een compounded by the financial crisis.

 

An important initiative in support of the
strategic effectiveness of the Bank’s private sector operations is the Enhanced
Private Sector Assistance for Africa
(EPSA). This initiative was conceived in
2005 and announced by the Japanese
Government at the G-8 Gleneagles
Summit. Consequently, UA 0.65 billion
(US$ 1.0 billion) is being channeled by
the Government of Japan through the
Bank in the form of concessional credit
lines for nonsovereign operations. Part
of these proceeds are also being used
to provide technical assistance under
the Fund for African Private Sector
Assistance (FAPA) program. This is mainly to support capacity building linked to
the nonsovereign operations financed
by the Bank.

Annual Report 2010

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

 

To enhance the relatively poor business
enabling environment (BEE) for private
sector development in most African
countries, the Bank has intensified its
support to this area. BEE improvement
programs are now an integral part of the
Bank's approach. and include, among
others, Policy Based Operations (PBOs)
and Institutional Support Programs (ISPs).
Of 24 recent ISPs, 13 focused on BEE,
while 21 of 44 recent PBOs contained
significant BEE elements.

In 2010, the Bank continued to sustain its
high level of investments in private sector
operations by committing UA 1.21 billion
to finance 28 new projects. This was a
4.3 percent increase over the 2009 level
of UA 116 billion. The 2010 total approvals
figure comprised UA 1.02 billion in project
loans and LOCs, and a further UA 189.9
million in private equity participations
(see Figure 2.2).

With regard to the private sector's share
of total approvals, this represented
46.7 percent of ADB and 29.4 percent of
Bank Group total approvals, respectively.
While the project loans, in general, were
used for accelerating economic growth
and reducing poverty, the LOCs aimed
at deepening domestic financial markets
for onlending to SMEs. The Bank Group's
investments in many sizeable multinational projects and programs in the form of

loans, LOCs, and private equity supported
economic cooperation and regional integration, thereby also improving the investment climate in the continent.

In terms of the distribution of private
sector operations by country classification in 2010, middle-income countries
(MICs, namely those eligible only for ADB
resources) received the highest share
(43.0 percent), followed by regional and
multinational projects (38.0 percent),
and then low-income (ADF-only eligible) countries (19.0 percent). In its efforts
to increase private sector operations in
low-income countries (LICs), the Bank
has provided LOCs to African banks and
DFls, and engaged in equity participation in regional funds located in MICs,
for onlending to projects in LICs. This
minimizes the Bank’s risk exposure, while
supporting projects in LICs. Although the
number of project approvals with direct
financing exposure to LICs remained
relatively low in 2010, when the regional/multinational operations that target mostly LICs are included, then the
share of private sector approvals supporting beneficiary LICs rises to around
50.0 percent (see Figure 2.3).

With regard to the MIC private sector
operations in 2010, there were three major
approvals in terms of their expected
development outcomes, namely: (i) a

17Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

loan to the Egyptian Refining Company
(UA 130.5 million); (ii) an LOC to the
Industrial Development Corporation
(IDC) of South Africa (UA 132.4 million);
and (iii) a loan to Transnet Limited (UA
271.3 million) in South Africa. Although
IDC is a Development Finance Institution
based in South Africa, the proceeds of the
LOC will help to support projects in LICs
(such as Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Uganda, etc.).

Turning to the regional and multinational
private sector operations, the four main
ones, in terms of their expected development impacts were: equity participations
in GEF Africa Forestry Fund (UA 12.9 million) and the African Agriculture Fund
(AAF) (UA 26.5 million); a loan to the
African Guarantee Fund (AGF) for Small
and Medium-Sized Enterprises (UA 6.4
million); and a loan for the Satellite 03B
project (UA 32.1 million).

With respect to private sector operations in low-income countries (LICs), the
two principal approvals in 2010 in terms
of loan size were for the Blaise Diagne
International Airport (UA 59.6 million) in
Senegal and the Markala Sugar Project
(UA 25.6 million) in Mali. The latter represented the first PPP in the agriculture
sector of an LIC and it aimed not only to

boost sugar production, but also to generate 30.0 MW of electricity for the use of
the communities in the project area (see
Box 2.7). In this way, it was able to draw
resources from both the ADB and the ADF.

Figure 2.4 presents the sectoral distribution of private sector approvals in
2010 (including project lending, LOCs,
and equity participations). Infrastructure
(comprising transportation, energy, and
communications) attracted the largest
share (42.2 percent); followed by finance
(41.8 percent - mainly in the form of LOCs
and equity participation); then industry, mining and quarrying (13.9 percent);
and agriculture and rural development
(2.1 percent). The allocation to finance
dropped from its 2009 level, when it
attracted 69.5 percent of the total private sector approvals. At that time the
Bank was playing a countercyclical role
by providing loans to alleviate liquidity
constraints being felt by African banks.
The 41.8 percent allocation to the finance
sector in private sector operations in 2010
reflects a return to the normal trend.

During the year under review, both the
infrastructure sector and industry, mining,
and quarrying sector benefited from a
larger tranche of the approvals compared
to 2009 (an increase of 110.7 percent and

50.3 percent respectively). The Bank’s
investments in industries and mining generally target the development of construction materials, agribusiness, as well
as hospitality and medical services. An
important feature of the Bank’s investments in infrastructure and industries is
the creation of developmental linkages
with local SMEs to promote their growth
and expansion.

Additionality and Development
Outcome Assessment (ADOA) of
Private Sector Operations

During the year, the Bank conducted the
Additionality and Development Outcome
Assessment (ADOA) for 55 private sector
operations, 28 of which were submitted
o the Board for approval and funding.
Of the 28 approved projects, development outcomes were rated as “good” in
4 cases; as “very good” in nine cases;
and as “excellent” in four cases. Only one
project had its development outcomes
rated as “marginal,” i.e. below the satisactory threshold. Additionality was rated
as “strongly positive” in 12 cases, “positive”
in 13 cases, and as “marginally positive”
(i.e. below the satisfactory threshold) in
hree cases only.

 

ADOA reaffirms the Bank's results agenda
by increasing its effectiveness and building its knowledge base. It does this by:
(i) ensuring that each operation has clear
and quantified development targets; (ii)
improving project design through a rigorous economic analysis of the benefits for
all stakeholders; and (iii) producing operations-related knowledge that will inform
the strategic selection of future projects.
A challenging development of the ADOA
framework concerns the evaluation of
the expected development outcomes of
Bank-funded regional operations, which
is scheduled to start in 2011.

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC
AND GOVERNANCE REFORMS

In the aftermath of the global financial
crisis, the Bank has deepened its support to sound economic and financial

Annual Report 2010management in its RMCs. Good financial
governance, including improved revenue
administration and more effective and
transparent public expenditure, is critical
to improve the fiscal and policy environment of RMCs and to strengthen their
resilience to exogenous shocks.

In order to play a leading role and to
deliver on the governance commitments
espoused in its Strategic Directions and
Governance Action Plan (GAP) 20082012 (see Box 2.4), the Bank has adopted
a two-pronged approach: (i) strengthening policies and institutions for more
effective, transparent, and accountable
management of public finances; and (ii)
improving the business-enabling environment and investment climate for private
sector-led growth.

The Bank Group supports economic and
financial governance-related reforms
through various instruments, including:
lending through Policy Based Operations
(PBOs) and Institutional Support
Programs (ISPs); nonlending activities;
and via upstream analytical and advisory work. During 2010, the Bank, in close

collaboration with its international development partners, consolidated its operational
and policy frameworks on governance, and
on PBOs in particular. It has sharpened its
focus on development results by adopting the Core Sector Indicators (CSIs) on
governance, in accordance with the Bank
Group’s Results Measurement Framework
(RMF) adopted in 2010.

The governance agenda is implemented
at three interrelated levels: country, sectoral, and regional. At the country level,
the emphasis is on enhancing country
systems for managing public resources,
with an emphasis on oversight institutions. Special attention is being paid to
(i) fragile states, where there is aneed to
strengthen state institutions in particular
to improve both governance and poverty
outcomes, and (ii) middle-income countries, where the focus is on building the
enabling environment for private sector
development and investment. At the sectoral level, the Bank promotes anti-corruption safeguards, especially in high-risk
sectors such as the extractive industries.
At the regional level, the Bank encourages
initiatives that promote best international

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

standards and codes of good economic
and financial governance. Interventions
undertaken at the three levels during 2010
are elaborated below.

Promoting good governance at the
country level: \n 2010, the Bank Group
approved 21 programs and projects in
support of good governance in 18 countries, for a total commitment of UA 298.9
million. One of these projects was the
Institutional Support Project for Improving
the Business Climate and Diversifying
the Congolese Economy. Other projects
approved in 2010 aimed to strengthen: governance capacities and country
systems for resource mobilization and
domestic taxation (Togo and Benin); land
registry management (Cameroon); budgeting and auditing systems and standards
(Benin, Togo, and Tanzania); and public
procurement (Tanzania) (see Box 2.5).

Promoting good governance at the
sectoral level: At the sectoral level, the
Bank targets high-risk sectors such as
infrastructure, especially through support to country procurement systems.
In 2010, it assisted Liberia, Mozambique,

The Bank's central objective in governance is to assist African countries to strengthen transparency and accountability in the
management of public resources. In this context, the Bank has adopted the following set of guiding principles:

8. Bank governance activities will develop synergies and improve relevance.

Annual Report 2010

African countries have the primary responsibility for improving their own governance to accelerate the fight against poverty.
Bank activities in governance will be sequenced and tailored to country circumstances.

The Bank considers corruption as a symptom of broader governance challenges.

The Bank will pursue a strategy of constructive and systemic engagement, including in high-risk environments.

The Bank will strengthen country systems, rather than bypass them.
Internally, the Bank will strengthen transparency in its own operations.
Bank activities in governance must be focused on delivering results, demonstrating impact, and adding value compared to

Context: This UA 5.2 million project in an ADF country in the East Africa subregion illustrates how the Bank’s assistance seeks to
improve governance in terms of enhanced capacity, accountability, and integrity in the management of public resources.

Objective: To improve transparency and accountability in public financial management in order to strengthen the performance of
budgetary institutions and thus help to reduce fiscal deficits and increase economic growth, both in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar.

Project Components:

Component A: Improving the credibility and transparency of the budget to build capacity in the areas of public procurement
and audit; and

Component B: Enhancing economic policy management by building capacity in managing the Public Financial Management

Reforms Program (PFMRP) and improving the business environment.

Expected Outcomes:

Component A: (i) improved tracking, monitoring, and value-for-money in the audit of public accounts; and (ii) improved value
for-money in public procurement.

Component B: (i) improved budget credibility; (ii) improved business environment; and (iii) improved external resource mobilization.

Sierra Leone, and Tanzania to adopt
and implement the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). The Bank
also helps to strengthen the extractive industries’ governance regimes, for
example through the capacity-building
projects in Guinea-Conakry and Togo.
Further, the institution approved in
2010 an “Operational Guidance Note for
Addressing Governance in the Extractive
Industries Sector Operations.”

Promoting good governance at the
regional level: The Bank supports regional and subregional initiatives that promote
standards and codes of good economic
and financial governance. As a strategic partner of the African Peer Review
Mechanism (APRM), during the year
under review, the Bank participated in
the country reviews of Mozambique and
Sierra Leone, assisted in the streamlining
of the APRM questionnaire, and contributed to the development of the M&E framework for the National Programs of Action.

Also at the regional level, the Bank has

renewed its support for the third phase of
the African Technical Assistance Centers

20

(AFRITAC Ill). These provide policy advice
and technical assistance to African counries with a view to improving public
resources management. Another initiaive which has drawn the Bank’s support
is the African Investment Climate Facility
(ICF), which assists RMCs to design
and implement programs to improve
he business-enabling environment. It
aims to improve property rights, taxaion and customs, infrastructure facilitaion, competition, financial markets, and
abor markets. Further, the initiative is
also designed to remove obstacles to
doing business, including business registration red tape, corruption, and crime.
he Bank serves as the financial resources
administrator of the ICF Facility.

During 2010, the Bank intensified its support to African technical networks in a
number of areas, namely: (i) domestic
resource mobilization, including hosting
he council meeting of the African Tax
Administration Forum; (ii) public budgeting, by cofinancing the Collaborative
African Budget Reform Initiative (CABRI);
iii) public procurement, by supporting the establishment of an African

 

Network on Public Procurement ; and (iv)
government auditing, through its support
to the African Organization of Supreme
Audit Institutions (AFROSAI).

PROMOTING HIGHER
EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY,
AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING

In order to enhance RMCs’ socioeconomic advancement and integration
into the world economy, the Bank’s MTS
affirmed Higher Education, Science and
Technology (HEST) to be one of the core
areas of assistance, alongside Technical
and Vocational Education and Training
(TVET). These are important for building the continent’s capacity for research
and innovation, so that it can participate
fully in the technological advancements
of the twenty-first century.

The specific means selected by the Bank
to realize these aims include: (i) strengthening national and regional Centers of
Excellence in science and technology;
(ii) constructing and/or rehabilitating
existing science and technology infra
Annual Report 2010Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

 

Context: This project, approved in 2010 for an ADF loan of UA 8.6 million, supports Higher Education, Technology and Vocational
Training, which is a core priority of the MTS. It will help to establish new Center of Excellence (CoE) in an LIC in the East Africa subregion.

Objective: To address the acute shortage of advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills in Rwanda and the subregion.

Background: The CoE is one of the five ICT Centers of Excellence recommended by the 2007 Connect Africa Summit to address Africa’s
limited capacity in hardware and software engineering, network design, and large-scale ICT project management. The center will be
located in Kigali in the ICT Park, which is being developed as part of a New Industrial Area. The academic program component will be
delivered by the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) as service provider under a Service Level Agreement. The involvement of the private
sector (e.g. IBM, Microsoft, EMC and Pixel Corps), through various types of partnerships, will contribute to the sustainability of the CoE.

Expected Outcomes:

(i) 150 full-time M.Sc. graduates in electrical and computer engineering and information technology students in the first 5 years;
(ii) 500 experts in ICT leadership trained over a 6 year period; and

(iii) The region’s private sector operators to be provided with access to ICT related services from within the region and beyond,

through the CoE’s leveraging of national and international networks.

structure, including tertiary education
institutions; (ili) linking HEST to the
productive sectors; and (iv) developing
appropriate TVET systems in RMCs to
respond to the productive sector’s skills
requirements.

t is for this reason that the Bank is pioneering a HEST initiative to design a
credible and implementable Education
and Training for Science, Technology and
nnovation (ET4STI) system. A concept
paper on this initiative was prepared in
2010. The Bank is also putting together
a comprehensive TVET innovations program, to address the evolving needs of
RMCs’ labor markets. This is with a view
0 improving the employment opportunities and life chances, especially for the
youth, in the wake of the global financial
crisis. Initiatives such as this should help
0 attenuate the social discontent and
sense of hopelessness that contributed to the major sociopolitical upheavals
recently experienced in some African
countries.

 

In 2010, the Bank approved UA 47.6
million to the subsector, distributed as

Education and Training in Botswana.

With regard to nonlending activities,
he Bank has embarked on the development of a range of operational strategies in line with the HEST Strategy. This
rocess has involved consultations and
study tours in several African countries
and Japan. During the year, the planning for a regional Science, Technology
and Innovation (STI) forum to be held
in mid-2011 was initiated with a view
to: (i) sharing experiences and ideas on
best practices; (ii) discussing strategies
for developing STI; and (ili) exploring
financing opportunities for the promotion of STI by the Bank and other development partners. Within this context,
country case studies were conducted in
four RMCs, namely Burkina Faso, Ghana,
Niger, and Senegal.

 

 

 

Within the context of the HEST strategy,
the Bank has started to explore how to
develop this sector through a comprehensive, local enterprise development
program. This approach makes full use
of networks among enterprises, research
institutions, technical training institutes,
schools, and other relevant resources to
promote technology transfer and skills
development. The aim is to have STI
programs address local development of
manufacturing capabilities through the
incubation of enterprises and job creation. In this regard, to support the implementation of the national STI policy in
Rwanda, the Bank assisted the government in designing and conducting a study
on “Mapping Science and Technology for
Industrial Development.”

 

PROMOTING REGIONAL
INTEGRATION

The low level of regional integration in
Africa is a constraint to doing business
in the continent, deterring foreign investment and the achievement of economies
of scale. Africa’s export performance is

21Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

poor, despite lower tariffs and freer access
to foreign markets. In most African countries, unreliable transportation, energy, and
water supplies, inadequate telecommunications networks, coupled with lengthy
and cumbersome administrative procedures, constitute a substantial disincentive
for entrepreneurs to invest in the region.
Furthermore, weak supply chains and poor
marketing systems result in high international transportation costs, raising the price
of African goods in the global marketplace.

During the year under review, the Bank
produced background issue notes and
reports for the preparation of Regional
Integration Strategy Papers (RISPs) for
all the African subregions. As a consequence, the initial versions of the RISPs
for Southern and East Africa were produced, as well as the second version for
Central Africa. The RISPs will be finalized
for all subregions in 2011 and will provide
guidelines on the Bank’s proposed interventions for the 2011-2015 period.

On the global front, the Bank continues
to be an active participant in the global
Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative, led by the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD). The Bank’s
interest and comparative advantage in the
delivery of AfT stems from its role as the
single largest financier of regional projects
in Africa and its track record of providing
trade-related assistance to its RMCs.

 

Although significant challenges remain
for enhancing regional integration on the
continent, some progress was made in
2010. For instance, activities and priority
projects over the 2009-2012 period for
the AU Program for Minimum Integration
(PMI) were adopted. Also, in order to
improve the coordination and the implementation of pan-African projects, the
Heads of States and Government decided
to transform the Secretariat of NEPAD into
the NEPAD Planning and Coordination
Agency (NPCA). In November, the African
Union Commission spearheaded, in partnership with the Bank, the creation of the

22

Conference of Energy Ministers of Africa
(CEMA). This new high-level body will
streamline all existing ministerial bodies
in the sector and serve as a central coordinating organ for energy policies and
strategy across the continent.

The Bank, inits role as the key agency supporting the NEPAD infrastructure agenda,
undertook a third and final implementation review of the NEPAD Short Term
Action Plan (STAP) to measure its performance since its inception in 2002. In
this connection, the Bank financed, over
the 2002-2010 period, 48 STAP projects/
programs for a total value of US$ 2.6 billion
(UA17 billion), and mobilized cofinancing
of around US$ 2.0 billion (UA 1.3 billion)
from multilateral and bilateral agencies
such as the World Bank, the European
Investment Bank, Development Bank of
South Africa, Agence fran¢aise de développement, and KfW. The review concluded that the STAP has made a significant
contribution to the integration agenda in
Africa and has reinforced the urgency for
physical and economic integration through
prioritized cross-border infrastructure.

The Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA) was
launched in 2010 as a merger of the
EPAD Medium to Long Term Strategic
ramework (MLTSF) and the AUC Master
Plans and Continental Policy Initiatives. It
sacontinent-wide program to develop a
vision, policies, strategies, and a program
for the development of priority regional and continental infrastructure (transportation, energy, transboundary water
resources, and ICT) up to the year 2030.
The development of the program began in
mid-2010 under Bank management along
with key partners, the AUC and the NPCA.

mn

 

During 2010, additional support was
provided to the NPCA for preparing the
AU/NEPAD African Action Plan (AAP),
which is the defining statement of Africa’s
current priority programs and projects
related to the promotion of regional and
continental integration. This followed the
Bank-supported review and update of the

AAP in 2009. The AAP will be launched
at the January 2011 AU Heads of State
and Government Summit. Thereafter,
the plan will be widely disseminated and
will inform Africa’s engagement with its
development partners.

Total approvals for the Bank Group’s
multinational operations (including
loans, grants, and equity participations)
in 2010 amounted to UA 515.1 million
for 22 projects and programs, which is
a decrease from the 2009 level of UA
117 billion. Figure 2.5 shows that in 2010,
the largest share (66.6 percent) of loan
and grant approvals to multinational projects went to infrastructure (comprising
transportation, water and sanitation, ICT,
and energy supply) and the remainder to
finance (33.3 percent).

One of the key regional infrastructure
approvals was the Lake Victoria Water
Supply and Sanitation Program (UA 75.4
million), which targeted an important
transboundary natural resource, the second largest lake in the world. This program will be implemented in 15 towns in
the five East African Community states.
With ten countries in the Nile Basin
depending on the lake for economic survival, this program promotes regional
cooperation, partnership-building, knowledge sharing, institutional and capacity
enhancement, and joint ownership of the
resources of the lake basin. Another key
project was the Nacala Road Corridor
(Phase Il) (UA 69.4 million), connecting Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique. Its
objective is to support economic growth
in the SADC area, while fostering regional
integration through reliable, efficient, and
seamless transportation infrastructure
that will increase subregional trade and
enhance access to global markets.

Other infrastructure projects that emphasize regional integration include: (i) the
COMESA Airspace Integration project
to service the countries in the subregion; and (ii) the Kenya TimboroaEldoret Road Rehabilitation project to
improve transportation links between

Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, DRC,
and Southern Sudan. In addition, a study
was approved by the Bank to promote
regional integration for the Central Africa
subregion (the Ouesso-Bangui-Njamena
road and Inland Navigation on the Congo,
Oubangui and Sangha Rivers).

Private sector operations also provide
significant support to the Bank’s regional
integration objective. In 2010, the Bank
approved one project loan, one LOC, and
O multinational private equity investments worth UA 322.5 million for this
purpose. A number of these projects promote access to remote areas and link
he communities together. They include
equity investments in the New Africa
Mining Fund, Catalyst Fund, and GEF
Africa Forestry Fund. (For details, see

gy, two in transportation, three in capacity building, one in transboundary water
resource management, one multisector
project, and one in facility management.
The total commitments for these projects
stood at UA 6.0 million, distributed among
various regional economic communities
(RECs) (see Figure 2.6).

To complement physical infrastructure
investments during the year, the Bank
also addressed soft elements through
trade facilitation. The Bank’s approach
incorporates the development of corridors and spans both hardware and
software activities. “Hardware” refers to
the quality and quantity of trade-related
infrastructure (e.g. roads, corridors, and
ports). Support was given toward maintaining and rehabilitating road networks,
increasing the connectivity of road and
railroad networks, and installing container facilities at ports. “Software” includes
promoting customs reforms and modernization; strengthening and developing one-stop-border-posts; advancing
negotiation and implementation of the
trade facilitation agreement of the WTO;
and developing logistics services.

 

SUPPORT FOR FRAGILE STATES

In assisting countries toward economic
recovery, the Bank’s Fragile States Facility

(FSF) provides support in three areas,
namely: (i) supplemental investment support in the Bank’s key priority areas; (ii)
arrears clearance; and (iii) targeted support for capacity building and technical assistance. Through this instrument,
the total ADF allocation to fragile states
has increased, in particular, to the countries eligible for supplemental support,
over and above the country allocation
provided under the performance-based
allocation (PBA) system.

n 2010, UA 110.7 million was approved in
he form of budget support, economic
governance reforms, and infrastructure
rehabilitation for six countries. At the
inal ADF-12 replenishment consultations
in September 2010, the Deputies agreed
‘oO areplenishment amount of UA 764.0
million to be transferred to the FSF, for
he ADF-12 period (2011-2013). Further, in
October 2010, the Bank operationalized
he Zimbabwe Multidonor Trust Fund (the
Zim-Fund) and by end-December 2010,
an estimated amount of UA 24.5 million
(US$ 37.8 million) had been paid into the
und by donors.

 

he results from all these commitments
cannot yet be fully quantified, partly
because they are at differing stages of
implementation. However, early indicators
show improvements in Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
ratings and in portfolio performance
indicators, such as disbursement ratios
and the number of operations supervised. Building on these improvements
and the operational challenges in fragile states, the Bank is strengthening its
results measurement tools, enhancing the
quality-at-entry of its operations, improving portfolio management, and intensifying its engagement at the country level.

 

This FSF rapid-response instrument
complements other Bank support (nonFSF operational instruments) in fragile
states. In the period since its establishment in March 2008, this simple, fast, and
flexible mechanism has been yielding
results. The arrears clearance process,

23Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

for example, has enabled countries
under arrears-induced sanctions (such
as Togo), to quickly reengage with the
international community. The process
has also proven effective in assisting such
countries to gain access to additional
resources for investment in areas such
as infrastructure (energy), social sector,
and agriculture. The budget support has
also provided for the rehabilitation of
basic social services in infrastructure, in
particular water and sanitation. This will
result in increased access to safe water for
communities in countries like Comoros,
Liberia, and Zimbabwe. /nstitutional
capacity strengthening in the areas of
public financial management, statistical capacity building, and private sector
development have been provided across
several fragile states. For example, the
Bank's support in Somalia has resulted,
for the first time in 20 years, in the development of a national budget framework
and budget accounts, thereby improving
financial transparency and accountability.

SUPPORT FOR
MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

In line with the Bank Group’s strategic
approach to deepen its engagement
in middle-income countries (MICs), its
operations in the 13 African MICs emphasize selectivity, focus, and complemen
Figure 2.7

tarity. The Bank’s support is demand
driven and tailored to the RMCs’ specific requirements, the institution’s own
internal capacity and resources, as well
as its comparative advantage in relation
to other international financing entities.

The Bank is now building more effective linkages between sovereign and
nonsovereign operations in its MICs. Its
approach includes providing competitive loan pricing and improved product
marketing; supporting well-targeted nonsovereign operations, particularly through
private sector investments; and expanding regional operations where necessary.

In 2010, the Bank Group’s approvals for
operations in the MICs (excluding multinational projects and programs) amounted to UA 1.88 billion, which is below the
level of 2009, but an increase of 69.4 percent over the 2008 level.

The sectoral distribution for Bank Group
lending to MICs during 2010 confirms
infrastructure to be the major sector,
attracting 72.7 percent of all financing,
most of which went to the transportation
subsector (53.3 percent). The other beneficiary sectors were industry (7.9 percent),
social (7.7 percent), finance (7.1 percent),
multisector (4.6 percent), and agriculture
(0.01 percent) (see Figure 2.7).

Figure 2.8

The geographic distribution of financing
to MICs in 2010 shows North Africa to
be the principal beneficiary (78.3 percent), while Southern Africa was allocated 21.7 percent. MICs in Central and East
Africa attracted 0.04 percent (see Figure
2.8). This is a reversal of the 2009 distribuion, when North Africa attracted 21.8 percent, and Southern Africa was allocated
78.2 percent of the total financing to MICs.

n terms of financing instruments, project lending (for both public and private sectors) continued to be the main
inancing vehicle in 2010. It accounted
or 92.8 percent of total approvals for
IC operations (see Figure 2.9), comared to the 65.3 percent share in 2009.
here was a decline in policy-based loans,
rom 34.1 percent in 2009 to 6.9 percent
in 2010. Grants from the MIC Technical
Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF), the African
Water Facility (AWF), and the Special
Relief Fund (SRF) represented a marginal
0.4 percent of the financing.

 

AGRICULTURE AND
RURAL DEVELOPMENT

The Bank Group’s new Agriculture Sector
Strategy (AgSS) 2010-2014, approved
in 2010, is rooted in the Comprehensive
Africa Agriculture Development Program,
established by the AU in 2003, which

Annual Report 2010represents the continent’s overarching
framework for eliminating hunger and
reducing poverty. The AgSS is founded on two pillars: (i) the development
of agricultural and rural infrastructure
and (ii) renewable natural resources
management. The objective is to ensure
sustainable food security through
increased agricultural productivity made
possible by investments in irrigation infrastructure, agro-processing, and marketing

Bank Group Strategic Directi

networks, including transportation and
storage facilities and related equipment.

During 2010, the Board approved operations and studies in support of agriculture
and rural development, including water
resource sustainability, valued at UA 68.3
million. These were for seven operations
and two studies in eight countries. Of
this total amount, 97.6 percent targeted
increased food production, with the bal

ance addressing natural resources management. To ensure sustainable food security in the RMCs, the Bank promotes the
full utilization of modern agricultural technologies, including improved seeds and
animal breeds, the increased use of fertilizers, and other agricultural productivityenhancing inputs. Projects approved for
the sector include the Agriculture Sector
Rehabilitation Project in Liberia and the
Markala Sugar Project in Mali (see Box 2.7).Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

 

Context: This is the first public-private partnership operation between Mali (an LIC) and the Bank in the agriculture sector. It
is funded from both the ADB and ADF windows. The project is notable in that it will not only boost sugar production, but also
generate power for the community in the project area.

Objectives: (i) To ensure a sustainable increase in the income of sector stakeholders (including farmers) and eventually to transform the country into a sugar exporter, thereby boosting the economy and (ii) to produce bio-ethanol, a by-product of the sugar

production process, to generate power for the local community.

Project Components

() Agricultural Component: Establishing a 14,132 ha irrigated cane estate in Markala, 275 km northeast of Bamako, on the north
bank of the Niger River to produce 1.48 million tonnes of sugar-cane per annum.
(i) Industrial Component: This will comprise a sugar mill, ethanol plant, and power co-generation facility. Each year, the ethanol
plant will produce 15 million liters of ethanol, and the co-generation facility will produce 30 MW of electricity.

Approvals: UA 29.0 million was approved for the project from the ADF window. A further loan of UA 25.6 million was approved

from the ADB window.

Expected Outcomes:

(i) Growth of Mali’s agriculture sector for 2010-2015 period from 5.0 percent to 5.4 percent;
(ii) Improved farmers’ incomes - expected eightfold increase;

dil)
(iv)

Employment creation - 8,000 jobs directly and 32,000 jobs indirectly;
Rural electrification - 30 MW of electricity produced, supplying power to communities in the project area;

(v) Social services and infrastructure - improved access to social services, including malaria control; also improving access to
safe water for the community and employees;

wi)
(vil)

The Board also approved the Business
Plan for Agricultural Water Development
and Water Storage Enhancement in 2010.
This plan will contribute to the implementation of the AgSS and to meeting
targets set in the Africa Food Crisis
Response by (i) increasing the area
under improved agricultural water management and (ii) expanding water storage capacity in Africa. The objective of
the plan is to increase water availability
for agriculture, domestic consumption,
climate change adaptation, and flood
and drought management. It also aims
to support capacity building for water
resources programming, policy and
strategic planning, and to help develop

26

effective institutional arrangements in
individual RMCs.

In line with the Bank’s operational selectivity, the first year of AgSS implementation has seen most approved investments in infrastructure and renewable
natural resources target food security.
Similarly, the Bank has used its partnerships with other donors, the private sector, and governments to leverage additional resources and to unlock potential
synergies in promoting agriculture and
food security. The Liberia Agriculture
Sector Rehabilitation Project and the
Mali Markala Sugar Project, cofinanced
with IFAD and private investors respec

tively, demonstrate the Bank’s success
in fostering public-private partnerships
and in leveraging resources.

Africa’s agriculture sector suffers from
another problem: an estimated 40 percent
of produce harvested in Africa is lost yearly in the agricultural value chain before
reaching the final consumer. To address
the situation, in 2010 the Bank prepared a
Framework Paper on “Post-Harvest Losses
Reduction 2010-2014,” based on a background paper prepared collaboratively
with the FAO and UNIDO. The aim is to
assist RMCs to attain supply chain efficiencies that will reduce quantitative and qualitative losses. This will be achieved through

Annual Report 2010selective investments in rural infrastructure
and by employing appropriate post-harvest and agro-processing technologies.
For instance, in the Markala Sugar Project
in Mali, the Bank is financing cane production and the sugar mill, while private investors finance the construction of an ethanol
plant that uses sugar mill waste products.

Leveraging Inter-agency Cooperation
in Support of Africa’s Agriculture

The new AgSS stresses the importance for
the Bank of building and consolidating
partnerships with development agencies,
regional organizations, bilateral organizations, government ministries, and related
agencies. This is necessary in order to
leverage each organization’s comparative strengths, to achieve economies of
scale, and to maximize scarce resources.
With this in mind, the Bank during the
year under review, pursued its program
of cooperation activities in the sector,
particularly with the following partners:

* World Food Program (WFP). The Bank
and the World Food Program agreed on
a number of collaborative approaches
in support of the agriculture sector and
food security in Africa. These included: (i) improving vulnerability assessments and early warning systems, and
strengthening social and productive
safety-nets in fragile states, through
policy analysis and advocacy; (ii)
exploring the potential for using WFP’s
Purchase for Progress (P4P) initiative
to provide a market for the outputs of
ADF-supported programs; (iii) jointly
preparing an “Atlas of Climate Change
and Food Security in Africa”; and (iv)
jointly supporting selected fragile states.

* Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). An understanding was reached
with the FAO on the preparation of
the Cameroon Rural Infrastructure
Development Project and the
Mauritania Agriculture and Food
Security Strategy. They also agreed
to jointly analyze the Benin Forestry
Sector Review.

Annual Report 2010

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

¢ International Fund for Agriculture
Development (IFAD). Agreements
were reached to increase cooperation
in cofinancing, supervision, analytical
work, and in showcasing successful
joint operations.

* Brazil-Africa Dialogue. Within the con‘ext of the Brazil-Africa Dialogue on
‘ood security, hunger, and rural development, the Brazilian government agreed
‘0 expand cooperation programs with
RMCs in capacity building, policy design,
echnical and financial assistance.

¢ IFDC agreed to assist the Bank in
advancing the Africa Fertilizer Financing
lechanism agenda in order to stimulate
rivate sector interest in the mechanism.

In the course of 2010, several Banksupported initiatives came to fruition,
including the following:

 

(i) Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program (GAFSP), which had been
proposed by the G-20 in 2009, was
established in 2010 and its Steering
Committee approved grants to
Ethiopia (UA 33.4 million) and Niger
(UA 21.4 million).

(ii) Africa Agriculture Fund (AAF). The
Bank approved a UA 26.0 million equity
investment in the AAF. This is a private
equity fund designed to attract private
investors into supporting Africa’s agrofood sector. Founding sponsors are the
AfDB, AFD, IFAD, and BOAD.

(iii) African Agribusiness and Agroindustries Development Initiative
(3ADD. This initiative, cosponsored
by the Bank, the AU, ECA, FAO, IFAD,
and UNIDO, will mobilize domestic
and international financing for agribusiness and agro-industrial development in Africa.

Managing Renewable Natural
Resources and Climate Change for
Sustainable Development

Value enhancement through judicious
management of renewable natural
resources (water, forestry, and land) con
stitutes the second pillar of the AgSS. This
will help to reverse land degradation and
halt practices that utilize the resource
base beyond its regenerative capacity.
The aim is enhance climate risk mitigation, sustained productivity of the natural
resource base, maintenance of soil fertility,
and sustainable development.

To this end, the Bank is working closely
with other multilateral development banks
to support the Forest Investment Program,
which was set up within the Strategic
Climate Fund (For further discussion,
see the section "Bank's Engagement in
Climate Investment Funds" on p. 30).
The Bank’s forestry policy promotes the
sustainable management of Africa’s forest resources to ensure environmental
protection, the supply of wood, and a
steady flow of non-wood forest products.
The policy was reviewed in 2010 to better
capture the emerging issues, especially in
climate change adaptation and mitigation.

The Bank has stepped up its involvement
in forestry projects that seek to sequester carbon and reduce emissions from
deforestation and degradation (REDD).
The Bank is also working with three RMCs
(Ghana, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic
Republic of Congo) to help them secure
funds from the Green Africa Initiative.
Supported by Japan, the initiative assists
selected African countries to address forest degradation in the dry forest zones
through plantation programs using
improved tree species.

In the fisheries sector, the Bank is one of the
main donor institutions contributing to the
management and development of African
fisheries, and to the implementation of the
NEPAD Action Plan for the Development of
African Fisheries and Aquaculture.

PROMOTING SOCIAL
AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

As part of its overall mission to help lift
African nations out of poverty, the Bank
supports its RMCs to develop human

27Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

capital through effective education,
health and social systems geared to
achieving the Millennium Development
Goals. This section focuses on issues of
social and human development, other
than those already covered in the previous section on higher education, technology, and vocational training.

To help protect its RMCs against the
impact of exogenous shocks, such as
food and fuel price volatilities, the Bank
hosted a donors’ consultation meeting in 2010 to review the Bank’s draft
paper on supporting social protection
in Africa. The meeting recommended
Bank intervention in three key areas:
(i) labor market programs to reduce
income poverty through strengthening
employability and job creation; (ii) basic
infrastructure and services to support
the development of basic community
infrastructure and reduce vulnerability;
and (iii) private sector development to
promote poverty reduction and food
security through entrepreneurship, targeting micro, small and medium sized
enterprises (MSMEs), investment and
economic growth

 

28

Social Protection

and Employment Creation
Poverty remains pervasive in Africa, with
about half of the population living on less
than US$ 1.25 per day. Poverty reduction
is therefore central to the Bank’s strategy
for promoting equitable growth, social
and economic development. Social protection represents an increasingly important approach for attenuating poverty
and there are sets of instruments at the
Bank's disposal to address economic
hardship and social exclusion. There is
also mounting evidence of the value
of social protection as means to boost
economic growth.

The MTS underscored the need for the
Bank to support investments that empower poor and vulnerable people to share in
Africa’s economic growth. Furthermore,
the Bank’s food crisis response targeted social protection interventions. It was
against this background that the Bank
committed to scale up its support to
social protection and pro-poor growth.
Consequently, in 2010 the Bank approved
UA 146.0 million for five operations aiming to increase income and employment

 

 

opportunities, social protection, and social
cohesion. These included the National
Taxi Replacement Scheme (see Box 2.8),
amounting to UA 98.9 million, and the
Rural Income and Economic Enhancement
project for UA 45.3 million, both in Egypt.
The other interventions were emergency assistance grants to Zimbabwe
and Sudan, and an MIC grant to Gabon

Recent sociopolitical turmoil across much
of North Africa has brought to the fore
the importance of addressing socia
issues. Mindful of this escalating need,
the Bank has renewed its emphasis on
enhancing the life-chances of Africa’s
youth by improving the availability of,
and access to, decent employmen
opportunities.

 

Support to the Health Subsector

The health subsector in Africa is burdene
by a growing number of chronic and
infectious diseases, which severely cha
lenge the capacity of RMCs to attain the
health-related Millennium Developmen
Goals. To maximize its resources, the Ban!
has to exercise selectivity in its choice o
interventions in this area, leveraging its

 

 

Annual Report 2010Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

 

Background: About 90,000 taxis in Egypt are over 20 years old, causing deteriorating air quality, chronic respiratory diseases,
traffic insecurity, transport congestion, high maintenance and fuel costs, loss of incomes to owners and drivers, and negative
implications for tourism.

Objectives: To protect and increase the incomes of owners, drivers, and service providers of taxis that are more than 20 years

old and to improve access to finance for new cars that are more environmentally friendly.

Project Components:

(i) Taxi Replacement Financing: UA 98.9 million loan and grant provided to Nasser Savings Bank (NSB) to complement finance
by NTRS of UA 66.3 million for the replacement of 21,250 cars.
(ii) Institutional Capacity Building: Strengthening the capacity of the NSB and instituting an M&E mechanism for the scheme.

(iii) Monitoring & Evaluation: This comprises the recruitment of a consulting firm to put in place an M&E system; the provision of
computer and communications equipment linking project sites and the executing agency; training M&E personnel; and undertaking baseline, midterm and impact assessment surveys.

Expected Outcomes:

(i) Around 21,250 jobs will be protected for targeted taxi-owners and drivers;
(ii) Increase in the incomes of taxi-owners (by around 40 percent) and drivers (by around 100 percent);
(iii) Direct and indirect job creation (approximately 11,500 new taxi-driving and related jobs generated); and

(iv)Reduction in CO, emissions.

comparative strengths in relation to other
development partners.

In view of the critical shortage of trained
health professionals and technicians in
RMCs, the Bank has reoriented its support to the sector by:

* reducing its investments in diseasespecific health programs in order to
focus on interventions for tertiary and
technical training;

* supporting national and regional
Centers of Excellence for pre-service
training;

* building the continent's research
capacity to more effectively tackle
Africa’s unique health challenges;

* engaging in strategic partnerships
to leverage additional donors’ and
local resources to finance medical
education in African universities;

Annual Report 2010

* focusing on innovative healthcare delivery financing through
community-based insurance schemes
and public-private partnerships,
among others; and

* engaging in strategic international
health partnerships to leverage global
resources. These partnerships include
the Harmonization for Health in Africa,
which was launched in 2007, and is
a joint initiative by the Bank Group,
UNAIDS, UNFPA, UNICEF, WHO, the
World Bank, and the African Program
for Onchocerciasis Control.

During the year under review, the Bank
commissioned background studies
with a view to enhancing its Human
Development Strategy. This will include
areassessment of the modalities for leveraging the health and social protection
dimensions within the framework of the
updated strategy.

ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT,
AND CLIMATE CHANGE

In 2010, the Bank established the Energy,
Environment, and Climate Change
Department as a timely response to its
RMCs’ evolving needs and priorities. The
Department comprises two geographically focused Energy Divisions and
one Environment and Climate Change
Division. Furthermore, the Bank’s Quality
Assurance and Results Department supports all departments within the Bank to
ensure that every project complies with
its environmental and social safeguards.
It also assists in mainstreaming climate
change at policy and advocacy levels.

In accordance with its MTS, the Bank is
positioning itself as the lead financier
for energy-related investments in Africa,
while supporting low-carbon development in the continent. In pursuit of

29Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

this objective, the Bank has begun to
formulate its Energy Strategy. During the
year, the Bank approved UA 887.6 million
for 14 new operations in the energy sector
(see the discussion of Energy under the
Infrastructure section for further details).

Regional Focus

The cost of electricity in Sub-Saharan
Africa is very high relative to income levels. This stems from two principal causes:
(i) limited supply and (ii) the high unit
cost of production and transmission.
At the same time, some of the most
promising clean power resources in the
continent (e.g., wind and water) remain
undeveloped because of the remoteness
of their locations relative to major centers of demand, which increases the cost
of their development.

The five NELSAP countries (Burundi,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,
Rwanda, and Uganda) are implementing
the East African Power Pool to support
power trade within the subregion. The
Bank has committed UA 99.8 million of
the total UA 160.2 million financing for
the project. The pooling of resources and
increasing power trade has facilitated an
increased energy supply in the national
and regional grids. The benefits of this
pooling include reductions in energy
transmission losses and lower costs to
the end consumers. Furthermore, there
are environmental benefits to be gained
by reducing dependence on polluting
thermo-energy.

Combating Climate Change
The Bank's activities in this area include
the following:

* conducting environmental and social
assessment, due diligence, and supervision of all new and ongoing operations within the Infrastructure Complex;

* preparing categorization requests
for Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment/ Resettlement Action Plan
summaries to ensure compliance with
the Bank’s environmental and social
safeguards;

30

* contributing to the preparation of
management responses and the
implementation of action plans for
addressing complaints over the noncompliance of Bank policies and procedures. This relates to operations for
review by the Independent Review
Mechanism on issues of an environmental and social nature;

* mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the Bank’s operations by
developing a Climate Safeguards
System composed of a screening manual, a screening tool, and a climate
change knowledge base;

* developing a subregional training program to enable Bank staff and RMC
officials to apply climate change safeguards and policies, thereby enhancing
project quality; and

* producing advocacy materials on climate change and safeguards, and conducting related thematic studies.

The Bank supports sustainable land
management in most of its agricultural
projects. In this regard, it is mainstreaming
land management issues into its project
design. The institution is also taking an
active role in the implementation of the
United Nations Convention to Combat
Desertification in RMCs.

Bank’s Engagement in

Climate Investment Funds

In the area of mobilizing resources
to help mitigate climate change, the
Bank was highly engaged during 2010.
It launched the African Carbon Support
Program (ACSP) and collaborated with
other MDBs on climate change innovation. Furthermore, at the Climate
Conference in Cancun, Mexico, in
December, the Bank’s President called
on the international community to support the establishment of an African
Green Fund, to be hosted by the Bank. In
addition, the Bank approved the Climate
Investment Fund Implementation
Mechanism, and Africa secured as
much as US$ 810.0 million (UA 516.0
million) in funding from various Climate
Investment Funds.

Clean Technology Fund (CTF) and
Strategic Climate Fund (SCF): The Bank
is participating in both the CTF and the
SCF. This pair of financing instruments was
set up to channel grant resources, concessional loans, and risk mitigation instruments to developing countries through
multilateral development banks, including
the Bank. The aim is to leverage additional
funds through the blending of the Bank
Group’s limited resources for climate solutions with those of other MDBs, together
with national and private sector resources.

Within the SCF, the Forest Investment
Program (FIP) mobilizes funds in support of the reduction of emissions from
deforestation and degradation (REDD),
and to promote sustainable forest management that will protect carbon reservoirs. The FIP has enabled the Bank to
increase its involvement in forestry projects; consequently, UA 90.9 million was
earmarked to support forestry initiatives in
Ghana, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic
Republic of Congo. In addition, the Bank
is engaging in the ongoing consultations
with the Forest Carbon Partnership, UN
REDD, the Forest Investment Program,
and the Global Environmental Facility,
which are the key agencies financing the
REDD initiatives.

 

The CTF and SCF finance four programs:

* The CTF, with a funding amount of UA
519.5 million (US$ 800.0 million) earmarked for Africa, finances the Pilot
Program on Climate Resilience (PPCR),
the Forest Investment Program (FIP),
and the Scaling up Renewable Energy
in Low Income Countries (SREP). Of
this total, UA 405.8 million is targeted
for CTF operations in Egypt, Morocco,
Nigeria, South Africa, and Tunisia.

* The SCF budget of UA 116.9 million (US$
180.0 million) is assigned to operations
in PPCR pilot countries (Mozambique,
Niger, and Zambia), FIP beneficiary
countries (Burkina Faso, Democratic
Republic of Congo, and Ghana), and
SREP pilot countries (Ethiopia, Kenya,
and Mali).

Annual Report 2010Africa Carbon Support Program (ACSP):
This two-year technical assistance program was launched by the Bank in
November 2010, with resources from
the Fund for African Private Sector
Assistance (FAPA). The ACSP assists
RMCs to access carbon finance by ensuring the commercial feasibility of their projects. Furthermore, it supports capacitybuilding activities for government agencies responsible for developing projects
eligible for carbon finance. It also supports the documentation of research findings in the area of climate change vulnerability and adaptation options.

Global Environment Facility (GEF): This
acility was created in 1991 to provide
grants and concessional funding to cover the additional costs associated with
ransforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental
enefits. The Bank, as Executing Agent,
as direct access to GEF resources to
increase its pipeline of projects relating
o sustainable environmental management, biodiversity, and climate change. In
2010, the Bank helped its RMCs to secure
UA 16.2 million (US$ 25.0 million) in project funding with grant resources from
he GEF.

Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa
(SEFA): The SEFA was conceived to support the provision of energy to African
SMEs to stimulate economic growth and
increase employment. Following the
Danish government's approval of the
SEFA program document in 2010, the
program will become operational in 2011.

 

ClimDev-Africa Special Fund (CDSF): This
multidonor facility was set up to finance
Climate Information for Development in
Africa (ClimDev-Africa), which is a joint
initiative of the AUC, AfDB, and ECA. Its
objective is to integrate climate information and services into development
planning and to mainstream climate considerations into policies and programs.

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

PROMOTING
GENDER EQUALITY

A new Gender and Social Development
Monitoring Division has been established
to ensure the quality-at-entry of operations and better results monitoring. In
addition, gender is being mainstreamed
in Bank operations across various sectors and at all stages of the project lifecycle. During 2010, for the first time, the
Bank included gender equality in quality
assurance and monitoring. Gender equality is being mainstreamed into the new
Supervision Reporting format, the new
Operations Manual, and the revised CPIA
rating system. In addition, following a trial
run during the course of the year, the
Bank developed a gender results tracking
system which proposes gender equality
as anew quality-at-entry standard to be
included in the Readiness Review.

To assist its operations, during the year the
Bank produced three new Country Gender
Profiles and conducted assessments of
gender mainstreaming in Social and
Human Development, and gender-responsive budgeting. It also mainstreamed gender equality in some policies, including the
Bank’s new Energy Policy. Gender specialists in Operations and in Quality Assurance
and Results Monitoring assisted in raising
the quality of operations by participating
in the project-cycle activities, CSPs, and
other country dialogue work.

In the area of partnerships, the Bank
deepened its collaboration with the
OECD/DAC gender network. It also
collaborated with the “New Faces and
New Voices Network” and organized the
Africa Women’s Economic Summit. The
Summit is a forum for business women,
bankers, and politicians to discuss the
challenges and opportunities of expanding women’s access to financial products and decisionmaking. During the
Bank’s 2010 Annual Meetings in Abidjan,
a meeting was held on the implementation of the UN security resolutions on

“Women in Fragile States: From Passive

Victims to Active Agents of Change.”

KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT
FROM OPERATIONAL
ACTIVITIES

Knowledge from the Bank’s operational
activities comprises an evolving accumulation of lessons - some positive and
others negative - which accrue from
the institution’s decades of experience
in development activities in Africa. This
knowledge needs to be fully utilized if
Bank-supported operations, programs,
and policies are to attain their expected
development objectives. To that end, it
is important for this knowledge to be
documented, internalized, and applied
to future projects and programs. This
will help to avoid the pitfalls of the past,
while building on the positive lessons in
the day-to-day planning and implementation of the Bank’s interventions.

In this regard, the knowledge development products can be classified into three
categories: (i) economic and sector work
(ESW); (ii) strategic products and events;
and (iii) operational lessons and recommended best practices, as elaborated
below.

 

 

Economic and Sector Work (ESW)
in 2010

Private Sector Operations

Given the rapid expansion of private sector operations, the Bank has increased
the involvement of this function in ESW.
Accordingly, the sector staff have become
increasingly involved in the preparation
of Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) and
Regional Integration Strategy Papers
(RISPs) to ensure adequate and appropriate coverage of private sector issues
in these documents.

Social and Human Development

Two sector studies were carried out in the
area of Social and Human Development,
namely: (i) the Angola study entitled

“Rapid Microfinance Sector Assessment:

Opportunities and Challenges for AfDB”
and (ii) the Mozambique study entitled

“Pre-Feasibility Study on Weather Index:

31Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

Micro Insurance for Rural Livelihoods
Protection.” The Angola study indicates
that there are indeed opportunities for
a vibrant microfinance industry based
on previous successful initiatives. The
Mozambique study shows that in the context of current and future investments in
climate adaptation and resilience, there is
both a need and a potential for transferring drought-related risk between years.

Regional and Country Programming
Four studies were undertaken on The
Gambia, Senegal, Mali, and Gabon. Some
of the key findings from two of these
studies are presented below.

* The Gambia - The study on “Improving
Civil Service Performance” found that
the civil service is small, understaffed
at higher levels, and overstaffed in
lower ranks; furthermore it is poorly
paid, of weak capacity, and in need of
general reform (including pay reform).

* Gabon - The study on “Private Sector
Development” contributed to the
design of public policies geared
toward the development of the private sector, which is the linchpin of
economic diversification, growth, and
poverty reduction. The study assessed
the quality of institutions that influence the expansion of activities, focusing particularly on transaction costs. It
examined various constraints on private sector development, highlighting
those that require immediate action
and measures to be taken to stimulate
or revitalize key diversification sectors.
The study also recommended reforms,
which are being implemented by the
government.

 

Strategic Products
and Events during 2010

Water Sector
In its pursuit of nontraditional sources of
funding, the Bank:

(i) presented a paper on the theme
“Financing Investments in Water
for Growth and Development” at

32

Gi)

the Third Africa Water Week (Addis
Ababa, November 22-26, 2010); and
published five major studies that
explore thematic issues for water
sector investment, including water
sector governance, user fees, and
cost recovery for urban/rural water
supply and sanitation services.

Private Sector

The private sector function of the Bank
has assumed a growing role in knowledge events and in creating key strategic
products, including:

Trade Finance Market,” for a highevel roundtable chaired by Pascal
Lamy and the AfDB President,
in connection with the Africa
Economic Conference in Tunis in
October 2010; and

a policy brief, titled “A Preliminary
Assessment of the Implications of
Financial Regulatory Reform for
African Countries,” in response to
he global financial crisis.

 

Economic Governance and Reform
In support of economic governance and
reforms, the Bank:

designed and piloted anew method
to better report the contribution of
budget support for effective results;
facilitated, in collaboration with ECA,
CABRI, ATAF, and AFROSAI, the
Good Financial Governance in Africa
Initiative. This produced a baseline
study on the trends, challenges, and
opportunities for good governance
in the financial sector;

issued Operational Guidance Notes
on how to strengthen country systems in public financial management, public procurement, and government auditing; and

(iv)

jointly with the OECD, completed
a stock-taking report on business
integrity and anti-bribery, legislation, policies and practices in 20
countries.

Higher Education,

Science and Technology

The midterm review of the Bank’s
Strategy on Higher Education, Science
and Technology (HEST) was conducted
during 2010. Experience indicates the
need for a holistic vision of education
development, which promotes a coordinated programmatic approach. This
stands in contrast to the Bank’s former
approach to the education sector, which
was characterized by multiple, small, and
uncoordinated interventions.

Energy, Environment, and

Climate Change

Preparations for several strategic products were undertaken, including:

The Bank undertook a number of thematic background studies to feed into the
preparation of the Regional Integration
Strategy Paper (RISP) for Southern Africa,
2011-2015. These in-depth studies, conducted through a broad consultative process with stakeholders in the subregion,
related to: (i) trade performance, challenges, and opportunities; (ii) macroeconomic performance across countries in
the subregion; (iii) private sector financing
of infrastructure; and (iv) development in
the following subsectors: transportation,
energy, and ICT.

Other knowledge products included:

as cases for comparison. This study
produced six detailed country
assessments of domestic resource
mobilization (five EAC countries
and South Africa), which focused
on tax policy and administration.

NEPAD, Regional Integration, and Trade
The Bank published a report titled:
"Financial Sector Integration in Three
Regions of Africa: How Regional
Financial Integration Can Support Growth,
Development, and Poverty Reduction".
This study, which focuses on the Arab
Maghreb Union (AMU), the Central
African Economic and Monetary Union
(CEMAC), and the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
countries, examines the status of regional
financial integration in each REC. The
report identifies the challenges and
opportunities for progress, makes proposals on the way forward, and suggests
future areas of Bank support.

Operational Lessons and
Recommended Best Practices

Social and Human Development

The following are the recommendations
and best practices that emanated from
the Bank-supported operations for Social
and Human Development:

(i) Government perspectives need to
be given prominence in the design
of programs to ensure country ownership, since this is crucial for program success and sustainability.

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

dii) +The design of new programs must
be preceded by a thorough analysis of the political economy of the
country and baseline surveys.

The effective participation of civil
society is essential in project design
and preparation, and throughout
the project cycle to ensure stakeholder ownership, project qualityat-entry, as well as its success and
sustainability.

Effective M&E systems and the
strengthening of national capacities
for project management are essential for ensuring effective project
implementation, the attainment of
desired development impacts, and
the sustainability of project benefits.
(v) Thorough supervision during implementation is critical to program
success and should entail frequent
visits and adequate mission duration on the part of Bank supervision teams. These teams should be
equipped with the complete range
of relevant skills, and be authorized
to make certain decisions while in
the field.

There should be increased flexibility
and delegation of decisionmaking
on operational and financial matters
to Field Offices and project supervision teams, in order to facilitate
speedy project implementation.
RMCs and the Bank should finance
a small number of large programs
in each country, rather than a large
number of small projects spread all
over the country.

did

(iv)

(vi)

(vil)

NEPAD, Integration, and Trade

A review of the performance of the
NEPAD/STAP program made the following recommendations:

(i) REC priorities should be aligned to
country priorities, as this enhances
country ownership, thus improving
performance.

(ii) Technical capacity should be
strengthened to ensure the
sustainability and effectiveness of
operations.

33Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

iii) Program performance will be better ensured if all stakeholders are
adequately consulted in the planning stages of integration programs.

Agriculture and Rural Development

A review of the operational experiences in
this sector indicated the following:
(In planning projects, traditional
authorities must be involved, as
they often have controlling power
and interest in issues of land tenure.
In projects involving infrastructure development in conjunction
with social, economic, and community development activities, the
sequencing of activities is critical for
success, with infrastructure development to precede the social activities.
Project design should include the
provision of access roads to all project sites for ease of supervision and
to improve project sustainability.
Delays in project start-up and resulting inflationary effects should be
anticipated when estimating and
preparing the project budget at
appraisal.

When project implementation has
begun, a redirection study should be
undertaken, to enable the Bank and
government to cancel or redirect
the project if this proves necessary.
Improving and extending financial
services to the poor requires the
strengthening of rural microfinance
institutions (MFIs), including rural
community banks (RCBs), in order
to expand their outreach.

Regional, Country

Programming, and Policy

A review of private sector development in
Gabon highlighted the following lessons:
(i) ~Multifaceted support needs to be
given to streamlining private enterprise structures, so as to improve
their performance, thereby reducing
costs and boosting productivity.
The quality of appraisal reports
could be improved through a clar
dp

34

ification of objectives and activities, and the preparation of detailed
implementation schedules.
Institutional support should be provided, including the training of project managers before the official
launch of projects, to strengthen
the capacity for procurement and
for the supervision of works.

The physical and financial monitoring of projects should be enhanced.

Gi)

(iv)

In connection with the Bank’s engagement
in fragile states, the following are some
of the lessons learnt. At the country level,
human capacity constraints in key sectors
continue to pose challenges to reconstruction efforts. Added to that is the need
to address state legitimacy and establish
a transparent and judicial process. Job
creation and food security remain at the
top of the development agenda, followed
closely by the need to improve the private
sector investment climate.

Evaluation of Operations

The reviews of Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) and Expanded Supervision
Reports (XSRs) (which are PCRs for private sector operations), highlighted the
following lessons:

(i) Project Design:

* to strengthen projects by paying more attention at the design
stage to risk factors, and

* to undertake adequate feasibility studies and other analytical
work during project preparation.
ii) Project implementation:

* to reduce the complexity of
he administrative procedures
demanded by the Bank and borrowers, and
* to ensure that supervision is carried out regularly and by teams
with an adequate skills mix.

(ili) /nfrastructure projects:

* to take adequate account of the
capacity constraints of borrowers, and
* to coordinate projects in the

same or related sectors in order

 

to achieve greater development
impact and synergies.
(iv) Procurement:

* to pay increased attention to procurement planning and management in order to minimize delays
which may threaten project outcomes and the overall success of
a project.

(For a discussion of Knowledge Management and Development arising from
research and capacity building, see
Chapter 4.)

RESOURCE MOBILIZATION

The Sixth General

Capital Increase (GCI-VI)

n response to the financial crisis, the
Bank frontloaded its commitments, put in
place new instruments to facilitate trade,
restructured its portfolio, and speeded
up its operational processes. As a result,
he Bank used up its available resources
more quickly than previously anticipated,
although some adjustments to liquidity
olicy and temporary additional capital
rovided by Canada and Korea helped
0 limit the constraints. Nevertheless, it
was clear that the Bank needed an earier Capital Increase than had been foreseen in the Bank's Medium-Term Strategy,
2008-2012.

During the Bank Group Annual Meetings,
on May 27, 2010 in Abidjan, the Board
of Governors endorsed a 200 percent
increase in the Bank’s capital resources
rom UA 24.00 billion (US$ 35.00 billion)
‘0 UA 67.69 billion (US$ 100.00 billion).
his substantial increase will allow the Bank
Group to sustain a higher level of lending,
including to the private sector, in response
‘0 sustained demand from its RMCs, both
low- and middle-income countries.

o ensure an efficient use of the additional
resources made available by its shareolders, the Bank has been implementing a program of institutional reforms, in
order to strengthen its capacity. To that

 

Annual Report 2010end, a reform matrix has been elaborated,

targeting improvements in areas such as:
Bank strategies and policies, business
processes, project quality-at-entry and
results, risk management, information
disclosure policy, and communications.

ADF-12 Replenishment Consultations

Consultation meetings on the twelfth
replenishment of the African Development
Fund (ADF-12) commenced on October 21,
2009 in Helsinki (Finland) following the
conclusion of the ADF-11 Mid-Term Review.
The second consultation meeting was held
in Cape Town (South Africa) on February
22-23, 2010, with the third meeting held in
Abidjan (Céte d'Ivoire) on May 27-28, on
the fringes of the 2010 Bank Group Annual
Meetings. The final replenishment meeting
was held in Tunis on September 7-8, 2010.

The ADF-12 replenishment consultations
came at a critical time for the African

Annual Report 2010

continent. With only five years remaining
before the 2015 MDGs deadline, Africa
stands out as the continent with the biggest development financing gaps. The
2008-2009 global economic and financial crises further challenged ADF countries, particularly fragile states, and jeopardized the gains Africa had made over
the past several years.

Participants at the ADF-12 replenishment
consultations commended the Fund for
its expeditious response to the needs of
its clients under the ADF-11 period. It was
underscored that the Fund had achieved
unprecedented levels of commitments,
particularly in its strategic priority areas
of infrastructure, governance, support for
fragile states, and regional integration.
Both commitments and disbursements
have doubled compared to ADF-10, demonstrating the ADF’s capacity, flexibility,
and commitment to Africa’s development.

 

Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities Chapter 2

Accordingly, for the ADF-12, State
Participants agreed on a replenishment
level of UA 6.10 billion (US$ 9.5 billion)
for the three-year period 2011-2013. The
replenishment represents a 10.6 percent
increase in State Participants’ contributions over ADF-11, and a 5.8 percent
increase in total ADF resources. The
donors further agreed that 20.0 percent
of the ADF-12 resources would be allocated to the regional operations envelope, and that UA 764.0 million would be
transferred from the ADF-12 resources to
the Fragile States Facility (FSF). Under
ADF-12, the Fund is committed to building
on ADF-11's strong track record, while it
continues to enhance its delivery capacity and account better for its development impact and effectiveness in ADF
client countries. To this end, the Fund has
adopted a comprehensive framework for
measuring and reporting development
results on the ground.

ADF-11 Resources, Allocation, and
Utilization at end-December 2010

The total resources for the ADF-11 cycle
amount to UA 5.63 billion, made up of
UA 3.57 billion of donor contributions
and UA 2.06 billion of the Advanced
Commitment Capacity (representing
internally generated resources). After
adjustment for carry-over resources
from previous replenishments, total
available ADF-11 resources amount to
UA 5.89 billion. The amount set aside
from ADF-11 resources for the Fragile
States Facility (FSF), regional operations, Project Preparation Facility (PPF),
and contingencies total UA 1.76 billion.
This leaves UA 4.14 billion available for
allocation to the 40 ADF-eligible RMCs
under the Performance-Based Allocation
(PBA) process. At end-December 2010,
95.0 percent of the ADF-11 resources
available for allocation under the PBA
system had been committed.

The PBA system determines the amount
of ADF resources to be allocated to each
of the 40 eligible RMCs, while the Debt
Sustainability Framework (DSF) determines the country-specific financing

terms in the form of loans, grants, or a
loan/grant combination. The DSF country classification applied during 2010 is
presented in Box 2.9.

Enhanced Heavily Indebted

Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative:
Progress Report

The Bank mobilizes resources for the
Enhanced HIPC initiative for the benefit of the 33 eligible RMCs after they
have reached their decision and/or completion points. During 2010, the Bank
Group approved completion point debt
relief assistance for Congo Republic and
Liberia, in addition to decision point
assistance for Comoros. This brings the
total number of countries that have qualified for irrevocable HIPC debt relief at
year-end 2010 to 23 (Benin, Burkina Faso,
Burundi, Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Congo Republic, Ethiopia,
Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique,
Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tomé & Principe,
Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda,
and Zambia) (see Figure 2.10). Three
more RMCs (Democratic Republic
of Congo, Guinea Bissau, and Togo)

received approval in 2010 of irrevocable
HIPC debt relief at completion point by
the Bretton Woods Institutions, but Bank
Group approval is only expected in the first
quarter of 2011.

Four countries (Chad, Comoros, Céte
d'Ivoire, and Guinea) remain at decision
point, while three countries (Eritrea,
Somalia, and Sudan) are at pre-decision
point. Two of the pre-decision countries
(Somalia and Sudan) have large arrears
that need to be cleared before the countries become eligible for HIPC, and later
MDRI, debt relief assistance.

The Bank Group provides an opportunity for arrears clearance operation for
pre-decision-point RMCs through its
Fragile States Facility (FSF). The arrears

Cost of the HIPC Initiative

The overall cost of debt relief for the 40
HIPCs worldwide is estimated at US$ 76.2
illion in end-2009 NPV terms, of which
he costs to multilateral creditors account
or 45 percent (US$ 34.2 billion). The
Bank Group’s total commitment is estimated at US$ 5.4 billion, in NPV terms.
This represents 7.0 percent of the initiaive’s cost to all creditors and 16.0 percent
of the cost to multilateral creditors.

The Bank Group finances its participation
in the HIPC Initiative using internally generated resources as well as donor contributions, which are managed by the Debt
Relief Trust Fund - DRTF (formerly the
HIPC Trust Fund, and administered by the
nternational Development Association of
he World Bank). The contribution from
he Bank Group’s internal resources typically finances 15-20 percent of the estimated cost of each beneficiary counry, while 80-85 percent of the cost is
inanced through donor contributions.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI)

he MDRI provides additional debt relief
0 eligible RMCs that have reached their
HIPC completion points. Under the MDRI,
donors are committed to cancel ADF
oans for debts outstanding and disursed as at December 31, 2004, and to
compensate the Bank “dollar for dollar”

for the MDRI-related foregone reflows
over a 50-year period to safeguard the

The total estimated cost (updated in July
2010) of the ADF debts to be canceled
under MDRI is UA 5.9 billion (US$ 9.06 billion). As at December 31, 2010, all the RMCs
that had reached their completion points
and qualified for irrevocable HIPC debt
relief assistance have benefited from MDRI
debt cancelations worth UA 4.90 billion.

PARTNERSHIPS AND
COOPERATION ACTIVITIES

The Bank continued to deepen and diversify its strategic partnerships during
2010 at both international and regional
levels. Its spectrum of partnerships covers
traditional bilateral donors, as well as
emerging donors, multilateral development agencies, academic and knowledge institutions, and private sector
institutions. Collaboration with African
partners has also been strengthened, for
example with the African Union, Regional
Economic Communities, Regional
Development Banks, and African thinktanks. Outreach missions by Senior
Management and high-level consultations with key development partners
took place during the year, to enhance
synergies and development effectiveness through more focused and selec

tive cooperation, in line with the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the
Accra Agenda for Action. In March 2010,
the second AfDB Partnerships Forum
was successfully conducted to deepen
the dialogue with over 80 partners from
around the world.

The Bank’s partnerships and cooperation
activities aim to leverage its core financial
and technical resources through mobilizing cofinancing, trust funds, technical
cooperation, staff exchanges, knowledge
partnerships, and joint analytical work.

Cofinancing Operations

In 2010, the Bank approved 28 cofinancing projects, comprising 25 national
projects and three multinational projects
for a total cost of UA 8.41 billion. This figure includes the Bank Group’s contribution, that of external donors, plus resources from governments and local financiers.
This was a decrease of 56.1 percent from
the peak of UA 19.16 billion in 2009 for 36
projects. In respect of the Bank Group’s
contribution to cofinanced projects in
2010, this amounted to UA 1.28 billion,
compared to its 2009 level of UA 3.89
billion (see Figure 2.11).

 

 

Of the 2010 total combined cost, the
Bank Group’s contribution amounted
to UA 1.28 billion (15.2 percent), external partners contributed UA 6.14 billion

37Chapter 2. Bank Group Strategic Directions and Priorities

(73.0 percent), while governments and
other local contributions accounted for UA
996.4 million (11.8 percent) (see Table 2.1).
A breakdown of external sources shows
that in 2010, in addition to contributions
from multilateral and bilateral partners,
UA 228.9 million was provided by private
sector institutions.

Among the multilateral partners, the
main cofinanciers were the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
the World Bank (WB), the European
Investment Bank (EIB), and the European
Union (EU). The key bilateral cofinanciers
were the United Kingdom, Korea, Japan,
Spain, and France (see Figure 2.12).

The sector that benefited the most from
cofinanced operations in 2010 was multisector, which attracted UA 3.27 billion
of resources. The second largest beneficiary sector was infrastructure (comprising the transportation, communications,
water supply and sanitation, and energy
subsectors), which was allocated UA 3.17
billion, followed by social at UA 1.63 billion (see Table 2.1). These three sectors
combined amounted to 96.0 percent of
total cofinanced operations for the year.
The sectoral allocation pattern for 2010
represents a departure from the previous
year, when infrastructure attracted by far
the greatest share (boosted by the Bank’s
support to a number of large power inter
connection projects), followed by social,
and then multisector.

New Cofinancing

Partnership Agreements/MOUs

Two new framework cofinancing agreements worth UA 454.5 million (US$ 700.0
million) were signed during the year. In
September, the AfDB and the Korean
Strategy and Finance Ministry signed a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
extending their UA 129.9 million (US$
200.0 million) Public Sector Cofinancing
Agreement through to 2011-2013. Then in
December 2010, the AfDB and the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB) signed an MOU
whereby each bank earmarked UA 324.7
million (US$ 500.0 million) for joint project financing in 26 member countries
in Africa.

Technical Cooperation Activities

he Bank mobilizes and manages bilateral
and multidonor thematic trust funds as
well as technical cooperation with donors
o leverage its core resources. At the end
of 2010, 13 experts had been seconded to
he Bank, and nine technical assistance
experts had also been assigned, while 16
new secondment and technical assistance
arrangements were being finalized with
ive donors. In 2010, the Bank published an
Annual Report on Trust Funds Management
or the first time, highlighting the major progress and achievements in this area in 2009.

 

Bilateral Trust Funds

In 2010, a total of UA 21.2 million was
approved under the bilateral trust funds
to support 66 activities. This represented
a 74.0 percent increase over the 2009
level of UA 12.2 million (see Figure 2.13).
These activities cover the preparation
of Economic and Sector Work (ESW),
Regional Integration Strategy Papers
(RISPs), and capacity building in the priority areas of infrastructure, governance,
private sector, regional integration, and
climate change. Finland was the largest
donor (UA 8.4 million), followed by Korea
(UA 3.4 million), DFID (UA 2.4 million),
Norway (UA 2.2 million), and Japan (UA
2 million). By year-end, 152 projects with
a total cost of UA 41.34 million were under
implementation by 33 departments.

Mobilization of New Bilateral Trust
Funds: A total of UA 19.4 million was
mobilized in the form of new resources
from the governments of Norway, Finland,
India, and Korea. Brazil committed UA 3.9
million (US$ 6.0 million) to establish a
new fund to promote South-South cooperation, which will be launched in 2011.

In addition, the Bank is collaborating with
other MDBs on climate change innovation through Climate Investment Funds.

Multidonor Thematic Funds

A total of UA 34.2 million was approved
under thematic trust funds in 2010 to support 28 projects. Thematic funds currently
support private sector development, water
and sanitation projects and programs,
the Congo Basin Forest, and Regional
Infrastructure Project Preparation.

Mobilization of Multidonor Thematic
Funds: \n 2010, a total of UA 36.7 million was mobilized for multidonor thematic funds. This sum included contributions from Australia and Austria
totaling UA 6.2 million for the African
Water Facility. Austria contributed UA

1.3 million for FAPA, while Japan replenished the fund with an additional UA 2.6

42.0 million) was mobilized to establish
a Multidonor Trust Fund for Zimbabwe
(the Zim-Fund), with contributions from
Australia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and
the UK (see Table 2.2).

Institutional Partnerships

During the course of the year, the Bank
followed up on the implementation progress of more than 140 partnership agreements and MOUs that had been formalized with over 70 development partners.
New strategic partnerships for knowledge development were established
with: the Development Bank of Southern
Africa (DBSA) and the Government of
the Republic of Korea. Furthermore, a
partnership was undertaken with the

Korea Trade-Investment Promotion
Agency for trade and investment promotion; as well as a framework MOU with the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
of the US. The Bank's tripartite partnership
with the World Bank and the European
Commission was reinvigorated, with the
focus on upstream policy harmonization.

This chapter presents an overview of the Bank Group’s operations during 2010 for each of its three windows (ADB, ADF, and

NTF). The analysis includes approvals by financing instrument and by subregion, with cumulative figures presented since 1967.

Disbursement figures for the year and the loan portfolio for each of the three windows are also presented. This is followed by a

breakdown of Bank approvals for each of the five African subregions. Profiles of all the projects and programs approved by the
ADB, ADF, and NTF during the year are presented at the end of Part |.

OVERVIEW OF
BANK GROUP OPERATIONS

Bank Group approvals in 2010 totaled UA
4110 billion, which was a decline from the
peak of UA 8.06 billion recorded in the
previous year, when there was an unprecedented demand for Bank Group support
from RMCs in the face of the global financial crisis (See Figure 3.1). Nonetheless,
the Bank Group approvals level for 2010
was 16.1 percent higher than that of 2008
and signals a return to a more regular
level of lending. Of the total approvals,
UA 3.67 billion was in the form of loans
and grants (compared to UA 7.51 billion in
2009 and UA 3.17 billion in 2008), while
VA 425.3 million was channeled to debt
relief, private sector equity participation,
and special funds allocations.

The six single largest approvals for projects were: the Suez 650 MW Steam Cycle
Thermal Power Plant (UA 360.5 million) in
Egypt; the Tangiers-Marrakech Railroad
Project (UA 255.6 million) in Morocco;
Transnet Limited (UA 271.3 million) in
South Africa; Tunisia - Road VI (UA 198.3
million); Project to Upgrade the Drinking
Water Supply in the Rabat-Casablanca
Coastal Area (UA 179.1 million) in Morocco,
and an LOC to the Industrial Development
Corporation of South Africa (UA 132.4
million).

The distribution of approvals from the
Bank Group’s three windows shows that
the ADB accounted for UA 2.58 billion
(63.0 percent), while the ADF accounted
for UA 1.46 billion (35.5 percent) and the
NTF, UA 29.5 million (0.7 percent). The

42

other instrument for approvals, namely
he Special Funds (which cover allocations
rom the African Water Facility, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, and
he Global Environment Facility), accounted for UA 32.4 million (0.8 percent).

here was a decrease of 54.0 percent in
he ADB's total approvals in 2010 compared to 2009. Similarly, total approvals from the ADF window fell by 40.0
percent over the 2009 level. However,
2009 was an exceptional year in terms of
unding requests from RMCs struggling
with the impact of the global financial
crisis. Looking back a further 12 months,
ADB total approvals for 2010 exceeded
hat of 2008 by 42.8 percent, while ADF
otal approvals for 2010 declined by 12.6
percent compared with 2008. As for the
TF, total approvals rose fivefold from UA
5.7 million in 2009 to UA 29.5 million in
2010. Special Funds approvals increased

 

 

 

2006 2007 2008 2009 2010

by 16.5 percent from UA 27.8 million in
2009 to UA 32.4 million in 2010.

Bank Group Operations by Sector
Bank Group operations in 2010 continued
to take account of the RMCs’ own strategic priorities and development agendas, in line with the precepts of the Paris
Declaration and the Accra Agenda for
Action. The distribution of total approvals among the various sectors reflects the
Bank’s adherence to its policy of selectivity, project focus and effectiveness, and
the rising demand for infrastructure support from RMCs. Figure 3.2 and Table 3.1
show the three main beneficiary sectors
for the year to be: infrastructure, with an
allocation of UA 2.60 billion (70.9 percent), finance with UA 319.9 million (8.7
percent), and multisector with UA 301.2
million (8.2 percent). These three sectors
jointly attracted 87.8 percent of the total
operational loans and grants.

 

 

Industry 5.1%

Annual Report 2010Although the approvals level for infrastructure projects dropped by more than a third
from 2009 to 2010 (from UA 3.91 billion
to UA 2.60 billion), this sector still dominates the total loan and grant approvals
for the year. The transportation subsector
benefited from the largest tranche (47.6
percent) of the total infrastructure allocation, followed by energy (34.1 percent),
water supply and sanitation (17.1 percent),
and communications (1.2 percent). This is
a shift from the previous year’s pattern of
allocations, when the energy subsector

received the largest share (57.2 percent),
followed by transportation (33.1 percent),
water supply and sanitation (7.6 percent),
and finally communications (2.2 percent).

 

The Bank’s channeling of substantial
financial resources to infrastructure
reflects its resolve to target high-impact
projects that will create an enabling
climate for private sector investment,
improve competitiveness and productivity in its RMCs, enhance employment
opportunities, and support sustainable
economic growth.

Poverty reduction is the Bank’s core
commitment, as enshrined in its Vision
Statement and its MTS, 2008-2012. To
this end, the Bank supports the drivers of sustainable, pro-poor growth and
regional integration, particularly through
the construction and rehabilitation of

Bank Group Operations Chapter 3

infrastructure projects in both rural and
urban areas.

Agriculture and rural development are
also critical to the continent’s development and a key driver of poverty reduction. Indeed, agriculture supports the
livelihoods of 80 percent of the African
population. Agricultural growth means
greater food productivity and increased
food security at a time of escalating food
costs and shortages. The Bank recognizes
that it has a role to play in this sector, by
assisting countries to boost agricultural productivity through its support for
agricultural infrastructure. This encompasses projects and programs that aim

to improve irrigation, water storage and
management; rural energy supply; rural
and community roads (including maintenance); marketing and storage facilities;
and agro-processing.

Another major focus of Bank interventions
relates to multisector operations, which
target support to public sector management (including structural adjustment
programs), poverty reduction budget
support programs, institutional reforms,
governance support programs, franchising and diversification support programs,
inter alia. |N 2010, Bank Group loans and
grant approvals for multisector operations
otaled UA 301.2 million, representing 8.2
percent of total loan and grant approvals.
Although still a significant amount, this
is a decrease from the 2009 and 2008
evels, when multisector represented 29.1
percent and 23.0 percent respectively of
otal loan and grant approvals. The Bank
Group’s allocation of a sizeable proporion of its resources to multisector operaions underscores its commitment to build
RMCs’ institutional capacity for sound and
ransparent fiscal management. Good
governance is essential to attract foreign
and domestic investment and to enhance
rivate sector-led growth.

 

Other sectors to benefit from Bank Group
operations in 2010 were social (5.3 percent); industry, mining and quarrying (5.1
percent); and agriculture and rural development (1.9 percent) (see table 3.1).

Cumulative Bank Group Loan

and Grant Approvals by Sector

The Bank Group approved a total of 3,526

the total cumulative approvals, the share
of the ADB window was 58.8 percent, the
concessionary ADF window 40.6 percent,
and the NTF 0.6 percent, respectively. The
cumulative Bank Group approvals by sector are presented in Figure 3.3. This shows

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (ADB) OPERATIONS

The ADB is the Bank's non-concessional
lending window through which it finances development activities in 13 middleincome countries (MICs) and three blend
countries (Cape Verde, Nigeria, and
Zimbabwe). The latter three countries
can also access ADF resources for financing projects and programs. Furthermore,
one of the main objectives of the ADB
window is to provide resources for supporting the private sector in all RMCs
through direct loans, LOCs, equity participation, and guarantees to financially
sound and viable private enterprises, and
to multinational projects that support
regional integration.

The approvals from the ADB window during 2010 totaled UA 2.58 billion for 59
operations, compared to UA 5.60 billion
in 2009 for 84 activities (see Figure 3.4
and Table 3.2). This was mainly due to
a decrease in both project lending and
policy-based loans after the record lending levels of 2009, in the wake of the eco
 

 

6,000

 

2006 2007 2008 2009 2010

nomic and financial crisis. The approvals
level for 2010 was higher than that of
2008 (UA 1.81 billion) by 42.8 percent.

ADB Approvals by

Financing Instrument

The two main financing instruments for
the ADB are project lending and policybased loans. Project lending is specific
in nature, while policy-based lending is
intended to assist RMCs to improve their
macroeconomic policy, and for structural
and sectoral adjustment, budget support, and institutional reforms. Project
lending (made up of public and publicly guaranteed loans and private sector
loans) and private equity participations
decreased from UA 3.94 billion in 2009
to UA 2.30 billion in 2010 - a drop of 41.6
percent, but still higher than UA 1.54 billion approved for project lending in 2008.
Similarly, policy-based lending decreased
from UA 1.52 billion in 2009 to UA 128.6
million in 2010 (see Table 3.2). This was
due to the absence of any major budget
support loans to RMCs, in contrast to the
situation in 2009, when Botswana and
Mauritius each attracted large loans to
boost their competitiveness.

The other financing instrument used by
the Bank is grants, which decreased from

allocation under the HIPC Initiative
increased from UA 112.8 million in 2009
to UA 1441 million in 2010, which is a rise
of 27.7 percent. The distribution of ADB
approvals between the various financing
instruments shows that project lending
and private equity participation accounted for by far the greatest share, at 89.0
percent, while debt relief accounted for
5.6 percent, policy-based lending for 5.0
percent, and grants for 0.4 percent.

In terms of recipient countries, the ten
prime beneficiaries of ADB loan and grant
approvals were: Egypt, Morocco, South
Africa, Tunisia, Senegal, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Mali, Cameroon, and Cape Verde (see
Figure 3.5). The others benefited from
either MIC grants or emergency assistance grants. In addition, Congo, Comoros,
and Liberia were allocated funds for debt
relief under the HIPC Initiative.

Cumulative ADB Loan and
Grant Approvals by Subregion
During the period 1967-2010, the ADB

approved 1,144 operations amounting
to UA 32.89 billion, of which UA 5.16 billion was for 154 private sector operations.
Figure 3.6 presents the subregional distribution of cumulative ADB approvals.
This shows that North Africa received the
largest share at 47.7 percent, followed

 

by Southern Africa (22.3 percent); West
Africa (14.6 percent); Central Africa (8.0
percent); East Africa (3.7 percent); while
multiregional accounted for 3.6 percent.
North Africa and Southern Africa, which
comprise mainly ADB countries, received
70.0 percent of total loan and grant
approvals. This approach confirms the
Bank's strategy of utilizing ADB resources
to enhance its engagement in MICs and
to encourage private sector investment.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed (net of cancelations)
amounted to VA 26.27 billion at
December 31, 2010. Total outstanding
loans at that date amounted to UA 8.29
billion, which was UA 0.75 billion higher
than the UA 7.54 billion outstanding at
the end of 2009. Undisbursed balances
at end-December 2010 amounted to UA
4.86 billion, which is a decrease of UA 0.14
billion from the 2009 level. There were
274 active signed loans totaling UA 8.29
billion, while the number of fully repaid
loans was 624, for a total of UA 10.31 billion at year-end 2010.

Disbursements

Disbursements from the ADB window in
2010 amounted to UA 1.34 billion, which
represents a 43.0 percent decrease from
the UA 2.35 billion disbursed in 2009.

At end-December 2010, cumulative disbursements (including non-sovereign
loans) totaled UA 21.31 billion. By the
same date, 810 loans had been fully disbursed for an amount of UA 18.75 billion,
representing 88.0 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
FUND (ADF) OPERATIONS

The ADF is the Bank Group’s concessionary lending window for countries
that cannot access funds from the ADB
window, other than for enclave and private sector projects. ADF resources are
allocated on the basis of country creditworthiness, per capita GNI, and country performance using the PerformanceBased Allocation (PBA) system. The PBA
mechanism is designed to ensure that
resources are proportionately targeted
to those RMCs that can leverage them
most effectively.

In 2010, ADF total approvals comprising
loans, grants, project preparation facility
resources, debt and debt service reduction, amounted to UA 1.46 billion, compared with UA 2.43 billion in 2009, which
is a 39.9 percent decrease (see Figure 3.7
and Table 3.3).

ADF Approvals by

Financing Instrument

In terms of project lending to support
public sector operations in RMCs, the
ADF approved UA 802.1 million for 26
activities in 2010, compared with UA 951.3
million in 2009 for 25 activities, which is
a decrease of 15.7 percent. Policy-based
lending, which encompasses financing
sector activities and budget support,
declined significantly from UA 349.2 million for six activities in 2009 to UA 38.9
million for two operations in 2010. The
total approvals for project and policybased loans from the ADF dropped by
35.3 percent from UA 1.30 billion in 2009
to UA 0.84 billion in 2010.

Grant approvals in 2010 stood at UA 585.6
million compared with UA 862.8 million
in 2009, which is a decline of 32.1 percent. With respect to ADF allocations for
debt servicing, there was almost a tenfold

to UA 30.0 million in 2010.

Figure 3.8 shows that 26 countries benefited from ADF loan and grant approvals during 2010. The 16 countries that
received the highest allocations were:
(in order of magnitude): Ethiopia,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania,
enya, Ghana, Niger, Cameroon, Benin,

ali, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Burundi,
ogo, Zambia, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
Furthermore, under the HIPC Initiative,
Congo Republic and Liberia received
unds from ADF for debt relief.

Cumulative ADF Loan and Grant
Approvals by Subregion, 1974-2010
During the period 1974-2010, ADF cumuative approvals totaled 1,467 loans and
842 grants, for a sum of UA 22.73 billion.
Figure 3.9 shows the split of these cumuative approvals by subregion. The West

 

Africa and East Africa subregions, whose
constituencies comprise mostly ADF (i.e.
low-income) countries, received 31.0 percent and 31.1 percent of the cumulative
approvals respectively. Central Africa, on
he other hand, which also mainly comprises ADF-eligible countries, received
just 9.2 percent. The North Africa and
he Southern Africa subregions, which
are constituted principally of ADB (i.e.
middle-income) countries, received 2.4
percent and 15.3 percent respectively.
he share of multiregional operations was
1.0 percent. These cumulative figures
herefore are consistent with the Bank
Group's policy of targeting ADF resources

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
BY SUBREGION

Bank Group Loan and

Grant Approvals by Subregion

The Bank divides Africa into five subregions for operational purposes, namely,
Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa,
Southern Africa, and West Africa. At
December 31, 2010, Bank Group approvals for all five subregions (including
multinational projects and programs)
totaled UA 3.67 billion. This was a significant decrease from the UA 7.51 billion approved for 2009 (an exceptional
year in the history of Bank Group lending). Nevertheless, the approvals for 2010
exceeded that of 2008 by 15.9 percent.

The approvals for 2010 were allocated to
the subregions as follows: North Africa, UA
1.47 billion (40.1 percent); West Africa, UA
595.8 million (16.2 percent); East Africa,
UA 560.3 million (15.2 percent); Southern
Africa, UA 492.8 million (13.4 percent); and
Central Africa, UA 234.6 million (6.4 percent). Loan and grant approvals for multinational projects and programs amounted to UA 319.1 million (8.7 percent). The
Bank Group's cumulative loan and grant
approvals for the period 1967-2010 for all
five subregions plus multinational operations amounted to UA 55.93 billion, of
which multinational operations totaled
UA 3.71 billion (see Annex II-7).

North Africa

North Africa constitutes six countries:
Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco,
and Tunisia. All the countries in the subregion are ADB countries, except for
Mauritania which is an ADF country.
Mauritania can only borrow from ADF
resources, except for private sector and
enclave projects which can be financed
from ADB resources. Loan and grant
approvals for the subregion totaled UA
1.47 billion in 2010, which is a rise of 40.0

percent above the 2009 level of UA 1.05
billion. North Africa’s approvals represented 40.1 percent of total Bank Group
pprovals, which makes it the main beneiciary subregion during the year. The benefiting countries were: Egypt, UA 651.4
million; Morocco, UA 519.7 million; Tunisia,
VA 296.6 million; Mauritania, UA 3.6 million; and Libya, UA 0.6 million (which was
an MIC-TAF grant) (see Annex II-7).

The key projects approved for North
Africa were: the Suez 650 MW Steam

in Morocco. The summary profiles of all
projects and programs are presented at
the end of Part |.

The sectoral distribution of loan and grant
approvals in 2010 shows that infrastructure attracted the largest share at UA 1.10
billion (74.4 percent). Within this dominant infrastructure sector, the energy
subsector received the biggest tranche,
at UA 458.3 million (41.8 percent), followed by transportation, at UA 454.5 million (41.5 percent), and water supply and
sanitation, UA 182.7 million (16.7 percent).
The allocations to the other sectors were
as follows: industry, mining, and quarrying, UA 1471 million (10.0 percent); social,
UA 144.2 million (9.8 percent); and multisector, UA 85.2 million (5.8 percent). This

sectoral split is consistent with the Bank
Group’s operational focus of prioritizing
infrastructure development - a key driver
of economic growth - in line with its MTS
(2008-2012).

The Bank Group started operations in
the North Africa subregion in 1968 - one
year after the other subregions. During
the period 1968-2010, North Africa was
allocated the highest cumulative loan
and grant approvals of UA 16.25 billion,
representing 29.1 percent of total Bank
Group loan and grant approvals. Among
the countries in the subregion, Morocco
received the largest share of the cumulative approvals, followed by Tunisia, Egypt,
Algeria, and Mauritania. Libya received an
MIC-TAF grant of UA 0.6 million in 2010,
which was the first time the country had
benefited from Bank Group resources (see
Annex |l-7). Figure 3.11 shows the cumulative Bank Group loan and grant approvals

rural development (8.5 percent).

West Africa

West Africa is made up of 16 countries:
Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Céte
d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea
Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Sao
Tomé and Principe (So Tomé and Principe
is included in West Africa for operational
purposes), Senegal, Sierra Leone, and
Togo. The subregion has the greatest linguistic, geographic, and natural resources
diversity. Apart from Cape Verde and
Nigeria, all the countries in the subregion
are ADF-eligible only (except for private
sector and enclave projects which can
draw funding from ADB resources). As
blend countries, Cape Verde and Nigeria
can borrow from both the ADB and ADF
windows. Bank Group loan and grant
approvals for West Africa declined from
UA 1.24 billion in 2009 to UA 595.8 million in 2010, which is a decrease of 52.0
percent. Nonetheless, in 2010 West Africa
was the second highest recipient of loans
and grants after North Africa.

Approvals to the subregion in 2010
accounted for 16.2 percent of total
approved loans and grants (see Annex
ll-7). Fourteen countries in the subregion

be financed from ADB resources. In 2010,
East Africa received UA 560.3 million of
Bank Group loan and grants, representing an increase of 8.7 percent over the
UA 515.6 million approved in 2009. The
approvals were earmarked to assist development projects and programs in nine
countries; this represented 15.2 percent
of total approvals (see Annex II-7). The
beneficiary countries were as follows:
Ethiopia (UA 224.4 million), Tanzania
(UA 129.6 million), Kenya (UA 116.7 million), Rwanda (UA 41.1 million), Burundi
(UA 34.1 million), Eritrea (UA 12.9 million),
Sudan (UA 0.7 million), Comoros (UA 0.6
million), and Seychelles (UA 0.3 million).

In line with the Bank Group's strategic
operational priorities, in 2010 approvals
in this subregion too were directed mainly
toward infrastructure, which attracted
UA 396.9 million (70.8 percent of total
approvals), while multisector received
UA 88.4 million (15.8 percent). The breakdown of infrastructure approvals into
subsectors shows that energy was allocated UA 243.8 million (61.4 percent);
water and sanitation, UA 94.0 million
(23.7 percent); and transportation, UA
59.1 million (14.9 percent). The allocations to the other sectors were as follows:
industry, mining and quarrying, UA 39.3
million (7.0 percent); social, UA 22.2 million (4.0 percent); finance, UA 12.7 million

(2.3 percent); and agriculture and rural
development, UA 0.8 million (0.1 percent).
The focus of Bank Group operations on
infrastructure aims at building the foundations for sustainable economic growth
and promoting regional integration and
foreign investment. The approvals to multisector aim to strengthen RMCs’ institutional capacity for sound and transparent
fiscal management, which improves the
business enabling environment and competitiveness, thereby assisting economic
development.

Notable infrastructure projects approved
for East Africa include: the Electricity
Transmission System Improvement
Project, and the Protection of Basic
Services, phase Il in Ethiopia; the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Program
and the lringa-Shiyanga Electricity Power
Transmission Line in Tanzania; the Power
Transmission System Improvement Project,
the Nairobi Rivers Basin Rehabilitation
and Restoration Improvement Project, the
Timbora-Eldoret Road project in Kenya;
and the Gitenga-Nyangungu-Ngozi road
project in Burundi. Other notable projects
and programs approved for the subregion in 2010 include “La Cimenterie du
Rwanda” project, the Support for Higher
Education Development Project in Eritrea,
and Support to the Regional ICT Center
of Excellence in Rwanda.

During the period 1967-2010, East Africa
received UA 8.38 billion in cumulative
loan and grant approvals, accounting for
15.0 percent of total cumulative approvals to the continent. Among the countries
in the subregion, Ethiopia was allocated
the largest share, followed by Tanzania,
Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan,
Djibouti, Somalia, Seychelles, Eritrea, and
Comoros (see Annex II-7). Figure 3.13 presents the cumulative Bank Group loan
and grant approvals by sector, which
shows infrastructure to be the biggest
recipient (45.3 percent), followed by agriculture and rural development (20.8 percent), multisector (16.0 percent), social
(11.7 percent), industry, mining, and quarrying (3.1 percent), and finance (2.8 percent).

Southern Africa

Southern Africa comprises 12 countries,
namely Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia,
and Zimbabwe. Five of these countries
(viz. Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia, South
Africa, and Swaziland) are eligible for ADB
resources. Zimbabwe, as a blend country,
can access funds from both ADB and ADF
windows, although it has been under sanctions since 2000. The remaining six countries (Angola, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi,
Mozambique, and Zambia) are ADF-eligible only, except for private sector and
enclave projects, which permit resources
to be drawn from the ADB window.

Bank Group loan and grant approvals to
the subregion declined from UA 3.40 billion in 2009 to UA 492.8 million in 2010,
representing a 85.5 percent decrease.
This was mainly due to the absence of
any large budget support loan in the
subregion, compared to 2009 when two
budget support loans amounting to UA
1.51 billion were approved for Botswana
and Mauritius. Nonetheless, the loan and
grant approvals for the subregion in 2010
exceeded that of 2008 by 3.6 percent
and represented 13.4 percent of total
approvals to all the five subregions (see
Annex II-7).

Annual Report 2010The nine beneficiary countries were as
follows: South Africa, UA 403.7 million;
Mozambique, UA 37.9 million; Zambia,
UA 32.6 million; Malawi, UA 14.7 million;
Botswana, UA 2.1 million; Zimbabwe,
UA 0.7 million; Namibia, UA 0.6 million;
Mauritius, UA 0.3 million; and Swaziland
UA 0.3 million. South Africa, which has
consistently been the major beneficiary
of Bank Group approvals in the subregion
since 2007, retained this position in 2010.

4

e four key approvals for Southern Africa
were for the following projects and programs: Transnet Limited in South Africa;
the Industrial Development Corporation
of South Africa (an LOC); the MontepuezLichinga Road in Mozambique; and the
Third Poverty Reduction Budget Support
in Zambia.

The sectoral distribution of the 2010
approvals in the subregion shows that
infrastructure was allocated UA 309.8
million (62.9 percent) of the total. Within
is allocation, the transportation subsecor was allocated UA 304.6 million (98.3
percent); and water supply and sanitation,
UA 5.3 million (1.7 percent). The share of
e other sectors was as follows: finance,
UA 133.0 million (27.0 percent); multisec‘or, UA 47.8 million (9.7 percent); social
sector, UA 1.3 million (0.3 percent); agriculture and rural development, UA 0.7
million (0.1 percent); and UA 0.3 million
‘0 industry, mining and quarrying.

 

The Bank Group started its operations in
he subregion in 1969. Southern Africa’s
cumulative Bank Group loans and grants
or the period 1969-2010 totaled UA 10.90
billion. This amounts to 19.5 percent of all
he cumulative approvals for the continent.
South Africa received the highest share,
ollowed by Botswana, Mozambique,
Zambia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius
Zimbabwe, Angola, Lesotho, Swaziland,
and Namibia. In terms of sectoral distribution, infrastructure received the highest cumulative approvals (44.9 percent),
ollowed by multisector (22.4 percent);
inance (10.9 percent); agriculture and
rural development (10.1 percent); social

 

Annual Report 2010

(71 percent); industry, mining, and quarrying (4.6 percent); and environment (0.1
percent) (see Figure 3.14).

Central Africa

The Central Africa subregion is made up
of seven countries: Cameroon, Central
Africa Republic, Chad, Congo Republic,
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Gabon
and Equatorial Guinea are the only two
countries that can borrow from the ADB
window. The other five countries are only
eligible to borrow from ADF resources,
other than for private sector and enclave
projects. In 2010, the subregion was allocated UA 234.6 million, representing 6.4
ercent of the total Bank Group loan and
grant approvals to all the five subregions.
The total approvals for this subregion in
2010 show a drop of 14.7 percent compared to 2009.

 

 

he five countries to benefit from loan
and grant approvals in 2010 were the
Democratic Republic of Congo, UA 158.3
million; Cameroon, UA 71.7 million; Congo,
UA 3.4 million; Chad, UA 0.7 million; and
Gabon, UA 0.5 million (see Annex II-7).
The two largest project approvals for the
subregion were both for the Democratic
Republic of Congo, namely the Priority
Air Safety Project (UA 88.6 million) and
he Semi-Urban and Rural Electrification
Project (69.69 million). Cameroon attracting funding for four smaller projects in
various sectors, namely: the Dibamba
Power Project; the Rural Drinking Water
Supply and Sanitation Project; the
Project to Strengthen and Extend the
Electricity Transmission and Distribution
Network, and the Support Project for the
Modernization of the Land Restoration
System and Business Climate. The Congo
benefited from approved financing for
one multisector project, viz. Institutional
Support to Improve the Business Climate
and Diversity of the Congolese Economy.

 

The sectoral distribution of 2010 approvals to the Central African subregion largely mirrors that of the other subregions, in
that infrastructure attracted the highest

Bank Group Operations Chapter 3

allocation, at UA 223.0 million (95.0 percent). Of this amount, the energy subsector received UA 124.4 million (55.8
percent); transportation, UA 88.6 million
(39.7 percent); and water supply and sanitation, UA 10.0 million (4.5 percent). The
other sectoral allocations were as follows:
multisector, UA 10.4 million (4.4 percent);
agriculture and rural development, UA 0.7
million (0.3 percent); and social, UA 0.5
million (0.2 percent).

The Bank Group’s cumulative loan and
grant approvals to Central Africa during
the period 1967-2010 amounted to UA
4.73 billion, which represents 8.5 percen
of the total cumulative approvals to the
continent. The Democratic Republic o
Congo received the largest amount, fo!
lowed by Gabon, Cameroon, Chad, Congo,
Central African Republic, and Equatoria
Guinea.

The sectoral split for this cumulative fig
ure shows infrastructure with the larges
tranche (46.7 percent), followed by multisector (18.1 percent), then agriculture
and rural development (14.5 percent),
social (12.5 percent), industry mining, and
quarrying (6.5 percent), and finance 1.6
percent (see Figure 3.15). This confirms
that the Bank is maintaining its opera
tional focus on those sectors that wil
accrue the greatest economic gains for
the continent.

During the year under review, the Bank Group continued to steadfastly implement its institutional reforms in order to improve

its corporate performance, the quality of its operations, and its development effectiveness. The Bank also pursued its path of

becoming the premier development institution for the continent, a center of excellence for knowledge and research, and the

preeminent voice on Africa’s development issues. This chapter presents the program of the Bank in the various functional areas

toward realizing these strategic objectives

INSTITUTIONAL REFORMS

The Bank has made sound progress in all
areas of institutional reform established
under the 2007 core reform agenda. The
implementation of these reforms in 2010
has achieved the following: (i) improved
coordination and enhanced monitoring
and management of corporate performance; (ii) enhanced operational effectiveness by fine-tuning the Bank’s organizational structure and strengthening its
field offices (FOs); and (iii) streamlining
the budget reform process by further
decentralizing budget management.

Improved Coordination

and Corporate Performance

The position of the Chief Operating
Officer (COO), and the strengthening of
the Senior Management Coordination
Committee (SMCC) are central to the
Bank’s overall coherence, coordination,
and optimal effectiveness. It has helped
to align resources to strategic priorities
and has enhanced the monitoring and
management of corporate performance.
The SMCC ensures that the Bank Group’s
corporate functions operate with optimal
efficiency and effectiveness, and in arbitrating cross-Complex resource allocations in line with strategic priorities. The
Committee also leads the review of corporate strategies, policies, procedures,
and guidelines throughout the Bank
Group. In this way, the SMCC has become
an important forum for information sharing amongst Senior Management, as well
as for performance monitoring, consensus building, and coordination. One of the
key initiatives coordinated by the SMCC

56

in 2010 was the Review of the Bank's Risk
Management Framework.

Key priorities for the COO Office include
coordinating the effective implementation and sustained focus of the institutional reforms confirmed by the Board of
Governors in 2010, as captured through
the ADF-12 and GCI-VI Commitment
Matrixes.

Following recommendations made by
the Task Force on assessing the effectiveness of the operations review and
approval process, Management took
action in 2010 to strengthen the functions
of the Operations Committee (OpsCom).
OpsCom was established in 2006 and
oversees operations review and approvals processes to sharpen the strategic
selectivity of the Bank Group's operations.
The Bank bolstered the capacity of the
OpsCom Secretariat through the appointment of a Director, while increasing its
allocation of high-caliber staff. OosCom
has also stepped up its efforts to ensure
quality-at-entry in operations, including
increased alignment of its guidance with
Board decisions and recommendations,
and by strengthening the upstream peer
review and country team structures.

 

Budget Reforms

In January 2010, the Bank launched
the Unit of Account (UA) Budgeting
System, which is a key component of
Phase Il of the ongoing budget reforms.
UA Budgeting has further decentralized
budget management, as the responsibility for managing financial resources is
delegated to Managers, who are empow
ered to make decisions geared toward
achieving results.

With the advent of UA Budgeting, the
Bank discontinued Staff Headcount
Control. However, as compensating
controls, the Bank introduced a more
rigorous staff planning process and
established Fixed Cost Ratios (FCRs).
The Annual Staff Plans and the FCRs are
intended to strengthen the alignment of
staff numbers, skills, experiences, grade
levels, and profiles to Work Program
needs, while containing costs. The new
system has empowered Managers and
facilitates holding them accountable
whilst maintaining an appropriate level
of control by Senior Management.

Decentralization

The Bank continues its decentralization
exercise by hosting well-staffed, fully
equipped, and effective field offices.
At year-end 2010, the Bank had signed
Host Country Agreements for its targeted 26 field offices, of which 23 are
fully equipped and functioning, with
differing levels of staffing mix. A comprehensive revision of the Delegation
of Authority Matrix was carried out in
2010; this has subsequently empowered
field offices with the authority to negotiate, sign and administer loans, manage portfolios, supervise projects, and
dialogue with RMCs and partners. To
reaffirm its commitment and deepen
the benefits to be garnered from the
decentralization process, the Bank is
fine-tuning its implementation plan
through a Decentralization Roadmap,
to be approved in 2011. The objectives

work to support policy dialogue; (ii) to
expand the Bank’s presence in fragile
states to enhance portfolio management and address weak government
capacity; and (iii) to consolidate regional
capacity by establishing five Regional
Service Centers. The ultimate goal is
to improve the Bank Group's portfolio,
strengthen analytical work, and provide
clients with assistance tailored to their
specific needs.

Annual Report 2010

Operations Business Processes

As part of the ongoing enhancements
to its operations business processes, the
Bank undertook an organizational finetuning exercise in 2010, to set up and
strengthen those units responsible for
sharpening the Bank’s strategic focus,
reinforcing its mandate, and directing
its Managing for Results agenda. The
fine-tuning exercise included: establishing the Energy, Environment and
Climate Change (ONEC) department
and the new Strategy Office (STRG)
within the Presidency, as well as placing the Quality Assurance and Results
(ORQR) department within the oversight
of the COO.

The fine-tuning exercise, together with
the decentralization process, led to considerable improvements in a number
of the Bank Group’s Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) for 2010 (see Table
4.1). These include: (i) improved portfolio management, supervision, procurement, financial management, and portfolio quality; (ii) enhanced dialogue with
RMCs and closer coordination with other
development partners in line with the
commitments of the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda
for Action; and (iii) timeliness in the delivery of some key knowledge products
such as Country Strategy Papers and
ESW. But certain slippages in the KPls

57Chapter 4 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

have raised some concerns such as the
slow disbursement rates, and the need to
accelerate field-based professional (PL)
staff levels. In this connection, the internal business processes continue to be
under review to identify the constraints
that need to be addressed and areas for
further improvements.

Strengthening Risk

Management Capacity

On the basis of the growing volume of
private sector operations in both ADB
and ADF countries, and following the
Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI),
the Bank has made the strengthening of
its risk management capacity a key priority. Accordingly, the Bank is taking steps
to mainstream risk management in its
operations in a systematic and holistic way.
During the year, the Bank took the first significant step toward developing the Bank
Enterprise Risk Management Framework.
The goal is to reinforce the Bank’s risk governance structure for the credit approval
process and operations risks as the size of
its portfolio grows and the share of private
sector operations increases.

COMPLIANCE REVIEW
AND MEDIATION

he Bank Group established the
ndependent Review Mechanism (IRM)
oO promote accountability in its operaions. IRM is mandated to examine comlaints from parties adversely affected
by any Bank-financed operations and to
effect appropriate remedy through comliance review or mediation. The review
examines whether, as a result of noncompliance with the Bank’s policies and
rocedures, harm has been inflicted on
eople and/or the environment. It recommends remedies that the Bank can carry
out through improvements to the projects
hat are the subject of complaint, as well
as in its internal systems and procedures.
lediation facilitates dialogue among the
requestors, the Bank and any other interested parties to find agreeable solutions
‘0 complainants’ grievances.

 

58

Following the 2009/2010 IRM structure and process review, the Boards of
Directors approved key amendments
to the IRM Rules. The amended Rules
enhance the independence of the mechanism by providing:

* that the Director of the Unit admin
istering the IRM be appointed by the

President with concurrence by the

Boards;

* that the Compliance Review Panels

comprise the three IRM Experts

appointed by the Boards for a nonrenewable term of five years;

* facilitation of accessibility to the IRM

by permitting complainants to submit

heir requests to the mechanism by any
means at their disposal;

* enhanced effectiveness of the review
process by providing Bank Management
with the opportunity to submit a
response action plan to address the
instances of noncompliance and mitigate the inflicted harm.

 

 

 

 

Two new complaints were received in
2010. The first relates to the MarrakechAgadir Highway Project in Morocco,
concerning compensation of damages
caused to farm land, houses, and access
to land and water. This complaint is being
handled through a problem-solving exercise. The second complaint relates to the
Medupi Power Project in South Africa and
concerns climate, environmental, social,
and procurement issues. This was registered for compliance review.

 

With respect to complaints submitted to
the IRM in previous years, the Bujagali
Hydropower and Interconnection Projects
in Uganda continue to be subject to
IRM monitoring. On the two complaints
received about the Gibe Ill Hydropower
Project in Ethiopia, the concern over the
negative impact on Lake Turkana and
on livelihoods of people living alongside
the Lake was handled through problemsolving. The case concerning Gibe IIl’s
impact on the Omo River basin in Ethiopia
and on procurement issues was registered for compliance review, however, it

has been closed, as the Bank is no longer
financing the project. Similarly, the case
regarding the Combined Cycle Power
Plant Project in Egypt has been closed
owing to the relocation of the project.

In 2010, the Bank organized subregional
workshops and community sessions and
participated in internal seminars, national
workshops, and regional training programs to raise awareness of the IRM.
Full information about the IRM, including functions, activities, and registered
complaints, are posted on the Bank
website (www.afdb.org/irm).

EVALUATION OF OPERATIONS

A wide range of evaluation activities
was carried out in 2010. A major independent evaluation of the Bank’s system of operations supervision concluded
that it needed to be overhauled. These
recommendations were taken up by
Management in a program of reforms.
Other major evaluations were initiated
during 2010 and the reports on them
will be published in early 2011. These
include evaluations on the Bank’s policy-based operations, its assistance to
fragile states, and its implementation
of the Paris Declaration.

In 2010 the Bank, jointly with other major
donors, completed a quantitative review
of donor assistance to public financial
management in Africa. Project evaluations covering operations in the energy, transportation, and water subsectors, natural resources management, and
institutional capacity develooment were
also completed.

The Operations Evaluation Department
also undertook several reviews. These
included synthesis studies of lessons
learned from Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) and Expanded Supervision
Reports (XSRs) for private sector operations, and a global review of evaluation
evidence on gender mainstreaming. A
summary of these reviews is presented in

Annual Report 2010Chapter 2 in the section on “Knowledge
Development from Operational Activities.”

The department also organized seminars and workshops to enhance evaluation capacity. For instance, a training
session was given to Bank staff on the
evaluation of private sector operations.
Furthermore, the Bank lent its support
to an evaluation seminar for stakeholders
in Morocco’s water sector and it developed exchange programs with development partners such as the Islamic
Development Bank (ISDB). The Bank
is also supporting a global program to
establish regional Centers for Learning
on Evaluation and Results (CLEAR),
which firmly adheres to the institution's
focus on knowledge development and
establishing regional centers of excellence in evaluation.

INTERNAL AUDIT

In accordance with its mandate, the
Internal Audit Department provides
independent and objective assurance,
advisory, and consulting services for the
Bank Group operations, finance, and corporate administrative activities. By so
doing, reasonable assurance is given to
the Board and Senior Management that
the internal resources of the Bank and
those allocated to operational activities
are being appropriately safeguarded
and efficiently and effectively utilized,
in line with the Bank’s objectives and in
compliance with relevant regulations
and policies. The department adopts
a methodology of identifying essential,
auditable activities of the Bank, assessing the attendant risks, and determining
the frequency with which such activities are to be audited. The department’s Annual Work Program provides
reasonable assurance to the Board and
Management of meeting Internal Audit
responsibilities within the constraints of
the available resources.

Internal Audit maintains a quality assurance program consisting, among others,

Annual Report 2010

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 4

of internal and external quality assessments. External quality assessment is
conducted every five years. In November
2010, an external quality assessment
was carried out by the Institute of
Internal Auditors, which resulted in the
Bank’s Internal Audit being awarded
the Institute’s highest rating. This confirms that the department conducts its
activities in line with the International
Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing.

In 2010, the Bank conducted: 12 audits in
the Finance and Corporate Complexes, 20
audits of trust and grant funds, 10 project audits in the RMCs, and six audits in
field/regional offices. There were three
specially requested audits and advisory
services undertaken.

INTEGRITY AND
ANTI-CORRUPTION

Within the context of the Bank’s 2010 initiative to fine-tune its organizational structure, the Integrity and Anti-Corruption
function, formerly part of the Office of
the Auditor General, was upgraded to
a separate department. In the course of
the year, the department witnessed more
than a 100 percent increase in the number of its investigative staff compared
to 2009. Today the department has six
principal investigators and three senior
investigators.

During 2010, the Bank received 35
complaints, all of which were reviewed.
Twenty-one were closed, with two resulting in the debarment of one company and
two individuals. Sanctions proceedings
concerning the function’s recommendation to debar another company and an
individual were still ongoing at year-end,
as were 16 other investigations.

With respect to preventive activities, the
focus was on exploring the use of new
investigative technologies and on developing a red-flag system for preemptive
detection of potential cases of fraud and

corruption in Bank-financed projects. In
addition, during the year under review the
Bank held a regional workshop aimed at
sensitizing project beneficiaries, government officials, Bank staff, and NGOs on
issues of fraud and corruption.

In 2010, the Bank joined the World
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, and the Inter-American
Development Bank in signing the
Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of
Debarment Decisions. This agreement
establishes a system whereby the compliance and enforcement actions on sanctions, carried out by one participating
institution, can be mutually enforced
by others, thus substantially strengthening the efforts of any one institution
to deter and prevent corrupt practices.
Accordingly, the department has focused
on developing policies, processes, and
procedures necessary to implement the
agreement with sister institutions.

To improve overall investigations management, the Bank completed the review of
alternative, off-the-shelf commercial systems to replace the current case management system. In addition, the department
developed a communications strategy
for increasing general awareness of the
challenges of integrity and anti-corruption, both within and outside the Bank. In
line with best practice, the Bank is considering the outsourcing of its whistleblowing hotline to an independent service
provider.

LEGAL SERVICES

The 2009 restructuring of the Legal
Services function of the Bank strengthened the institution’s capacity to
mitigate the growing risks arising from its
increased nonsovereign lending portfolio.
Accordingly, during 2010 the department
proactively engaged in the negotiation
and conclusion of the Sixth General Capital
Increase of the Bank (GCI-VI) and the consultations for the ADF-12 replenishment.

59Chapter 4 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

The Bank developed an innovative fourstep process to ensure the total allocation of all shares from GCI-VI. This enabled
its member countries to subscribe to the
full general capital increase, thus mitigating the risk of capital subscription arrears,
which had occurred previously. The Bank
also revised its Share Transfer Rules to
enable member countries to continue, as
far as possible, to preserve their preemptive rights as shareholders of the Bank.

The Legal Services also advised and counseled the Board of Governors with respect
to increasing the number of Executive
Directors on the Board of Directors, under
Article 33 of the Bank Agreement, in order
to enhance the governance of the Bank.

During the year, in addition to its regular
support to the Bank’s operations and its
sovereign and nonsovereign guaranteed
transactions, Legal Services achieved the
following outcomes:

* assisted in drafting contracts for the
rehabilitation of its headquarters building in Abidjan, and to lease or buy real
estate properties for field offices;

* favorably resolved the Bank’s claims in

respect of its outstanding investment

in a restructured investment vehicle;

* assisted in the implementation of the

Bank’s borrowing program, including

he successful completion of several

socially responsible bond issues;

* advised the Bank to approve its sec
ond risk management product to a

orrower;

* negotiated and drafted the documen
ation for a number of new multilat
eral funds, including the Zimbabwe
ultidonor Trust Fund and several climate funds;

¢ drafted a Bank policy on de facto

governments, providing clear guide
ines on how to deal with them;

* advised the Board of Directors on the

review and reform of the Independent

Review Mechanism and the Bank’s
Compliance Review Unit; and

* advised on the structuring and implementation of the Integrity and Anti

against firms confirmed to have
engaged in procurement misconduct.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
AND DEVELOPMENT

Development Research

Significant progress was made during
2010 in enhancing the Bank's visibility
through the mainstreaming of knowledge
development in Bank Group operations.
This strategic thrust, which is an institutionwide approach engaging various departments, included the following activities:

* high-quality research to generate a
deeper understanding of the development challenges facing the continent;

* enhancing the Bank’s statistical capacity and knowledge platforms for which
it has designed and maintained a Data
Portal to facilitate online access to its
statistical databases;

* strengthening the network of economists through more frequent interaction and professional exchange (seminars, workshop) to enhance the quality
of knowledge products; and

* increased collaboration with the
Operations Complexes, especially in
the preparation of knowledge products related to Economic and Sector
Work (ESW).

Building on the momentum acquired in
crisis-response activities in 2009, the
Bank contributed significantly in 2010
to policy dialogue in RMCs, providing analytical and policy support to the activities
of the Committee of Ten (C-10) African
Ministers of Finance and Central Bank
Governors. This support also helped
to build a consensus, whereby Africa’s
voice could be clearly heard at key international fora, such as the Third KoreaAfrica Economic Cooperation (KOAFEC)
meeting in September 2010 and the G-20
Summit in Korea in November 2010.

The Bank's knowledge activities during
the year also contributed to improving
the quality-at-entry of Bank operations,
through the implementation of the ex-ante
Additionality and Development Outcomes
Assessment (ADOA) framework. This exercise created a platform to benchmark
development outcomes and improve the
institution’s development effectiveness.

The Bank also made significant improvements in the quality of its flagship reports,
such as the African Economic Outlook
(AEO), the African Development Report
(ADR), and the African Competitiveness
Report (ACR). With the Bank as leading
partner, the AEO now covers virtually the
entire continent (50 countries) and continues to provide high-quality economic
analysis and comparative statistics on
economic, social, and governance-related
developments in African economies, while
also offering an evaluation of short-term
prospects. The AEO is now in its tenth
year, and has become an authoritative
source of information for decisionmakers
both in Africa and globally. Its readership
covers development organizations, civil
society organizations, academic institutions, and stakeholders in the private and
nonprofit sectors who need reliable, upto-date information on economic, social,
and political developments in Africa. The
AEO, the ACR, and the ADR have thus
helped to position the Bank Group as the
premier knowledge bank for Africa.

The Fifth African Economic Conference
(AEC) was held in Tunis, Tunisia, on October
27-29, 2010 on the theme: “Setting the
Agenda for Africa’s Economic Recovery
and Long-term Growth.” The Conference
was attended by 360 participants comprising academics, policymakers, businessmen, and development practitioners from Africa and beyond. In line with
the Bank’s Knowledge Management and
Development Strategy 2008-2010, the
AEC fulfills the capacity building as well
as the knowledge generation and sharing objectives of the Bank and combines
technical knowledge sharing and policy
dialogue at the highest level.

 

Annual Report 2010Capacity Building and

Training Activities in RMCs

During the year, activities in this area
supported two key pillars of the Bank
Group Capacity Development (CD)
Strategy, namely: Pillar 1: enhancing
the development effectiveness of Bank
Group operations and Pil/ar 2: strengthening the capacity of RMCs for policy
design and development management.
Under Pillar 1, the Bank delivered 11
workshops on the following themes; (i)
Bank Rules and Procedures; (ii) Project
Performance Improvement Planning; (iii)
Project Monitoring and Evaluation; (iv)
Scaling Up Poverty Reduction Strategies;
(v) Project-Cycle Management; and (vi)
Performance-Based Allocation of ADF
Resources and the Debt Sustainability
Framework (PBA/DSF). Under Pillar 2,
the Bank delivered 28 seminars and workshops to bolster the capacity of policymakers to effectively design and implement their own economic policies, and
engage in policy dialogue. Altogether,
1,395 participants attended the Bank’s
seminars and workshops delivered under
Pillars | and Il of the CD Strategy.

Among the seminars and workshops provided under Pillar 2, some were delivered
under partnership agreements. One such
agreement was the Joint Partnership for
Africa (JPA) platform between the IMF
Institute and the Bank, which continued
the longstanding partnership established
in 1999 under the Joint Africa Institute
for the delivery of seminars and workshops. In 2010, 21 seminars were delivered
in Tunis and other African venues under
the new JPA platform, 11 of which were
conducted by the IMF Institute, while
the Bank took the lead in organizing the
remaining 10. Similarly, an understanding
was reached with the World Bank Institute,
which led to a workshop being held in
Tunis in November 2010 on the theme of
“Strategic Choices for Education Reforms
in Africa.” Furthermore, the Bank, in partnership with Boston College, delivered in
Tunis an Executive Education Program
on Building World Class Universities for
Presidents, Vice-Chancellors and Rectors

Annual Report 2010

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 4

of African Universities. The Harvard
Kennedy School, in partnership with
the Bank, also delivered one seminar in
Rwanda on “ICT and Education.”

In October 2010, the Bank launched a
Learning and Talent Management System.
This distance learning training platform
is designed to disseminate the Bank’s
knowledge products more widely and to
make training events more readily available to any registered participant on the
continent. This will also enable the Bank
to organize online courses and coordinate Bank staff assistance, based on the
needs and requests from RMCs, through
coaching, tutorial assistance, and learning communities.

Eminent Speakers’ Program

he Eminent Speakers’ Program was
jaunched in 2006 by the Bank to create
a platform for the sharing of views on
Africa’s development issues and thereby
romote a discourse on policy options.
n 2010, three renowned experts made
heir presentations under the program
he first was Professor Joseph Stiglitz,
a Nobel Laureate in Economic Science
(2001), who delivered his presentation on

“Post Financial Crisis: Options for Africa.”

The second speaker was Professor Wole
Soyinka, a Nobel Laureate in English
Literature (1986), who took as his theme,
The Role of African Intellectuals in the
Development of Africa.” The final speaker
was Dr. Jean-Michel Severino, former Vice
President for Asia of the World Bank, who
made his presentation on “New Challenges
in the Political Economy of Africa.” After
he presentations, stimulating discussions
were held with the audience comprising
he Diplomatic Corps in Tunis, Boards of
Directors, Senior Management, and staff.

 

Statistical Capacity Building

and Data Dissemination in Support

of Results Measurement

The statistical activities of the Bank focus
on: (i) building capacity in 52 RMCs (with
limited support to Somalia through participation in some workshops), five subregional organizations, and six regional

training centers, (ii) mainstreaming
results measurement in Bank operations, including developing the Data
Portal (DP); and (iii) enhancing partnerships with other multilateral and bilateral
donors for the coordination of statistical
activities in the region. The Data Portal
is a web-based system that provides all
Bank staff with direct online access to a
wide range of development data managed by the Bank. A Core Data Portal system is also being developed by the Bank
which will be made available to RMCs to
strengthen data management and dissemination systems in their countries and
to facilitate data exchange between them
and the AfDB.

Statistical Capacity-building
Activities in RMCs

During the year under review, the
Bank, jointly with the African Union
Commission (AUC) and the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), develope
the Strategy for the Harmonization o
Statistics in Africa (SHaSA) to provide
the statistical framework for the African
integration agenda espoused by the AU
Summit. The SHaSA was approved an
adopted by the African Heads of State
and Government at the July 2010 AU
Summit in Kampala. The Bank, ECA, AU,
and UNDP also prepared the 2010 MDG
report, “Assessing Progress in Africa
toward the Millennium Developmen
Goals,” which was presented an
approved at the 2010 AU Summit.

The Bank played a key role in the area o
social statistics in 2010, where it:

(i) mobilized RMCs to participate in the
2010 Round of the Population an
Housing Census (RPHC), including
rendering assistance in processing
and analyzing their data;

ii) assisted in improving the quality o
the data for monitoring progress
toward achievement of the MDGs,
with an emphasis on using nationa
ly produced data rather than relying
entirely on international datasets;
and

 

61Chapter 4 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

(iii) in collaboration with other partners,
revived Civil Registration and Vital

Statistics (CRVS).

As a result of these efforts, for the first
time in the history of census taking, all
RMCs committed to undertake the 2010
RPHC. This culminated in August 2010 in
the First Conference of African Ministers
responsible for CRVS, held in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia. The conference made
recommendations on how to improve
civil status information for efficient public administration and generation of vital
statistics for national development and
MDGs monitoring in RMCs.

The Bank assists RMCs in improving their
country-level knowledge base of the infrastructure sector. In cooperation with other
donors, it has formulated a comprehensive
capacity-building program for improving
agricultural and rural development statistics in RMCs and has initiated the design
of a database to inform agriculture and
food policy management in RMCs. In addition, during 2010 the Bank worked with
RMCs to improve their statistical information systems in the following areas: labor,
health, education, gender, governance,
environment and climate change.

During the year under review, the Bank
continued to coordinate the International
Comparison Program (ICP) global statistical initiative in RMCs. Furthermore,
it assisted RMCs in their price data collection and analysis activities. The Bank
also helped them to improve their national accounts systems, and to this end
drew up the “African Strategy for the
Implementation of SNAO8.” This strategy was adopted by all RMCs and the UN
Statistical Commission and was approved
by the 2010 AU Summit.

The Bank provided financial assistance
and technical guidance to help RMCs
improve their data processing, storage,
and dissemination systems. Assistance
was also provided on enhancing the
exploitation of unused or underutilized
existing data in RMCs.

62

Statistical Support to Enhance the Bank’s
Operational Effectiveness and Financial
Services

In addition to building statistical capacity
in RMCs, statistical support was provided
by the Bank for country programming
and project cycle activities. The aim is to
help mainstream results measurement in
Bank operations and ensure the effective
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of
development impacts arising from these
operations and from national development programs. The process of preparing
Country Statistical Profiles (CStPs) was
launched in 2010 to address the data
issues for M&E and provide the necessary
baseline data for country programming.
To this end, nine CStPs and one Regional
Integration Statistical Profile (RIStP) were
prepared.

Other initiatives along these lines included: (i) the elaboration of the Statistical
Framework for Bank Operations, which
has so far been used to design 11 operational and seven governance projects that
had substantial statistical components;
ii) enhancing data management and
dissemination by launching an internet
version of the Data Portal, which provides external users with access to more
than 800 indicators; and (iii) organizing
a workshop for staff from RMCs’ central
banks on the African Financial Markets
Initiative (AFMI) Database, to examine
methods and concepts to improve data
quality and increase the response rate.

Enhancing Statistical Partnerships

Wider coordination of statistical activities was achieved through the African
Statistical Coordination Committee
(ASCC), which is chaired jointly by the
Bank and ECA. It comprises the four
regional institutions (AfDB, AU, ECA, and
ACBF); five subregional organizations;
six African Statistical Training Centers,
and selected African countries. The ASCC
analyzes mechanisms for achieving greater synergy among the institutions and
provides a forum for coordinating statistical programs and activities in various
countries. The Bank has also established

strong partnerships with other bilateral
and multilateral development institutions
to provide technical assistance, funding,
monitoring, and supervision of statistical
activities in RMCs. The network of partners includes the World Bank, IMF, Paris21,
ECA, UNDP, DFID, INSEE-France, ACBF,
ILO, FAO, UNSD, and WHO.

Statistical Publications

The following flagship statistical publications were generated by the Bank in
2010: African Statistical Journal (May and
November issues); Market Briefs on development topics; African Statistical Yearbook;
Gender, Poverty and Environmental
Indicators; AfDB Statistics Pocket Book;
MDGs Progress Report for Africa, 2010;
Annual Report of the Bank Group; and
Compendium of Statistics on Bank Group
Operations. |n addition, five Market Studies
were prepared in 2010 using Bank data;
and 52 weekly Africa Economic & Financial
Briefs were disseminated widely, both
within and outside the Bank.

INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
(ICT) MANAGEMENT

The main activities in 2010 focused on the
implementation of the IT Renewal Action
Plan, which had been approved by the
Board in October 2009. The Action Plan
aims to improve the Bank’s IT infrastructure and to support strategic initiatives
such as decentralization, the streamlining
of business processes, human resources
management, financial management, and
knowledge management.

During the year, improvements were
made to the IT infrastructure in the areas
of network performance and monitoring; installation of Wi-Fi in the Bank’s
buildings in Tunis; the connection of staff
remotely to the Bank’s central IT systems;
and completion of the initial phase of the
windows environment server consolidation project. With respect to IT support
to core Bank strategies and functions, the
following progress was made:

Annual Report 2010Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 4

By the end of 2010, 25 field offices (FOs) had been directly connected to Information Technology (IT) services, including video
conferencing, hosted by the Bank’s TRA in Tunis. Field Office workflow management is being streamlined, with each SAP module rolled out to FOs. These modules include institutional procurement systems that allow FOs to create purchase requisitions
and purchase orders online, for approval by Resident Representatives. The Uganda FO is acting as a pilot.

The Bank’s consultant procurement system was rolled out to eight FOs in 2010. The system allows for the online registration,
short-listing, recruitment, and management of consultants in different domains. A pilot project for travel accounting and management services was implemented in the FOs of Burkina Faso, Céte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda, and rollout was completed by December 2010 as planned. In addition, IT systems in FOs were upgraded to facilitate reporting, support
new financial products, provide FOs with a secure disbursement platform, and better integrate them with the TRA.

In an effort to improve the Wide Area Network (WAN) and telecommunication services, action was taken to reduce the latency
in Head Office communications with the FOs. The Bank installed high-definition video conferencing equipment to enable certain
FOs to hold quality video conference sessions with partners worldwide. Throughout 2010, the Bank trained IT technicians both
in FOs and in Tunis to improve and support the skills needed for the new technology.

+ Decentralization Process: 25 field
offices (FOs) became fully operational on the Bank’s Wide Area
Network (WAN) via the VSAT, except
for Angola. Automatic backups for
data for 20 FOs were conducted ona
daily basis. Multi video-conferencing
is possible with all FOs, resulting in
the reduction of the IT gap between
the Head Office and the FOs. In 2010,
many ongoing IT activities were linked
to strengthening FO capacity and
enhancing staff productivity (see
Box 411).

+ Business Process Improvements: |T
systems have been enhanced and
improved to process operations funded by initiatives such as the Globa
Liquidity Trade Program, the Congo
Basin Forest Fund, and the NEPAD
Infrastructure Project Preparation
Facility (NEPAD-IPPF). The firs
phase of the SAP Upgrade projec
has advanced significantly and the
technical upgrade is scheduled to go
live in February 2011.

+ Human Resources Management: |
support to human resources management has resulted in the processing

 

Annual Report 2010

of all FO salaries centrally by using a
multi-currency payroll. In addition,
e-recruitment and e-learning systems
have been implemented.

+ Financial Management: The Bank is
continuously optimizing and providing
better integration of its core financial
systems such as SAP and SUMMIT.
Processes for the management of
trust fund operations have also been
automated.

HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT

The Bank has continued to make progress in attracting and retaining the best
talent on the market within the framework of the Human Resources Strategy
(2007-2011) and the corporate services
reform agenda. During 2010, 244 new
staff joined the Bank, of whom 26 were
young professionals. Internal capacity
was further enhanced with 152 promotions through internal competition and
in-situ recommendations.

The total number of Bank staff rose from
1,654 in 2009 to 1,789 in 2010, which is
an increase of 8.2 percent. This includes
Management and Professional Level (PL)
and General Services (GS) staff in the
Bank’s FOs. There were 1,101 PL staff in
total in 2010, including advisors to the
Executive Directors, and 688 GS staff.
In terms of gender, 27.2 percent of PL
staff and 54.5 percent of GS staff were
female (see Table 4.2). During the year,
the Bank recruited an additional 11 new
staff for the 26 FOs. This increased by
almost 4 percent the number of locally
recruited FO staff over the year, from
285 in 2009 to 296 in 2010.

During the year under review, the
Bank launched its Learning and
Development Strategy and Career
Development Framework. This represents a coordinated effort to strengthen internal capacity, leverage the
career development path of staff and
Management, improve retention, and
enhance service delivery to the RMCs.

The compensation reform was further
enhanced with “Pay for Performance” to
encourage employee productivity and
better position the Bank to attract, motivate, and retain the best talent. This reform
supported the new performance management system, which resulted in 98.9 percent
of staff participating in the evaluations that
took place in 2010. This provided a fair basis
to manage the staff performance system.

PROCUREMENT AND
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
(PFM)

In supporting the Operations Complexes,
the Procurement and Financial
Management (PFM) services focus on
improving the delivery of procurement
services, while minimizing fiduciary risks
and enhancing accountability. During
2010, the Bank continued with the consolidation of the PFM reform initiatives
started in previous years. The following
major activities, among others, were performed during the year:

(i) Completing the review of country National Competitive Bidding
procurement laws, procedures and
bidding documents for 25 RMCs
to determine the use of country
NCB procedures for Bank-financed
projects; and the publication of five

In order to reduce the fiduciary risk and
ensure that the proceeds of loans and
grants were being used for the purposes intended, the Bank positioned key
PFM international and local staff in the
Service Centers and FOs. The Bank was
also regularly involved in assessing the
procurement and financial management
arrangements of projects and programs.

 

EXTERNAL RELATIONS AND
COMMUNICATIONS

The Bank is making progress in achieving
higher visibility, transparency, and modernization in its communications platforms:

+ The Bank's new website (www.afdb.
org) has attracted increased numbers
of visitors. Between 2009-2010, daily
visits rose by 24.3 percent, page views
by 8.3 percent, and unique visitors by
18.7 percent. In addition, in 2010 the
Bank reached out to social networking,
securing 1,250 followers on Facebook.

* The AfDB has expanded its range of
multimedia products and services,
almost doubling its production and
posting of videos on its website from
170 in 2009 to 330 in 2010. It has also
expanded its partnerships with African
and international TV networks to cover
Bank activities and air about 20 documentaries produced by the Bank.

* Inadrive to promote interaction with
various media and raise the Bank’s profile, over 100 internal and international
events were covered during the year,
including the Bank Group’s Annual
Meetings, the launch of the African
Economic Outlook, and related conference activities. The 2010 Annual
Meetings attracted a record number
of journalists, 81.7 percent more than
in 2009. Furthermore, the Bank was

Annual Report 2010quoted in the African and international
press (excluding radio and TV) 15 percent more in 2010 than in 2009.

* Media training sessions were organized for Senior Management, managers, and Resident Representatives, and
three refresher sessions were organized for staff in the External Relations
and Communications Unit (ERCU).
The Bank for the first time organized a
capacity-building workshop for African
media, which was attended by 20 participants from all the subregions of the
continent.

In order to better align its external relations and communications function with
its new strategies and priorities, the Bank
launched a study in 2010 to consider an
in-depth restructuring of the unit.

CORPORATE
ADJUDICATION SERVICES

Administrative Tribunal

The Administrative Tribunal is an independent organ of the Bank and the ultimate forum for the resolution of disputes
between members of staff and the Bank. It
hears applications of staff members contesting administrative decisions concerning the non-observance of the contract of
employment, conditions of employment,
or dismissal after exhaustion of all other
administrative recourse mechanisms.

In 2010, the Tribunal held one judicial
session in which it considered and rendered judgment in four cases. It also held
one administrative session dedicated to
considering and adopting amendments
of the Tribunal’s Rules of Procedure. In
addition, the Tribunal held a working
session with General Counsel and Legal
Services Department, Human Resources
Department, Staff Council and the Appeals
Committee, all of which are involved in the
work of the Tribunal. It also proposed and
submitted for General Counsel’s consideration, several amendments of provisions
in the Tribunal’s Statute.

Tribunal held an information and outreach training session for Field Office (FO)
Resident Representatives, as well as for
staff from the East Africa subregion.

Ethics Office

As the anchor of the corporate ethics culture of the Bank, the Ethics Office’s principal functions include promoting awareness and understanding of the Bank’s core
values and ethical standards. Specifically,
the office provides advice and guidance to
staff and management; carries out ethics
awareness-raising activities; and conducts
financial disclosures for Bank staff.

In the course of 2010, the Ethics Office met
and consulted with 198 staff and other clients. Of the total 63 cases/issues brought
to the Office during the year, 53 (81.5 percent) were either resolved by direct intervention or referred to appropriate internal
organs for resolution. The others were
staff requests for guidance, clarification,
or counseling.

To increase awareness on ethical issues
and standards of conduct, the Ethics
Office carried out the following awareness-raising activities during 2010:

* information and outreach training sessions, including a regional workshop in
Tunis and in 12 field offices;

* consultations on ethical issues with
members of Senior Management,
including FO Resident Representatives;

* regional workshops to discuss ethical
issues and dilemmas;

* induction training on ethics and Bank
values for new staff; and

* in partnership with the Ombudsman,
Staff Council and Human Resources
Department held a “Conflict Transparency Week” to provide staff with
an opportunity to raise and discuss
ethical issues.

To enhance cooperation, the Office carried
out exchanges with comparable organs
in sister institutions, including the World
Bank, the IMF, and the IDB. As part of its
responsibilities, the Office undertook the
annual Financial Disclosure exercise with
a 97.5 percent response rate, following up
on cases of real, potential, or perceived
conflict of interest with the requisite advice
and counseling.

Ombudsman’s Office

The Office of the Ombudsman is the designated neutral and impartial conflict resolution practitioner in the Bank, whose
primary function is to provide confidential,
independent, and informal assistance to
staff on grievances and complaints related
to human resources and workplace issues.
In 2010, the Bank launched the “Conflict
Transparency Week,” during which various activities seeking to reduce workrelated conflicts were held. During the
year, the Bank received 103 issue-based
complaints/cases. Of these, 94 were dealt
with and closed, while efforts continued
to address the eight cases that had been
carried over to the following year, and
one complaint was referred to the Staff
Appeals Committee.

In its ongoing program to resolve
and, where possible, forestall conflicts,
the Bank held a Skills Development
of Conflict Competencies Program
for Senior Managers, and two Joint
Working Sessions with the Resident
Representatives. This was intended to
revisit the available frameworks for informal conflict resolution within Bank values.
In addition, advocacy and outreach activities were undertaken for selected FOs.

Increase (GCI-VI) as well as the increase

Annual Report 2010in the number of seats on the Boards
of Directors. The Governors observed
that this expression of confidence needed to be matched on the Bank’s part by
redoubled efforts to improve the effectiveness of the decentralization process,
reinforce its results agenda, and promote
the development of Africa’s private sector, including in ADF-eligible countries.

The Governors stressed the need for the
Bank to concentrate its interventions in
areas where it had a distinct comparative advantage, such as the development
of infrastructure, the promotion of the
private sector and regional integration,
support to fragile states, and improved
access to water and sanitation in regional
member countries.

Finally, the Governors congratulated
the Bank Group President, Dr. Donald
Kaberuka, on his re-election. They urged

already initiated to improve the Bank’s
operations.

BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

The Boards of Directors continued to ensure
adherence to the Bank Group’s MediumTerm Strategy (MTS) 2008-2012, in the
regional and country strategies, projects,
and other documents it reviewed and/or
approved. The implementation of the MTS
as well as quality assurance and results,
were the cornerstones of the organizational
fine-tuning which the Board of Directors
of the Bank approved. In this connection,
the Board approved a renewed focus and
scaling-up of resources to infrastructure
development in the RMCs. This would
be achieved by splitting the infrastructure department into two departments,
namely the: (i) Transport Department
and (ii) Energy Department. The Quality
Assurance and Results Department was
also brought under the supervision of the
Vice President, COO, to ensure a compre
72

hensive results and quality-driven operations culture. Furthermore, additional resources were allocated to enhance
quality at entry, through the Board’s
creation of an OpsCom Secretariat, also
under the oversight of the Vice President,
COO. To ensure clarity and a common
understanding both internally and externally, in the measurement of results, the
Boards of Directors of the Bank and the
Fund approved a “One Bank” Results
Measurements Framework (RMF).

Financial resource mobilization, as a key
2010 Bank Group activity, consumed a
considerable amount of the Boards’ time.
In this regard, the ADB Board of Directors
endorsed the documents containing the
proposals for the GCI-VI, as well as the
related institutional reforms, and the
amendments to the Share Transfer Rules,
all of which were approved by the ADB
Board of Governors at the 2010 Annual
Meetings. Members of the Boards of
Directors also participated in all the replenishment meetings for the ADF-12, and
actively made the case with their relevant
capitals for the ADF-12.

 

 

Fifty percent of the members of the Board
of Directors completed their term of office
and were replaced by new members following the general election of Executive
Directors, conducted by the Board
of Governors during the 2010 Annual
Meetings. Furthermore, to ensure wider
shareholder representation on the Board
of Directors, the Governors approved two
additional seats (one each for regional and non-regional member countries)
to the Board. Following this approval for
the increase in Board size, the Board of
Directors brought relevant revisions to the
subsidiary procedures for representation
on the Board of Directors of the Fund, and
the various committees of the Boards.

Board members also focused on issues
of integration of new members and had
general discussions on Board performance during the induction and retreat
of Board members. The retreat deepened
the successful collaboration between

the President, Boards of Directors, and
Management regarding the work ahead.

2011 Administrative Expenses and
Capital Expenditure Budgets

In December 2010, the Board of Directors
of the Bank approved an Administrative
Expenses and Capital Expenditure Budget
for 2011 comprising: (i) UA 289.1 million
allocated to Administrative Expenses, (ii)

and (iii) UA 2.9 million to contingency. The
Board of Directors of the Fund approved
an indicative Administrative Budget of UA

Executive Directors’

Consultation Missions

In-country dialogue with key government officials, civil society, beneficiaries
of Bank Group-financed projects, and
representatives of donor agencies is a key
annual activity of the Boards of Directors.
In this connection, Executive Directors
usually visit four regional member countries each year. Board members split into
two groups, with each group visiting two
countries. In 2010, a group of Board members visited Benin and Mali in February,
while another group visited Malawi
and Zimbabwe in March. The Executive
Directors engaged the leadership of these
countries on development issues and
were able to appreciate, at close range,
the development challenges of the people. Given the positive impact of these
visits on the Bank’s engagement with
RMCs, the Senior Advisers and Advisers
of Executive Directors also embarked on
missions to African countries with the
intention of achieving a similar objective.
The Advisers visited Cameroon and Egypt.

Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 30, 2011

he Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentaion and overall integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and
he Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board, while those of the African Development Fund were prepared ona special purpose basis.

he financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to
all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board.
janagement believes that all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The
external auditors’ report accompanies the audited financial statements.

j|anagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conormity with the basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken
‘o correct deficiencies identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by
management and internal audit and are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the
integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and
he circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as
opposed to absolute, assurance with respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control sysem can change with circumstances.

he Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUF) to assist the Boards, among
other things, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the
effectiveness of internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the
rocess for the selection of external auditors and makes recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in
urn makes recommendation for the approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management to review
and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors regularly
meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and any other matter that may require
AUFI's attention.

 

The Bank’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that
the Bank Group maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the Financial Statements for
2010. Management is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2010 financial statements.

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2010, the external auditors of the Bank
Group conducted an independent assessment of the Bank Group’s internal control framework and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group
regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2010

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2010, based on criteria
established in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting for 2010.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal control is maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting during the
year ended 31 December 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed
unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

This chapter discusses the management of the financial resources of the Bank Group’s windows—the African Development Bank

(ADB), the African Development Fund (ADF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)—during the year. It also presents the Audited

Financial Statements for 2010 for the three windows, as well as the ADB and ADF Administrative Budgets for the financial year 2011.

AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK

Financial Management

Capital Subscription

The authorized capital stock of the Bank
as undergone several capital increases
since 2008. Two special capital increases, approved in 2008 (resolution B/
BG/2008/07) and 2009 (resolution B/
BG/2009/05), allowed the Republic
of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg to apply for membership
of the Bank, increasing the authorized
capital of the Bank from UA 21.87 billion
0 UA 22112 billion.

Furthermore, Canada and Korea
responded favorably to the Bank’s need
or expanded financial capacity pending decisions on a Sixth General Capital
ncrease (GCI-V1) of the Bank by offering
a temporary increase of their callable
capital with no attached voting rights.
As a result, a special capital increase was
adopted by the Board of Governors in
2010 (resolution B/BG/2010/02), bringing the authorized capital to UA 23.95
billion. The temporary callable capital
subscribed by Canada (UA 1.63 billion)
and the Republic of Korea (UA 0.19 billion)
will be retired as soon as their subscription to GCI-VI becomes effective.

 

GCI-VI was carried out by resolution B/
BG/2010/08, and raised the authorized
capital of the Bank from UA 23.95 billion
to UA 67.69 billion as of December 31, 2010.
This represents a 200% increase in the
Bank’s authorized capital [excluding temporary callable capital and special capital
increases for Turkey and Luxembourg]
with a paid-in capital of 6%. The new
shares created under GCI-VI are to be
allocated to regional and non-regional
members in such proportions that, when

Annual Report 2010

fully subscribed, the regional group would
hold 60 percent of the total capital stock
and the non-regional group 40 percent.

The capital stock of the Bank is composed
of paid-up and callable capital. The paidup capital is the amount of capital payable
over a period determined by the relevant
General Capital Increase. For GCI-VI,
the payment period is set at 8 years for
Middle Income Countries, Blend countries
and Non-Regional member countries,
and at 12 years for ADF-eligible member countries. The callable capital is subject to payment as and when required by
the Bank to meet its obligations incurred
(a) by making or participating in direct
loans out of funds borrowed or otherwise acquired by the Bank for inclusion
in its ordinary capital resources or in special resources; or (b) by guaranteeing in
whole or in part, loans made by other
entities. This acts as protection for the
Bank's creditors and holders of Bank’s
guarantees in the event that it is not able
to meet its financial obligations. There
has never been a call on the capital of
the Bank.

A subscription becomes effective (i.e.
shares issued and corresponding voting
rights allocated) once the Bank receives
in fullthe payment for the first installment,
which triggers the issuance of the entire
callable capital portion. Shares representing the paid-up portion of a subscription
are issued as and when the Bank receives
the actual payments for such shares.

As at December 31, 2010, the paid-up
capital amounted to UA 2.38 billion, with
a paid-in capital (i.e. the portion of paidup capital that has been actually paid)
level of UA 2.36 billion. The Bank's callable
capital was UA 21.55 billion including UA
9.48 billion from non-borrowing member
countries rated A- and higher.

In accordance with the Shares Transfer
Rules, shares for which payment have
become due and remain unpaid are
forfeited after a prescribed period and
offered for subscription to member countries. In 2010, the Bank modified the Share
Transfer Rules as part of the GCI-VI process. Specifically, the priority rules for
allocation were amended; the payment
period for shares offered under these
rules were reduced, and the forfeiture
period for shares under all capital increases was aligned to 120 days.

The details of capital subscriptions
at December 31, 2010 is shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital
Stock and Voting Power, which forms part
of the Financial Statements of this Report.

Bank Rating

The rating agencies Standard & Poor’s,
Moody’s, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan
Credit Rating Agency reaffirmed their
AAA and AA+ rating of the African
Development Bank’s senior and subordinated debts respectively, with a
stable outlook. Their rating reflects the
Bank's strong membership support, its
preferred creditor status, sound capital
adequacy and prudent financial management and policies. Rating agencies
have noted positively the approval by
Board of Governors in May 2010 to triple the Bank’s capital base as a sign of
strong shareholder support for its development mandate, and growing franchise
value in the continent.

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds from the
capital markets at the lowest possible
cost to support its lending activities.
The top-notch credit ratings enjoyed by
the Bank enable it to issue securities at
low interest rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by client and cash flow

mChapter 6 African Development Bank

requirements, assets and liability management goals, and risk management
policies.

The 2010 funding program in capital
markets was approved for a maximum
amount of UA 3.62 billion including up
to UA 140 million under the Enhanced
Private Sector Assistance (EPSA) for
Africa initiative. The Bank raised UA
2.82 billion during the year including UA
14.9 million under the EPSA initiative.
The actual amount raised was guided
by the pace of the disbursements. As
at December 31, 2010, the outstanding
borrowing portfolio of the Bank stood
at UA 11.98 billion.

In terms of market conditions, while the
markets went through phases of uneasy
calm and bouts of panic, the Bank as a
triple A rated supranational institution
continued to see improvement in its funding cost levels. This is a reflection of the
Bank’s continuous effort to broaden its
investor base as well as the good performance of its bond issues in the secondary market.

The Bank has used various markets
and instruments to meet its borrowing requirements. The Bank issued its
annual USD 1 billion global bond transactions during the year in February. Private
placements, uridashi transactions’,

Table 6.1

themed bond transactions (described
below) and African currency-linked
bonds in Zambian Kwacha complete
the range of markets utilized in 2010.

The Bank also maintains a regular presence in the short-term market by issuing
under its EUR 2 billion Euro Commercial
Paper (ECP) program whose aim is to
enhance flexibility in short-term liquidity management. As at December 31,
2010, there were no amounts outstanding under the ECP program.

Themed Bond Transactions. The retail
bond market in Japan has seen a flurry
of activity where investors wish to invest
in bond issues that have a social theme
and carry top-notch credit ratings.

n 2010, the Bank established its own
niche by issuing bonds under the themes
of clean energy, education and water.
During the year, the Bank entered into
6 such bond transactions raising UA
398.9 million.

he proceeds of the bonds are included
in the ordinary capital resources of the
Bank and will be used for the general
operations of the Bank. However, under
he terms of these bond issues, the
Bank will use its best efforts to direct
an amount equal to the net proceeds
o lending to projects related to the

 

relevant theme, subject to and in accordance with the Bank’s lending standards.

A snapshot of the Bank’s activity in these
sectors is presented in Table 6.1.

Investments

The Bank’s cash and treasury investments (net of repurchase agreements)
as of December 31, 2010 totaled UA 7.83
billion, compared to UA 7.73 billion at
the end of 2009. Investment income for
2010 amounted to UA 219.22 million or
a return of 2.81 percent on an average
liquidity of UA 7.78 billion, compared to
VA 222.96 million in 2009, or a return of
3.50 percent, on an average liquidity of
UA 6.37 billion.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into
3 portfolios, namely operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equitybacked portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the cash
flow and risk profile of its assets and
funding sources. These benchmarks
are l-month LIBID for the operational portfolio, and 6-month marked-tomarket LIBOR, resetting on February 1
and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The equity-backed portfolio is managed against a repricing profile benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank’s net
assets repricing uniformly over a period
of 10 years.

Financial Products

Loans. The ADB provides loans to its
clients on non-concessional terms. The
standard loan product offered to sovereign and sovereign guaranteed clients

Annual Report 2010

is the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan
(EVSL). The loan product offered to nonsovereign guaranteed clients is the Fixed
Spread Loan (FSL).

The interest rate on the EVSL is comprised of a floating base (6-month LIBOR
for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR
for Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR), a
funding margin that is a function of the
Bank's cost of funding relative to LIBOR,
EURIBOR or JIBAR computed every six
month, and a contractual spread that was
set at 60 bps with effect from January
1, 2011. The EVSL offers a free option to
fix the floating base rate. The standard
repayment period for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans is up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years

The interest rate on the FSL is comprised
of a floating base rate (6-month LIBOR
for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR) which
remains floating until maturity date or a
fixed base rate (amortizing swap rate
set at borrower's request for disbursed
loan balances) plus a risk-based credit
spread. Non-sovereign loans have standard repayment periods up to 15 years
including a capital grace period that does
not exceed 5 years.

On May 10, 2010, the Board of Directors
of the Bank approved a revision to loan
pricing for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed operations effective January 1,
2011. This revision relates to the following:

+ Upward adjustment of the contractual
spread from 40 to 60 basis points for
new commitments;

* Introduction of a graduated commitment fee ranging from 25 to 75 basis
points, applicable only to undisbursed
amounts of fast disbursing policy based
loans after the negotiated drawdown
timetable; and

+ Periodic revision of the contractual
spread, within the framework of the
Medium-Term Financial Outlook of the
Bank, in order to assess whether the

African Development Bank Chapter 6

contractual spread provides for adequate coverage of the Bank’s operational expenses.

The Board of Directors agreed that management shall submit to the Board for
consideration, requests for upward
adjustment of the price of loans in
response to exceptional unforeseen stress
events. The Board shall approve inter alia
the qualification of an event as exceptional, the related level of pricing adjustment
and the application period.

 

Other loan structures offered by the Bank
include parallel and A/B syndications, and
local currency loans if the Bank is able
to fund efficiently in the local currency
market. These loans are offered under the
FSL pricing framework with a cost pass
through principle for local currency loans
to ensure that the overall cost of funds is
compensated.

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector
enterprises can be extended directly or
through a private financial institution
(PFI). In an agency line (AL), the credit
risk of the borrower is borne by the Bank.
In addition, the PFI acts as an agent for
the Bank, to carry out a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, identifying projects within certain parameters;
appraising such projects on behalf of the
Bank; when approved, undertaking all of
the administrative steps related to disbursement (billing, collection of Bank’s
funds, filing of security); supervising projects, monitoring the performance of the
borrower submitting reports thereon;
and transmitting amounts related to the
repayment of the loan to the Bank.

Guarantees. Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its preferred creditor status to assist eligible
borrowers to obtain financing from third
party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees will also enable borrowers to
obtain financing in their own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide such financing directly from its own
resources.

13Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Risk Management Products are offered to
enable borrowers to manage the market
risks associated with their loans from the
Bank, including interest rate, currency, and
commodity price risks. These products
assist borrowers to manage their balance
sheets and their changing needs more
efficiently over time. Risk management
products such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, interest rate caps and collars are available to borrowers at any time
during the life of the loan.

Equity Participation or Quasi Equity
Products. The Bank's ability to provide
risk capital through equity investments
is a key element of its resource mobilization role. Even though the Bank cannot
be a majority shareholder in a company,
it can participate in a project by acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred
stocks or debentures.

Other Financial Services. |n addition to
the products described above, the Bank
may offer technical assistance and underwriting services through its public and
private sector windows.

Risk Management Policies

and Processes

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are not essential to
its core business of providing development finance and related assistance.
Accordingly, the Bank’s risk management policies, guidelines and practices are designed to reduce exposure to
interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal and other operational risks,
while maximizing the Bank’s capacity to
assume credit risks to public and private
sector clients, within approved risk limits.

The policies and practices employed
by the Bank to manage these risks are
described in detail in Note D to the
Financial Statements.

Financial Results

The Board of Governors in 2010 approved
distributions to various development initiatives in Africa amounting to UA 146.37

4

million. The beneficiaries of these distributions are listed under Note N to the
financial statements. In accordance with
the Bank’s accounting policies, such distributions are reported as expenses in
the year they are approved by the Board
of Governors. The discussions and analyses below focus on “Income before
distributions approved by the Board of
Governors”, which reflects the ordinary
operations of the Bank.

The highlights of the Bank’s financial performance in 2010 include the following:

* Despite the volatile market conditions
and the low interest rates experienced
during the year, the Bank in 2010 earned
income before distributions approved
by the Board of Governors of UA 213.66
million, compared to UA 231.16 million in
2009. The decrease was due primarily
‘oa higher level of fair valuation losses
on derivatives and the borrowings on
which fair value options were elected
as well as a higher level of administraive expenses incurred in 2010 comared to 2009. With regard to asset
impairments, there was an increase in
loan loss provisions, which were largely offset by a reduction in provisions
on investments held to maturity due
‘0 improved ratings and performance.

The provision for impairment at
December 31, 2010 relates largely to
hree sovereign borrowers that as of
hat date had been in arrears for six
months or more. In addition, based on
a review of the facts and circumstances after the balance sheet date, provision for impairment was recognized on
a fourth country that fell into arrears
after the year-end. Consequently, at
December 31, 2010 total accumulated
provision for losses on principal and
charges in arrears was UA 283.37 million, representing 3.28 percent of gross
principal outstanding plus charges
receivable at that date, compared to
UA 227.39 million, or 2.90 percent of
gross principal outstanding plus charges receivable at December 31, 2009.

 

+ Net interest income increased from UA
267.29 million in 2009 to UA 373.25
million, largely due to higher levels
of earning assets in 2010. As a result
of the Bank’s asset and liability management practices, the effect of the
lower interest rates was significantly
muted, as lower interest income was
largely offset by lower interest expense.
The Bank also earned income of UA
6.74 million in 2010 on investments
in debt instruments issued by entities in its regional member countries.

As a result of a general increase in its
operational activities, total Bank Group
administrative expenses increased by
8.08 percent from UA 221.51 million in
2009 to UA 239.42 million in 2010. Total
manpower expenses increased by 4.89
percent from UA 170.63 million in 2009
to UA 178.98 million in 2010 while other
administration expenses increased by
18.81 percent from UA 50.88 million to
UA 60.45 million in 2010. The Bank’s
share of the total Bank Group administrative expenses amounted to UA 75.00
million for 2010, compared to UA 63.06
million for 2009. Bank Group administrative expenses are allocated between
the Bank, the ADF and the NTF based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula driven primarily by the relative levels of certain operational volume indicators and relative balance sheet size.

The Bank continues to earn levels of net
income sufficient to sustain its strong
financial position and also make contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other development initiatives for
Africa. Total reserves plus accumulated loss provisions on outstanding loan
principal and charges at December 31,
2010 were UA 2.91 billion, compared to
VA 2.78 billion at the end of 2009. As
a percentage of gross loans, reserves
plus loss provisions on loan principal at
December 31, 2010 represented 33.06
percent compared to 35.22 percent at
December 31, 2009.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010

NOTE A - OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic
and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire. However, since
February 2003, the Bank has managed its operations largely from its temporary relocation facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. The Bank
finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and preparation
of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank also promotes
investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and social progress
of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Develooment Fund (ADF or
the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing
to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to promote cooperation and increased international
trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and its operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any obligation to pay,
withhold or collect any tax or duty.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated
by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

Interest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life
of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.
Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank’s right to receive payment is established.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of
all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the
Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit
adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

122 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31,
2010 and 2009 are reported in Note W-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation
differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at
the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements
as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount
at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other
currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever
withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that the members are independent African and non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is
to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and
jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2010, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member
country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member,
hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against
the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations
and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date
are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently
taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the
amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the
repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date,
for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred
and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying
a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the
risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered
by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors.
In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each
member country.

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit
payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that
an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable
service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in
other comprehensive income in the year they occur. Past service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are

Annual Report 2010 123Chapter 6 African Development Bank

already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability reoresents the present value of the
Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to
eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to
the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age and
the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to
the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the
Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both
the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year they occur.
The medical plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual
rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and
receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.

1) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement and gains and losses are reported in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. The investments in the trading portfolio are acquired principally for the purpose
of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ii) Loans and Receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry
amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that
are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However, incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred, as such amounts are considered insignificant.
The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

lil) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management has the
intent and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

124 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

iv) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
The Bank has classified equity investments over which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale.
Available- for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in
the future. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly
in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or
loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments
are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are
recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially
recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the
financial assets have expired or where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates.
The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors their fair value and if necessary may require additional collateral.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity
upon acquisition of three months or less.

2) Financial Liabilities

) Borrowings

n the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed
or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash
low requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and
roviding cost-effective funding.

n addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity
management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet
at amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using
he effective interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate and currency risks. The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s
risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D below. Certain of the Bank’s borrowings obtained prior to
990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free loans. In accordance with the revised
AS 20- Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such borrowings represent a form of
government assistance, the benefits of which are not quantified by the imputation of interest. Accordingly, such borrowings
are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable on their due dates.

 

ii) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the
borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise
would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried
on the balance sheet at fair value.

Annual Report 2010 125Chapter 6 African Development Bank

iii) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost.
The amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are
used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established
on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

Although IAS 39 allows hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the Bank has elected not to apply hedge
accounting to any qualifying hedging relationship, but rather classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the criteria for the application of the fair value option are met,
then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair
value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Impairment of Financial Assets

1) Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of
financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed
for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of
impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference
between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the
estimated impairment representing present value losses, arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due.
For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the non-collectability, in whole or
in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring
any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all
loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease in
impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

126 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

2) Available-for-Sale Assets

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial
assets is impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair
value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for
available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the
acquisition cost and the current fair value, net of any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is reclassified from
equity to the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments
carried at fair value are reversed through equity.

f there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an available-for-sale equity instrument that is carried
at cost because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between
he carrying amount of the impaired equity instrument and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at
he current market rate of return for a similar equity instrument. Once recognized, impairment losses on these equity instruments carried at cost are not reversed.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure
n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuaion process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using
valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length
ransactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale
might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

 

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs
are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.

Annual Report 2010 127Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank's credit spread.
Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank’s
new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to
value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves,
exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are made to the relevant
observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best estimate of the price at which the Bank could have bought back the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments carried at fair value are periodically fair valued both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments
in listed enterprises is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed
using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated
as the Bank’s percentage ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

 

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use
market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for
valuing the Bank's financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows
of these loans. For multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow
model based on the year end variable lending rate in that currency. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in note I.

Day One Profit and Loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the
consideration given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair
value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument
(i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable
markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate
data solely from observable markets. The Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they
arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price.

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is determined based on valuation models that use inputs that may not be market-observable as of the calculation date. Such financial instruments are initially
recognized at the transaction price, although the value obtained from the relevant valuation model may differ. The difference
between the transaction price and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized
over the life of the transaction; or (b) deferred until the instrument's fair value can be determined using market observable inputs
or is realized through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day
one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate
reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

128 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered
associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not controls, over the entity’s
financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is described in more detail in Note J.
IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor’s
share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee is
recognized in the investor’s income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974
and 1990. At December 31, 2010, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1 percent of the economic interest
in the capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since
its creation in 1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the
ADF. Furthermore, in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as
measured under the equity method are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential
losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset,
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

* Buildings: 15-20 years

« Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

* Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
* Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between
proceeds and the asset's carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

 

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other
regional member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to
the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Annual Report 2010 129Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Allocations and Distributions Approved by the Board of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations
from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from
prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of distribution
for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income
Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously
transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts allocated to
surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income, and expenses
recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories.
Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Held-for-Trading - In classifying financial assets or liabilities as “trading”, the Bank has determined that such assets or liabilities
meet its description and set criteria for classification as such.

Fair Value through Profit and Loss - In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has
determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Held-to-Maturity - The Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intent and ability to
hold such investments to maturity.

2) Significant Estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

 

Impairment Losses on Loans and Advances - At each financial statements reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios
for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective
evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the loan’s net carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows
on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an
individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a group of loans with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed
for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of loans may include observable data indicating that there has
been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate
with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk
characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to
reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

130 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are
calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use
only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Equity Investments - The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired
when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below the carrying amount. The determination of what is
significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates any evidence of deterioration in the
financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.

Retirement Benefits - The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial assumptions
used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate to be used to
determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations, based on interest rates of suitably long-term high-quality
corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the UA.

Events after the Balance Sheet date
The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment
of the financial statements themselves. The nature and potential financial statements effect of such events are detailed in Note
U to these financial statements.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

Certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations were not yet effective for application
as of the balance sheet date, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following new standard is
expected to be relevant to the Bank:

IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 “financial instruments” was issued in November 2009 as the first part of the IASB comprehensive project to replace IAS 39. The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 replaces those parts of IAS 39 relating to the classification and
measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the entity’s business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument, into two measurement categories: those to be measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized
cost only if it is a debt instrument and the objective of the entity’s business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash
flows and the asset’s contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be
measured at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity
instruments that are held for trading will be measured at fair value through profit or loss while for all other equity instruments an
irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

Annual Report 2010 131Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The second part of Phase 1 of IFRS 9 which deals with classification and measurement of financial liabilities was issued on
October 28, 2010. The new requirements address the problem of volatility in profit or loss (P&L) arising from the “own credit” of
an issuer choosing to measure its own debt at fair value. With the new requirements, gains and losses resulting from changes in
“own credit risk” for liabilities measured at fair value will be reported in “other comprehensive income” and therefore not affect
reported profit or loss.

As at December 31, 2010, the two other phases of IFRS 9 dealing with impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting had
not been issued by IASB.

Adoption of IFRS 9 is mandatory from January 1, 2013 but earlier adoption is permitted. IFRS 9 will have an effect on the current
classification of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities. The Bank intends to early adopt the first phase of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

n carrying out its develooment mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk,
and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

he degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This
institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank’s capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk proile consistent with the highest credit rating. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy was revised in 2009, as further discussed in

ote M under Borrowings.

he policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit,
roduct, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors regularly review trends in the Bank’s risk
rofiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

he guiding principles by which the Bank manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on the
Bank's Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority), the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM
Authority) and the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

 

he FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for
its borrowers and separate guidelines which prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for
he Bank’s sovereign and non-sovereign loan and equity investment portfolios.

 

he ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the
Bank’s financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM
Authority covers the Bank’s entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources. It
also includes the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed
operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and
the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control organ of the Bank’s risk management activities.
It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance.
OPSCOM reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

132 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

he ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc
inance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms country
and project credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
hat report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk,
inancial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the
appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance
with those policies and guidelines.

he following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
inancial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising essenially from its lending and treasury operations.

 

he Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign
credit risk on its portfolio of private sector, non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio
of treasury investments and derivative transactions. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies,
guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising
from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through
its policies related to sustainable lending strategies, including individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the
concerned country. These include the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects.

134 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal
credit risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Bank’s statistical loss expectations as shown in the following table. The level
of granularity helps in measuring probabilities of default for internal grades in order to differentiate between obligors distinctly.

Risk Rating Description Risk Class International Equivalent
il Excellent Very Low Risk A-BBB/Baa
2 Strong Low Risk BB/Ba
3 Good .

: Moderate Risk B/B

4 Fair

5 Acceptable aR

6 Marginal High Risk (C/Caa

i Special Attention

8 Substandard Be

9 Doubtful Very High Risk (C-D/Ca-D
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and Bank’s portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and a composite non-sovereign country risk index which
in turn are converted into separate country risk rating for the sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. These country risk ratings
are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and other specialized international organizations. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they reflect the expected risk
profiles of the countries. The ALCO also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their country exposure limits and
approves changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

The portfolio’s weighted-average risk rating at the end of 2010 was 2.01 compared to 2.42 at the end of 2009. The distribution
of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

It is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
30 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to
the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for
such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts
have been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.50 percent on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Annual Report 2010 135Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on nonperforming sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties to service their debts to the Bank on a timely
basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with
the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative
risk capital cushion for sovereign credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for public sector and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities (guarantees and client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for
private sector operations which have a higher probability of default and loss given default than public sector operations. At the
end of December 2010, the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio used up to 28 percent of the Bank's total risk capital based on the
Bank’s capital adequacy framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of
translation adjustments. Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees. The
Bank may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign
guarantee.

 

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses a uniform internal credit risk rating scale. Nonsovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) greenfield and expansion projects; b) financial
institutions; and c) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of some pre-determined critical factors.

a) Greenfield and Expansion Projects

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower’s financial strength. This assessment looks at:

i) capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating performance and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project company’s
management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the information on
which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

b) Financial Institutions

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model:

i) Capital adequacy - analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution's capital; ii) Asset quality, operating
policies and procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision making framework; iv) Earnings
and market position - an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy - an assessment
focusing on the entity's ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk - an assessment of the impact of interest
rate changes and exchange rate fluctuations.

136 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

c) Private Equity Funds
The assessment of a Private Equity Fund takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

+ Investment strategies;

* Industry structure and regulatory framework;
+ Management and corporate governance;

* Financial strength and fund performance; and
* Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require a minimum initial credit rating and undergo rigorous project approval. The Non-Sovereign
Working Group of the ALCO reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend
for the ALCO’s approval, changes if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its exposure to the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios. The weighted-average
risk rating improved from 3.14 at the end of 2009 to 3.12 at year-end 2010. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across
the Bank's five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

n compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit
impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2010, the impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired
oans in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 12.04 million compared to UA 11.89 million in 2009.

n addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds. To the extent possible, equity investments are carried at fair value. In the event that the fair value of an equity
investment cannot be reliably determined, it is carried at amortized cost, and periodically assessed for impairment. The Bank
recognizes loss provision based on accepted impairment tests measured against the carrying cost of the equity investment. At
he end of 2010, the provision for impairment on equity investment was UA 18.78 million compared to UA 15.94 million in 2009.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk capial cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel Il Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At the end of
December 2010, the Bank's non- sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 25 percent of the Bank’s total onlance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 40 percent determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign
operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, Equity participations required as risk capital approximately 8.3 percent of

he Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the statutory limit of 15 percent established by the
Board of Governors for equity participations.

Credit Exposure Limits

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given point
in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign guaranteed and non-sovereign
portfolios) by ensuring that in the aggregate, the total country exposure limit to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the
Bank’s total risk capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s capital
adequacy framework. Specifically, the country limits are determined for each of the RMC borrowers by differentiating them on
the basis of their credit ratings; size of the economy and the country’s economic potential. Country exposure limits are reviewed
annually to support the Bank’s medium term country lending strategies.

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further controlled and managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit
with regard to the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range
of collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its
exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement.
All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to
meet its obligation to the Bank. Given the nature of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty
credit risk, however, the Bank minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counter- party exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for
Finance. For local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate
availability of investment opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies.
The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored.

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non DVP based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

Maturity

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government Agencies and Supranationals A/A2 AA-/ad AAA/Aaa

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in the UK and

40 year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life
for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

138 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

The Bank also invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized securities
repurchase agreements.

As arule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or
A-/A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Approved transactions with
derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital (equity and reserves)
for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank’s credit limits
after considering the benefits of any collateral.

The counterparty credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be predominantly AA or higher

rated as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA rated entities rose from the previous year as the bank
continued to increase its relative investments in sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed, agency and supranational securities.

2007 3% 54% 3%
2006 56% 39% 5%
2005 56% 36% 8%

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk
capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2010, the Bank’s
counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 2 percent of the Bank’s
total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity risk
arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon without
additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The PML is
updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net loan
disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; and
4) undisbursed equity investments.

Annual Report 2010 139Chapter 6 African Development Bank

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to meet
the Bank’s short term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are included in
the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the Bank maintains
a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to cover its expected
medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity resources, is held
in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective of stabilizing the bank’s net
income. During the year, the Bank revised its definition of eligible liquidity to include, with appropriate hair-cuts as necessary, all
liquid securities in all the portfolios of assets held by the Bank.

The contractual maturities of financial liabilities and future interest payments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market fore
risk bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objec
due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the cur
composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicit

ign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its
ive is to protect its risk capital from translation risk
rency composition of its net assets to the currency
ly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange

exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily

by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) i
(after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Ban
currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, w

nthe same currencies in which they were borrowed
requires its borrowers to service their loans in the

ich are denominated in Units of Account (equiva
lent to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates
fluctuate. The Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account
by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. In line with

this policy, throughout 2010 the Bank’s currency alignment was adjusted wi

hin a tight band of the risk-neutral position in each

of the currencies making up the SDR composition. In keeping with the Bank’s currency risk management policy, spot currency
transactions are carried out to realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a revision to the SDR currency com
position. As a result of these policies and practices, despite sharp movemen
the Bank experienced translation adjustment gains of less than 0.50 percen

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The distribution of the currencies of the Bank’s recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in Euros,
USD and Tunisian Dinar. For 2010, the Bank’s strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to cover the estimated
currency composition of expenses mitigated the unfavorable impact of those currencies movements during the year.

Net currency position at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was as follows:

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies,
namely the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the
International Monetary Fund every five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2006. The SDR rate represents
the sum of the interest rate of each currency that is determined based on the weight and the representative exchange rate and
interest rate of each currency.

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange
rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes
a separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change
in the African currency holdings the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/depreciation of each African
currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal
change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

Interest Rate Risk

The Bank’s interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding

such assets;

2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank’s principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not overly
sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Annual Report 2010 147Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt

Over half of the Bank’s interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin
on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding
liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost
of funds pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s pool-based loans has traditionally
helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining
demand for this product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (marketbased loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month LIBOR floating rate). The Bank
may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of
its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market
risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche.
The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity policy and
uses a six-month LIBOR floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational
cash flow needs and uses a one-month LIBOR floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all new
borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard six-month LIBOR rate reference. Where the
Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired
six-month LIBOR-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative
to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of debt
that will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio.

 

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of the Bank’s assets with equity resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank’s equity resources
(the SDR) affect the net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result
in lower lending and investment rates, which in the long-term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity
of the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile
of the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark.
The Bank's repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s assets funded by equity
reprice in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a ten-year
moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

 

At the end of 2009 and 2010, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual buckets.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity

A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a gain in income statement of UA 8.17 million and UA
7.55 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fair Value Sensitivity

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements
at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of
the currencies in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2010 for
assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps (2009: +/- 10 bps).

(UA thousands)
Upward Parallel Shift Downward Parallel Shift
2010 2009 2010 2009
Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss) Gain/(Loss)
Held-for-trading investments (10,943) (18,664) 12,099 21,812
Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios 160,758 148,876 (175,841) (163,105)

Prepayment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans
committed before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level
of prepayments has generally been within acceptable levels. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70
million compared to the amounts in prior years, due in large part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans
issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying
the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298 million included an amount of UA 192 million in respect
of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007; total prepayment amounted to UA 199 million, of which 98 percent related to
market-based loans. Prepayment in 2008 amounted to UA 17 million while prepayment in 2009 was UA 20 million. In the year
ended December 31, 2010, prepayment mainly on private sector loans amounted to UA 67 million.

Operational Risk

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and functions. The interdependencies among its departments and among its risk factors in general, could adversely impact its activities with consequential
exposure to financial losses.

Operational risks encompass all risks other than credit, market, and liquidity risks. Operational risks include the risks of losses
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems, and from external events which could negatively
impact its reputation.

The Internal Control Unit (ICU) of the Bank is responsible for among other duties the implementation of the Committee of the
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) internal control framework, as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s internal controls in all significant business operations. As part of this process,
Management's attestation on the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s annual report.
Phase two of the implementation extending the COSO framework to other areas of operational risk management is still ongoing.

Annual Report 2010 149Chapter 6 African Development Bank

It is the primary responsibility of the management of each business area to implement the relevant controls. This responsibility
is supported by institutional standards in the following areas:

* Requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorization of transactions
* Requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions

* Documentation of controls and procedures

* Training and professional development

* Risk mitigation including insurance where this is effective

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General of
the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and non-borrowing),
bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in its office locations.
Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive Crisis Committee, chaired
by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from the Operations Crisis Committee
(OCC); Ci) the OCC that closely monitors all developments affecting the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate
the relevant risks and (iii) the business continuity Unit (BCPU) that follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is
also responsible for periodic tests of the overall business continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

The Bank’s Capital Adequacy and Exposure Management framework currently provides for a risk capital charge of 15 percent of
the average operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basle Il recommendations for operational risk.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management include compliance with the Code of Conduct and staff rules, the
work of the Fraud and Investigations Unit and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

Loan Swaps
The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable
rate income.

Administrative Expenses Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the
principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange
transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2010 and 2009, there were no open positions with respect to the forward exchange transactions.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital
increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options
for making their payments:

1. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local
currency; or

2. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non- interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/1l relating to the
Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV) is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members - 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes
of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five
(5) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely
convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and
consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to
the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Payments for shares under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors
Resolution B/BG/2010/08 of May 27, 2010 are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes encashable on or before the due date for payment.

Each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund shall pay for the paid-up portion of
its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while any member not eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund shall pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal
and consecutive annual installments.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

Annual Report 2010 157Chapter 6 African Development Bank

NOTE | - LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other nonsovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or
in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall
be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a
grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary
market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank’s own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50
basis points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans to single currency variable terms or retain the
terms of their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1,
1998. The other terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1,
1997, the Bank has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum
of two components, namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually
on January, 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank’s selected reference
interest rate in each market. The Bank’s standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR,
EURIBOR and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single
currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule.

Others: Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel and A/B syndications and local currency loans if the Bank
is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The local currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loans (FSL)
pricing framework with a cost pass through principle to ensure that the cost of funds is fully recovered.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower’s chosen
base rate to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to
50 basis points. For non- sovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank’s assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

The movements in the accumulated provision for impairment on loan interest and charges receivable for the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. No irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks
on undisbursed loans were outstanding at December 31, 2010 (2009: UA 0.16 million).

Also, the Bank may provide repayment guarantees to entities within its regional member countries for development loans granted
to such entities by third parties. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not
made. At December 31, 2010, guarantees provided by the Bank to some of its borrowers amounted to UA 2.31 million.

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social
development of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African
countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement
since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General
Increases and General Replenishments.

162 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and 7 members
selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of
the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays
a share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of
programs and projects executed during the period. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses
incurred by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2010 amounted to UA 163.96 million (2009: UA 157.65 million), representing
70.83 percent (2009: 70.84 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF
are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its
participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding
claims against the participants. At December 31, 2010, the Bank’s pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.67 percent (2009:
0.72 percent).

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note W-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Banks investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss on
the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations
plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points
and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in such equity
investments is to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of
their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African
participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external
resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank currently holds less than 20 percent of the total equity capital of most of the
institutions in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests,
but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In the exceptional instances where the Bank has
more than 20 percent but less than 50 percent ownership, such investments are accounted for as investments in associates. In
accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2009/10 of May 13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall
not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate amount of the Bank’s paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital)
included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated
permanent and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to
sub-regional and national development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development
objective, including capacity building. The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general
public. Only member states or institutions owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions.
Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments are included in the income statement.

166 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank’s owned buildings in the host country are intended to be
used for the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country. At December 31, 2010, the book value of such assets is not significant.

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

The revised capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2009 adopted the use of a single debt
to usable capital ratio to monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank’s total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable
capital. Usable capital under the revised capital adequacy framework comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital
of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s usable capital at December 31, 2010 was UA 14,303 million.

As at December 31, 2010 and 2009, senior and subordinated borrowings were as follows:

 

(UA millions) 2010 2009
Senior borrowings 11,203.69 9,852.32
Subordinated borrowings 776,88 728.32
Total 11,980.57 10,580.64

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities
and to lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified dates
prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put dates, rather
than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain outstanding
beyond their earliest redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the
two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform
a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2010 was UA 10,887.11 million (2009: UA
9,488.61 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31,
2010 was UA 11,119.82 million (2009: UA 9,188.23 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional
amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net loss of UA 27.61 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended
December 31, 2010 (2009: net gain of UA 17.38 million). This included a loss of UA 38.78 million which was attributable to changes
in the Bank’s credit risk during the year ended December 31, 2010 (2009: gain of UA 37.31 million). Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings designated
at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid markets for ADB quoted bonds versus
LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread was not applied for fair value changes on
callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2010, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses
to date were UA 542.80 million (2009: losses of UA 300.38 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY
Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The
Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In
Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase,
six General Capital Increases (GCI), and a series of special capital increases to allow new members to subscribe to the capital of
the Bank. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29, 1998 and
became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments to
the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million
shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided
into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V
shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall
hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

 

Prior to the sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of
Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120
million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. The membership
of these two countries shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the
Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank. As at December 31,
2010, such formalities had not been completed by either country.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea
offering to subscribe, temporarily, to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and
UA 0.19 billion, respectively. This proposal was adopted by the Board of Governors on February 22, 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of the Bank would increase from UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710
non-voting shares. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ approval, this temporary capital increase shall become effective on January 1, 2010, or such later date when Canada and the Republic of Korea shall each have deposited with the Bank an
Instrument of Subscription in relation to all the additional shares. As at December 31, 2010, Canada and the Republic of Korea
had completed the necessary formalities.

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 27, 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital stock
of the Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares created are
to be allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the regional group shall
hold 60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The new shares and the previous ones described above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of 6 percent paid-up shares and
94 percent callable shares.

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 43,762.84 million at December 31, 2010, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia
to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the
event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares
of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested nonregional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will
however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may,
under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested non- regional member states and credit
the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for
membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the
proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member

countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US lz
dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represents the value of the US Dollar to the SDR immedi
ately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on July 1, 1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices,

losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in

the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself.
The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance
sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s

gross income.

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

year. Leases may be extended for periods that are no longer than the original term of the leases.

NOTE R - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the
Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of
6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In
November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor,
changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of
service. The past service cost associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and were recorded in 2004. Also, new
members from the local field offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million
were reported in the 2007 financial statements.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior service cost of UA 8.12 million, which has been immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9
percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been
eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results
of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other
than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s
liabilities. At December 31, 2010, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested
in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan
Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b)
Bond portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the
currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Post-Employment Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17,
2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute
a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing
of the MBP. Contribution rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children,
range between 0.70 percent to a maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers
of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The
contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the
Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided
to them and their recognized dependants.

The pension and post employment medical benefit expenses for 2010 and 2009 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined
(the Bank Group) comprised the following:

Assumptions used in the latest available actuarial valuations at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

(Percentages)
Staff Retirement Plan Medical Benefit Plan
2010 2009 2010 2009

Discount rate 5.24 5.00 5.24 5.00

Health care cost growth rate

~ at end of fiscal year 8.00 8.00

~ ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.00 5.00
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2014 2012

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and
equity securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as
forward-looking expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real
earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to
the long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

The medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced by a wide
variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of these calculations,
the initial medical cost inflation rate is assumed at 8 percent per annum between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, thereafter
reducing by 1 percent per annum each year until it reaches 5 percent per annum where a constant rate of 5 percent per annum
will be used thereafter. This level rate of 5 percent per annum will be reached at January 1, 2014 under the current assumption.

Annual Report 2010 183Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The Bank’s obligation and costs for post-retirement medical benefits are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding medical cost
inflation.

The following table shows the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost growth rate:

(UA millions)
Th Increase 1% Decrease
2010 2009 2010 2009

Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 15.761 14.543 (12.541) (11.576)

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used
by the Bank.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31, 2010 and 2009 for the Staff Retirement Plan:

(UA thousands) 2010 2009

Total 345,398 302,248

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in time deposits.

The Bank’s estimate of contributions it expects to make to the SRP and the MBP for the year ending December 31, 2011, are UA
14.44 million and UA 3.74 million, respectively.

NOTE S - RELATED PARTIES
The following related parties have been identified:

The Bank makes or guarantees loans to some of its members who are also its shareholders, and borrows funds from the capital
markets in the territories of some of its shareholders. As a multilateral development institution with membership comprising
53 African states and 24 non-African states (the “regional members” and “non-regional members”, respectively), subscriptions
to the capital of the Bank are made by all its members. All the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, which
consists of the Governors appointed by each member of the Bank, who exercise the voting power of the appointing member
country. Member country subscriptions and voting powers are disclosed in Note N. The Board of Directors, which is composed
of twenty (20) Directors elected by the member countries, is responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank,
and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the Board of Governors. The Bank also makes or guarantees

countries. Such loans are approved by the Board of Directors.

184 Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

n addition to its ordinary resources, the Bank administers the resources of other entities under special arrangements. In this
regard, the Bank administers the resources of the ADF. Furthermore, the Bank administers various special funds and trust funds,
which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social progress of its
regional member countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the NTF as well as certain multilateral and bilateral donor
unds created in the form of grants.

The ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of the ADF
is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors of which 7 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent
of the voting power in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry out its functions,
he ADF utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses the Bank based on an
agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed during the year.

The Bank’s investment in the ADF is included in Equity Participations and disclosed in Note J. In addition to the amount reported
as equity participation, the Bank periodically makes allocations from its income to the Fund, to further its objectives. Net income
allocations by the Bank to ADF are reported as Other Resources in the Fund's financial statements. Net income allocation to the
Fund in 2010 amounted to UA 50 million (2009: UA 25 million).

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors conducts
he general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in this connection, the Bank consults with
he Government of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for which it
reimburses to the Bank its share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses reimbursed
‘0 the Bank by both the ADF and NTF are disclosed in Note Q.

 

 

Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other entities
are generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction operations
and technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such grant funds at
December 31, 2010 and 2009 are disclosed in Note W-5.

The Bank also administers the SRP and MBP. The activities of the SRP and MBP are disclosed in Note R.

related parties.

Annual Report 2010 185Chapter 6 African Development Bank

NOTE T - SEGMENT REPORTING

The Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its regional member
states. The Bank’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.

Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s operations, management has determined that ADB has only one reportable segment since
the Bank does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net income
from individual borrowers.

The products and services from which the Bank derives its revenue are mainly loans, treasury and equity investments.

External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 is detailed as follows:

(UA thousands) 2010 2009

 

Interest income from loans:

Fixed rate loans 177,928 164,747
Variable rate loans 31,787 79,098

284,871 284,597

Commitment charges and commissions 8,488 3,642
Total income from loans 293,359 288,239
Income from investments 219,219 222,955
Income from other debt securities 6,737 7,684
Other income (1,725) 7,338
Total external revenue 517,590 526,216

Revenues earned from transactions with a single borrower country of the Bank amounting to UA 67.54 million for the year ended
December 31, 2010 exceeded 10 percent of the Bank’s revenue (2009: UA 65.96 million).

The Bank's development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Activities involving more than one single country from the continent of Africa are described as multinational activities. Treasury investment activities are carried out mainly
outside the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on the basis of the
above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers.

As of December 31, 2010, land and buildings owned by the Bank were located primarily at the Bank’s headquarters in Abidjan,
Céte d'Ivoire. More than 90 percent of other fixed and intangible assets were located at the Bank’s Temporary Relocation Facilities
in Tunis, Tunisia.

NOTE U - EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

The Sudan: Pursuant to a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed at the end of the civil war in the Islamic Republic of
Sudan in 2005, a referendum was held in January 2011 in southern Sudan to decide whether it should separate from the North
and become an independent state. The final outcome of the referendum, announced on February 7, 2011, was a vote for the separation of South Sudan as an independent state. The separation is expected to take effect in July 2011. For the Bank, the split will
ave effect on the respective rights and obligations of the two states with regards to loans given by the Bank currently reported
as outstanding against Sudan in Note D, and also on the subscriptions to the Share Capital of the Bank currently reported for
Sudan in the Statement of Subscription in Note N to these financial statements. These are among matters currently being negoiated between representatives of the North and South Sudan. While this non-adjusting event will eventually impact both the
Statement of Loans and the Statement of Subscriptions and Voting Powers, it is not expected to have an impact on the overall
inancial position or performance of the Bank.

Significant Socio-Political Developments: Subsequent to the balance sheet date, a number of the Bank’s borrowing member
countries have been going through significant socio-political unrests and changes. Notable among these are Tunisia, Egypt,
Libya and Cote d'lvoire. The Bank has no loan exposures to Libya. The Bank has significant exposures to Egypt and Tunisia. The
Bank's exposure to Céte d'Ivoire is relatively small. Given that Tunisia is the Temporary Relocation Agency from where the affairs
of the Bank are directed, the developments in the country also have business continuity implications for the Bank. In this regard,
he Management and Board of Directors of the Bank continuously monitor the situation and, in the event of a significant degradation in the security environment, suitable measures will be taken as required by the Bank’s time-tested Business Continuity
Plan, to assure the safety and well-being of staff and officers of the Bank and the continuity of essential activities and services,
including the prompt settlement of all obligations that may be coming due.

 

Annual Report 2010 187Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Egypt and Tunisia have honored all their bills due subsequent to the balance sheet date. Further, the Bank has reviewed the
exposures to both Egypt and Tunisia, including discussions with the interim governments in both countries. Both countries have
reaffirmed their commitments to continue to fully honor their obligations to the Bank. At December 31, 2010, the Bank’s total
development related exposures to Tunisia (including private sector enterprises in the country) amounted to UA 1,349 million.
For Egypt, the total at December 31, 2010 was UA 830 million. The Bank is also committed to providing development financing
assistance to the countries to help address the underlying economic causes of the unrests. Further, the Bank has carried out
detailed analyses, including stress tests where necessary, of its exposures in North Africa, particularly the exposures to Tunisia
and Egypt, and has concluded on the basis of the results of such reviews that no additional adjustments or impairment provisions are warranted as a result of these events.

Based on a review of the facts and circumstances of Cote d’lvoire after the balance sheet date, a provision for impairment has

been recognized on the country’s sovereign guaranteed loans for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Bank’s exposure to
Céte d'Ivoire (including private sector enterprises in the country) after the impairment provision amounted to UA 37.54 million.

NOTE V - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 30, 2011, the Board of Directors authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The financial
statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors at its annual meeting in June 2011.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears
owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into
new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that
were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In
approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan
is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out
conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created extensive destruction of physical assets, such that
he DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage
between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility.
n June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently,
he consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from
ime to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of
such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the
annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC loans in current earnings is
ransferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the
Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Fragile States Facility

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts
owards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to
he Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations
rom the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

 

 

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt
relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this
connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income
of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to the facility and by its
resolution B/BG/2007/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank's
allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors approved the establishment
of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and in addition provide broader and integrated
framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the
foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary countries.

Annual Report 2010African Development Bank Chapter 6

iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this
initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended

period to bring

heir debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible benefi
ciary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or

ues, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives. Following the signature of a HIPC debt
, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying value. On average,
B’s portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net
the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund
he HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This

was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much

d through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service
ey come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and

completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

At December 31, 2010, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 30 ADB borrowing countries, of which 23

iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for
nternational Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent o
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

 

38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Develo,

NOTE W-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

(i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development
Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from
the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to the Government of Nigeria
upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006, the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations and an independent evaluation of the NTF.
Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years starting
from April 26, 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each,
in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976,
and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87
million) was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on
September 13, 1985.

Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.71 million) was made
to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund. A second request for withdrawal of US$ 200 million was disbursed

to the Government of Nigeria in July 2009.

The resources of the NTF at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below:

1974. Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government
of Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On
August 11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from
which loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2010, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2009: US$ 13.45
million) had been so repaid.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended 31 December 2010

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (“the Bank”’) which comprise the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2010 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity
and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
as set out in notes A to W.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved
and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This
report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the
Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2010,
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of ADF primarily consist
of subscriptions by the Bank and State
Participants, as well as other resources
received by the Fund. The cumulative
subscriptions to ADF amounted to UA
18.81 billion at December 31, 2010.

The resolution for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund (ADF-11) was adopted
by the Board of Governors on March 28,
2008 and became effective on May 8,
2008 with a replenishment level set at UA
3.70 billion, and an Advance Commitment
Capacity amount of UA 2.06 billion bringing the total resources of ADF-11 to UA
5.76 billion. This amount covers the threeyear operational period 2008-2010. As
of December 31, 2010, State Participants
had subscribed a total amount of UA 3.37
billion, representing 91 percent of the
ADF-11 pledged amounts.

The negotiations for the twelfth replenishment of the Fund (ADF-12), which covers
the three-year operational period 201I2013, were concluded in September 2010
with a total resource level of UA 6.10 billion. The replenishment level for ADF-12
has been set at UA 4.09 billion, and the
Advance Commitment Capacity for the
period amounts to UA 2.01 billion.

Commitments under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) became effective on September
1, 2006 and covers the period 2006-2054.
To preserve the financial integrity and
the financing capacity of the Fund, the
terms of the MDRI require donors to fully
compensate the Fund for debts canceled
under the MDRI.

 

As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had
received from donors aggregate commitments of UA 4.70 billion represent
Annual Report 2010

ing 79.12 percent of the MDRI cost for
the period 2006-2054 of UA 5.94 billion.

Donors agreed that periodic adjustments
would be made under the initiative to
reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs to the Fund resulting from
debt forgiveness.

The indicative cost of the debt cancelation granted under the MDRI has thereby
been revised from UA 5.57 billion in 2007
to UA 5.94 billion in 2010 for the period
2006-2054. The indicative cost for the
period 2011-2054 was estimated in 2010
at UA 5.72 billion.

Investments

ADF cash and treasury investments
amounted to UA 3.21 billion at December
31, 2010, compared to UA 3.18 billion at
the end of 2009. Investment income for
the year amounted to UA 84.40 million,
representing a return of 2.53 percent,
onan average liquidity level of UA 3.33
billion, compared with an income of UA
131.59 million in 2009, representing a
return of 4.09 percent on an average
liquidity of UA 3.22 billion.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancelations, at December 31, 2010,
amounted to UA 20.33 billion compared
to UA 18.86 billion at the end of 2009.
Total outstanding loans, as at December
31, 2010 was UA 6.30 billion, UA 863.50
million higher than the UA 5.43 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2009. This
increase was in spite of debt cancelation
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative,
amounting to UA 17.57 million, for two
additional completion point countries.

At the end of 2010, there were 1,145
active signed loans and grants. Also at
December 31, 2010, a total of 1.144 loans
amounting to UA 6.69 billion had been
fully repaid or canceled through MDRI.

Disbursements
Disbursements of loans and grants
decreased by 32 percent to UA 117 billion

African Development Fund Chapter 6

in 2010 from UA 1.73 billion in 2009. As at
December 31, 2010, cumulative disbursements on loans and grants amounted
to UA 14.77 billion. A total of 1,673 loans
and grants were fully disbursed for an
amount of UA 11.75 billion, representing
80 percent of cumulative disbursements.

Financial Results

The Fund reported a deficit of UA 62.93
million in 2010, compared to a net surplus of UA 4.70 million in 2009. The significant loss in 2010 was principally due
to the very low level of interest rates,
which have the dual effect of lowering investment income and increasing
the impact of the accelerated encashment of promissory notes deposited for
payment of subscriptions. The average
adjusted commercial interest reference
rate (CIRR) applied in the determination
of the discount rates for the accelerated
encashment of notes (fixed when interest rates were high) was higher than
the current market interest rates earned
on the extra liquidity created by the
acceleration, creating a negative income
gap for the Fund.

Administrative expenses, which represent the Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group, also
increased by UA 6.31 million, from UA
157.65 million in 2009 to UA 163.96 million
in 2010, as a result of general increase in
total Bank Group administrative expenses. The Fund’s share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group is based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven primarily by the
relative levels of certain operational
volume indicators and relative balance
sheet size. The Fund’s share of Bank
Group shareable expenses was 70.83
percent for 2010, compared to 70.84 percent for 2009. The increase in the absolute amount of administrative expenses
borne by the Fund was attributable to
the overall increase in Bank Group shareable expenses due to increased activities.

 

 

199Chapter 6 African Development Fund

Loan income remained virtually the same
at UA 59.11 million in 2010 compared to
UA 59.08 million in 2009. Reflecting
the current low interest rate environment, investment income decreased
by UA 47119 million from UA 131.59 million in 2009 to UA 84.40 million in 2010.
Discount on the accelerated encashment
of promissory notes amounted to UA
41.29 million in 2010 compared to UA
28.02 million in 2009.

200

According to the Fund’s non-accrual policy, service charges on loans made to, or
guaranteed by borrowers are excluded
from loan income if principal repayment
and service charges are in arrears for 6
months or more. As a result of this policy, UA 2.12 million of non-accrued loan
income was excluded from 2010 income
compared to UA 2.07 million in 2009.
The number of borrowers in non-accrual
status at December 31, 2010 was 3; the

same level as at the end of December
2009.

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying debts under MDRI as the relevant
countries reach their HIPC completion
points. A summary of the cumulative
loan cancelations under MDRI and HIPC
is presented in Note E to the Special
Purpose Financial Statements.

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010

NOTE A - PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members,
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of May 27, 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors of
ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State
Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank
is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
to as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member
countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the
selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries, particularly the lesser-developed countries. The
assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not
liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of
the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund
(the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and
contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources
represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and
demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article
35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its
financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund’s special purpose financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of
Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

206 Annual Report 2010African Development Fund Chapter 6

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the
currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the
provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time
of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund's Unit of
Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect
of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the
Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation
Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are
included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are as follows:

2010 2009
1 Unit of Account equals:

United States Dollar 1.540030 1.56769

 

‘No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting from the rates indicated above.

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the
ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the
replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are
recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund.
The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with
an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant's budgetary appropriation process.

Annual Report 2010 207Chapter 6 African Development Fund

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

For the ADF-9, ADF-10 and ADF-11 replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount
equivalent to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts
received are invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between
the face value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be
earned on the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over
and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors
of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and
timely compensation for the debt cancelation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent
(70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs);
and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

 

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with
effect from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancelation, the
ADF governing bodies endorsed Management’s proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the Initiative.
Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for
each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will
take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing
ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted
as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the
same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

 

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its
foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant’s territory, that
participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the
time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within
that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value
of the Fund's holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts
have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

208 Annual Report 2010African Development Fund Chapter 6

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09, 2005-01 and 200801, which in turn stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and
eleventh general replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national
currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded
as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified based on the Fund’s intention on the date of purchase. Securities which the
Fund has the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Heldto-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the
Fund’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. The Fund assesses whether objective evidence
of impairment exists for held-to-maturity investments. If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured
as the difference between the investment’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding
future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The carrying
amount of the investment is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. All other investment securities are classified as held-for-trading and measured at market value. Fair values
for investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available using the bid prices. If quoted market prices are
not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government and agency obligations
include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments
of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may
only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates of deposit and
other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial
institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading portfolio. Purchases and
sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the
investments.

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans
are not included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places
all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such
member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue amount will be
collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by
6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet
date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower’s loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges that had previously
been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for that period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of such charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth
replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations
of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

Annual Report 2010 209Chapter 6 African Development Fund

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund,
(the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their
overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to
their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference
between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it
falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the
completion point under the HIPC framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by
additional contributions to be made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When
MDRI becomes effective for a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable
by the country and effectively take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI
are included in “Net Debt Relief” and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development
resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the
form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed
that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund’s loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing
from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per
annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on
the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved
after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2010,
outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 4.93 million (2009: UA 21.66 million).

As at December 31, 2010, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of
UA 284.91 million (2009: UA 278.54 million) of which UA 83.09 million (2009: UA 73.85 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2010, would have
been higher by UA 2.12 million (2009: UA 2.07 million). At December 31, 2010, the cumulative charges not recognized on the
non-accrual loans amounted to UA 33.65 million, compared to UA 30.83 million at December 31, 2009.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of
20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

212 Annual Report 2010African Development Fund Chapter 6

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10 percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.50 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments
were allocated as grants and grant based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or
programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the
ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing.
Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth and eleventh general replenishments is based on a country-bycountry analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may

also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period,
from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible,
the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement of the operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment
period of 5 years thereafter.

 

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

he HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by

reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the

original
through

ramework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered
annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they

come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided.
Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. Total contribu

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

At the G

 

leneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the

International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development
Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

Annual Report 2010 213Chapter 6 African Development Fund

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation is delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the
same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF
to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded from
net development resources, the debt cancelation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development resources.
Cancelation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2010, a gross amount of UA 4.85 billion (2009: UA 4.84 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled under
MDRI for 23 (2009: 21) HIPC completion point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2009: UA 1,225.99 million) in nominal terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71 million (2009: UA
942.71 million). As of December 31, 2010, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC - In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF,
he World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstrucion efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA
36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-IX) to clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears
‘o the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing

lechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-VIII as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework - The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and
integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically regional member countries of ADB emerging from conflict or crisis.
The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and
long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their arrears and prepare
hem for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails
he setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF, the ADB and private donors.
Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible fragile states not yet receiving debt relief to
ill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. Contributions made by the Fund
0 the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state. Contributions by the Fund to the
Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the
form of a special general increase and eleven general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement
of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note O.

Negotiations for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund (ADF-11) were concluded on December 11, 2007 when the deputies
agreed to a replenishment level of UA 5.76 billion, of which UA 2.06 billion represents internally generated resources, for the
three year operational period 2008 to 2010. ADF-11 came into effect on May 8, 2008 after the State Participants had deposited
with the Fund instruments of subscriptions exceeding the threshold of 30 percent of pledged subscriptions. At December 31,
2010 subscriptions to ADF-11 amounted to UA 3.37 billion.

At their meeting held in Tunis on 7-8 September 2010, the Deputies reached agreement on the terms of the Twelfth General
replenishment (ADF-12) of the Fund. In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Fund, the replenishment report authorizing the ADF-12 replenishment has been submitted to, and approved by the Board of Governors by its resolution F/BG/2011/01
of January 20, 2011. The twelfth Replenishment will come into effect on the date when State Participants shall have deposited
with the Fund, Instruments of Subscription representing an aggregate amount equivalent to at least thirty percent (30%) of the
total intended subscriptions.

At December 31, 2010 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.58 billion of which UA 390.70
million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid
entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note O.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund
or amember of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part
of the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 342.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 340.30 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund’s activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair
value of the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available,
fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the
Bank. While the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent
of the disbursed and outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to
cover the cost of administering the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate
fair values for outstanding loans.

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers
the Fund to receive other resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public
or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2010, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 4.29 million (2009: UA 4.37 million) representing
the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter’s offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects
executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA
163.96 million (2009: UA 157.65 million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by the
Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the
Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB (the
Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the
resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by some of its State Participants.

NOTE P - EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

The Sudan: Pursuant to a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed at the end of the civil war in the Islamic Republic of
Sudan in 2005, a referendum was held in January 2011 in southern Sudan to decide whether it should separate from the North
and become an independent state. The final outcome of the referendum, announced on February 7, 2011, was a vote for the separation of South Sudan as an independent state. The separation is expected to take effect in July 2011. For the Fund, the split will
have effect on the respective rights and obligations of the two states with regards to loans given by the Fund currently reported
against Sudan in the Summary Statement of Loans in Note M. These are among matters currently being negotiated between
representatives of the North and South Sudan. While this non-adjusting event will eventually impact the Statement of Loans it
is not expected to have an impact on the overall financial position or performance of the Fund.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the special purpose financial statements of the
African Development Fund to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund
Year ended 31 December 2010

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development Fund (“ the Fund “) prepared in
compliance with the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the Special Purpose
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010.

These special purpose financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of submitting approved and audited special purpose
financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement establishing the Fund,
and are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with a recognised accounting framework, such as, International Financial
Reporting Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the
Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Annual Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in accordance with articles 26(v), 35(l)

African Development Fund

Independent Auditor's Report on the special purpose
financial statements of the African Development Fund

to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the special purpose financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2010.

Financial Management

Investments

The cash and treasury investments of
the NTF are denominated in US Dollars
and amounted to UA 107.95 million
at December 31, 2010, compared to
UA 102.79 million at the end of 2009.
Investment income for 2010 amounted
to UA 0.41 million, representing a return
of 0.38 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 108.40 million, compared
with an income of UA 1.99 million in 2009,
representing a return of 1.06 percent on
an average liquidity of UA 18715 million.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancelations, as at
December 31, 2010, slightly decreased
by UA 0.16 million to UA 245.65 million
compared to UA 245.81 million at the end
of 2009. As at the same date, there were
32 active signed loans and 39 fully repaid
loans amounting to UA 52.55 million and
UA 101.85 million, respectively.

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 4.87
million in 2009 to UA 5.02 million in 2010
representing an increase of 3 percent.

224

As at December 31, 2010, cumulative
disbursements amounted to UA 226.72
million. 61 loans were fully disbursed
for a total amount of UA 205.34 million,
representing 91 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

Risk Management

Policies and Processes

Similar to the African Development Bank,
the Nigeria Trust Fund seeks to reduce
its exposure to risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development related assistance, such
as liquidity, currency and interest rate
risks. Note D to the Financial Statements
provides the details of the risk management policies and practices employed
by the NTF.

Financial Results

The NTF’s income before distributions
approved by the Board of Governors
decreased from UA 3.17 million in 2009
to UA 1.83 million in 2010, due mainly
to the decrease in investment income.
Investment income in 2010 decreased by
UA 1.58 million as a result of the decline
in interest rates as well as the reduction
in average investment funds.

Administrative expenses, which represent
the Fund's share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB group, decreased
by UA 0.33 million from UA 0.80 million in 2009 to UA 0.47 million in 2010.
The Fund’s share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB group is based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula,
which is driven by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators and
relative balance sheet size. However, the
Fund’s total administrative expense is
subject to a ceiling of 20 percent of its
gross income.

 

The Fund's reserves net of cumulative currency translation adjustments increased
from UA 28.14 million at the end of 2009
to UA 32.28 million on December 31, 2010.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank,
which is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. The
purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such sunset
date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement expired in
April 26, 2006 and has been extended twice for one-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of the
operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of the independent review, the Agreement has been extended for a
period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. The significant accounting policies employed
by the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

Interest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life
of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued in arrears for unutilized loan facilities.

Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading investments.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States Dollars
(USD). In accordance with Article VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements are presented
in Units of Account (UA).

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At
December 31, 2010, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.54003 USD (2009: 1.56769 USD).

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses
on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

Annual Report 2010 231Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets
The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: held-for-trading financial assets, loans and receivables, and
held-to-maturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments upon initial recognition.

1) Held-for-Trading Financial Assets
All held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Held-for-trading financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included
in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

ii) Loans and Receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise
when the Fund provides money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans
and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

lil) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund's management has the
intent and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest
method.

Purchases and sales of held-for-trading and held-to-maturity investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date
the Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time
to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon discharge, cancelation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if,
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

232 Annual Report 2010Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 6

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or heldto-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred),
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may
be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of
such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognised in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate
for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are
accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Offsetting Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure
n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuaion process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on
current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by
using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length
ransactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale
might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs
are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Annual Report 2010 233Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash
flows and are presented at amortized cost. Fair values disclosures are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on
the year end market equivalent lending rate in that currency, adjusted for estimated credit risk.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year
net income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in
a group of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a
collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are
incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows
of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement.

li) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas
such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes
in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

li) Held-to-Maturity Investments

In making judgments to designate assets as held-to-maturity, the Fund makes a positive determination at the acquisition
date as to its intent and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

234 Annual Report 2010Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 6

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

Certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations were not yet effective for application as of
the balance sheet date, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following new standard is expected
to be relevant to the Fund:

IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 “financial instruments” was issued in November 2009 as the first part of the IASB comprehensive
project to replace IAS 39. The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 replaces those parts of IAS 39 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the entity’s business model for managing its
financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument, into two measurement categories: those to be
measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized cost only if it is a debt
instrument and the objective of the entity’s business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows and the asset’s contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be measured at fair value through
profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are held for trading
will be measured at fair value through profit or loss while for all other equity instruments, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

The second part of Phase 1 of IFRS 9 which deals with classification and measurement of financial liabilities was issued on 28
October 2010. The new requirements address the problem of volatility in profit or loss (P&L) arising from the “own credit” of an issuer
choosing to measure its own debt at fair value. With the new requirements, gains and losses resulting from changes in “own credit risk”
for liabilities measured at fair value will be reported in “other comprehensive income” and therefore not affect reported profit or loss.

As at December 31, 2010, the two other expected phases of IFRS 9 dealing with impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting have not been issued by IASB.

Adoption of IFRS 9 is mandatory from January 1, 2013 but earlier adoption is permitted. IFRS 9 will have an effect on the current classification of the Fund's financial assets. The Fund intends to early adopt the first phase of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of the Fund through the
Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund's risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as
necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s most senior
management forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. As part of ALCO’s key functions pertinent to the administration of the
Fund, it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance
sheet, and confirms country credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing
working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate
risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated to the

relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with
those policies and guidelines.

Annual Report 2010 235Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk
for the Fund arising from sovereign credit risk in its lending operations and counterparty credit risk in its treasury operations.
These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in
more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential
losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit
risk through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness
assessment. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

Country Exposure
The Fund's loans outstanding at December 31, 2010 were to the following countries:

236 Annual Report 2010Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 6

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The Fund currently lends only to public sector borrowers, and its loans generally carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent
from the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk
rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

 

Risk Rating Description Risk Class International Equivalent
i Excellent Very Low Risk A - BBB/Baa
2 Strong Low Risk BB/Ba
3 Good :

4 Fait Moderate Risk B/B

5 Acceptable oo

F Maina High Risk (CC/Caa
Ti Special Attention

8 Substandard re

9 Doubiful Very High Risk (CD/Ca-D
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices
are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized
international bodies. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure
limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that
country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any
previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to
or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

2) Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. The Fund utilizes various financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and to invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may
be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund
minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the
Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that
are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

Annual Report 2010 237Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

Maturity
6 months lyear 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government Agencies and Supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/had AAA/Aaa
MBS /ABS AAA/Aaa, no maturity limit, but repayment projections mandatory

The Fund also invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits
of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to
be predominantly in the AA or higher rated class.

Credit Risk Profile of the Investment and Derivative Portfolios

AAA AA+ to AA- A+ to A2010 48% 40% 1%

2008 55% 34% 1%
2007 1% 85% Ib
2006 42% 54% a
2005 7% 19% aM

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to
mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement
obligations.

Currency Risk
Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

Interest Rate Risk

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed interest
rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently the available
resources. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is accordingly not hedged.

238 Annual Report 2010Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 6

At December 31, 2010 the Fund had UA 18.94 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2009: UA 24.12 million). The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were as follows:

Annual Report 2010 239Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Currency and Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in USD and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the Fund's
assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an impact of
approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the effect
of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100bps on the portfolio as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The loan portfolio comprises fixed rate loans only and is carried at amortized cost, thus not affected by movements in interest rates.

NOTE E - INVESTMENTS

As part of its portfolio management strategy, the Fund invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, as well as corporate bonds.

For government and agency obligations with final maturities longer than 1 year, the Fund may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Investments
in money market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum rating of A.

As at December 31, 2010 and 2009, all the Fund’s investments are held-for-trading.

The Fund's investments at December 31, 2010 and 2009 are summarized below:

NOTE F - LOANS

Loans originated prior to September 22, 2003 carry an interest rate of 4 percent on the outstanding balance. With effect from
September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of June 3, 2003 and the protocol agreement
between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated September 22, 2003, the interest rate on loans was changed from a
flat 4 percent per annum to a range of 2 to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding balance and future undisbursed
loans. Furthermore, a 0.75 percent commission is payable on undisbursed balances commencing 120 days after the signature of
the loan. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty-five years including grace periods of up to five years.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At December 31, 2010,
all loans disbursed were repayable in USD.

Following a request by the Government of Nigeria, on June 14, 2006, a withdrawal of US$ 200 million (UA 135.71 million) was
made by the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund.

A second request for withdrawal of US$ 200 million (UA 129.04 million) was paid to the Government of Nigeria in July 2009.

The Board of Governors of the Bank approves the transfers of part of the Fund’s income to HIPC. Transfers approved by the
Board of Governors of the Bank are reported within the income statement as expenses in the year the transfer is approved. Prior
to 2006, Board of Governors’ approved transfer was reported as a reduction in retained earnings. Approvals during the years
ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were UA 0.32 million and UA 0.60 million, respectively.

NOTE | - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

According to the Agreement, the Fund shall pay to the Bank the expenses incurred in the management of the Fund as follows:
a) Separately identifiable costs incurred by the Bank for the Fund; and

b) Indirect costs incurred by the Bank in the management of the Fund.

However, the annual payment for the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Bank shall not exceed 20 percent of the Fund’s
gross income during the course of each year. The administrative cost-sharing formula may be reviewed from time-to-time by
mutual agreement.

The amount of UA 0.47 million charged for the year ended December 31, 2010 (2009: UA 0.80 million) represents the Fund's
share of the Bank group expenses.

NOTE J - RELATED PARTIES

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF
on the basis of the terms of the Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the officers,
staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such facilities, based

on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula (see Note |). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2010 in respect of Fund’s share
of administrative expenses was UA 0.67 million (2009: UA 0.66 million) and is included in Accounts Payable on the balance sheet.

Annual Report 2010 245Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

NOTE K - SEGMENT REPORTING

The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB regional member countries for development purposes.
The Fund’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.
Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB regional member countries
and treasury investments. External revenue for the year ended December 31, 2010 is detailed as follows:

(UA thousands) 2010 2009
Interest income and charges on loans 1,922 2,021
Treasury Investments Income 413 1,990
Total external revenue 2,335 4011

The Fund’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are carried out
mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on the basis
of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses ADB's officers, staff, organisation, services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own. Geographical information about income from loans for
the year ended December 31, 2010 is detailed as follows:

(UA thousands)
Central East North Southern West
Africa Africa Africa Africa Africa Total
2010
Income from loans - 233 142 435 1112 1922
2009
Income from loans - 428 135 308 1,150 2,021

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10 percent or more of the
Fund's revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010.

NOTE L - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 30, 2011, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors.
The financial statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank at its annual
meeting in June 2011.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2010

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (“the Fund’’) which comprise the balance sheet as
at 31 December 2010 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of change in equity and the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set
out in notes A to L.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement
establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of
the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

247Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December 2010,
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Notes:

* Origin of Supply (00S) for Bank Group procurement and disbursement purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated, as evidenced by the contract for procurement,
and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire
would be classified under the code for France.

** The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to the Bank.

However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

Notes:

1) Entire or part of HIPC debt relief assistance had already been provided under arrears clearance operations.

2) Congo DRC is benefitting from exceptional HIPC debt relief assistance and part of the grants are funded by DRC Debt Relief Special Account.

3) HIPC Assistance has been suspended due to delays in reaching their completion points, as a result they are expected to fully pay their debt obligations falling due.
4) Countries figures include the debt relief already committed and delivered under the original HIPC framework.

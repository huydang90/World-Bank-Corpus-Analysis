Annual Report 2011The African Development Bank Group

The Bank Group has strengthened its “One Bank” approach
to enhance its client responsiveness, in contrast to a more
limited, product-driven strategy. Through this approach, the
Bank Group offers a holistic response to the exigencies of its
regional member countries (RMCs), by maximizing the use of
Bank Group resources, instruments, and competencies across
financing windows, and by engaging both its headquarters and
field offices. As a result, the Bank ensures the efficient implementation of operations in a sustainable and inclusive manner.
The Bank Group delivers its development assistance through
two main channels, the public sector and private sector, which
actively reinforce each other for enhanced sustainable economic
development and social progress in its RMCs. The Bank Group
achieves this objective by (i) mobilizing and allocating resources
toward investment in its RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice
and technical assistance to add value to its development efforts.

One way in which the African Development Bank operationalizes its “One Bank” approach has been through scaling up dialogue with RMCs at the country level. This has been assisted in
recent years through institutional reforms, particularly the Bank’s
decentralization program, which has been enhanced through
the establishment of regional resource centers, empowerment
of field offices, and closer engagement at the grass roots. As
One Bank, the institution is better positioned to work with its
partners in the international development community, regional
economic communities, RMCs, and civil society. This approach
also helps to consolidate its legitimacy as the premier development finance institution and knowledge bank for the continent.
Speaking as One Bank also strengthens its capacity to support
good governance in its RMCs, through strong policy dialogue
led by experts based in the regional resource centers and field
offices, working closely with other partners.

 

The Bank’s interventions in its RMCs are delivered through various financial instruments, including: project lending, programbased operations (PBOs), grants, lines of credit, equity participations, guarantees, and institutional capacity-building support.
The Bank’s financing conditions for support to its RMCs are
based on a debt sustainability classification of each regional
member country. The three resource windows offer different
terms and conditions, tailored to the needs of regional member
countries, as outlined below.

 

 

Annual Report 2011

African Development Bank (ADB) resources, which are generally obtained through capital market borrowings, are used to provide loans to its RMCs on non-concessional terms. Furthermore,
resources from this window are also used to support private
sector projects in all RMCs through direct loans, lines of credit
(LOCs), equity participations, and guarantees to financially
sound and viable private enterprises, and multinational projects that support regional integration. In 1997, the Bank introduced three new loan products to meet the needs of its clients,
namely: a single-currency variable-rate loan, a single-currency
floating-rate loan, and a single-currency fixed rate loan. The
interest rate for the single-currency variable-rate loan is based
on the quarter’s average cost of all outstanding Bank borrowings specifically allocated to fund these loans. The interest rate
for the floating-rate loan is based on the 6-month LIBOR in the
basket of currencies offered by the Bank. The rate for fixed-rate
loans is based on the Bank’s cost of borrowing to fund them.
The repayment terms for ADB resources are as follows:

* A repayment period of up to 20 years, including a grace
period not exceeding 5 years for public sector (sovereign
guaranteed) loans;

« Arepayment period of up to 14 years, including a grace period not exceeding 4 years for sovereign guaranteed lines of
credit (LOCs); and

« Arepayment period of 5 to 20 years, including a grace period of
1to 3 years for private sector (non-sovereign guaranteed) loans;

The African Development Fund (ADF) resources emanate
from contributions and periodic replenishments by ADF-State
Participants, usually on a 3-year basis. No interest is charged on
ADF loans. The loans, however, carry a service charge of 0.75
percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment
fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans span a 50-year repayment period, including a
10-year grace period. Lines of credit (LOCs) have a 20-year
repayment period, which also includes a 5-year grace period.
The Fund also provides grants to RMCs, and these do not carry
any interest charges. For blend countries (see Appendix IV),
however, the lending terms have been made more stringent
during the ADF-12 (2011-2013) period, as follows: 30 years’
maturity, a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1
percent on project loans. The other terms remain the same,
namely: 0.75 percent service charge on outstanding balances
and 0.5 percent commitment fee on undisbursed commitments.

viiThe Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) resources are provided entirely
by the Federal Republic of Nigeria under an Agreement signed
with the Bank in 1976 for an initial period of 30 years. Following
its revision in April 2008, the Agreement provides that the
resources of the Fund shall be used in accordance with the
terms of the following three options:

+ First option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a service
charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances;
(c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 20-year repayment period,
including a 7-year grace period.

Second option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 15-year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period.

Third option: Same terms as for the ADB private sector loans,
taking into consideration the provisions of the Guidelines for
the Bank’s private sector financing as well as the risk analysis
of the project.

Loans granted prior to the revision of the Agreement carried

interest at rates that ranged between 2 percent and 4 percent,
with a commission of 0.75 percent on undisbursed portions.

Pieter De KEIZER (The Netherlands)MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP AND CHAIRPERSON OF THE BOARDS OF DIRECTORS

 

Donald KABERUKA
President of the African Development Bank Group

am pleased to submit the Bank Group’s Annual Report for

2011, by all accounts, an eventful year for Africa and the Bank.
At this time, most of Africa continues to demonstrate remarkable
resilience as the second-fastest growing region of the globe.

This is no mean achievement given the global economic slowdown.
But this is no time for hubris either. Africa’s capacity to resist
external shocks is now much reduced compared to the previous
three years. Those buffers which enabled the resilience need to
be rebuilt. Secondly, ensuring that economic growth is broadbased, inclusive, and job-creating is fundamental for sustainability.

To attenuate the risks emanating from the global economy and
manage Africa’s growth drivers, such as natural resources, the
continent will need to leverage its demographic dynamics. As
we come to the end of our Medium-Term Strategy 2008-2012
and begin to craft the Bank’s ten-year Long-Term Strategy, the
issue of maintaining Africa’s momentum, and ensuring that it is
inclusive and transformational, will be at the center.

 

| am pleased to report that over the years, the African
Development Bank has demonstrated its solid finances, stra
xii

tegic choices, and crisis response capacity. It has continued to
post very good results, and has shown a strong countercyclical capability in helping member countries respond to successive crises, including support for the ongoing transitions
in North Africa.

The Bank has maintained a strong financial position, despite the
unfavorable global financial environment, over the past year.
The four major rating agencies once again reaffirmed their AAA
and AA+ ratings of the Bank’s senior and subordinated debts
respectively, with a stable outlook. These ratings confirm the
Bank's capital adequacy, prudent financial management and
risk management policies, solid shareholder support, and its
preferred creditor status.

In 201, the Bank committed close to US$ 9 billion - a 40 percent
increase over 2010. Our portfolio quality has been enhanced
and strategic focus maintained in core areas such as infrastructure, regional integration, and support to fragile states. The key
commitments made under the Sixth General Capital Increase
(GCI-VI) and the ADF-12 replenishment are on course. | note, in
particular, the enhanced decentralization, a new income model
and results measurement framework. Thanks to the support of
shareholders, the African Development Bank is now a mature,
much more complex organization, which knows how to deliver
effectively on its mandate.

| take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the
members of the Bank and to State Participants of the African
Development Fund for their firm support over the last few years,
in particular for the GCI-VI and ADF-12 replenishment. This has
gone a long way toward building a solid institution, responsive
to Africa’s needs, and well positioned to take advantage of the
opportunities and manage the risks in the emerging global
landscape. As we look forward, we shall consolidate the Bank’s
achievements, always aiming for strategic fit, quality and effectiveness in the course of fulfilling our mandate and meeting
Africa’s expectations.

Annual Report 2011Executive Summary

How Africa Performed in 2011

Africa’s economic performance over the past year shows GDP.
growth falling from 5.0 percent in 2010 to 3.4 percent in 2011.
However, this was still a significant achievement compared
to the GDP growth in OECD and other developed countries.
Africa’s performance was all the more remarkable when one
considers the challenges that beset the continent during the
year, including the sociopolitical crises (the “Arab Spring”) in
North Africa, which resulted in revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt,
and Libya, and political instability in Céte d'Ivoire, with ripple
effects on neighboring countries. As a result, Africa and SubSaharan Africa (SSA) performed quite differently in terms of
GDP growth during the year. While growth in SSA reached 5.1
percent, North Africa experienced near stagnation in 2011 (0.7
percent growth). Countries in the northern subregion are still
adjusting to the sociopolitical shifts ushered in by the Arab
Spring. On the other hand, the political situation in Céte d'Ivoire
has now stabilized and the economy is expected to rebound in
2012. As a result, it is estimated that Africa's growth rate could
reach 4.5 percent in 2012 (see Figure 0.1).

 

With regard to other macroeconomic indicators, although rising commodity prices may initially have benefited several major
African exporting nations, the increase in food and energy prices
in 2011 reinforced inflationary pressures overall. Consequently,
inflation for the continent rose from 7.4 percent in 2010 to 8.5
percent in 2011, and is expected to remain at around that level
in 2012. Despite signs of economic recovery and prudent fiscal policies being pursued in several regional member counries (RMCs), the sociopolitical unrest in North and West Africa
exacted its toll. This resulted in a marginal worsening of the
iscal deficit in the continent, from 3.5 percent in 2010 to 3.6
percent in 2011, but with an improving forecast of 2.9 percent

Annual Report 2011

for 2012. Africa’s current account deficit remained at 0.6 percent of GDP in both 2010 and 2011. The expectation is that it
will decline marginally to 0.4 percent in 2012.

While Africa is expected to continue on an upward growth traJectory, there are a number of risks and challenges which may
impact its performance.

The Bank Group’s Strategic Focus and

Response to Africa’s Development Challenges

For the Bank, the priorities remain the core areas set out in its
Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012), namely addressing the
infrastructure deficit; ensuring good governance and social
inclusion; promoting private sector development; and investing in higher education and vocational training. It also places
emphasis on the challenges of regional integration; support for
fragile states; deeper involvement in middle-income countries;
agriculture and rural development; climate change mitigation
and adaptation; gender mainstreaming; as well as knowledge
generation. Addressing these risks and challenges will ensure
that Bank Group interventions in RMCs achieve sustainable
development results.

Bank Group operations in 2011 continued to address the pressing development challenges facing RMCs so that they might
achieve sustainable and inclusive growth and development. In
2011 the Bank committed UA 5.72 billion toward its operations
in all sectors. The largest share of Bank Group interventions was
targeted at building infrastructure, which comprises transportation, water supply and sanitation, energy, and information and
communication technology. This amounted to UA 1.57 billion,
representing 38.1 percent of total Bank Group loan and grant
approvals for the year. Of this total, 13.9 percent supported
private sector-led operations in RMCs.

In response to the sociopolitical unrest of the “Arab Spring,”
which began in Tunisia, the Bank in 2011 approved the Social
Inclusion and Transition Support Program (SITSP). This is a
multidonor emergency budget support operation to restore
socioeconomic stability to the country. The Bank contributed
UA 308.5 million toward this program, which was cofinanced
with other development partners, including the World Bank, the
European Union (EU), and the Agence francaise de développement (AFD). The program is in direct response to the popular
demands voiced during the revolution for more jobs, greater
equity between the subregions, fuller democratic participation
by citizens, and increased transparency in the governance of the
country. Addressing all these issues will contribute to a restoration of socioeconomic stability and to asmooth democratic transition in Tunisia. Another key Bank operation geared to respond
to Tunisia’s needs is the Gabés-Médenine-Ras Jedir Highway
Construction Project, which was approved for Bank financing of
UA 123.4 million in 2011. This corridor will form part of the Trans
 

 

xiiiMaghreb Highway, which aims to integrate the North African
subregion. This project will not only reduce overall transportation costs and travel time, but also unlock remote rural areas,
create job opportunities for the youth, and spur inclusive growth.

In the aftermath of Céte d'lvoire’s sociopolitical unrest, the Bank
acted swiftly to extend emergency support to the country, to
the tune of UA 100.5 million. The objectives were to: promote
access to basic social services and water supply and sanitation
networks; support capacity building for public financial management; promote social cohesion and reconciliation; and thereby
help to restore the country to a path of stability.

During the year, the Bank extended its support to the emerging democracy of South Sudan, mainly in the form of capacitybuilding. The Bank also provided emergency support amounting
to UA 2.5 million to address the effects of the severe drought
experienced in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, and Somalia.

One of the ways in which the Bank helps to address challenges facing the RMCs is by collaborating with other pan-African
partners and regional economic communities to generate and
disseminate deeper knowledge about the development issues
facing the continent. The Bank also works closely with its regional
partners to help forge a unified and collective voice for Africa
on key issues that are uppermost in the minds of regional policymakers and leaders. In 2011, this was manifested in the Bank’s
active participation in key events of great importance to Africa’s
development agenda. These included participation in the meetings of Ministers and Experts to prepare recommendations for
the G20 Leaders’ Summit, as well as knowledge products to
inform the debate on development issues of interest to Africa.

 

As the Bank enters the final year of its Medium-Term Strategy
(MTS), it has been examining its performance over the period
2008-2012. The evidence indicates its success in achieving
selectivity and focus in the choice of operations; in scaling up
its development effectiveness; and in instilling a “One Bank” culture throughout the institution. The Mid-Term Review of the MTS
noted that during the period 2008-2010, the level of approvals totaled UA 15.5 billion, surpassing the UA 11.3 billion initially
projected in the MTS. Of this total, UA 13.7 billion (88.4 percent)
was directed to the core priority areas designated by the Bank.

In 2011, the Bank Group approved UA 5.72 billion for new operations. This is an increase of 39.9 percent over the 2010 approvals
level of UA 4.09 billion, although it is still much lower than the
2009 level. The approvals for 2011 and 2010 signaled a return to
amore regular pattern of lending after the peak in 2009. That
was an exceptional year in terms of funding demands by the
Bank’s RMCs in the wake of the global economic crisis.

* Total loan and grant approvals exclude equity participations, HIPC debt relief, and Special Funds.

Of the institution’s three financing windows, the African
Development Bank (ADB) accounted for the largest share of
the 2011 approvals, namely UA 3.69 billion (64.5 percent). The
African Development Fund’s (ADF) tranche totaled UA 1.83 billion (32.0 percent), while approvals from the Nigeria Trust Fund
(NTF) amounted to UA 10.9 million (0.2 percent). Other instruments, namely the Special Funds, accounted for the remaining
UA 188.1 million (3.3 percent).

The range of the approved
priorities and developmen

operations reflects RMCs’ national
agendas, as well as the objectives

outlined in the Bank’s MTS. Figure 0.2 presents the sectoral
distribution of Bank Group approvals for 2010 and 2011, with

infrastructure emerging as

he principal beneficiary sector (38.1

percent in 2011), followed by multisector (20.7 percent), then

finance (19.4 percent). This
priorities enshrined in the

pattern of lending conforms to the
MTS, with infrastructure and multi
 

sector predominating. Multisector operations foster improvements in public financial management and institutional reforms,
thereby promoting good governance, which is a strategic focus
of the Bank.

During the year, Bank Group loan and grant approvals for all
five subregions (including multinational projects and programs)
amounted to UA 4.13 billion, which is an increase of 12.3 percent
over the 2010 level. West Africa attracted the largest share of
approvals (24.8 percent), followed by North Africa (21.9 percent), East Africa (14.8 percent), Central Africa (11.0 percent),
and Southern Africa (9.8 percent). Loan and grant approvals
for multinational projects and programs attracted 17.8 percent
of funding.

Annual Report 2011While Bank Group interventions in 2011 continued to target the
core strategic priorities of infrastructure, private sector development, governance, and higher education and vocational
training, in addition innovative budget support operations
were introduced to promote inclusive growth. As part of this
agenda, the Bank committed UA 344.3 million to support five
social inclusion projects and programs in Guinea, Liberia, Malawi,
Tanzania, and Tunisia, as well as a study in Djibouti. The Arab
Spring and the spread of social unrest in other African counries have underscored the need to tackle problems posed by
social exclusion, inequality, unemployment, and lack of voice,
particularly for the youth.

Disbursement performance: The Bank Group's total disbursements for project loans and grants in 2011 excluding special
unds was UA 3.17 billion. Of this total, UA 1.87 billion was for
ADB, UA 1.29 billion was for ADF, and UA 8.67 million for the
TF window. Disbursements in 2011 were higher than the total
amount of UA 2.51 billion recorded in 2010. This improvement
was partly due to the continuous effort to streamline the disbursement process; it also reflected the Bank's rapid response
in the form of budget support operations in certain RMCs.

Despite the increased disbursement amount recorded in 2011,
he disbursement ratio - which represents the pace of disbursements - remains relatively slow. This is due in general to: (i)
signature delays; (ii) weak country capacity, in particular, weak
record-keeping capacities of project implementation units in
some RMCs; (iii) the impact of political events in some RMCs,
which has delayed the original disbursement plans; and (iv) rapid
changes brought about by the changes in domestic, regional and
global economic situations which affected the readiness of cofinanciers to provide additional funds. Disbursement performance
will continue to be monitored as the Bank aims at improvements through portfolio clean-ups, procedural enhancements,
and other measures. Fiduciary clinics have also recently been
introduced, whereby Country Teams and Project Implementation
Units (PIUs) are being trained in project management Cincluding procurement, financial management, and disbursement).
t is also expected that the on-going decentralization process

 

and the recent opening of the Regional Resource Centers will
urther enhance disbursement efforts.

Institutional Reforms to

Foster Development Effectiveness

n 201, the Bank’s performance in terms of its institutional
effectiveness was measured through an analysis of its key perormance indicators (KPls). This revealed that: (i) the decenralization program is making steady progress; (ii) portfolio
management is showing a positive trend; (iii) economic and
sector work (ESW) and publication of related papers exceeded
heir targets; (iv) there is continuous improvement in the delivery of Operational Strategy Papers (CSPs, RISPs, CPPRs, and
related documents); and (v) the pace of disbursements is slow,
ut internal processes are being reviewed to improve this indicator. The Bank also adopted the Roadmap on Development
Effectiveness in 2011 (see Box 0.1). Overall, the Bank continues
o scale up the efficient utilization of resources and to improve
he delivery of its work program.

During the year, the Bank consolidated its institutional reforms
hrough the adoption of a number of key policies, including:
(i) the Decentralization Roadmap; and (ii) the Establishment
of External Representation Offices.

 

Decentralization of Bank Operations

A Permanent Committee on the Review and Implementation
of the Decentralization (PECOD) process was established in
January 2011 to coordinate and monitor the implementation of
the Roadmap. The Roadmap on Decentralization guides the
Bank in the transfer of decision-making authority to the field
offices (FOs). This will help to improve the quality of the Bank’s
portfolio, strengthen its analytical work, and provide its diverse
clients with tailored assistance.

Decentralization milestones in 2011 included: (i) the opening
of four new FOs in fragile states (Togo, Liberia, Central African
Republic, and Burundi); (ii) completion of preparatory work
for the opening of the fifth FO in South Sudan in 2012; and
ciii) the establishment of two pilot Regional Resource Centers

engagement by accelerating decentralization.

 

The Roadmap was adopted in March 2011 to support the Bank’s development effectiveness agenda in the run-up to the 4th
High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, which took place in Busan, Korea, in November/December 2011. Building on the
Bank’s commitments under the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action, the Roadmap proposes that the institution should concentrate on the three areas most likely to bring about transformational change. These are: strengthening
transparency and accountability for development results; expanding the use of country systems; and enhancing field-level

xvin Nairobi and Pretoria, which will become operational during
2012. In September 2011, the Bank also approved the opening of
three External Representation Offices (EROs) in the Americas,
Europe, and Asia. The three EROs will be launched in a phased
manner, starting with Tokyo and Washington, D.C. in 2012 and
with the third ERO opening in Europe in 2013.

Sound Financial Management

Despite the unfavorable global financial environment during
2011, all four major rating agencies - Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s,
Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency - have reaffirmed their AAA and AA+ rating of the African Development
Bank's senior and subordinated debts respectively, with a stable outlook. Their ratings confirm the Bank’s strong financial
position, based on sound capital adequacy, prudent financial
management and risk management policies, solid shareholder
support, and its preferred creditor status.

During the 2011 Annual Meetings, the Board of Governors
approved the allocation of: (i) UA 23.13 million from the Bank's
2010 allocable income of UA 236.13 million to the Surplus
Account. They also agreed to distribute from the allocable
income (a) UA 35.0 million as a contribution to the ADF-12 and
(b) UA 68.0 million to a Special Account dedicated to the debt
service of part of the consolidated loans of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC). In addition, the Governors approved
UA 110.0 million from the 2010 allocable income for retention
in reserves. The Governors also agreed to distribute from the
Surplus Account: (a) UA 5.0 million for the Technical Assistance
Fund for Middle-Income Countries and (6) UA 5.0 million for
the Special Relief Fund. In addition, for the Nigeria Trust Fund
(NTF), the Board of Governors approved the retention of UA
1.52 million of its income in reserves and the allocation of UA
183,200 for the HIPC Initiative .

The Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI VI) of the Bank, which
became effective in 2010, increased the authorized capital of
the Bank to UA 66.05 billion as at December 31, 2011. At that
date, the number of authorized shares of the Bank stood at
6,605,450 shares valued at UA 10,000 per share. The new shares
created by the capital increase were allocated to the regional
and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully
subscribed, the regional group would hold sixty (60) percent of
the total capital stock of the Bank and the non-regional group,
forty (40) percent.

The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and callable capital. As at December 31, 2011, the Bank’s paid-up capital
amounted to UA 3.29 billion compared with UA 2.38 billion in
2010. The Bank’s callable capital at year-end stood at UA 34.03
billion, including UA 18.63 billion from non-borrowing member
countries rated A- and above.

xvi

The twelfth replenishment of the African Development Fund
(ADF 12), which was adopted in January 2011, was concluded for
a total resources level of UA 6.10 billion, of which UA 2.01 billion
represented internally generated resources. As of December 31,
2011, a total of UA 3.18 billion of the ADF 12 replenishment had
been subscribed by State Participants, representing 84 percent
of the total pledged amounts.

To support its lending activities, the Bank strives to raise funds
from the capital markets at the lowest possible cost. The Bank’s
borrowing activities are guided largely by clients’ needs and
cash flow requirements, its asset and liability management
goals, and risk management policies.

A maximum UA 4.3 billion funding program in the capital marets was approved for 2011, with up to UA 150 million expected
under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa (EPSA)
initiative. During the year, the Bank raised a total of UA 2.46
illion, and an additional UA 70 million under the EPSA initiaive, in line with project disbursement needs.

he Bank’s borrowings during the year included two US$ 1 bilion global benchmark bond transactions contracted in February
and August. Other borrowing transactions undertaken by the
Bank during the year included private placements, deep-discount bonds, Uridashi transactions, and Euro-commercial paper
borrowings.

As at December 31, 2011, the Bank’s outstanding borrowing
portfolio stood at UA 12.90 billion compared with UA 11.98 bilion in 2010.

Furthermore, in December 2011, the Board of Directors of
he African Development Bank approved an Administrative
Expenses and Capital Expenditure Budget for 2012 comprising: (i) UA 292.55 million allocated to Administrative Expenses,
ii) UA 20.59 million for the Capital Budget, and (iii) UA 2.92
million to contingency. The Board of Directors of the African
Development Fund approved an indicative Administrative
Budget of UA 197.5 million for the Fund for 2012.

2 Chapter 1
- Africa’s Performance and
Mid-term ProspectsChapter 1 = Africa’s Performance and Mid-term Prospects

1.0 Introduction

The year 2011 was characterized by a volatile operational environment owing to the sociopolitical events and transitions
taking place in the continent. These events directly impacted
the lending environment by increasing the risk profiles of the
member countries, which created new challenges for the Bank.

While Africa is expected to con

the internal factors is the risk 0

rnal and external factors which
ormance. Prominent among
disruption arising from social

unrest, as seen in North Africa and in other parts of the conti
nent. External challenges inclu:

e the global financial crisis and

its associated economic downturn, which could affect the con
tinent through trade and FDI c!

annels. Furthermore, many of

Africa’s traditional trading partners, particularly in the eurozone,
have resorted to fiscal consolidation and austerity measures as
a result of the crisis, which is likely to result in a decline in aid
flows. Moreover, high fuel and food prices could damage the
external accounts of most African countries, in particular nonresource rich ones. This situation is further compounded by the
high social demands, which if not met, could exacerbate the
social tensions, slow down the implementation of the needed
reforms to achieve sustainable growth, and reduce investors’
confidence as well as private sector investments.

 

In the face of such internal and external risks, African countries
will face the difficult task of maintaining or restoring political,
economic, and social stability, and promoting inclusive development, with in all likelihood fewer resources. However, one
opportunity is the increased engagement of African countries
with China and India as this could help to cushion adverse effects
arising from a downturn in OECD countries.

1.1 Macroeconomic Performance
in 2011 and Prospects for 2012

Real GDP growth: As illustrated by Figure 1.1, the continent
recorded significant growth up to 2009 but has experienced
volatility since then, as a result of the various crises. Prospects
remain favorable and in most parts of Africa, growth is expected
o accelerate further in 2012 to around 4.5 percent.

However, as a result of the political events in Tunisia and Egypt,
and civil war in Libya, the two regions of North Africa and SubSaharan Africa (SSA) are performing quite differently (see
Figure 1.2). In 2011, while SSA growth was about 5.1 percent,
Africa’s growth was only 3.4 percent, due to the near stagnaion (0.7 percent) in North Africa.

Countries in North Africa continue to undergo the political transition ushered in by the Arab Spring. However, reform remains
imited and a number of challenges, both political and economic,
are hindering the subregion’s return to stability. Public disillusionment with the handling of political reform is reflected in
renewed demonstrations, albeit sporadic, in Tunisia and Egypt.
ourism was hit hard by the unrest in 201] but there are signs
hat visitors may now be returning to these countries in greater
numbers. In Libya, the transitional leaders continue to wrestle
with attempts to assert full authority over the whole country.

he political situation has stabilized in Cote d’lvoire and economic recovery is expected in 2012, with a real GDP growth rate
of around 8 percent. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission
has been established to heal the wounds inflicted by more than
our months of continuous fighting.

Annual Report 2011If the situation in the troubled countries stabilizes, Africa’s
growth is expected to pick up to around 4.5 percent in 2012,
moving closer to the growth path attained prior to the global
financial crisis of 2008/9. High commodity and agricultural
export prices are expected to be the main growth drivers in 2011.
In addition, strong domestic consumer demand as well as sound
macroeconomic policies are expected to boost real growth.

External position: Trade and current accounts have improved
in resource-rich countries owing to high commodity prices
and rising export volumes. At the same time, high oil and food
import bills are contributing to a worsening of external balances in resource-poor countries and threatening food security. On average, while oil-exporting countries are expected
‘o run current account surpluses to the tune of 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2011, oil-importing countries are expected to run into a
deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP. In addition, the soaring gold price
enefits Africa’s main gold producers such as South Africa,
Ghana, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Guinea, and Mali. Africa accounts
or around 30 percent of global gold production. On a year‘0-year basis, the price of gold increased significantly in 2011
compared to 2010. The price of gold continued its steep rise
during 2011, partly driven by global demand to hedge against
inancial market and exchange rate risks (See Figure 1.3).

Fiscal deficit: Due to the economic recovery and prudent fiscal
policies, African countries recorded a moderate fiscal deficit of
3.5 percent of GDP in 2010. It is estimated that this will increase
marginally to 3.6 percent in 2011 but then improve to slightly
below 3 percent in 2012. The 2011 increase is mainly due to the
deterioration of fiscal balances in North Africa in the wake of
political upheavals. However, fiscal consolidation may be uneven
across the continent if governments respond to higher food and
oil prices by increasing subsidies or if disbursements of ODA
all short of expectations.

 

Inflation: The median inflation rate was 4.2 percent in 2010, but
his accelerated to 5.6 percent in 2011 (see Figure 1.4), owing
mainly to rises in energy and food prices. Sustained increases
in food prices have driven inflation in some East African counries to historic highs. In Uganda, headline inflation in August
2011 climbed to 21.4 percent, the highest since February 1993.
nflation in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Rwanda shot up by 26.7
ercent, 12.7 percent, and 5.6 percent, on a year-to-year basis,
respectively. Food items have relatively higher weights in the
asket of goods and services of these countries. Although the
rend in food prices is largely reliant on regional outlooks of
agricultural production, forecasts of global food indices indicate
hat the upward pressure on food prices will remain throughout
2012 (see Figure 1.5). The rise in food prices following severe
droughts and spikes in fertilizer and energy prices have resulted
in inflation levels that are much higher than earlier forecasts

Economic expansion is expected to be stronger in resourcerich countries that could benefit from the increased demand
for primary commodities. Countries enjoying a robust economic
expansion with GDP growth of above 7 percent in 2011 include
Ghana, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Eritrea, and Mozambique. Partly
driven by new oil production, Ghana is a star performer on the
continent, with an expected real GDP growth of 13.7 percent in
2011. The fiscal and current account balances reflect these differences in natural resource endowments (see Figures 1.6 and 1.7).

1.2 Exogenous Risks

On the external front, the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and
the fiscal problems in the US have geared up market sentiment
against a rapid recovery. A fully-fledged Euro debt crisis could
have serious consequences on African trade and financial flows.
Estimates show that a1 percent decline in OECD GDP growth is
associated with a 9 percent fall in Africa’s export earnings. The
impact could be worse for Africa’s oil and mineral producers,
and exporters of agricultural products such as cotton and cocoa.

External financial flows: The slow pace of the global economic
recovery poses a serious threat to the flow of foreign direct
investment to Africa (see Figure 1.8). The economic currents
in developed and emerging market economies would seem to
mitigate against increases in foreign direct investment to the
continent. Indeed, with regard to ODA, donors may not meet
their Gleneagles commitments. Net ODA stagnated at around
US$ 47.2 billion in 2010, which is US$ 7.8 billion (or 14.2 percent)
short of the target. The current weak performance in Europe
and the US does not tilt the balance in favor of ODA expansion.

International food and commodity prices: There has been
upward pressure on food prices since 2010 (see Figure 1.5). As
a result, many countries, especially in East Africa, that are net
food importers are experiencing increasing import bills, deepening inflation, and a worsening of their external positions. About
eleven million people are now at risk of severe food insecurity
and in need of emergency assistance. Holding strategic food
reserves would help to mitigate the effects of food price volatility.

1.3. Remaining Challenges

Although Africa continues to perform well, it faces a number of
major challenges. In the long term, these include: the infrastructure
deficit; ensuring good governance and social inclusion, private sector promotion; and investing in higher education and vocational
training. There are also the risks and challenges associated with
regional integration, support for fragile states; deeper involvement
in middle-income countries; agriculture and food security, environment and climate change mitigation and adaptation; gender
mainstreaming, as well as knowledge generation to ensure that
Bank Group interventions in RMCs achieve development results.

Annual Report 2011(@) Closing Africa’s infrastructure gap: The infrastructure deficit in Africa is a major constraint to its development - and yet,
if successfully addressed, this area could offer massive potenial for growth. Africa’s poor level of infrastructure limits trade,
access to markets and basic services, and competitiveness. In
Sub-Saharan Africa for example, it reduces business productivity by about 40 percent and taxes national economic growth
by 2 percent annually. These constraints are not unique to
Sub-Saharan Africa; in North Africa, poor infrastructure limits accessibility to basic services and creates unequal access
o information technologies. Such disadvantages hinder private sector investment, which is a key driver of job and wealth
creation. Africa’s infrastructure lags behind other developing
countries in almost all asset classes. The largest gaps are in
he energy sector and paved road density. Whatever measure
is taken, the energy infrastructure in SSA delivers only a fracion of the services found elsewhere in the developing world.
Equally, as a result of SSA’s low road density, only one-third of
he population living in rural areas is within two kilometers of
an all-season road, compared with two-thirds of the populaion in other developing regions (see Figure 1.9).

 

 

The main constraints to infrastructure development and main
enance are:

* Deficiencies in planning, preparation, and procurement
including a lack of transparency);

* Lack of financing to meet the estimated US$ 93 billion per
year required to bring Africa’s infrastructure on a par with
other developing regions over the next decade;

* Poor management of existing infrastructure assets, as an
estimated 30 percent of African infrastructure required rehabilitation in 2010;2 and

* Obstacles to a regional approach to infrastructure develop
ment relative to national projects, such as markedly higher

transaction costs, more complex risks, and the need for crossborder cooperation and harmonization of policies.

 

Overcoming these constraints will require concerted efforts to
address inefficiencies in resources mobilization and to improve
governance capacity. Nevertheless, upgrading Africa’s infrastructure stock to the level of Mauritius could boost Africa’s
economic growth by as much as 2.3 percent per year? and
improve Africa’s competitive position. It would also broaden
economic opportunities by creating more jobs and more market interaction. In addition, it would significantly improve the
business-enabling environment, thereby accelerating private
sector development.

 

1 Spending US$ 1 on road maintenance provides an estimated savings of
USD$ 4 to the economy in avoided costs of rehabilitation (AICD, 2010).

AfDB, UNECA, AUC, in collaboration with the Korea Institute for International
Economic Policy (KIEP), 2010.

Annual Report 2011

Africa's Performance and Mid-term Prospects Chapter 1

(ii) Overcoming economic fragmentation: Africa has more
countries than any other continent and yet it is the least integrated of all developing regions. Its highly fragmented infrastructure network reflects the continent’s lack of integration
due to geographic as well as sociocultural differences, which
are partly a legacy of its colonial history. Therefore, it is not surprising that Africa is also the least competitive region of the
world, unable to benefit from economies of scale and increased
productivity that integration would provide.

Without integration and the removal of barriers to trade, the
prospects for market interaction have been severely curtailed.
Indeed, if markets were integrated, the trade within Africa
(which grew from US$ 48 billion in 2005 to US$ 76 billion in
2009) would have been even higher. However, growth has
been limited by cumbersome regulations, inadequate fiscal
and legal coordination, poor transportation infrastructure, and
a lack of resource and production complementarities among
many African countries.

It is clear that without a scaling-up of regional integration, most
African countries will continue to depend on the global economy
in their role as producers of primary commodities and importers of manufactured goods. Currently, most African goods
are destined for markets in the North, with only 10-12 percent
traded with other African nations (see Figure 1.10). Half of the
continent’s intraregional trade occurs in just one subregion, the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), through
which South Africa trades with its neighbors.

Africa’s low population density, wide geographic spread, and
low levels of urbanization make economic integration essential
‘or building economies of scale and making the continent internationally competitive. Promoting integration would accelerate overall growth rates and allow poorer areas to benefit from

growth in the trading hubs. Equally, greater regional integration
would help African countries to diversify their economies and
safeguard themselves against external shocks, while increasing efficiency and productivity. It could also provide a platform
for increased domestic and regional resources mobilization for
investment needs, and build resilience against potential shortages in foreign direct investment.

To achieve integration though will require that the political
rhetoric be translated into committed practical actions to spur
the development of infrastructure linkages and create incentives for increased private sector participation.

(iii) Developing the private sector: The private sector reduces poverty in Africa by creating employment and generating
income. With few exceptions, the cost of doing business in
Africa is among the highest in the world - indeed 9 out of the 10
lowest-ranked countries in the World Bank 2010 “Doing Business”
survey? are in Africa. In many African countries, businesses
face arbitrary laws and regulations and opaque enforcement
mechanisms. This creates incentives for informality, discourages investment, and undermines entrepreneurship. When the
proper legal and regulatory conditions are put in place, informal
enterprises are incentivized to enter the formal sector, where
they can better access financial services and markets, resulting
in increased growth and job creation.

 

3 “Lions on the Move: The progress and potential of African economies,”
McKinsey Global Institute, June 2010.

Although many African economies have grown over the past
decade at impressive rates, inequality and unemployment, particularly amongst the youth, have also increased. Therefore, to

achieve economic outcomes that lift greater numbers of people out of poverty requires a vibrant private sector in which

micro, small, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs) can thrive

alongside large firms. This demands the removal of constraints
to the business environment, improved access to finance, and

the provision of adequate infrastructure to support private sector activities (see Figure 1.11). Furthermore, studies have shown

that poverty falls faster where firrns and households have better
access to financial services. Yet, many Africans have little or no

access to financial services or to financial information.

(iv) Creating economic space for a growing workforce through
diversification: Africa still relies heavily on a narrow economic
base of raw materials which, if not expanded to new products,
will significantly limit its future growth potential. In spite of
recent progress, the industry structure in most African middleincome countries is characterized by low value added. These
activities tend to be geographically concentrated, leading to
widespread regional disparities. Remote areas and low productivity sectors are widely neglected in government policy and
expenditure. This is particularly the case for agriculture, which
employs about 60 percent of the population in most African
countries. Africa has abundant arable land and plentiful labor,
which if put to work effectively could provide food security for
the continent and better living standards for the rural population.
In recent years, the terms of trade have shifted in favor of the

Annual Report 2011farmer, creating real opportunities for poverty reduction in rural
areas. Yet, Africa is the only region of the world to have experienced a decline in per capita food production over the past 30
years. Agriculture contributed less than 10 percent of Africa’s
overall growth over the past decade, leaving per capita incomes
in rural areas to stagnate or decline in most countries. This is
due to chronic underinvestment in agricultural productivity.

In order to achieve sustainable growth and create new jobs,
African countries must diversify into a much broader range of
products and services to build their competitiveness. There is
a wide range of possibilities, including traditional and new agricultural crops, horticulture, fisheries, food processing, clothing,
jewelry, toys, furniture, tourism, financial services, call centers
and many more. Without more diversified economic opportunities, growth and poverty reduction will almost certainly stagnate. Also, a more diversified economy offers many benefits,
including reduced vulnerability to commodity shocks while at
the same time creating new and better-paid jobs. A diversified economy can stimulate the productivity gains that lead to
higher incomes and reduced poverty over time. To achieve this,
actions will be required to support agriculture and reduce business costs, especially for trade and expanding infrastructure.

(v) Addressing climate change and energy security: By most
estimates, climate change will have profound effects on developing countries, but particularly in the Africa region. Climate
change will undermine agricultural productivity and food security, strain water supplies, increase the frequency of droughts
and flooding, darnage coastal areas, and increase conflict over
scarce resources. Africa, along with many other developing
countries, will need to adapt to these changing circumstances.
Since agriculture is likely to be the hardest-hit sector, efforts to
increase agricultural productivity and to diversify production are
imperative. On the other hand, countries must manage forest
resources better, since deforestation is a major contributor to
CO, emissions. And they will need to adopt new green technologies in energy production, housing construction, and other
areas that increase energy efficiency. The mitigating actions that
African countries take now to stave off the effects of climate
change, and the support they receive from developed countries, will have a massive impact on how the continent fares in
the future. The countries that adopt sensible policies early on
will be much better positioned to adapt to climate change and

minimize the impacts on economic growth and poverty reducion in the long term.

 

(vi) Enhancing domestic resource mobilization: Africa faces
substantial development needs which are normally funded
rom external resources, including foreign direct investment, aid
and remittances. Often, in times of financial strain in the donor
countries, the gap between Africa’s development needs and
he resources it requires amplifies. Furthermore, most countries
in Africa, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, face large resource
gaps due to low domestic savings and high investment needs.
Conversely, where resources may be available, they often do
not reach businesses, especially start-ups and SMEs, because of
perceived risk on the part of lenders. Strengthening the financial
markets through facilities such as collateral registries and credit
bureaux could help to improve businesses’ access to finance.

 

To reduce these gaps, new sources will be required. Domestic
resource mobilization offers a range of methods for raising
tax revenues - by deepening the tax base, strengthening tax
administration, and formalizing the informal sector. Private savings can be increased by banking sector reforms and through
innovative methods such as securitizing future resources inflows
(e.g. remittances or oil revenues). As many countries still rely on
official aid to supplement their resources, the challenge will be
to ensure that the donors not only provide an adequate level
of aid, but also that they ensure its predictability, to assist in
forward planning. A further challenge is to effect a change in
attitude, whereby aid becomes a complement to private sector
investment and vice versa. This can be achieved, for example,
through initiatives aimed at crowding in additional private sector investment and also public-private partnerships.Chapter 1 = Africa’s Performance and Mid-term Prospects

(vii) Managing new partners and emerging powers: The emergence of new potential powers such as the BRICS countries,
namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, presents
significant opportunities for Africa’s growth but also challenges.
These countries are now providing an estimated US$ 8 billion
a year in aid, with an increase expected.‘ They tend to adopt a
more holistic approach to promoting their exports, supporting
direct investments and offering development assistance. BRICS
countries have become Africa’s major new trading partners, with
China emerging as the dominant one. Currently, China’s trade
with Sub-Saharan Africa exceeds US$ 100 billion, compared to
US$ 174.2 billion of trade with Europe. Also, the BRICS countries
are a source of foreign direct investment in Africa particularly in
the mining sector and in infrastructure. As investors, the BRICS
have been adding value in order to diversify African economies.
China, for instance, is beginning to invest in industrial parks in
various countries, which will stimulate Africa’s manufacturing
base. However, the BRICS’ influence across the region is uneven,
as the bulk of their trade and investment is concentrated in a
few countries.

The BRICS’ growing role creates many potential economic benefits. They provide a new market for raw materials and other

strengthening horizontal partnerships.

exports, while being a source of low-cost capital and consumer
goods. However, the rise of BRICS’ influence in the continent
also raises several concerns. Chief among them is the perceived
lack of transparency in negotiating and implementing agreements, which might facilitate corruption, undermine good governance, and violate environmental and labor standards. This
could eventuate in deals that ultimately do more harm than
good. Also, their focusing of investment in a few countries, most
of which are resource-rich, could accentuate disparities across
the subregions, making Africa’s growth less inclusive. Whether
the benefits to Africa of increasing engagement with BRICS
countries will ultimately outweigh the risks remains to be seen.
This will largely be determined by how effectively governments
and leaders in Africa manage the relationships.

 

Annual Report 2011The Bank also leverages strategic relationships with multinational private corporations, which are increasingly supporting
development in Africa through their corporate social responsibility or philanthropic programs.

(iii) Skills development: |nclusive growth is impossible without skills. Education empowers people to participate in and
benefit from both economic and social opportunities. It not
only helps to improve the quality of skills but also enables local
youth to take up emerging jobs as a result of increased capital. The unrest in North Africa illustrates starkly how Africa’s
education systems are poorly matched with the needs of the
labor market and are failing to provide young people with
economic opportunities. Emphasis should therefore be placed
on inclusion, through the establishment of links between
technical vocational training/apprenticeship and the corporate sector, and on reforms focusing on employability and
entrepreneurship. More investment should be channeled to
vocational training, with a focus on science and technology,
to address chronic unemployment. It is also important to help
bridge the digital gap between rural and urban areas, as well
as addressing differences in the educational opportunities
available to boys and girls.

(ix) Political stability and governance: The quality of a country’s institutions - including the quality of political representation and policy-making processes, the competence and
integrity of the bureaucracy, and the enforcement of contracts
and property rights - is a major factor in its overall economic
performance and its ability to tackle poverty. Around the world,
countries with better governance tend to have greater equality.
Yet, governance remains Africa’s major weakness. The region
has consistently underperformed on standard governance
indicators, scoring 30 percent lower than the Asian average
and 60 percent lower than the average among industrialized
countries. National elections in African countries (20 in 2011)
are often accompanied by the risks of (i) large government
spending that undermines fiscal discipline and (ii) political
instability. It is not surprising then, that many governance
indicators in Africa are currently worse than they were in
2000. In terms of economic governance, however, Africa is
performing quite well. Among the top 30 reformers listed in
Doing Business 2011, one-third of them are in SSA (Rwanda,
Cape Verde, and Zambia are in the top ten). However, the ratings for political governance are much worse, as most African
countries show a deterioration across a number of indicators.

Poor governance significantly compromises Africa's ability to
lift its populations out of poverty. Corruption costs Africa a
significant share of its GDP every year, with the burden falling heavily on the poorest. It is estimated that if Africa had
the quality of institutions that most Asian countries achieved

Annual Report 2011

Africa's Performance and Mid-term Prospects Chapter 1

in the early phase of their industrialization, its collective GDP
would be 80 percent higher than it is today. Capable states
and good governance will give more voice to the people and
will empower them to actively participate in wealth creation.
Good governance will also ensure that natural resources and the
environment on which the current and future growth depend
are managed in a transparent and responsible manner and
provide benefits to all.

11Chapter 2 Bank Group Response to Development Challenges

2.0

In line with its Medium-Term Strategy (2008-2012), the Bank
Group operations in 2011 continued to address pressing development challenges facing RMCs, to help them to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth and development. The focus was
on the four core priority areas of infrastructure, governance,
private sector development, and higher education and vocational training. The Bank also scaled up its support for fragile
states, middle-income countries (MICs), agricultural and rural
development, gender, environment, and climate change, regional
integration and trade as well as knowledge development and
management.

Introduction

2.1 Overall Approvals

The Bank Group approval of UA 5.72 billion for new operations
in 2011 represents an increase of 39.9 percent over the 2010
amount of UA 4.09 billion (See Figure 2.1). The approvals for
2011 signaled a return to a more regular pattern of lending after
the significant increase in 2009, when the Bank Group stepped
in to play a countercyclical role in response to the global economic crisis. Of the total amount approved in 2011, UA 4.13 billion was in the form of loans and grants, while UA 1.59 billion
was directed toward debt relief, private equity participations,
and Special Fund allocations.

2.2 Engagement in Subregions

In 2011, Bank Group project and program approvals for all five
subregions (including multinational projects and programs)
amounted to UA 4.13 billion. This was an increase of 12.5 percent
over the 2010 level of UA 3.67 billion. In terms of distribution,
West Africa attracted 24.8 percent of approvals funding; North
Africa, 21.9 percent; East Africa, 14.8 percent; Central Africa,
11.0 percent; and Southern Africa, 9.8 percent. Loan and grant
approvals for multinational projects and programs gained 17.8
percent of funding (see Figure 2.2).

The key Bank Group’s interventions in all the subregions include
the following: Domestic-Oriented SME Financing Program in
Nigeria; Financial Sector Development Support Program in
Morocco; Governance and Economic Competitiveness Support
Program in Tanzania; Rural Infrastructure Development Support
Project in Democratic Republic of Congo; and Eskom Renewable
Energy Project in South Africa.

and then finance. Multisector operations foster improvements
in public financial management and institutional reforms,
thereby promoting sound financial governance and robust

Program in Nigeria and Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP)
S.A. Investment Program 2008-2018 in Morocco (see Box 2.1).

2.4 Selectivity and Focus on the
Core Strategic Areas

By channeling the bulk of its approved financing to the MTS
priority areas (infrastructure, private sector development,
governance; and higher education; and vocational training),
the Bank continues to deliver on its commitment to selectivity and focus.

Morocco: Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) S.A.

 

The objective of this project is to increase and sustain OCP’s contribution to the Moroccan national economy and enhance its
position as international leader in the phosphates sector. The expected outcomes are: OCP’s phosphate production capacity
increases by 65 percent (from 28 to 47 million tonnes p.a.); government revenues are augmented; Foreign Direct Investment
in Morocco’s phosphates industry increases; greenhouse gas emissions are reduced; and employment is boosted with the
creation of 9,000 direct jobs.

Tunisia: Gabés-Médenine-Ras Jedir Highway Construction Project

 

The objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of Tunisia’s transportation system in order to boost the country’s
domestic and international trade. This will enhance regional integration within the five countries forming the Arab Maghreb
Union (AMU). The project will facilitate the movement of goods and people between Gabés (Tunisia) and the Tunisia-Libya
border and increase accessibility to key development centers located in the southeastern region of the country. The project
will also help to create direct jobs (2,000 jobs during the construction phase and 160 during the operational phase) with
potentially 30,000 further indirect jobs generated in the tourism and services sector.

contribute 60-80 percent of the subregion’s GDP. The project will also facilitate job creation within the identified sectors.
The expected outcomes include: a significant increase in trade volume and traffic through Kazungula between Botswana and
Zambia; reduced border transit-time (reduced transportation cost for trucks); and employment creation (direct and indirect
jobs of at least 200 persons recruited from local communities) during the project implementation and operational phases.

16 Annual Report 2011The Bank also approved the financing of two major bridges, which will serve as regional links. These are the Gambia
Bridge, linking The Gambia and Senegal in West Africa, and the
Kazungula Bridge, linking Botswana and Zambia in Southern
Africa (see Box 2.3).

The Bank’s approvals to the transportation sector in 2011 were
not restricted to roads but included other projects that foster
regional integration, boost trade and communication among
African countries, and open up international markets. For example, in the maritime subsector, a loan was approved in 2011 for
the construction and operation of the Lomé Container Terminal
in Togo to accommodate new supersize container ships. The
port is a gateway to the landlocked countries of Mali, Niger,
and Burkina Faso. Improving its capacity will facilitate overseas
exports and imports for these countries, as well as for Togo.

Information and Communications Technology (ICT): Two \CT
projects were approved during the year for a total amount of UA
21.6 million. These projects align to the Bank Group’s MediumTerm Strategy as well as its ICT Strategy, as they promote infrastructure, technological and vocational training, and regional
integration. The Bamako Digital Complex Support Project in
Mali (See Box 2.7 below) resonates with the new imperative to
build the capacity of African youth, to fully equip them with
the specialist skills needed in today’s labor market.

Energy: During the year, the Bank approved UA 420.1 million for
12 operations in the energy subsector, representing 26.7 percent of total approvals for infrastructure projects. The Bank’s
green agenda not only addresses energy deficits in an environmentally friendly way, but also creates jobs and improves

help to avoid significant greenhouse gas emissions, diversify
the energy mix, and address power deficits in the countries,
which are currently hampering socioeconomic development.

Water and Sanitation: Africa faces a problem of increasing
water scarcity, exacerbated by climate change, environmental
degradation, rapid population growth, and urbanization. The
Bank Group’s interventions focus on sustainable water resource
development and management across the continent. Loan and

 

17Chapter 2 Bank Group Response to Development Challenges

grant approvals for water and sanitation operations, together
with allocations from the Special Funds, totaled UA 1471 million in 2011. The Bank’s operations in the water and sanitation subsector focus on rural and peri-urban areas, where
the poorest members of society live; the objective being to
improve social wellbeing and access to basic amenities in these
deprived areas. Three new urban and peri-urban water supply
and sanitation projects were approved by the Bank Group in
2011 for Uganda, Egypt, and Zimbabwe, for a total amount of
UA 38.0 million. In addition to projects and programs financed
via its regular ADB and ADF windows, the Bank continues
to host three complementary initiatives: namely, the Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the African
Water Facility (AWF), and the Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program (MDWPP). In 2011, the Bank approved two RWSSI
operations, while under the AWF three projects were approved
for a total of UA 4.4 million.

Supporting the Private Sector

Private sector development is key to sustainable inclusive growth.
The Bank’s vision for private sector development is operationalized through a number of approaches, namely: improving the
business-enabling environment; supporting private enterprises;
strengthening financial systems and institutions; promoting
regional integration and trade; and creating a demonstration
effect that will help to catalyze resources from other financiers.

During the year, the Bank allocated UA 868.9 million to support
25 new private sector operations. The 2011 allocation comprises
UA 815.6 million in project loans and lines of credit (LOCs) and
UA 53.4 million in private equity participations. In addition, UA
4.5 million was approved from Special Funds to enhance private
sector development. The private sector operations represent
15.3 percent of the Bank Group’s total approvals for the year.
Three publicly guaranteed LOCs were approved for Tunisia and
Nigeria, to benefit private SMEs.

Figure 2.5 presents a breakdown of private sector operations
or 2011 according to the country classification. Regional and
multinational projects received the largest share (40.9 percent),
ollowed by middle-income countries (MICs) (35.1 percent)
and then low-income countries (LICs) (24.0 percent). The 2011
allocation to LICs exceeded the 2010 level of 19.0 percent and
included approvals for fragile states such as Zimbabwe, Togo,
and Sierra Leone. Although the share of approved operations
directly targeting LICs seems relatively low, when regional/
multinational operations that benefit LICs are factored in, the
figure rises to over 50 percent of approvals. In terms of sectoral allocations, in 2011 finance attracted the most private sector
approvals, followed by industries and services, and infrastructure (see Figure 2.6).

 

Financial services: |n 2011, UA 324.1 million of private sector
approvals were allocated to financial institutions, including
LOCs to the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA)

Governance Action Plan (GAP): Focal Areas

 

Level | - Country level: The focus at the first level is on strengthening country systems and institutions for better management of public resources, with an emphasis on oversight institutions and accountability systems. Special attention is paid to:
(i) fragile states, to strengthen state institutions and their capacity for financial governance and natural resources management; and (ii) middle-income countries, to improve the enabling environment for private sector development and investment.

Level Il - Sectoral level: Here the emphasis is on strengthening accountability and transparency in the management of public resources by promoting anti-corruption safeguards, especially in such high-risk sectors as the extractive industries and
infrastructure.

Level Ill - Regional level: At this level, the objective is to promote best international standards and codes of sound economic
and financial governance, including the fight against corruption.

Cote d'Ivoire: Emergency Program to Restore Basic Social and Administrative Services (PURSSAB)

 

The objectives of this program are to: (i) promote access to basic social and administrative services by rehabilitating social
services and water supply and sanitation networks, as well as capacity building for government services responsible for economic governance; and (ii) promote social cohesion and reconciliation and thereby restore stability. The expected outcomes
are: restored population’s access to health centers, schools, and social welfare centers; restored access to drinking water and

sanitation to 80 percent of the population; and consolidation of peace and a return to order and security.

 

 

operations (ISOs), non-lending activities, and upstream anaytical and advisory services. In accordance with the Bank’s
2008-2012 Governance Strategic Priorities and Governance
Action Plan (GAP), these interventions were undertaken at
country, sectoral, and regional levels (see Box 2.5).

 

At the country level, the Bank Group approved 21 programs and
projects during the year in support of good governance. This
amounted to a commitment of UA 698.5 million, covering 19
countries. Top priority was given to supporting fragile states
by rebuilding public financial management (PFM) systems and
public administration, restoring efficient service delivery, and
promoting inclusive growth. For instance, the policy-based
operation for Céte d'Ivoire was considered a critical intervention to help restore basic social services and amenities to the
population and to support the country’s transition toward peace
and stability after many years of crisis (see Box 2.6).

At the sectoral level, the Bank Group placed particular emphasis on improving governance and promoting integrity in the
high-risk sectors of mining and other extractive industries.
This is exemplified by the policy-based operations approved
for Tanzania and Guinea in 2011. Advisory services were also

20

provided to Mozambique and Ethiopia, to assist their validation
under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
which the Bank actively supports.

Also at the pan-African level, the Bank has supported the
establishment of three African Regional Technical Assistance
Centers (AFRITACs), which provide technical and advisory services for economic and financial governance in RMCs. Of the
UA 4.9 million that was approved for AFRITACs for the period
2010-2014, the Bank disbursed UA 3.9 million in 2011. The Bank
is also a strategic partner of the African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM), which is used by member countries to self-monitor all
aspects of their governance and socioeconomic development.

Investing in Youth: Higher Education,

Science, Technology, and Vocational Training

The MTS Mid-term Review reaffirmed Higher Education, Science,
Technology (HEST) and Vocational Training as an operational priority critical to Africa’s economic competitiveness and
employment generation. Five operations in this area were
approved during the year, amounting to UA 51.5 million. This
included the Bamako Digital Complex Support Project (see
Box 2.7) which will fund the establishment of Africa’s second
ICT Center of Excellence.

Social Assistance and Protection to

Enhance Human Capital Development

Social Inclusion: The Arab Spring and the spread of social unrest
and riots in several African countries have underscored the risks
posed by social exclusion, inequalities, unemployment, and lack
of voice for the masses. In response, during 2011 the Bank began
to formulate a comprehensive Human Capital Development
Strategy 2012-2016, which focuses on three areas critical for
inclusive growth. These are: (i) increasing competitiveness and
employment opportunities particularly for the youth, including
scaling up productivity in the informal sector; (ii) ensuring value
for money and accountability for improved service delivery; and
Ciii) improving social inclusion and cohesion.

Annual Report 2011

In 20, the Bank approved UA 344.3 million to support five
social inclusion projects and programs in six countries. The
Social Inclusion and Transition Support Program (UA 308.5 million) for Tunisia aims to reduce income poverty and create jobs,
strengthen civil society, give citizens a greater voice, and boost
the accountability of all national stakeholders (see Box 2.8).

Supporting the Health Subsector

The high burden of disease in Africa is a major economic and
social development issue. Healthy individuals are more productive, earn more, save more, invest more, consume more, and
work longer. Despite some progress on improved health outcomes, most African countries are not on track to achieve the

21Chapter 2 Bank Group Response to Development Challenges

health-related MDGs. Consequently, much needs to be done but
with limited resources. The Africa health agenda in the coming
decade will therefore be about value for money. It will make use
of transparent, evidence-based budgeting and results-based
financing; promote universal health insurance, and leverage
the opportunities provided by technological innovations, such
as e-healthcare systems.

Robust health systems are a precondition for sustainable and
inclusive human capital development. There is also a pressing
need to train and retain highly skilled health professionals within
the continent. The project for the Improvement of Health Services
Delivery at Mulago Hospital (UA 56.0 million) in Uganda will
scale up the delivery of quality health services to the population
(see Box 2.9). It targets two of the priority areas outlined in the
Bank’s Medium-Term Strategy, namely (i) vocational training and
(ii) investing in ICT infrastructure through the establishment of
a health management system.

Interagency Cooperation: The Bank is actively engaged in the
Harmonization for Health in Africa (HHA) Initiative jointly with
he World Bank, UNICEF, UNAIDS, UNFPA, WHO, USAID, and
ICA. The overarching aim of HHA is to strengthen health sysems toward achievement of the health-related MDGs. Based
on outcomes from conferences and workshops on the central
heme of “Aid Effectiveness in Africa’s Health Sector,” the Bank
ook a leading role during 2011 in promoting the concept of the
African health value-for-money agenda.

Facilitating Regional Integration in Africa

n 2011, the Bank formulated Regional Integration Strategy
Papers (RISPs) for the Southern, Eastern, Central, and Western
subregions for the 2011-2015 period. These are designed to
ring more focus and selectivity to regional integration efforts.

In terms of Bank Group approvals in 2011 for multinational/
regional operations, these totaled UA 735.2 million for 11 projects and programs. As shown in Figure 2.7, the transportation
subsector attracted the largest tranche, followed by finance.

On the global front, the Bank continues to be an active participant in the global Aid for Trade (AfT) initiative, which is led by
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In addition,
the Bank continues to support three major regional infrastructure
initiatives, namely: NEPAD-Infrastructure Project Preparation
Facility (IPPF); Program for Infrastructure Development in
Africa (PIDA); and Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA).

Annual Report 2011Agriculture and Food Security

The performance of the agriculture sector is central to the Bank
Group’s mission to reduce poverty and assist its RMCs to achieve
sustainable and inclusive growth. This sector has linkages to
many others. For example, infrastructure is paramount in terms
of irrigation systems to enhance agricultural productivity; also
good road networks are needed for the rapid movement of
produce from farms to wholesalers, storage facilities, and overseas markets. In terms of agriculture’s links to environment and
climate change, these became all too apparent in 2011 with the
Horn of Africa’s severe drought, failing harvests, escalating food
prices, famine, and massive displacements of people. Box 2.10
presents the Bank Group’s response to the crisis, which took
he form of an initial emergency contribution of UA 2.5 million
rom the Special Relief Fund and a pledge of a further UA 195.4
million for a regional long-term resilience program.

For the agriculture sector as a whole in 2011, loans and grants
or 11 operations were approved by the Bank Group, amounting to UA 145.6 million and covering nine countries. In addition,
UA 49.3 million was approved under the Special Funds to support projects and programs in three Horn of Africa countries.

 

Bank Group Response to Development Challenges Chapter 2

The Bank's Agriculture Sector Strategy (AgSS) 2010-2014 seeks
to increase agricultural productivity, enhance incomes, and
improve food security on a sustainable basis. It does this through
two mutually reinforcing pillars: (i) improving rural infrastructure
(water resources management and storage, agro-processing
and trade-related capacities for accessing local and regional
markets); and (ii) improving the management of renewable
natural resources. This adheres to the priorities set out in the
African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development
Program (CAADP).

Improving Rural Infrastructure: Pillar 1 of the AgSS focuses
on rural infrastructure - including water infrastructure. In line
with the Bank’s strategic focus and selectivity, 83.8 percent of
the 2011 approvals for the agriculture sector were allocated to
rural infrastructure.

 

Land Policy and Management: Pillar || of the AgSS aims to
improve the resilience of the natural resource base through
a three-pronged approach: (i) forestry, (ii) sustainable land
management, and (iii) climate change mitigation and adaptation.
One project approved under this pillar in 2011 was for the Natural

One of the most serious global humanitarian crises during 2011 was the Horn of Africa drought and famine, which affected
large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Djibouti. The Bank responded to this crisis firstly through emergency assistance
from its Special Relief Fund and, secondly, by developing a regional long-term resilience building program.

* Approximately 12 million people required emergency humanitarian assistance;

¢ This was the worst drought in 60 years in the Horn of Africa;

* High food prices and livestock mortality caused severe food insecurity;

+ Famine was declared in six regions of Somalia, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths; and
* Conflict in Somalia and refugee movements aggravated the crisis;

+ Failure of two consecutive rainy seasons and the increasing frequency and severity of the droughts - partly due to climate
* Inadequate governance systems and low institutional capacity to deal with natural disasters, emergencies, conflicts and
* Historically low investments in infrastructure, and marginalized rural communities with limited access to basic services.

* The Bank has pledged UA 195.4 million for a regional long-term resilience building program. UA 60 million has already been

earmarked from the Regional Operations window for the first phase of this program;
* In addition, the Bank contributed UA 2.5 million from its Special Relief Fund for emergency assistance to Djibouti, Ethiopia,

In 2011, the Bank participated in a High-Level Forum on the theme,
“Large-Scale, Land-Based Foreign Investments in Africa.” This was
organized in Nairobi by the Land Policy Initiative (LPI) Secretariat.
The LPI comprises a consortium of the AUC, ECA, and AfDB which
is engaged in developing a framework and guidelines on land
policy in Africa.

Agricultural Partnerships: The Bank Group has strengthened its
strategic partnerships with the AUC, ECA, World Food Program
(WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), International Fund
for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and United Nations Industrial
Development Organization (UNIDO) to harmonize cooperation
activities and build synergies. The AfDB also participates in other
global agriculture-related initiatives, such as the Global Agriculture
and Food Security Program (GAFSP), the Alliance for a Green
Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the Global Environment Facility (GEF),
and the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.
In 2011, the GAFSP approved a total of UA 50.0 million for projects
in Liberia and Niger, which are being supervised by the Bank.

Energy, Environment, and Climate Change

The Bank Group has expanded its role in energy, environment, and
climate change since the establishment in 2010 of a department
dedicated to these areas. The Bank has adopted a two-pronged
approach: focusing not only on advocacy activities but also, in terms
of its operations, on mainstreaming climate change into development planning. As part of this effort, during the year it continued
to support sustainable and clean energy in line with its low-carbon
development vision for the continent. It also ramped up efforts to
combat deforestation and to support sustainable land and water
resources management.

24

 

Environmental and Climate Change Special Funds: |n addressing issues of environmental sustainability and climate change, the
Bank mobilized not only its own resources but also finance from
Special Funds for a total of UA 120.0 million. The Special Funds
for the environment comprise the Climate Investment Fund (CIF);
Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF); Global Environment Fund (GEF);
and Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA). The latter was
established in 2011 and seeded with an initial disbursement from
Denmark of UA 30.0 million equivalent.

Forging a Collective Voice for Africa

One of the ways in which the Bank helps to address challenges
facing its RMCs is by collaborating with other pan-African partners and regional economic communities. Through this approach,
it seeks to generate and disseminate deeper knowledge about the
development issues facing the continent and foster policy dialogue
with RMCs. The Bank also works closely with its regional partners
to help forge a unified and collective voice for Africa. The aim is
to articulate united positions on key issues - and concerns - that
are uppermost in the minds of regional policymakers and leaders.

The Bank at International and Regional Fora

In 2011, this was manifested in the Bank’s active participation in highlevel international events that focused on issues of great importance
to Africa’s development agenda. These included participation in the
meetings of Ministers and Experts to prepare recommendations
for the G20 Leaders’ Summit. The meetings urged the leaders to
support African countries to improve trade facilitation and logistics.
Another key recommendation was to enhance the productive capacity and ability of local African enterprises to compete in regional and
global supply chains. Consequently, the G20 Conference of Ministers
and Officials recommended for inclusion in the G20 Action Plan for
Development an emphasis on: (i) private sector and infrastructure
development to build a business-enabling environment and (ii)
promotion of intraregional trade and integration.

Cognizant of capacity development challenges in the continent,
the Bank continued in 2011 to conduct activities in support of two
key pillars of its Capacity Development Strategy. Under the pillar
Enhancing the development effectiveness of Bank Group operations,
16 workshops were delivered on the following themes: Bank Rules
and Procedures; Project Performance Enhancement Tools; Results
Based Monitoring and Evaluation; and Scaling up Poverty Reduction
Strategies. Under the second pillar, Strengthening RMCs’ capacity
for policy design and development management, 17 workshops
were conducted, 10 under the Joint African Partnership agreement
between the IMF and the Bank.

Responding to Diverse

Client Needs - Analytical and Advisory Services

As aresult of almost five decades of operations in its RMCs to support their development, the Bank has accumulated a large stock of
lessons learned and best practices. In 2011, the Bank continued to
mainstream this knowledge base in its operations and long-term
development strategies for RMCs.

2.5 Enhancing Relevance for
All Regional Member Countries

Through its various operations and instruments, the Bank seeks to
assist all its RMCs - fragile states, low-income countries (LICs), and
middle-income countries (MICs). Its support is tailored to the differing needs of each regional member, in line with Country Strategy
Papers (CSPs) which are drawn up in close collaboration with RMC
representatives. These CSPs take account of national priorities as
well as the Bank’s own strategic focal areas in order to maximize
the development effectiveness of its operations. Under the Bank’s
Medium-Term Strategy 2008-2012, particular emphasis is placed
on scaling up support to MICs and fragile states.

Supporting Fragile States

The Bank recognizes that fragile states face a daunting set of challenges: to reconstruct critical infrastructure (transportation, water,
energy, and ICT networks); to create decent jobs; strengthen their
economies; restore access to basic services (e.g. health, water and
sanitation, and education); strengthen public finance administrations
and ensure good governance; and rehabilitate displaced persons
and disaffected youth to create an inclusive society.

At the end of December 2011, the Bank approved UA 168.0 million of
Pillar | allocations to projects and programs in six fragile states. This

included a UA 65.0 million contribution to the Emergency Program

to Restore Basic Social and Administrative Services (PURSSAB), to

assist Céte d'lvoire’s reconstruction efforts (see Box 2.6). In addition, the Board approved Sudan's eligibility to Pillar | resources.
Under Pillar Ill resources, UA 16.2 million was approved for various

programs in five countries.

In addition, the Bank approved a capacity-building project for
the University of Juba, South Sudan, financed from the Bank's
Governance Trust Fund at a total cost of UA 314,200. Through
this project, government officers will be trained by staff from the
University in Auditing, Fiduciary Management, and Resource
Mobilization. To deepen its assistance and contribute toward the
new state's National Development Plan, the Bank also: (i) financed
the preparation of the South Sudan Integrated Fiduciary Assessment
in collaboration with the World Bank; and (ii) undertook sectoral assessments in agriculture, transportation, energy, water and
sanitation, and information and communication technology (ICT).

These sectoral assessments culminated in the Infrastructure Action
Plan (IAP), which the Bank is presently finalizing. The IAP will be
used as an instrument both for resource mobilization and policy
dialogue with the country. In addition, the Bank undertook an
appraisal mission in November-December 2011 to gain an overview
of the status of the national statistical system in South Sudan. The
aim was to identify statistical areas and functions that need to be
established and/or strengthened in order to produce accurate and
reliable statistics. Capacity-building will be an essential element in
creating a robust national statistical system - one that can generate vital information required for the planning and implementation
of future development programs.

 

Deeper Involvement in Middle-income Countries
The Bank Group’s MTS emphasizes deeper engagement with middle-income countries (MICs), by positioning the institution as their
preferred development partner. In this respect, the Bank has developed effective linkages between public/private operations, as well

as competitive lending products, backed by high-value knowledge

and advisory services.

Approvals in 2011 for operations in MICs (excluding multinational
projects and programs) amounted to UA 1.59 billion, which is a
decrease of 15.4 percent from the 2010 level. Figure 2.8 shows the
sectoral distribution, with infrastructure receiving the largest share
(45.2 percent).

 

The geographic distribution of Bank Group approvals to MICs in
2011 shows North Africa as the principal beneficiary of non-concessionary lending followed by Southern Africa, Central Africa, West
Africa, and East Africa (see Figure 2.9).

In terms of financing instruments to MICs, project lending (for both
public and private sectors) continued to predominate in 2011, followed by policy-based operations (see Figure 2.10). MIC grants
remained at almost the same level in 2011 as in the previous year.
A new feature of the financing in 2011 was the increased use of
Special Funds.

Key Institutional Reforms and
Corporate ManagementChapter 3 Key Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

3.0

The key objectives of the Bank’s reforms are to improve its
corporate performance and development effectiveness, and
to instill a “One Bank” culture within the institution. The institution has also been enhancing its long-term operational and
financial sustainability, in line with commitments made under
the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and the Twelfth
Replenishment of the African Development Fund (ADF-12).
In addition, efforts continue to attract and retain the best talents and skills mix, within the framework of the Bank’s Human
Resources Strategic Framework and Action Plan (2007-2012).

Introduction

3.1 Key Institutional Reforms

Good progress was made during 2011 in all areas of institutional
reform launched under the 2007 reform agenda. Achievements
included the adoption of the Decentralization Roadmap for
Bank operations.

Decentralization of Bank Operations

Adopted in April 2011, the Roadmap on Decentralization provides
guidance for the transfer of greater decision-making authority
to the field offices (FOs). The objectives of the Roadmap are to
enhance services to clients in RMCs, based on three pillars: (i)
strengthening the existing FOs by giving them greater responsibility for portfolio management and implementation, and for
scaling up their analytical work; (ii) expanding the Bank’s presence in fragile states; and (iii) consolidating regional capacity
through the establishment of five Regional Resource Centers.
It is expected that the Decentralization Roadmap will help to
improve the quality of the Bank’s portfolio, strengthen its analytical work, and provide its many clients with tailored assistance.

A Permanent Committee on the Review and Implementation
of the Decentralization (PECOD) was established in January
2011 to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the
Decentralization of Bank operations. Milestones in 2011 include:

* The opening of four new FOs in fragile states (Togo, Liberia,
Central African Republic, and Burundi);

 

>» 2011 saw the opening of four new
field offices for the AfDB, in the fragile
states of Togo, Liberia, Central African
Republic, and Burundi.

28

+ Preparatory work for the opening of the fifth FO in South
Sudan in 2012; and

* The establishment of two pilot Regional Resource Centers
in Nairobi and Pretoria, which will become operational during 2012.

The Bank also scaled up its efforts to implement the new business model implied by the enhanced decentralization and
revision of the Bank’s Delegation of Authority Matrix. It was
underscored that devolving authority to the field presents new
institutional challenges for the Bank, as it requires seamless
communication and IT facilities, in addition to an appropriate
skills mix in the FOs.

Expanding and Revamping Key Policies

As part of the institutional reforms agreed during the GCI-VI
and ADF-12 consultations, in 2011 the following Bank Group
policies were developed or revised:

* Policy on Program-Based Operations (PBOs): The new Policy
ushered in aname change (from “Policy-Based Operations” to
“Program-Based Operations”). The new term is more reflective
of the broadening scope and application of such instruments.
The overarching rationale for this new Policy is to provide a
comprehensive framework that will better position the Bank
Group to support the development needs of its RMCs in a
transparent and results-oriented manner;

Fiduciary Risk Management Framework for PBOs (FRMF):
The new FRMF established a comprehensive and transparent
approach to the identification, mitigation, and management
of fiduciary risks across the main pillars of Budget, Audit, and
Corruption. It is already being implemented in the design and
usage of policy-based operations (PBOs).

Energy Sector Policy: The Bank Group elaborated its first
Energy Policy in 1994. In light of new developments and
challenges in this sector, anew Energy Sector Policy is under
preparation to guide its interventions. The aim is to promote
affordable and reliable energy infrastructure and services for
its RMCs in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner;

Private Sector Development Policy: A new policy has been
formulated to refine the Bank's activities in this area. The institution’s approach to private sector development is to provide
not only financial investments but also technical assistance to
bankable private sector-led projects and programs;

Policy on Disclosure and Access to Information: This updates
the institution's disclosure policy in line with best practices
and the Bank’s commitment to good governance;

Urban Development Strategy. This is geared to assist RMC governments to transform African cities and towns into engines
of economic growth and social development. The Strategy is
anchored on three pillars, namely: infrastructure, governance,
and private sector development;

Annual Report 2011+ Income Model for the ADB: A key commitment under GCI-VI,
the Income Model provides a framework within which loan
pricing, income allocation, and administrative expenses decisions can be balanced;

Managing GCI Resources and Large Loans: In a resourceconstrained environment, this GCI-VI commitment seeks to
ensure that capital resources are used in a balanced way for
the benefit of all borrowing member countries without the
need for an early return to shareholders for further capital
increases;

Capital Adequacy and Exposure Management Framework:
This updates the ADB's capital adequacy policy, including
further refinements of risk capital charges and enhancements in line with best practices and the evolving regulatory
environment; and

Operational Risk Management Framework: This formalizes the
Bank’s framework for managing operational risks in accordance with evolving practices.

being reviewed to improve this indicator.

Roadmap to Development Effectiveness

Adopted in March 2011, this Roadmap was designed to support
the Bank's development effectiveness agenda in the run-up to
the 4th High Level Forum, held in Busan, Korea, in November
2011. Priorities identified included: strengthening transparency
and accountability for development results; expanding the use
of country systems; and enhancing field-level engagement by
increased decentralization.

3.2 Human Resources Management

The Bank continues to make progress in attracting and retaining
the best talent within the framework of its Human Resources
Strategic Framework and Action Plan (2007-2012) and the
corporate services reform agenda. During 2011, 191 new staff
joined the Bank, of whom 22 were young professionals. Internal
capacity was further enhanced with 183 promotions through
internal competition.

The total staff strength of the Bank rose by 5.1 percent, from 1,810
to 1,902 during the period 2010-2011. This includes Management
and Professional Level (EL/PL) and General Services (GS) staff
in both the Bank’s Temporary Relocation Agency in Tunis and
in the field offices (FOs), and takes account of staff departures
during this period. There were 1,213 PL staff members in place
as at December 31, 2011 (including Advisers to the Executive
Directors), and 689 GS staff. In terms of the gender balance
at year end, 28 percent of PL staff and 55 percent of GS staf
were female. In 2011, the Bank recruited an additional 29 new
local staff for the field offices, bringing the total number of FO
staff to 315, compared with 286 in 2010 - an increase of 10.
percent (see Table 3.2).

Despite progress made in recent years, the vacancy rate for PL
staff remains a challenge. As at December 31, 2011, the figure
stood at 15 percent. It is, however, expected that with more
collaborative recruitment processes, vacancy pooling, and
enhanced technology, the vacancy rate will be reduced to less
than 10 percent. As for the attrition rate, there were 44 resignations. Initiatives to stem departures include; the develoomen
of an enhanced work/life balance policy; the introduction o
an executive leadership program for senior executives to complement the leadership development program for managers;
improvement of staff management skills; and the enhancemen
of the Bank’s physical work environment.

 

30

During the year, the Bank extended the retirement age from 60
to 62 years, with effect from January 1, 2012. It also established
a series of action plans in response to the concerns expressed in
the staff satisfaction survey. As part of the ongoing decentralization process, the Bank reinforced the provisions in respect of
mobility to and from FOs and Regional Resource Centers. This
will ensure that all offices continue to have sufficient capacity,
both in terms of numbers and skills mix, to effectively deliver
on the Bank’s mandate.

A new payroll system was introduced during the year for
enhanced salary administration and improved customer service. In terms of employee wellbeing, the Bank consolidated
its Medical Plan in 2011 and strengthened the financial sustainability of the Plan through a review of benefits. In addition,
efforts were made to scale up recognition of the Medical Plan
by the main health providers in the various countries hosting
he Bank’s FOs.

he institution continued to implement its 2010-2012 Learning
and Development Strategy. In this respect, 23 percent of staff
were trained and the content of the Bank’s learning management
system (LMS) was expanded to include over 2,800 different
raining courses in English and French, 1,300 e-book summaries, 700 e-books, and exhaustive mapping of the organization's
core competencies, through six learning centers.

Finally, the strengthening of the HR function - which was
one of the four pillars of the Human Resources Strategic
Framework and Action Plan (HRSFAP, 2007-2012) - will enale the provision of a dedicated and customized support to
users. Decentralization of the HR functions commenced in
2011, with dedicated HR business partners assigned to various
operational complexes. Further enhancements will be based
on the findings of the recent HRSFAP review undertaken by
external consultants.

ee.Chapter 4 Governance Oversight and Activities of the Boards

4.0

The Boards of Governors and the Boards of Directors constitute the Bank Group’s governance and oversight organs. Each
of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the Fund is constituted by ministerial or other high-level representatives of the
78 member states of the Bank Group. The Board of Governors
of the Bank elects a 20-member resident Board of Directors
to oversee the general operations of the Bank. The Fund has a
14-member resident Board of Directors, comprising 7 persons
from the Board of Directors of the Bank, designated by the
State Participants to represent them, while the Bank designates
7 persons also from the Board of Directors to represent their
interests. Each AfDB member country has an equal number
of basic votes in addition to a number of votes proportionate
to its paid-in shares. This chapter outlines the Board’s activities during 2011, with particular emphasis on the 2011 Annual
Meetings held in Lisbon, Portugal.

4.1

2011 Annual Meetings

The Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the African
Development Bank (ADB) and the African Development Fund
(ADF) took place in Lisbon, Portugal, on June 9-10, 2011, under
the Chairmanship of His Excellency Mr. Fernando Teixeira Dos
Santos, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Portugal and
Governor of the Bank. The theme of the meeting was “Towards
an Agenda for Inclusive Growth in Africa.” Notably, this was the
third time the Bank would hold its Annual Meetings in a nonAfrican country. The venue was also historically significant, as
Portugal was the first country to become a non-regional member of the Bank.

Introduction

Boards of Governors

The Annual Meetings were preceded by meetings of the
subsidiary organs of the Boards of Governors, the Financial
Presentation, and high-level and other seminars. Participants
included Governors, Alternate Governors, members of the
Boards of Directors, delegates, development partners, the private sector, members of civil society, academia and the media,
as well as AfDB staff.

Opening Ceremony
The formal opening ceremony was presided over by His
Excellency Mr. Luis Amado, Portuguese Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs, in the presence of several dignitaries. His
Excellency Mr. Fernando Teixeira Dos Santos, in his opening
statement, noted the connection between the global economic
recession and the theme of the Annual Meetings, and urged the
Bank to focus on development programs that would promote
inclusive growth in regional member countries and reduce
poverty through job creation and economic opportunity. He
underlined the importance of the Bank’s continued support for

 

34

infrastructure development, good governance, the private sector, regional integration, and mitigation of the effects of climate
change, particularly in fragile states and low-income countries.

In his statement, Dr. Donald Kaberuka, President of the African
Development Bank Group, welcomed the resolution of the postelection conflict in the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire, the host country
of the Bank’s Headquarters. He noted that this paved the way
for reconciliation and reconstruction, which would facilitate
the Bank’s orderly return to its Headquarters, once conditions
permit. Pledging the Bank’s preparedness, in collaboration
with the international community, to assist Cote d’lvoire in its
reconstruction efforts, the President thanked the Government
and people of Tunisia for their hospitality since the temporary
relocation of the Bank’s operations to their country in 2003.

The President, referring to the theme of the 2011 Annual Meetings,
affirmed that the Bank was poised to assume a leadership role
by promoting inclusive growth in Africa. In this regard, he recommended actions should be taken to: (i) boost agricultural
productivity for small farmers; (ii) support small and mediumsize enterprises (SMEs) to increase incomes and reduce poverty;
ciii) expand access to quality education for all; (iv) provide better access to water and sanitation; (v) promote gender equality; (vi) put in place basic safety-nets; (vii) bring governments
closer to the people through decentralization to the local level:
(viii) strengthen anti-corruption mechanisms; (ix) make finance
work for the poor; and (x) propose ways to avoid the Dutch
disease - the natural resource curse, which generates impressive growth side by side with massive poverty levels.

Referring to the upcoming COP17 meeting on Climate Change,
which was to be held in Durban from November 28 to December
9, 2011, President Kaberuka underscored the necessity for Africa
to have its voice heard. He noted that the Africa Green Fund
should be a mechanism to solidify the connection between
development priorities in Africa and climate change initiatives.

 

In his opening statement, His Excellency Mr. Luis Amado, Minister
of State, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Portugal, commended
the Bank’s role in making Africa a part of the global economic
community and urged it to pursue its policy of decentralization,
infrastructure development, good governance, and regional
integration. He emphasized the importance of greater cooperation and coordinated action by relevant world bodies, going
forward. This, he noted, was essential in order to: (i) ensure
economic stability through the sustained implementation of
macroeconomic reforms; (ii) open up markets for international
trade and promote private sector investments; and (iii) ease
social and geopolitical tensions through poverty reduction
and equitable wealth redistribution. His Excellency, Mr. Amado,
noted that international finance institutions can assist countries
to design programs geared to the attainment of the Millennium

 

Annual Report 2011Development Goals. In that regard, he commended the Bank
for its contribution in helping to stabilize the situation in North
Africa, following the recent turmoil in the subregion.

Highlights of Governors’ Statements
The Governors acknowledged the progress made in implementing reforms adopted in the context of the Sixth General Capital
Increase of the Bank (GCI-VI) and the Twelfth ADF replenishment
(ADF-12). This included the formulation of Regional Integration
Strategies, the adoption of a comprehensive income model, the
strengthening of the Bank’s risk management capacity, and
consolidation of the Bank’s quality and results agenda through
the adoption of a new Results Measurement Framework.

The Governors acknowledged the Bank's swift reaction to recent
events in Tunisia and Céte d'Ivoire. In this context, they welcomed
the theme of the 2011 Annual Meetings, “Towards an Agenda
for Inclusive Growth in Africa,” noting that the socioeconomic
upheavals in North Africa and the Middle East had produced
a worldwide ripple effect. This highlighted the need to support African countries on the path to inclusive, sustainable, and
shared growth.

In respect to the attainment of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), the Governors noted that the target date of
2015 was fast approaching, and that several countries still had
a long way to go to achieve those goals. In this respect, they
emphasized the need for coordinated action by the interna

tional community and the essential role that the Bank should
continue to play in supporting its RMCs.

With regard to the Bank’s sectoral priorities, the Governors called for
the finalization of the Bank’s Energy Policy. Further, they reaffirmed

the core areas of Bank intervention, as set out in its Medium-Term

Strategy, namely infrastructure and regional integration, governance, private sector development, higher education and vocational

training, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Governors’ Resolutions and Decisions

During 2011, the Boards of Governors approved the recommendations presented by the Joint Steering Committee and
adopted a total of ten Resolutions for the Bank Group, including nine during the Annual meetings (see Appendices II-1 and
Appendix Ill-1). These included resolutions on the Annual Report
and the Audited Financial Statements for the financial year
ending December 31, 2010 for the African Development Bank,
Nigeria Trust Fund, and Special and Trust Funds. The Governors
also approved the Annual Report and Audited Special Purpose
Financial Statements of African Development Fund for the
financial year ending December 31, 2010.

In addition, the Boards of Governors agreed to: (i) allocate UA

23,130,000 from the Bank’s 2010 allocable income to the Surplus
Account, (ii) distribute from the allocable income: (a) UA 35
million as a contribution to the ADF-12; and (b) UA 68 million
to a Special Account dedicated to the debt service of part of

the consolidated loans of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC); and (iii) distribute from the Surplus Account, (a) UA 5
million for the Technical Assistance Fund of Middle-Income
Countries, and (b) UA 5 million for the Special Relief Fund. In
addition, for NTF, the Governors approved the retention of UA
1,516,000 of the 2010 income in reserves, and the allocation of
UA 183,200 for the HIPC Initiative.

Furthermore, the Governors approved the composition of the
Bureau, and the Joint Steering Committee for the following
periods:

* From the end of the 2011 Annual Meetings to the end of the
2012 Annual Meetings, the Bureau would comprise Tanzania
as Chair, with Saudi Arabia and Lesotho as the first and second Vice-Chairs, respectively. During the same period, the
Joint Steering Committee would comprise Belgium, Benin,
Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Ghana, Mauritius, Democratic Republic
of Congo, and South Africa.

From the end of the 2012 Annual Meetings to the end of the
2013 Annual Meetings, the Bureau would comprise Morocco
as Chair, with Spain and Liberia as the first and second ViceChairs, respectively. The Joint Steering Committee would
comprise, during that period, Burkina Faso, China, Denmark,
Finland, Guinea-Bissau, Libya, Rwanda, Seychelles, and
Swaziland.

4.2 Boards of Directors

The Boards of Directors discussed and approved a range of policies, projects, and programs during the year under review. In
total, they approved 184 operations for an amount of UA 5.72
billion, which is a 39.9 percent increase over the 2010 level of
UA 4.09 billion. The focus was on positioning the Bank to assist
its regional member countries in a number of areas: to weather
the prevailing difficulties in the global economy; to green their
economies, in terms of climate change adaptation and clean
energy generation; to achieve more socially inclusive growth;
and to foster new partnerships in the evolving global development landscape. Furthermore, the Bank Group maintained its
operational strategy throughout the period of sociopolitical
unrest in North Africa, which became known as the Arab Spring.

The Board endorsed the Mid-Term Review of the Bank Group’s
Medium-Term Strategy, underscoring the need to remain focused
on the key pillars. The Board, cognizant of the importance of
an effective Bank presence in the field to achieve its development objectives, approved the Bank Group’s Decentralization
Roadmap. The Board also approved the phased establishment
of External Representation Offices (EROs) in Asia, the Americas,
and Europe. The EROs will assist in the Bank Group’s advocacy
work for the successful mobilization of resources and in the forging and strengthening of partnerships in other global regions.

36

While acknowledging the Bank’s robust financial position and
high institutional reputation, the Board underscored the need
for financial vigilance during this time of global financial uncertainty. In this context, the Board endorsed the Bank’s framework for the management of GCI resources and large loans. In
addition, they approved a proposal for a definition of the Bank’s
Risk Appetite, Risk Dashboard and Enhancement of Credit
Risk Governance, and revised Capital Adequacy and Exposure
Management Framework.

The year 2011 witnessed the creation of Africa’s newest state, the
Republic of South Sudan. Pending the completion of its membership of the Bank, the Boards - recognizing the urgent development needs of the new state - sought to provide sustained
development assistance. Accordingly, the Boards of Directors
recommended to the Boards of Governors, the approval of a
Cooperation Agreement with South Sudan, to provide a framework for the delivery of development assistance during the
interim period.

Management’s Report Regarding the Effectiveness of Internal Controls
Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 21, 2012

he Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentaion and overall integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and
he Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board, while those of the African Development Fund were prepared ona special purpose basis.

he financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to
all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board.
janagement believes that all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The
external auditors’ report accompanies the audited financial statements.

j|anagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conormity with the basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken
‘o correct deficiencies identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by
management and internal audit and are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the
integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and
he circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as
opposed to absolute, assurance with respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control sysem can change with circumstances.

he Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUF) to assist the Boards, among
other things, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the
effectiveness of internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees
he process for the selection of external auditors and makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors,
which in turn makes a recommendation for the approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management
‘o review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors
regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and any other matter that may
require AUFI’s attention.

he Bank’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that
he Bank Group maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the Financial Statements for
2011. Management is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2011 financial statements.

 

n addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2011, the external auditors of the Bank
Group conducted an independent assessment of the Bank Group’s internal control framework and their opinion thereon is pre
sented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group regarding the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2011

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2011, based on criteria
established in ”’ Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls over financial
reporting for 2011.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (JSAE) 3000, issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal control is maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the

African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting during the
year ended 31 December 2011, based on criteria established in /nternal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund

as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed
unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

Financial Management

 

Ibscription

The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and callable capital. The paid-up capital is the amount of capital payable
over a period determined by the Board of Governors’ resolution
approving the relevant General Capital Increase. The Bank’s callable capital is subject to payment as and when required by the
Bank to meet its obligations on borrowing of funds for inclusion
in its ordinary capital resources or guarantees chargeable to such
resources. This acts as protection for the Bank’s bond holders and
olders of guarantees issued by the Bank in the event that it is not
able to meet its financial obligations. There has never been a call
on the capital of the Bank.

Following the Board of Governors’ approval for a 200 percent
increase of the Bank’s capital base in 2010, the authorized capi‘al of the African Development Bank was increased to UA 67.69
illion? following the creation of 4,374,000 new shares with a
par value of UA 10,000 each. Six percent of the shares created
under this Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) are paid-up
(UA 2.62 billion), while ninety-four percent (UA 41.12 billion) are
callable. As of December 31, 2011, all the GCI-VI shares have been
ully allocated and accepted by member countries. In accordance
with the resolution governing this capital increase, the new GCI-VI
shares were allocated to regional and non-regional members in
such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the regional group
olds 60 percent of the total capital stock and the non-regional
group 40 percent.

 

in 2010, Canada and Korea had responded favorably to the Bank's
need for expanded financial capacity pending decisions on GCI-VI,
by offering a temporary increase of their callable capital with no
attached voting rights. This temporary callable capital was returned
‘0 the Bank in 2011, as soon as the subscription of Canada and Korea
‘0 GCI-VI became effective. Following the adoption of the Board of
Governors’ resolution to retire and cancel the 163,296 non-voting
callable shares previously subscribed by Canada, the number of

 

Table 5.1

Authorized and Subscribed Capital, 2010 and 2011

African Development Bank Chapter 5

authorized shares of the Bank decreased from 6,768,746? shares
to 6,605,450 shares in 2011. This cancelation reduced the total
authorized capital of the Bank to UA 66.05 billion as at December
31, 2011. The authorized capital is expected to decrease further
to 6,586,036 shares once the Board of Governors approves the
resolution authorizing the cancelation of the shares that had been
temporarily allocated to the Republic of Korea following the effectiveness of Korea’s subscription to GCI-VI.

The paid-up portion of the GCI-VI subscription is payable in eight
equal annual installments for regional member countries eligible
to borrow from ADB and non-regional members, and twelve equal
annual installments for Regional Member Countries eligible to
borrow only from ADF. Some member countries have elected to
pay their subscription in fewer installments, opting for an advance
payment scheme, and will receive a discount on their GCI-VI subscription payment accordingly.

A member country’s payment of the first installment triggers the
subscription to the entire callable capital portion, and shares representing the paid-up portion of subscriptions are issued only as and
when the Bank receives the actual payments for such shares. Table 51
below summarizes the evolution of the Bank's authorized, paidup, callable and subscribed capital at December 31, 2010 and 2011.

As at December 31, 2011, the paid-up capital of the Bank amounted
to UA 3.29 billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the portion of paidup capital that has been actually paid) level of UA 2.51 billion,
compared with UA 2.38 billion and UA 2.36 billion of paid-up and
paid-in capital, respectively, in 2010. The Bank's callable capital at
December 31, 2011 stood at UA 34.03 billion including UA 18.63 billion from non-borrowing member countries rated A- and higher.

In accordance with the Bank's Share Transfer Rules, shares for which
payment have become due and remain unpaid are forfeited after a
prescribed period and offered for subscription to member countries
within the same membership group (i.e regional or non-regional).

The position of the Bank’s capital subscriptions at December 31,
2011 is shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital Stock

and Voting Powers, which forms part of the Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Report.

 

In addition to the stringent monitoring and managing of the key
metrics related to its financial strength, the Bank is rated by four
major rating agencies. For 2011, all the four major rating agencies:
Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency have once again reaffirmed their AAA and AAt+
rating of the African Development Bank's senior and subordinated
debts respectively, with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects the
Bank's strong financial position, including sound capital adequacy,
prudent financial management and policies, solid membership support and its preferred creditor status. The strong support from its
members was evidenced by the recent significant capital increase
approved by its Board of Governors.

The Bank strives to raise funds from the capital markets at the lowest possible cost to support its lending activities. The top-notch
credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank enables it to issue securities at
competitive interest rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by
client and cash flow requirements, asset and liability management
goals, and risk management policies.

The 2011 funding program in capital markets was approved for a
maximum amount of UA 4.30 billion including up to UA 150 million
to be drawn down under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance
(EPSA) for Africa initiative. During the year, the Bank raised a
total of UA 2.46 billion with a weighted average maturity of 5.6
years, and an additional UA 70 million under the EPSA initiative.
The actual amount raised was guided by the pace of the project
disbursement needs.

In 2011, the Bank successfully executed two global benchmarks
in February and August, both with a 5-year maturity and for an
amount of USD 1 billion each. These transactions were in line with
the strategy of extending the Bank’s USD yield curve, and providing investors with at least one new liquid reference bond every
year. The ability to attract strong interest amid market volatility

 

Socially Responsible Uridashi Bonds

shows the depth of investors’ appetite for AfDB bonds, and also
reflects the extensive investor work conducted in recent years to
promote the AfDB name, its financial and operational strength and
its relevance for Africa. This helped consolidate relationships with
existing investors and broaden the Bank’s investor base. Building
on the strength of the global transactions, other issuances in key
markets as well as privately placed notes and Uridashis provided
unding at very competitive levels. The Bank indeed enjoys good
access to funding across all segments of the capital markets.
After a 5-year absence, it successfully returned to the Australian
market with an AUD 300 million 5-year issue. Euro-commercial
aper borrowings complete the range of markets utilized during
he year. The average cost of funds raised in 2011 remained below
he respective 6-month USD LIBOR, 6-month EURIBOR and
3-month JIBAR benchmarks.

 

The Bank also conducts regular buyback operations of its bonds
‘0 provide liquidity to investors. In 2011, the total amount of these
repurchases amounted to UA 75.50 million. As at December 31, 2011,
he Bank’s outstanding borrowing portfolio stood at UA 12.90 billion.

he borrowing program for 2012 was approved by the Board of
Directors for a maximum amount of UA 3.50 billion with up to UA
3.43 billion to be raised from the capital markets and an envelope
of UA 70 million under the EPSA facility.

 

 

1anly f O/€ C
Demand in the retail bond market in Japan has shifted dramatically away from socially responsible bond issuance, and the Bank
did not issue any of them in 2011.

The proceeds of previous socially responsible uridashi bonds were
included in the ordinary capital resources of the Bank. Under the
terms of these bond issues, the Bank is expected to and does use
its best efforts to direct an amount equal to the net proceeds to
lending to projects related to the relevant theme, subject to and
in accordance with the Bank’s lending standards and guidelines.

A snapshot of the Bank’s activity in these sectors is presented in

Annual Report 2011Investments

The Bank’s cash and treasury investments (net of repurchase
agreements) as of December 31, 2011 totaled UA 7.94 billion,
compared to UA 7.83 billion at the end of 2010. Investment
income for 2011 amounted to UA 168.85 million or a return of
2.14 percent on an average liquidity of UA 7.89 billion, compared
oan income of UA 219.22 million, or a return of 2.81 percent, on
an average liquidity of UA 7.78 billion, in 2010. The lower return
in 2011 is primarily due to the continuing low level of interest
rates as well as the volatile and stressed financial environment
eading to wider credit spreads during the year.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3 portfolios, namely
operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed
portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the cash
low and risk profile of its assets and funding sources. These
benchmarks are 1-month LIBID for the operational portfolio,
and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR, resetting on February
and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The operational and
prudential portfolios are held for trading. The equity-backed
portfolio is managed against a repricing profile benchmark with
O percent of the Bank’s net assets repricing uniformly over a
period of 10 years, and is held at amortized cost.

 

 

 

 

Loan Portfolio

The Bank makes loans to its regional member countries (RMCs)
and public sector enterprises guaranteed by the government.
Loans are also extended to private sector enterprises without a government guarantee. Cumulative loans signed, net of
cancelations, as at December 31, 2011 amounted to UA 28.39
illion. During 2011, new loans signed totaled UA 2.50 billion
compared with UA 334.12 million in 2010, an increase of UA
2.16 billion. Table 5.3 presents the evolution of loans approved,
signed, disbursed and undisbursed balances from 2007 to 2011.
Despite the significant reductions in the level of approvals from
he peak of UA 5.31 billion in 2009 at the height of the global
inancial crisis, loan approvals and disbursements remain consistently higher than pre-2009 levels with new approvals in 2011
amounting to UA 2.45 billion compared with UA 2.24 billion in
he previous year, representing an increase of UA 211 million.

F cial Products

he ADB offers an attractive and diversified menu of financial
roduct options that allows borrowers to tailor their financing requirements to their circumstances. The Bank’s financial
products comprise loans (including those denominated in local
currency, and syndicated loans), lines of credit (including for
rade finance), agency lines, guarantees, equity and quasi-equity,
and risk management products. In addition, the Bank provides
echnical assistance to its clients through grant funds. Each of
hese products is briefly discussed below:

Loans

he ADB provides loans to its clients on non-concessional terms.
he Bank’s standard loans are categorized either as Sovereign
Guaranteed Loans (SGLs) or Non-Sovereign Guaranteed Loans
(NSGLs). SGLs are loans made to RMCs or public sector enterprises
rom RMCs supported by the full faith and credit of the RMC in
whose territory the borrower is domiciled. Multinational instituions are eligible for SGLs if they are guaranteed by an RMC or by
RMCs in whose territory or territories the projects will be executed.

SGLs are loans made either to public sector enterprises, without the requirement of a sovereign guarantee or to private
sector enterprises.

e@ Bank’s standard loan product has evolved over time, with
erms that are increasingly more accommodating and responsive to client needs.

 

e standard loan product now offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients is the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan
(EVSL) which gives borrowers a high degree of flexibility to
manage their interest rate risks. For non-sovereign guaranteed
clients the loan product offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The interest rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base (6-month
LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for Euro and
3-month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is a function
of the Bank’s cost of funding relative to LIBOR, EURIBOR or
JIBAR computed every six months, and a contractual spread
that was set at 60 basis points with effect from January 1, 2011.
Al

tl

 

a borrower's request, the EVSL offers a free option to convert
e floating base rate into a fixed rate. The repayment period
for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans is up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

 

The interest rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for Euro
and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating until maturity date or a fixed base rate (amortizing swap rate set at borrower’s request for disbursed loan balances) plus a risk-based
credit spread. Non-sovereign loans have repayment periods
up to 15 years including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

Annual Report 2011Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel cofinancing, A/B loan syndications, and local currency loans. In
September 2011, the President approved the introduction of four
African currencies (Egyptian Pound, Kenyan Shilling, Nigerian
Naira, and Ugandan Shilling) to the existing selection of lending
currencies. Lending in these currencies is only offered if the Bank
is able to fund efficiently in the relevant local currency market.
These loans are offered under the FSL pricing framework with
a cost pass through principle for local currency loans to ensure
hat the overall cost of funds is fully covered.

Lines of Credit

The development of a dynamic small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) sector in the continent is an important objective
of the Bank as is the development of private financial instituions (PFls). To this end the Bank offers lines of credit for loans
‘Oo PFls for on-lending to SMEs. The terms of the lines of credit
specify the conditions under which Bank funds will be provided
o the PFI for on-lending. The credit risks of the sub-loans are
borne by the PFs.

rade finance lines of credit (TF LOC) are a variation of the Bank's
standard long-term lines of credit. The Bank developed the TF
LOC as a component of the Trade Finance Initiative which was
designed to quickly respond to the liquidity squeeze in Africa's
rade markets as a result of the global financial crisis. The TF LOC,
which has a maturity of up to 3.5 years, is available to African
inancial institutions (commercial banks and developmental
inancial institutions) that are engaged in trade finance operaions. Given the short-term nature of trade finance, the recipient
inancial institutions are permitted to “re-use” or “revolve” the
proceeds until the contractual repayment dates of the facility.

Agency Lines

he Bank makes ordinary capital resources available for SMEs
under agency arrangements with local financial intermediaries.
The selection of individual projects for Bank support is largely
delegated to the intermediaries, which draw on Bank resources to make loan or equity investments for the Bank’s account
in projects meeting pre-agreed criteria. As part of an agency
agreement, financial intermediaries are required to commit their
own funds in each investment in parallel with the Bank and to
supervise the investee companies. The financial intermediary
acts only in an agency capacity for the Bank when investing
the latter’s funds and assumes no risk in this regards. The credit
risk of the borrower is borne by the Bank.

 

Guarantees

Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to obtain
financing from third party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their
own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide such

Annual Report 2011

African Development Bank Chapter 5

financing directly from its own resources. The Bank’s guarantees
can generally be classified into two categories: Partial Credit
Guarantees (PCGs) and Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs). PCGs
cover a portion of scheduled repayments of private loans or
bonds against all risks. PRGs cover private lenders against the
risk of a government, or a government owned agency, failing
to perform its obligations vis-a-vis a private project.

Risk Management Products

The Bank offers Risk Management Products (RMPs) to its borrowers in respect of obligations outstanding to the Bank or new
Bank loans to enable them to hedge their exposure to market
risks including interest rate, currency exchange and commodity
price risks, thus allowing them to optimize their debt management strategies. RMPs offered by the Bank include interest rate
swaps, Currency swaps, commodity swaps and interest rate
caps and collars. These products are available to borrowers at
any time during the life of the loan.

 

Equity and Quasi-Equity Participations

The Bank’s ability to provide risk capital through equity and
quasi-equity investments is a key element of its resource mobilization role. The use by the Bank of equity and quasi-equity
participation as instruments of investment have the objectives of promoting the efficient use of resources, promoting
African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other
investors and lenders to financially viable projects as well as
promoting new activities and investment ideas. The Bank may
invest in equities either directly or indirectly, through appropriate funds and other investment vehicles. Additionally, it may
choose to invest via quasi-equity instruments through redeemable preference shares, preferred stock, subordinated loans or
convertible loans.

Other Financial Services

In addition to the products described above, the Bank may
offer technical assistance through grant funds to supplement
its financial products for both the public and private sector
windows. The Bank’s technical assistance is primarily focused
on raising the effectiveness of project preparation which is vital
in ensuring the best developmental and poverty-reducing outcomes for projects that receive Bank financing. In addition, the
technical assistance also aims to foster and sustain efforts in
creating enabling business environment in order to promote
private sector investment and growth.

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are not
essential to its core business of providing development finance
and related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank’s risk management policies, guidelines and practices are designed to reduce
exposure to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal

49Chapter 5 African Development Bank

and other operational risks, while maximizing the Bank's capacity to assume credit risks to public and private sector clients,
within approved risk limits.

The policies and practices employed by the Bank to manage
these risks are described in detail in Note D to the Financial
Statements.

Financial Reporting

The Bank’s corporate governance structure is supported by
appropriate financial and management reporting. The Executive
Board of Directors makes strategic decisions and monitors the
Bank’s progress toward achievement of set goals. While management manages the Bank’s day-to-day operations and activities,
the Board provides oversight, advice and counsel on issues as
wide-ranging as long-term strategy, budgets, human resources,
benefits management and new product development. Based
on the COSO internal control framework, senior management
has put in place a robust and functioning mechanism to be able
to certify the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal controls over
external financial reporting. This annual certification statement is
signed by the President and Vice President - Finance as well as
the Financial Controller. The External Auditors of the Bank also
provide annually an independent report regarding the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control over financial reporting. In
addition, the Bank has a comprehensive system of monitoring
and reporting to the Board of Directors and its committees. This
includes reporting by the Office of the Auditor General to the
Audit and Finance (AUFI) Committee of the Board of Directors.

External Auditors

The Bank’s external auditors are appointed by the Board of
Governors, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
for a five-year term. Under Bank rules, no firm of auditors
can serve for more than two consecutive five-year terms.
The external audit function is statutory and is regulated by
the International Standards on Auditing (ISA), issued by the
International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The
external auditors perform an annual audit to enable them to
express an opinion on whether the Financial Statements of the
Bank present fairly the financial position and the results of the
operations of the Bank. They also examine whether the statements have been presented in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as described above,
the external auditors also review the internal control system and
issue an attestation on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal
controls over financial reporting. This attestation, which is a
report separate from the audit opinion, is included in the annual
report. At the conclusion of their annual audit, the external
auditors prepare a management letter for Senior Management

50

and the Board of Directors, which is reviewed in detail and discussed with the AUFI Committee. The management letter sets
out the external auditors’ observations and recommendations
or improvement on internal controls and other matters, and it
includes management's responses and actions for implementaion of the auditors’ recommendations. The performance and
independence of the external auditors is subject to continuous
review by the AUFI Committee of the Board.

he external auditors of the Bank Group are recruited for a fiveyear term, renewable only once. In the event that the term of
an external audit firm is renewed for a second five-year term,
he audit firm is required to replace the Engagement Partner in
charge of the audit. The external auditors are prohibited from
providing non-audit related services, except in situations where
it is adjudged to be in the interest of the Bank and approved
by the AUFI Committee.

Performance Management and Monitoring

n managing its operations the Bank uses quantified performance measures and indicators that reflect the critical success
actors in its business. These are monitored on a continuous
basis and results achieved are used to assess progress attained
against stated objectives and to inform required action in order
‘o improve future performance. Management uses a wide array
of measures both at the corporate and business unit level to
monitor and manage performance. Some of the key measures
and indicators or Key Performance Indicators (KPI) used by
management are discussed in Table 5.5 (see page 52) together
with their relevance to the operations of the Bank.

 

Financial Results

The Board of Governors approved in 2011 distribution from
he 2010 income to various development initiatives in Africa
amounting to UA 113 million. The beneficiaries of these distributions are listed under Note N to the Financial Statements. In
accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies such distribuions are reported as expenses in the year they are approved
by the Board of Governors. As a result of the above accounting treatment of income distribution, the Bank’s income before
distributions approved by the Board of Governors reflects the
result of the ordinary operations of the Bank. Consequently,
he discussions and analyses below focus on “Income before
distributions approved by Board of Governors."

he highlights of the Bank’s financial performance in 2011 include
he following:

 

* Despite the continued volatile market conditions and the low
interest rates experienced during the year, the Bank in 2011
earned income before distributions approved by the Board of
Governors of UA 164.51 million compared to UA 213.66 million

Annual Report 2011in 2010. As shown in Figure 5.3, the decrease primarily derived
rom reduced investment income arising from continued low
interest rates that prevailed in the global financial markets
during the year. Income in 2011 included a net charge of UA
7.68 million for impairment on loan principal and charges
compared to a charge of UA 26.76 million in 2010. As a result
of the improvement in the quality of the portfolio, there was
a net reversal of UA 6.39 million impairment provisions on
reasury investments held at amortized cost compared to a
net reversal of UA 18.58 million in 2010.

+ Net interest income decreased from UA 373.25 million in 2010
0 UA 331.71 million, largely due to a combination of lower
levels of investment income in 2011 and increased interest
expense. The Bank also earned an income of UA 5.41 million
in 2011 on investments in debt instruments issued by entities
in regional member countries compared to UA 6.74 million
earned in 2010. Figure 5.4 below shows the evolution of interest income and investment income for the past five years.

 

 

* Despite the general increase in its operational activities, total
Bank Group administrative expenses in 2011 remained at
about the same level of UA 239.42 million reported in 2010.
Total manpower expenses increased marginally by less than
1 percent from UA 178.98 million in 2010 to UA 180.14 million in 2011 while other administrative expenses decreased
slightly by 2.34 percent from UA 60.45 million in 2010 to

UA 59.07 million in 2011. The Bank’s share of the total Bank
Group administrative expenses amounted to UA 79.50 million for 2011 compared to UA 75 million for 2010, an increase
of 6 percent. Bank Group administrative expenses are allocated between the Bank, the ADF and the NTF based ona
predetermined cost-sharing formula driven primarily by the
relative levels of certain operational volume indicators and
relative balance sheet size.

The Bank continues to earn levels of income sufficient to
sustain its strong financial position and also to make contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other development
initiatives for Africa. There was a slight decrease in the total
reserves plus accumulated loss provisions on outstanding
loan principal and charges to UA 2.84 billion at December 31,
2011, compared to UA 2.91 billion at the end of 2010. Reserves
plus loss provisions on loan principal at December 31, 2011
represented 28.32 percent of gross loans compared to 33.06
percent at December 31, 2010.

Administrative Expenses

The Bank has an ongoing responsibility and commitment to
ensure maximum efficiency in the management of administrative and capital expenditures, to help maximize the resources
available for development financing and technical assistance
activities in its member countries. Accordingly, in the management of its administrative and capital expenses, the Bank
continues to focus on stringent budgetary discipline, effective
cost controls and proactive cost-recovery program. For the year
ended December 31, 2011, the Bank Group’s general administrative expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, were
UA 239.21 million (2010: UA 239.42 million) against a budget of
UA 289.13 million representing a utilization rate of 82.73 percent.

For 2012, the Bank’s administrative expenditure is budgeted
at UA 292.55 million. Management will continue to explore
and implement effective cost management strategies with
enhanced transparency on cost control behaviors with a view
to ensuring that cost outcomes are effectively tracked against
its strategic objectives.

The Bank’s financial results are sensitive to changes in the economic environment within the continent and in the global financial markets. Such changes may affect the volume of lending,
timing of repayments on the Bank’s loans or the volatility of
interest rates on its treasury investments, thereby affecting the

Key Performance Indicators: Financial, 2010 and 2011

Definition Importance to the business and management

Bank’s income. It is anticipated that the financial markets will
continue to show significant volatility throughout 2012. This is
expected to cause variability in the Bank’s results of operations
and reserves as a result of movements in the fair value of the
Bank’s treasury portfolio.

The weakening economic environment and changing expectations
from borrowing member countries will continue to put pressure
on lending volumes and margins. However, the Bank is taking
proactive steps to further reduce costs and improve operational
efficiency. The recent additional IT investments made by the Bank
via upgrade of its ERP system is expected to provide a useful
tool for cost monitoring and reduction while delivering faster and
more efficient service both internally and to external customers.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011

NOTE A - OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic
and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire. However, since
February 2003, the Bank has managed its operations largely from its temporary relocation facilities in Tunis, Tunisia. The Bank
finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and preparation
of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank also promotes
investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and social progress
of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Develooment Fund (ADF or
the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing
to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to promote cooperation and increased international
trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and its operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any obligation to pay,
withhold or collect any tax or duty.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated
by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convenion except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
eld by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life
of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

Dividends are recognized in income statement when the Bank’s right to receive the dividends is established in accordance with
AS 18 - Revenue.

 

60 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of
all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the
Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit
adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31,
2011 and 2010 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation
differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at
the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements
as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount
at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other
currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever
withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that the members are independent African and non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is
to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and
jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2011, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member
country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member’s shares.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member,
hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against
the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations
and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date
are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently
taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the
amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the
repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date,
for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred
and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying
a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the
risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered
by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors.
In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each
member country.

Annual Report 2011 61Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit
payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that
an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method.

Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable
service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in
other comprehensive income in the year they occur. Past service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are
already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the
Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to
eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to
the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age and
the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to
the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the
Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both
the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year
they occur. The medical plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents
the present value of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual
rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

Following the adoption of phase 1 of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011, the Bank revised the classification of its financial assets into the
following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and financial
assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). These classifications are determined based on the Bank’s
business model. In accordance with the Bank’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income
through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its
financial assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized cost
A financial asset is classified as at amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Bank's business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in debt investment are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at ‘fair value through profit or loss’.

62 Annual Report 2011ii)

African Development Bank Chapter 5

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain debt investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued income
and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial
assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Bank provides
money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried
at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However, incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred; as such amounts are considered insignificant.
The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

In addition, debt instruments that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A debt instrument
may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses
on them on different bases.

iii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)

On initial recognition, the Bank can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments not held for trading as financial assets measured at FVTOCI.

Equity investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value
with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative gains or
losses are not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments.

The Bank has designated all investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading as assets measured at FVTOCI
on initial application of IFRS 9.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the
Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets
not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are
derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has transferred
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates.
The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors their fair value and if necessary may require additional collateral.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to
maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Annual Report 2011 63Chapter 5 African Development Bank

D)

ii)

Prior to January 1, 2011, the Bank classified its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through
profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determined the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition on the following basis:

Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss

All trading assets were carried at fair value through the income statement and gains and losses were reported in the income
statement in the period in which they arose. Investments in the trading portfolio were acquired principally for the purpose
of selling in the short term. Derivatives were also categorized as held-for-trading.

Loans and Receivables

The Bank classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were
not quoted in an active market. They arose when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no
intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables were carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees were deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However, incremental direct costs associated with originating loans were expensed as incurred, as such amounts were considered insignificant. The amortization of loan origination fee was included in income from loans.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments

The Bank classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments were nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management had the
intent and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments were carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

iv) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets

2)

a

64

The Bank classified equity investments over which it did not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments were those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets were recognized directly in other
comprehensive income, until the financial asset was derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income was recognized in profit or loss.

Financial Liabilities

Borrowings

In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed
or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash
flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and
providing cost-effective funding.

In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at
amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in
profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate and currency risks.

Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D to these financial statements. Certain of the Bank’s borrowings obtained
prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free loans. In accordance with the
provisions of the amendments resulting from the improvements to IFRS issued in May 2008 relating to the revised IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such borrowings are carried at the amounts
at which they are repayable on their due dates.

ii) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the
borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise
would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried
on the balance sheet at fair value.

In accordance with IFRS 9, fair value changes for financial liabilities that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss,
that is attributable to changes in the Bank’s “own credit” risk is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair
value attributable to the Bank’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss. Previously, under IAS 39, the
entire amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss (including changes in fair value attributable to the Bank’s “own credit” risk) was recognized in profit or loss.

 

iii) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost.
The amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are
used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established
on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

The Bank classifies all derivatives at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in fair value
recognized in the income statement. Prior to January 1, 2011, the Bank elected not to apply hedge accounting on any qualifying
hedging relationship.

Following the adoption of IFRS 9 and beginning January 1, 2011, the Bank assesses its hybrid financial assets (i.e. the combined
financial asset host and embedded derivative) in its entirety to determine their classification. A hybrid financial asset is measured
at amortized cost if the combined cash flows represent solely principal and interest on the outstanding principal; otherwise it is
measured at fair value. The Bank did not hold any hybrid financial assets as at December 31, 2011.

Prior to January 1, 2011, derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts were treated
as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics were not closely related to those of the host contract and the host
contract was not carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives were stripped
from the host contract and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Annual Report 2011 65Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Hedge Accounting

On January 1, 2011 the Bank elected to apply fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge the interest rate risk exposure associated with its fixed rate loans. Under fair value hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the
hedging instrument and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the
income statement.

At inception of the hedge, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along
with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the
hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Bank documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Bank revokes the
hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for
hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged
risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.

Impairment of Financial Assets

1) Assets Carried at Amortized Cost
The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of
financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed
for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of
impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there
is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a
‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of
financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

\f the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments carried
at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment
representing present value losses arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereignguaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the non-collectability, in whole or in part, of amounts
due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in
the income statement. If a loan or investment carried at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on
all loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the decrease
in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

2) Available-for-Sale Assets

Prior to January 1, 2011, the Bank had assets classified as Available for Sale. For such assets, the Bank assessed at each balance
sheet date whether there was objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets was impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its
cost was considered in determining whether the assets were impaired. If any such evidence existed for available-for-sale equity
instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which was measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and
the fair value at the balance sheet date, net of any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, was reclassified from
equity to the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments
carried at fair value were reversed through equity.

66 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

If there was objective evidence that an impairment loss had been incurred on an available-for-sale equity instrument that was
carried at cost because its fair value could not be reliably measured, the amount of impairment loss was measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the impaired equity instrument and the present value of the estimated future cash flows
discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar equity instrument. Once recognized, impairment losses on these
equity instruments carried at cost were not reversed.

Following adoption of phase 1 of IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2011, the Bank no longer classifies its assets as available-for-sale.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure
n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuaion process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

 

The fair values of quoted assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current
asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.

These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuatio!
techniques commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily availab!
have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. According
the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actual
exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable;
however, the values actually realizable in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

Seas

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs
are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Annual Report 2011 67Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread.
Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank’s
new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to
value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves,
exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are made to the relevant
observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best estimate of the price at which the Bank could have bought back the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

For borrowings on which the Bank has elected fair value option, fair value changes were reported in income statement. However,
with effect from January 1, 2011, the portion of fair value changes on the valuation of borrowings, relating to the credit risk of the
Bank is reported in Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IFRS 9.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments are periodically fair valued both
by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises
is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate
methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated as the Bank’s percentage ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools
based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use
market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for
valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows
of these loans. For multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow
model based on the year end variable lending rate in that currency. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note |.

Day One Profit and Loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the
consideration given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair
value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument
(i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable
markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate
data solely from observable markets. The Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they
arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would consider in setting a price.

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is determined based on valuation models that use inputs that may not be market-observable as of the calculation date. Such financial instruments are initially
recognized at the transaction price, although the value obtained from the relevant valuation model may differ. The difference
between the transaction price and the model value, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized
over the life of the transaction; or (b) deferred until the instrument's fair value can be determined using market observable inputs
or is realized through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day
one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate
reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

68 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not controls, over the
entity’s financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is described in more detail in
Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates. Under the equity method, an
investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the
investor’s share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor’s share of the profit or loss of the
investee is recognized in the investor’s income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred
between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2011, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1 percent of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF.

Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972, the
revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in
accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the
equity method are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset,
as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost
of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

* Buildings: 15-20 years

* Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

* Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
+ Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between
proceeds and the asset’s carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

 

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other
regional member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to
the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Annual Report 2011 69Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Allocations and Distributions Approved by the Board of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations
from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from
prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of distribution
for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income
Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously
transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts allocated to
surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income, and expenses
recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical

experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories.
Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Fair Value through Profit and Loss - In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has
determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Amortized Cost for Embedded Derivatives - The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 9 on classifying financial assets with embedded derivatives in their entirety as at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss. In making this judgment, the Bank considers whether the cash flows of the financial asset are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and
classifies the qualifying asset accordingly without separating the derivative.

Prior to January 1, 2011, the Bank exercised judgment in classifying assets as Held for Trading, or Held to Maturity, in accordance
with the guidance provided under IAS 39.

2) Significant Estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Loans and Advances - At each financial statements reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios
for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective
evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the loan’s net carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows
on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an
individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a group of loans with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed
for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of loans may include observable data indicating that there has
been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate
with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk
characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to
reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

70 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are
calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use
only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments..

Retirement Benefits - The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial assumptions
used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate to be used to
determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations, based on interest rates of suitably long-term high-quality
corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the Bank’s UA.

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Equity Investments - Prior to the adoption of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011 the Bank determined that
available-for-sale equity investments were impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below
the carrying amount. The determination of what is significant or prolonged required judgment. In making this judgment, the
Bank evaluated any evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes
in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.

 

Events after the Balance Sheet date
The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date are disclosed, but do not result in an adjustment
of the financial statements themselves.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result. However, in accordance with its transitional provisions, entities adopting IFRS 9

before January 1, 2012 are not required to restate prior periods’ comparatives on their financial statements. Accordingly, the Bank
has not restated prior year’s comparative information in connection with the application of IFRS 9 in these financial statements.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

1) Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective after January 1, 2011 but early adopted by the Bank

IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 “financial instruments” was issued in November 2009 as part of the IASB comprehensive project to replace IAS 39. The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 replaces those parts of IAS 39 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the entity’s business model for managing its
financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument, into two measurement categories: those
to be measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized cost only if it
is a debt instrument and the objective of the entity’s business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows and the
asset’s contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be measured at fair
value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are
held for trading will be measured at fair value through profit or loss while for all other equity instruments an irrevocable election
can be made at initial recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

Annual Report 2011 71Chapter 5 African Development Bank

The second part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 which deals with classification and measurement of financial liabilities was issued on
October 28, 2010. The new requirements address the problem of volatility in profit or loss arising from the “own credit” of an
issuer choosing to measure its own debt at fair value. With the new requirements, gains and losses resulting from changes in
“own credit risk” for liabilities measured at fair value are reported in “other comprehensive income” and therefore do not affect
reported profit or loss.

As at December 31, 2011, the two other phases of IFRS 9 dealing with impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting had
not been completed by IASB.

Although IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in accordance with the option provided in
the standard, the Bank early adopted phase 1 of this standard with effect from January 1, 2011 (“the date of initial application’).

In accordance with the provisions of the new standard, certain adjustments required on application of the standard have been
made which had an effect on the opening balance of retained earnings. The following adjustments which resulted from the
change in the classification of the Bank’s financial assets were reported in the opening balance of retained earnings of the Bank
on January 1, 2011:

* Investments in debt securities previously classified as available-for-sale are now classified as financial assets at amortized cost.
In accordance with IFRS 9, the amortized cost of these investments on the transition date should be the original cost at the
time the investments were acquired which was UA 97.89 million. The difference of UA 18.14 million between the cost and the
carrying amount of UA 79.75 million at the date of transition (January 1, 2011) represents the cumulative mark-to-market loss
previously recognized on this investment over the years. This amount was written back into retained earnings;

Investments in debt securities previously classified as held-to-maturity that do not meet the business model and cash flow
criteria of financial assets at amortized cost were reclassified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.
As a result, held-to-maturity investments with carrying value of UA 32.26 million were fair valued at UA 31.36 million and the
related fair value losses amounting to UA 0.90 million were included in retained earnings as at January 1, 2011;

 

 

Equity investments not held for trading that were previously measured at fair value and classified as available-for-sale were designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income. Some of these investments that are not quoted were previously
carried at cost in accordance with IAS 39. Under IFRS 9, all equity investments are mandatorily to be fair valued. Accordingly,
the fair value gain of UA 30.79 million representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of these
investments on January 1, 2011 was recognized in retained earnings;

The net cumulative fair value gains on available-for-sale investments of UA 4.17 million held within equity as at January 1, 2011
were reclassified into retained earnings on that date.

The following table summarizes the transitional classification and measurement adjustments to the Bank’s financial assets on
the date of initial application:

The impact of the above transitional classification and measurement adjustments on retained earnings on January 1, 2011 is summarized as follows:

(UA millions)

Reversal of accumulated MTM effect on investments previously held as AFS 18.14
Fair value losses on reclassification of investments previously held as HTM (0.90)
Unrealized gains on unquoted equity investments now classified at fair value 30.79
48.03

Further, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, fair value changes during 2011 on borrowings designated at fair value through
profit or loss arising from the effect of the Bank’s “own credit” amounting to UA 63.51 million were reported directly in other
comprehensive income. Under IAS 39 and prior to January 1, 2011, the entire fair value gains/losses on these borrowings were
recognized in profit or loss.

At the date of issue of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for application, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The following new standards and amendments are expected to be relevant to the Bank:

IFRS 12 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 12 requires an entity to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and
risks associated with, its interests in other entities; and the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance
and cash flows. IFRS 12 is required to be applied by an entity that has an interest in any of the following entities: subsidiaries; joint
arrangements; associates; and unconsolidated structured entities. This standard requires disclosures of interests in subsidiaries
and associates and also expands the disclosure requirements for unconsolidated structured entities.

The adoption of IFRS 12 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance as it only
relates to disclosures.

Annual Report 2011 73Chapter 5 African Development Bank

¢ IFRS 13: “Fair Value”

IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements.

IFRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards
and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However, this standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value are required
under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair valuation hierarchy.

he adoption of IFRS 13 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Bank’s financial position or performance.

¢ AS 19 Revised: “Employee Benefits”

he amendment to IAS 19 was issued in June 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with
early adoption permitted. The key changes in the amended standard correspond to the elimination of the option to defer the
recognition of actuarial gains and losses, known as the ‘corridor method’. Accordingly, under the amended standard, all actuarial gains and losses have to be recognized immediately in OCI. In addition, an entity is no longer able to recognize in profit or
loss the long-term expected return on assets held. Finally, the amended standard requires enhanced disclosures about defined
benefit plans.

he adoption of the amended IAS 19 is not expected to have any significant effect on the net income of the Bank because the
Bank already recognizes all actuarial gains and losses in OCI under the option provided in the current version of IAS 19.

¢ IFRS 7: “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and IAS 32: “Financial Instruments: Presentation”

n December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entity's
inancial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new requirements are set out in “Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IFRS 7), and are related to
inancial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the IASB also published “Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities” (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

he amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after
january 1, 2013 and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, respectively.

 

he Bank is still evaluating the full impact of these amendments on its financial statements.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk,
and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its develooment mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This
institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank's capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk profile consistent with the highest credit rating. During 2011, the Bank through a comprehensive exercise, re-defined its risk appetite
and revised the capital adequacy policy. As part of this revision, the Bank’s rating scale was revised as explained under systematic credit risk assessment below.

74 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit,
product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Bank’s risk
profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on the
Bank’s Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority), the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM
Authority) and the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for
its borrowers and separate guidelines prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for the Bank’s
sovereign and non-sovereign loan, guarantee and equity investment portfolios.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the
Bank’s financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank’s interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM
Authority covers the Bank's entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources,
including the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed
operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) and
the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control organ of the Bank’s finance and risk management
activities. It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice
President for Finance. OPSCOM reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc
finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms country
and project credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk,
financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day
compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.
Credit Risk
Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential

financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

Annual Report 2011 75Chapter 5 African Development Bank

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign
credit risk on its portfolio of private sector, non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio
of treasury investments and derivative transactions. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies,
guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the following sections.

The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk before collateral held or other credit enhancements is as follows:

1) Sovereign Credit R
When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising
from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through
its policies related to sustainable lending strategies, including individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the
concerned country. These include the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects.

(L)_ The outcome of the referendum conducted in South Sudan in January 2011 supported the creation of an independent state of South Sudan. After the split of the current state of Sudan into two separate nations
became effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a basis agreed upon following the ongoing negotiations
between representatives of the North and South Sudan. At the end of December 2011, no decision has been taken by the states of North and South Sudan regarding the terms and conditions of such exchange.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Annual Report 2011

77Chapter 5 African Development Bank

The foundation of the Bank's credit risk management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment framework, through underlying models and their associated risk factors that have been optimized to ensure more predictive power of the rating parameters
and to better align with international rating scales and ensure consistency with best practices. The credit risk assessment result
is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade Master Scale. The Master Scale was revised in 2011 from a 10-grade to a 22-grade
rating scale, optimized to provide: (i) increased granularity; (ii) better differentiation between obligors; (iii) smoother grade distribution to alleviate the current grade concentration; and finally (iv) to create a common framework when communicating credit
risks to risks takers. The increased level of granularity helps in measuring probabilities of default for internal grades in order to
better differentiate between obligors.

The sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance,
debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and Bank’s portfolio performance. These five risk indices are
combined to derive a composite country risk index for both sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. These country risk ratings
are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and other specialized international organizations. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they reflect the expected risk
profiles of the countries. The ALCO also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their country exposure limits and
approves changes in loss provisioning, if required

78 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

The weighted average risk rating of the Bank’s sovereign and sovereign guaranteed portfolio reached 2.52 at the end of December
2011 in the revised 22-grade master scale. As of December 31, 2010, weighted average-risk rating reached 2.01 under the Bank’s
10-grade master scale. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

It is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
30 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to
the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for
such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts
have been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.50 percent on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on nonperforming sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their debts to the Bank on a timely
basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with
the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential Expected Losses (EL) and Unexpected Losses (UL) related to credit, the Bank maintains a prudent risk capital
cushion for credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for public sector
and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities (guarantees and
client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private sector operations
which have a higher probability of default and loss-given default than public sector operations. At the end of December 2011,
the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio had used up to 26.5 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital based on the Bank’s revised
capital adequacy framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of translation adjustments. Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

 

 

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers and to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees. The
Bank may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign
guarantee.

 

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses several models to assess the risk of every project
at entry. The models used are tailored to the specific characteristics and nature of the transactions. The result of the credit risk
assessment is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale as described above.

Non-sovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) project finance; b) financial institutions; and
c) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of some pre-determined critical factors.

Annual Report 2011 79Chapter 5 African Development Bank

a) Project Finance
The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower’s financial strength. This assessment looks at:

Primarily, i) the capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating performance and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project company’s
management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the information on
which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

    

b) I
The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model:

i) Capital adequacy- analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution’s capital; ii) Asset quality, operating
policies and procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision making framework; iv) Earnings
and market position - an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy - an assessment
focusing on the entity's ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk - an assessment of the impact of interest
rate changes & exchange rate fluctuations.

c) Private Equity Funds
The assessment of Private Equity Funds takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

* Financial strength and historic fund performance;
* Investment strategy and risk management;

* Industry structure;

* Management and corporate governance; and

* Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require an initial credit rating and undergo a rigorous project approval process. The Non-Sovereign
Working Group of the ALCO reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend
changes for approval by ALCO if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its exposure to the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios. The weighted-average
risk rating was 3.44 at the end of 2011 compared to 3.12 at the end of 2010. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across

the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

80 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

n compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign
portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment,
or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2011, the cumulative impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired
oan principal in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 23.73 million compared to UA 12.04 million in 2010.

n addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk capial cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel Il Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At the end of
December 2011, the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 27.2 percent of the Bank’s total onbalance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 45 percent determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign
operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, Equity participations required as risk capital approximately 10.1 percent of
he Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the statutory limit of 15 percent established by the
Board of Governors for equity participations.

Credit Exposure Limits

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given point
in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign guaranteed and non-sovereign
portfolios) by ensuring that in the aggregate, the total country exposure limit to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the
Bank’s total risk capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s capi‘al adequacy framework. In the revised capital adequacy and exposure management approved by the Board in May 2011, the
5 percent (of the Bank’s total risk capital) global country concentration limit is meant to allow for adequate portfolio diversification. However, in order to ensure that: (i) the allocation in aggregate does not exceed 100 percent of risk capital available for
core lending activities, and (ii) there is fairness of allocation among RMCs, a Performance Based Adjusted Country Limits formula (PACL) is used.

 

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further controlled and managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit
with regard to the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range
of collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its
exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement.
All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to
meet its obligation to the Bank. Given the nature of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty
credit risk, however, the Bank minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for
Finance. For local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate
availability of investment opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies.
The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored.

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non DVP based transactions.

Annual Report 2011 81Chapter 5 African Development Bank

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in the UK and

40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life
for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Bank also invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized securities
repurchase agreements.

The Bank uses derivatives in the management of its funding portfolio and in asset and liability management transactions. As a
rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/
A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Lower rated counterparties may
be used exceptionally for local currency transactions. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO. Approved transactions
with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

The financial and economic crisis has resulted in the downgrading of banks worldwide. The Bank’s derivatives’ exposures and

their credit rating profile are shown in the tables below. Daily collateral exchanges enable the Bank to maintain net exposures
to acceptable levels.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of the Bank's total risk capital (equity and reserves)
for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank’s credit limits
after considering the benefits of any collateral.

82 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

The counterparty credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be predominantly AA or higher
rated as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA-rated entities declined from the previous year due to the
downgrade of the United States and its agencies. The downgrade of some European sovereigns by Standard & Poor’s in early
January 2012 would reduce the AAA proportion to 50 percent.

The Bank's exposure to the stressed Eurozone economies is as follows: no exposure to Greece and Portugal; less than UA 0.25
million exposure to an ABS security registered in Ireland; and UA 312 million or less than 4 percent of the portfolio to Spain and
Italy, with 73 percent of the Spain and Italy exposure maturing within six months from December 31, 2011.

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk
capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2011, the Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 2.5 percent of the Bank’s
total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

 

 

  

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity risk
arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon withou
additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains a pru
dential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The PML is
updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net loan
disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; ani
4) undisbursed equity investments.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash i
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to mee’
the Bank’s short term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are included in
the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the Bank maintains
a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to cover its expecter
medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity resources, is hel
in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective of stabilizing the bank’s ne
income. In determining its level of liquidity for compliance with the PML, the Bank includes cash, deposits and securities in al
the treasury investments, with appropriate hair-cuts based on asset class and credit rating.

he potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its

risk bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation risk

due to fluctuatio!

ns in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the currency

composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange
exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily

by holding or len
(after swap activ!

ing the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which they were borrowed
ities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to service their loans in the

currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to
the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates fluctuate.

The Bank’s policy

is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by matching,

to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the Unit of Account). In

line with this poli

cy, during the year ended December 31, 2011, the Bank’s currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band

of the risk-neutral position in each of the currencies making up the SDR composition. In keeping with the Bank’s currency risk
management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a
revision to the SDR currency composition.

In accordance with the IMF procedures, the composition of the SDR currencies within the basket has changed with effect from

Annual Report 2011 87Chapter 5 African Development Bank

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies,
namely the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the
International Monetary Fund every five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2011. The SDR rate represents
the sum of the interest rate of each currency that is determined based on the weight and the representative exchange rate and
interest rate of each currency.

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange
rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes
a separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change
in the African currency holdings the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/depreciation of each African
currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal
change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding

such assets;

2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not overly
sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends

Annual Report 2011 91Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt

Over half of the Bank’s interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin
on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding
liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost
of funds pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s pool-based loans has traditionally
helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining
demand for this product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (marketbased loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank
may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of
its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market
risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche.
The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity policy and
uses a six-month Libor floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational
cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor floating rate benchmark.

 

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all
new borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where the
Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired
six-month Libor-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative
to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of debt
that will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity
The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of the Bank’s assets with equity resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank’s equity resources
(the SDR) affect the net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result
in lower lending and investment rates, which in the long-term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

 

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity
of the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile
of the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark.
The Bank's repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s assets funded by equity
reprice in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a ten-year
moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

 

 

At the end of 2010 and 2011, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual buckets.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity
A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain in income statement of UA 5.55 million and UA 8.17 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Fair Value Se 1
Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements
at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of
the currencies in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2011 for
assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps (2010: +/- 10 bps).

Held-for-trading investments (12,946) (10,943) 14,279 12,099
Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios 114,578 160,758 (126,498) (175,841)

payment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans
committed before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level
of prepayments has generally been within acceptable levels. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70
million compared to the amounts in prior years, due in large part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans
issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying
the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298 million included an amount of UA 192 million in respect
of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007, total prepayment amounted to UA 199 million, of which 98 percent related to
market-based loans. Prepayment in 2008 amounted to UA 17 million while prepayments in 2009 and 2010 were UA 20 million
and UA 67 million, respectively. No prepayments have been received in the year ended December 31, 2011.

 

 

Operational Risk
Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes.

Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems, and
from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse reputational impact. Operational risk is present in virtually all the Bank’s transactions and includes losses attributable to failures of internal processes in credit and market operations.

The Internal Control Unit (ICU) of the Bank is responsible for implementing the Integrated Internal Control Framework (IICF) which
consists of two phases. Phase one relates to the implementation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) based on the
COSO Framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bank’s internal controls in all significant business processes with financial statement impact. As part of this process, Management's attestation on the adequacy of
internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s annual report.

Phase two of the IICF will entail the implementation of Operational Risk Management Framework which will address risks inherent

in other business processes not covered by ICFR. The Operational Risk Management Framework is currently being considered
by the Board of Directors as the first step in the implementation process.

Annual Report 2011 93Chapter 5 African Development Bank

It is the primary responsibility of the management of each business area to implement adequate controls on their relevant activities. This responsibility is supported by institutional standards in the following areas:

* Requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorization of transactions
* Requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions

* Documentation of controls and procedures

* Training and professional development

¢ Risk mitigation including insurance where this is effective

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General of
the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and non-borrowing),
bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in its office locations.
Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive Crisis Committee, chaired
by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from the Operations Crisis Committee
(OCC); (ii) the OCC that closely monitors all developments affecting the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate
the relevant risks and (iii) the business continuity Unit (BCPU) that follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is
also responsible for periodic tests of the overall business continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

The Bank's Capital Adequacy and Exposure Management Framework currently provides for a risk capital charge of 15 percent of
the average operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basel Il recommendations for operational risk.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management include compliance with the Code of conduct and staff rules, the
work of the Fraud and Investigations Department and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government, agency, supranational, bank and corporate
obligations, time deposits, mortgage and asset-backed securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related
derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government, agency and supranational obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank may
only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with the same rating criteria. For maturities beyond 15 years and up to 30
years, a AAA rating is required. For mortgage and asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA
credit rating. For bank and corporate obligations with final maturity longer than 6 months and less than 5 years, the Bank may
only invest with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA-. AAA rating is required for obligations beyond 5 years
and up to 10 years. The purchases of currency or interest rate options are permitted only if the life of the option contract does
not exceed 1 year. Such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. All derivative
transactions, including options, cross-currency and interest rate swaps including asset swap transactions, are only permitted with
approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with which the Bank has entered into Master Derivative Agreements and a
Collateral Support Agreement with minimum credit ratings of A-/A3 at the time of the transaction.

As at December 31, 2011, the Bank had received collateral with fair value of UA 967 million in connection with swap agreements.
Of this amount, a total UA 870 million was in the form of cash and has been recorded on the balance sheet with a corresponding
liability included in “Other accounts payable”. The balance of UA 97 million was in the form of liquid financial assets.

 

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Bank had no securities sold under repurchase agreements (repos).

Loan Swaps
The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable
rate income.

  

The Bank has entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December 31,
2011, the Bank had 4,983 contracts in Euro and 4,567 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million
of each currency unit, except for 165 Euro contracts with a nominal value of Euro 100,000 for each contract.

 

ninistrative Expens 1 e
To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the
principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange
transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2011 and 2010, there were no open positions
with respect to the forward exchange transactions.

    

On January 1, 2011 the Bank elected to apply fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge its interest
rate risk exposure associated to fixed rate loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments are recognized
in profit or loss. The hedged item is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with the gain

or loss attributable to the hedged risk being recognized in profit or loss.

The fair value of the loan swaps designated and effective as hedging instruments as at December 31, 2011 was UA 98 million. The
fair value loss on these loan swaps for the year ended December 31, 2011 was UA 42.53 million. The fair value gain on the hedged
loans attributable to the hedged risk was UA 45.20 million. Therefore, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss was
a gain of UA 2.67 million.

It should be noted that the hedge accounting treatment for swaps at the designation date requires the amortization of the difference between the net carrying amount of loans and their fair value as at January 1, 2011. For 2011, the amortization of fair value
adjustment on the hedged risk amounted to UA 4.67 million.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital
increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options
for making their payments:

1. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local
currency; or

2. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/1l relating to the
Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV) is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members - 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes
of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five
(5) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely
convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and
consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to
the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors Resolution B/BG/2010/08
of May 27, 2010 each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund only shall pay for the
paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while Middle Income Countries,
Blend countries and Non-Regional member countries shall pay for the paid-up portion of their respective subscribed shares in
eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments.

Payments for shares under GCI-VI are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes encashable on or
before the due date for payment.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

NOTE I - LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other nonsovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or
in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall
be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a
grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary
market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered multi-currency variable
rate loans to its borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank’s own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans to single currency variable terms or retain the
terms of their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1,
1998. The other terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October
1, 1997, the Bank has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the
sum of two components, namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

 

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually
on January, 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank’s selected reference
interest rate in each market. The Bank’s standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR,
EURIBOR and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single
currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule of the loan. The funding spread comprises a funding cost margin and a market risk premium as determined
by the Bank. As part of the fixed lending rate, the funding spread remains fixed for the maturity of the loan for which the lending rate has been fixed. Prior to fixing the lending rate, the single currency fixed rate loan is essentially a variable spread loan.

Fixed Spread Loans: In January 2005, the Bank reviewed the entire set of products and lending processes and adjusted the
pricing of its market-based loan products for the first time since their introduction in October 1997. To this effect, the Bank
simplified the pricing for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers and suspended variable spread loans by eliminating
the funding cost margin and market risk premium. The simplification resulted in a single lending product known as the fixed
spread loan with a simple pricing based on a fixed spread over Libor and no other charges.

Enhanced Variable Spread Loans: In January 2009, in response to the impact of the global financial crisis and the ensuing
increase in funding costs for all categories of issuers, the Bank revised the financial terms and conditions offered to its sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients to ensure a full cost pass through of its borrowing costs to its clients, thereby safeguarding its financial integrity and its ability to remain a stable source of long-term funding. As a result, the Bank temporarily
suspended the fixed spread loan product for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers, and reintroduced the variable
spread loan. For non-sovereign guaranteed borrowers the fixed spread loan product is still applicable.

Annual Report 2011 103Chapter 5 African Development Bank

In December 2009, the Bank introduced the enhanced variable spread loan product, which offers to variable spread loan borrowers a free option to fix the floating base rate. Currently, the Bank’s only standard loan product for sovereign and sovereignguaranteed borrowers is the Enhanced Variable Spread Loan.

In May 2010, the lending margin of the enhanced variable spread loan was increased to 60 basis points (from 40 basis points)
for every loan approved after January 1, 2011. For non-sovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank’s
assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

Others: Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel co-financing, A/B syndications and local currency loans if the
Bank is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The local currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loan pric
ing framework with a cost pass through principle for local currency loans to ensure that the overall cost of funds is compensated.

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. No irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks
on undisbursed loans were outstanding at December 31, 2011 and 2010.

Also, the Bank may provide repayment guarantees to entities within its regional member countries for development loans granted to such entities by third parties. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity
are not made. At December 31, 2011, guarantees provided by the Bank to some of its borrowers amounted to UA 10.43 million
(2010: UA 2.31 million).

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social
development of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African
countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund’s original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement
since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General
Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and 7 members
selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of
the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a
share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually
on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred
by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2011 amounted to UA 159.33 million (2010: UA 163.96 million), representing 68.76 percent

Annual Report 2011 107Chapter 5 African Development Bank

(2010: 70.83 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate
and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its
participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2011, the Bank’s pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.63 percent (2010:
0.67 percent).

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note V-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Bank’s investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss on
the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations
plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points
and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations
The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in such equity
investments is to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of
their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African
participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external
resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank currently holds less than 20 percent of the total equity capital of most of the
institutions in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests,
but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2009/10 of May 13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate
amount of the Bank’s paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

Under IFRS 9 equity investments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, where the equity investment is
not held for trading, an entity has the option to take fair value changes into other comprehensive income (OCI), with no recycling
of the change in fair value to profit or loss if the investment is subsequently derecognized. As the Bank’s equity investments are
currently held for strategic purposes rather than for trading, the Bank has opted to designate all its equity investments as at fair
value through other comprehensive income.

 

Prior to the adoption of IFRS 9 by the Bank on January 1, 2011, equity investments for which fair value could not be reliably measured were reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent and lasting decline in value. The investments for
which fair value could not be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national development institutions. Investments
in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building. The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions owned by member
states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions.

The Bank may invest in certain debt instruments issued by entities in its Regional Member Countries (RMC) for the purpose of
financing development projects and programs. With the adoption of IFRS 9 from January 1, 2011, these investments are classified
as financial assets at amortized cost. Prior to the Bank’s adoption of IFRS 9 such investments were classified as available-for-sale
with fair value differences reported in OCI.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank’s owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used
for the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The land on which the buildings stand are owned by the Government
who granted unlimited right of occupancy to the Bank. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred
to a third party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered
to the host country. The Government would pay the Bank the value of the building as assessed at the time of the surrender. At

Annual Report 2011 mChapter 5 African Development Bank

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

The capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors adopted the use of a single debt to usable capital ratio to
monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank’s total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable capital. Usable capital

comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s usable
capital at December 31, 2011 was UA 23,513 million.

As at December 31, 2011 and 2010, senior and subordinated borrowings were as follows:

 

(UA millions)

2011 2010
Senior borrowings 11,756.42 11,203.69
Subordinated borrowings 1146.54 776.88
Total 12,902.96 11,980.57

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities
and to lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified dates
prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put dates, rather

than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain outstanding
beyond their earliest redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the
two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform
a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2011 was UA 11,756.42 million (2010: UA
10,877.11 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31,
2011 was UA 10,943.87 million (2010: UA 11,119.82 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional
amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net loss of UA 13 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December
31, 2011 (2010: net loss of UA 27.61 million). The fair value loss attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk included in the other
comprehensive income (which otherwise would have been included in profit or loss under IAS 39) for the year ended December
31, 2011 was UA 63.51 million. The net loss recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010 included a loss of UA 38.78 million which
was attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk. Under IAS 39, this amount was included in profit or loss.

Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for
the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid markets for
ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread was not applied
for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

 

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2011, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses
to date were UA 812.55 million (2010: losses of UA 542.80 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY

Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

 

Capital includes subscriptions paid in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The
Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

St i ins P. in

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase
and six General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the
Bank on May 29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of
the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35
percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000
shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional
members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

 

16 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Prior to the sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of
Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120
million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. The membership
of these two countries shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the
Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank. As at December 31,
2011, such formalities had not been completed by either country.

n 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea offering to subscribe, temporarily, to
additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and UA 0.19 billion, respectively. This proposal
was adopted by the Board of Governors on February 22, 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of the Bank increased
rom UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710 non-voting shares. These non-voting callable
shares were to be absorbed by the subscriptions of Canada and the Republic of Korea to GCI-VI when they become effective.

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 27, 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital stock of
he Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares created are to be
allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the regional group shall hold
60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The new shares and the previous ones described
above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of 6 percent paid-up shares and 94 percent callable shares.

 

Following the Board of Governors’ resolution, the temporary non-voting callable shares of Canada described above have been
effectively retired, while the processes for the retirement of those for the Republic of Korea were at an advanced stage as at
December 31, 2011. Consequently, the authorized capital of the Bank reduced by 163,296 shares representing the retired nonvoting callable shares for Canada.

The Bank’s capital as at December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows:

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 28,732.50 million at December 31, 2011, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia
to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the
event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares

Annual Report 2011 117Chapter 5 African Development Bank

of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested nonregional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will
however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may,
under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested non-regional member states and credit
the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for
membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s Official Develooment Assistance its pro-rata interest in the
proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

period for GCI-VI. After the shares have been fully subscribed, the regional and non-regional groups are expected to hold 60% and 40% voting rights, respectively.

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member
countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US
dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represented the value of the US Dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on July 1, 1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices,
losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in
the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

sale was made due to a severe deterioration in credit risk of such assets. Such sales were not contrary to the business model of
the Bank. The Bank incurred a loss amounting to UA 3.8 million on derecognition of these financial assets which was fully covered by provisions made in previous years.

The net loss of UA 27.61 million recorded in the year ended December 31, 2010 included a loss of UA 38.78 million which was
attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk. Under IAS 39, this amount was included in profit or loss. The fair value loss

attributable to changes in Bank's “own credit” included in the other comprehensive income (which otherwise would have been
included in profit or loss under IAS 39) for the year ended December 31, 2011 was UA 63.51 million.

The net unrealized gain of UA 9.96 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 included the income statement effects of the
application of hedge accounting consisting of an unrealized gain of UA 2.67 million representing hedge ineffectiveness and UA
4.67 million of amortization of fair value adjustment on the hedged risk (see Note G). Accordingly, from January 1, 2011 changes
in fair value of swaps qualifying for hedge accounting are almost offset by the fair value adjustment of the hedged risk. Prior to
January 1, 2011, only the fair value gain/(loss) on the loan swap was recognized in the profit or loss.

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself.
The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance

sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s
gross income.

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

NOTE R - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the
Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of
6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In
November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor,
changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of
service. The past service cost associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and were recorded in 2004. Also, new
members from the local field offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million
were reported in the 2007 financial statements.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior service cost of UA 8.12 million, which has been immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9
percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been
eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results
of annual actuarial valuations.

In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the mandatory staff retirement age in the Bank from 60 to 62 years
effective January 1, 2012. The impact of the change on the actuarial valuation of SRP for the year ended December 31, 2011 was
a curtailment of UA 10.90 million.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other
than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s
liabilities. At December 31, 2011, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested
in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan
Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b)
Bond portfolio - to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the
currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Post-Employment Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17,
2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute
a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing
of the MBP. Contribution rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children,
range between 0.70 percent to a maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers
of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The
contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the
Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided
to them and their recognized dependents.

Assumptions used in the latest available actuarial valuations at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

 

(Percentages)
Staff Retirement Plan Medical Benefit Plan
2011 2010 2011 2010

Health care cost growth rate

- at end of fiscal year 7.00 8.00

- ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.00 5.00
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2014 2014

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and
equity securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as
forward-looking expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real
earnings growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected infla
126 Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

tion, real bond yield, and risk premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to
the long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

The medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced by a wide
variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of these calculations,
the initial medical cost inflation rate is assumed at 8 percent per annum between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011, thereafter
reducing by 1 percent per annum each year until it reaches 5 percent per annum where a constant rate of 5 percent per annum
will be used thereafter. This level rate of 5 percent per annum will be reached at January 1, 2014 under the current assumption.

The Bank’s obligation and costs for post-retirement medical benefits are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding medical cost
inflation.

The following table shows the effects of a one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost growth rate:

 

 

(UA millions)
1% Increase 1% Decrease
2011 2010 2011 2010
Effect on total service and interest cost 2372 2.238 (1.828) (1.727)
Effect on post-retirement benefit obligation 27.951 15.761 (21.109) (12.541)

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used
by the Bank.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31, 2011 and 2010 for the Staff Retirement Plan:

 

(UA thousands)

2011 2010
Debt securities 154,733, 136,455

Property 36,895, 17,213
Others 36,488 19,818
Total 364,934 345,398

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in short-term deposits and bonds.

The Bank’s estimate of contributions it expects to make to the SRP and the MBP for the year ending December 31, 2012, are UA
17.38 million and UA 4.26 million, respectively.

NOTE V-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

i)

ii)

132

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears
owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into
new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that
were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In
approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan
is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out
conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created extensive destruction of physical assets, such that
he DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage
between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility.
n June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently,
he consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from
ime to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of
such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the
annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC loans in current earnings is
ransferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the
Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Fragile States Facility

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts
cowards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to
he Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations
rom the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

 

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt
relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this
connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income
of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to the facility and by its
resolution B/BG/2007/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank’s
allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors approved the establishment
of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and in addition provide broader and integrated
framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the
foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary countries.

Annual Report 2011African Development Bank Chapter 5

iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this
initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extende:
period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible benefi
ciary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or
their nominal values, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives. Following the signature of a HIPC deb’
relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying value. On average,
loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the ne
present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund
at book values. The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This
was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much
earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the deb
relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service
obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision ani
completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

 

At December 31, 2011, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 30 ADB borrowing countries, of which 26 had reache
he completion point.

iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
nternational Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

 

 

he main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help
38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation
would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance
lows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make addiional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

he MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed
and outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in
he ADF’s net assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank’s investment in the Fund.
Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are
declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancelation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

 

 

NOTE V-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.

At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development
Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from
the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to the Government of Nigeria
upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006, the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations and an independent evaluation of the NTF.

Annual Report 2011 133Chapter 5 African Development Bank

Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years starting
from April 26, 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each,
in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976,
and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87
million) was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on
September 13, 1985.

Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.71 million) was made
to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund. A second request for withdrawal of US$ 200 million was disbursed

to the Government of Nigeria in July 2009.

ii) The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution
20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in
1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields
are likely to facilitate the Bank’s objective of meeting the needs of regional member countries in those fields. The resources of
this Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

NO FUNDS

 

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These
funds, held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific
currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby Mr.
Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of
Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August
11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which
loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2011, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2010: US$ 13.45 million)
had been so repaid.

iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU)
held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving
assistance to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

African Development Bank
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2011,
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of the African Development Fund (the ADF or the
Fund) primarily consist of subscriptions by the Bank and State
Participants, as well as other resources received by the Fund. The
cumulative subscriptions to ADF amounted to UA 22.08 billion
at December 31, 2011.

Subsequent to the initial subscriptions, additional resources
ave been provided in the form of periodic general replenishments, typically done every three years. The twelfth, which is
he latest replenishment of the Fund (ADF-12) was adopted
by the Board of Governors on January 20, 2011 and became
effective on May 3, 2011. The replenishment covers the threeyear operational period starting in 2011 and ending in 2013. The
‘otal resource envelope for ADF-12 amounts to UA 6.11 billion
and includes an Advanced Commitment Capacity, or internally
generated resources of UA 2.01 billion. As of December 31, 2011,
State Participants had subscribed a total amount of UA 3.18 bilion, representing 84 percent of the ADF-12 pledged amounts.

Commitments under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), donor counries agree to compensate the ADF for the cancelation of its
loans to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that have
reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced
HIPC initiative. The MDRI became effective on September 1, 2006
and covers the period 2006-2054. To preserve the financial
integrity and the financing capacity of the Fund, the terms of
he MDRI require donors to fully compensate the Fund “dollar
or dollar” for debts canceled under the MDRI. Donors have also
agreed that periodic adjustments would be made under the
initiative to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs
‘o the Fund resulting from debt forgiveness.

 

 

As of December 31, 2011, the Fund had received from donors
aggregate commitments of UA 4.77 billion, representing 80 percent of the MDRI cost for the period 2006-2054 of UA 5.94 billion.

Financial Products
The ADF is the concessional financing window of the Bank
Group that provides low-income regional member countries
with concessional loans as well as grants for projects and programs, and support through technical assistance for studies
and capacity building.

Loans

Prior to the ADF-12 replenishment, no interest was charged on
ADF loans. Instead they carried a service charge of 0.75 per
Annual Report 2011

African Development Fund Chapter 5

cent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment
fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments.
These ADF loans have a maturity period of 50 years, including
a 10-year grace period.

However, for ADF-12, the Board of Directors approved differentiated ADF lending terms to ADF-eligible countries classified as
blend, gap and graduating under the African Development Bank
Group country classification. Accordingly, new loans extended
under ADF-12 and beyond to blend, gap and graduating countries will have a maturity period of 30 years, including an 8-year
grace period with an interest rate of 1 percent per annum. In
addition, the standard commitment and service fees that apply
to all ADF loans will be charged.

Guarantees

As ameans of stimulating additional private sector investments
in low-income countries, the ADF Partial Risk Guarantee (ADFPRG) instrument was introduced as part of ADF-12, on a pilot
basis, to leverage resources from the private sector and other
cofinanciers for ADF countries, including fragile states. The
ADF-PRG program which was rolled out on a pilot basis will
be reviewed as soon as the aggregate amount of committed
and outstanding guarantees reaches UA 200 million. The ADFPRG will insulate private lenders against well-defined political
risks related to the failure of a government or a governmentrelated entity to honor certain specified commitments and will
incentivize governments to undertake policy and fiscal reforms
necessary to mitigate performance-related risks.

Investments

ADF cash and treasury investments amounted to UA 3.09 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to UA 3.21 billion at the
end of 2010. Investment income for the year amounted to UA
68.45 million, representing a return of 2.17 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 3.15 billion, compared with an income
of UA 84.40 million, representing a return of 2.53 percent on an
average liquidity of UA 3.33 billion in 2010. The lower return in
2011 is primarily the result of the continuing low level of interest
rates as well as the volatile and stressed financial environment
that led to the widening of credit spreads.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net of cancelations, at
December 31, 2011, amounted to UA 21.48 billion compared
to UA 20.33 billion at the end of 2010. During 2011, new loans
signed totaled UA 1.25 billion compared with UA 743.30 million
signed in 2010, an increase of UA 502.99 million. Table 5.6 presents the loans approved, signed, disbursed and undisbursed
balances from 2007 to 2011. The level of loan approvals, loans
signed and disbursed peaked during 2009 at the height of
the global financial crisis. However, these have subsequently
stabilized.

Total outstanding loans as at December 31, 2011 amounted to
UA 6.88 billion, which was UA 581.82 million higher than the UA
6.30 billion outstanding as at the end of 2010. This increase was
in spite of debt cancelation under the MDRI, amounting to UA
300.15 million, for three (3) additional completion point countries.

At the end of 2011, there was a total of 1,074 active loans
and grants. Also at December 31, 2011, a total of 1,271 loans
amounting to UA 718 billion had been fully repaid or canceled
through MDRI.

Disbursements

Loans and grants disbursed by the Fund increased by 11.11
percent to UA 1.30 billion in 2011 from UA 117 billion in 2010.
As at December 31, 2011, cumulative disbursements on loans
and grants amounted to UA 16.04 billion. A total of 1,839 loans
and grants were fully disbursed as at December 31, 2011 for an
amount of UA 13.10 billion, representing 81.67 percent of cumulative disbursements. Figure 5.5 below tracks the evolution of
loan disbursements and repayments over the past five years.

Repayments

Loan repayments amounted to UA 46.26 million in 2011 compared to UA 46.95 million in 2010, representing a decrease of
1.47 percent over the previous year. Cumulative repayments as
of December 31, 2011, were UA 6.81 billion.

Performance Management and Monitoring

As with the Bank, management monitors performance measures and indicators which reflect the critical success factors in
he ADF’s business. To the extent that the ADF extends grants
in addition to lending at highly concessional rates, the convenional profitability and financial ratios are not deemed to be an
appropriate means of determining its effectiveness in delivering development resources to regional member countries. One
proxy for measuring effective delivery of development resources
is the level of disbursements made to RMCs from one period to
another. As already noted, during the year under review a total
of UA 1.30 billion was disbursed for loans and grants, compared
‘0 UA 117 billion in 2010. This is an 11 percent increase in the
evel of development resources transferred to RMCs during 2011.

Financial Results

he Fund reported a deficit of UA 58.46 million in 2011, compared to a deficit of UA 62.93 million in 2010. This persistent
oss was principally due to the generally low level of interest
rates prevailing globally, which had the dual effect of lowering
investment income and increasing the impact of the accelerated
encashment of promissory notes deposited for payment of subscriptions. The average adjusted commercial interest reference
rate (CIRR) applied in the determination of the discount rates
for the accelerated encashment of notes (fixed when interest
rates were high) was higher than the current market interest
rates earned on the extra liquidity created by the acceleration,
creating a negative income gap for the Fund.

 

The Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the administrative expenses of the ADB Group decreased by UA 4.63 million,

Annual Report 2011from UA 163.96 million in 2010 to UA 159.33 million in 2011. The
Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group
is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is
driven primarily by the relative levels of certain operational
volume indicators and relative balance sheet size. The Fund’s
share of Bank Group shareable expenses was 68.76 percent for
2011, compared to 70.83 percent for 2010.

Loan income remained virtually the same at UA 61.82 million in
2011, compared to UA 59.11 million in 2010. Due to the prevailing
low interest rate environment, investment income decreased
by UA 15.95 million, from UA 84.40 million in 2010 to UA 68.45
million in 2011. Discount on the accelerated encashment of
promissory notes amounted to UA 29.23 million in 2011 compared to UA 41.29 million in 2010.

African Development Fund Chapter 5

According to the Fund’s non-accrual policy, service charges on
loans made to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from
loan income if principal repayment and service charges are in
arrears for 6 months or more. As a result of this policy, UA 2.13
million of non-accrued loan income was excluded from 2011
income compared to UA 2.12 million in 2010. The number of
borrowers in non-accrual status at December 31, 2011 was three
(3); the same level as at the end of December 2010.

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying debts under MDRI as
the respective countries reach their HIPC completion points. A
summary of the cumulative loan cancelations under MDRI and
HIPC is presented in Note E to the Special Purpose Financial
Statements.

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011

NOTE A - PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members,
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of May 27, 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors of
ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State
Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank
is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
to as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member
countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the
selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries, particularly the lesser-developed countries. The
assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not
liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates, where there are, are disclosed in the notes that follow.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of
the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund
(the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and
contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources
represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and
demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article
35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its
financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's special purpose financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of
Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

150 Annual Report 2011African Development Fund Chapter 5

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the
currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the
provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time
of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund's Unit of
Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect
of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the
Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation
Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are
included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2011 and 2010 are as follows:

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the
ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the
replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are
recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund.
The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with
an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant’s budgetary appropriation process.

 

Annual Report 2011 151Chapter 5 African Development Fund

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Starting with the ADF-9 replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are
credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are
invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face
value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on
the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over
the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above
the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors
of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and
timely compensation for the debt cancelation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent
(70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs);
and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with
effect from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancelation, the
ADF governing bodies endorsed Management’s proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the Initiative.
Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for
each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will
take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing
ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted
as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the
same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

 

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its
foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that
participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the
time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within
that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value
of the Fund’s holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts
have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ successive Resolutions governing the second through to the twelfth general replenishments of the Fund, which stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to these general replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the date these
replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into UA are applied
against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).

152 Annual Report 2011African Development Fund Chapter 5

Financial Assets

Effective January 1, 2011, the Fund revised the classification of its financial assets into the following two categories: financial assets
at amortized cost and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on
the Fund’s business model. In accordance with the Fund's business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of
income through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification
of its financial assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized cost

A financial asset is classified at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold the
asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial assets are
considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified at "fair value through profit or loss".

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments
that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued income
and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides
money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category includes
all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss.

In addition, financial assets that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A financial asset may
be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or
recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on
different bases.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time
to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or
sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Income on investments includes interest earned
and unrealized gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified either as financial assets at amortized cost or as at fair value. Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All other investment securities are classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and measured at market value.

Annual Report 2011 153Chapter 5 African Development Fund

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio held at fair value through profit
or loss. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date at which the Fund commits
to purchase or sell the investments.

Prior to January 1, 2011, the Fund’s investment securities were classified based on the Fund’s intention on the date of purchase.
Securities which the Fund had the intent and ability to hold until maturity were classified as held-to-maturity and reported at
amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities that the Fund’s management had the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. The Fund’s investments not
classified as held to maturity were classified as held-for-trading portfolio.

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for develooment purposes to the least-developed countries in Africa. Country eligibility is determined by assessing gross national income per capita, creditworthiness and performance. Annual Debt Sustainability
Analysis is used to determine the risk of debt distress of each beneficiary country and set appropriate financing terms.

The following categories of countries are eligible for ADF loans:

* Category A countries are those not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing and whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off;

* Category A countries are those not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are above
the operational cut-off (gap countries);

* Category B countries are those deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are below the
operational cut-off with access to a blend of ADB and ADF resources (blend countries).

Graduating countries are those that are graduating from the category of ADF borrowing countries to the category of ADB borrowing countries and the graduating policies are determined for each new ADF replenishment.

Disbursed and outstanding loans are not included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses
is required. The Fund places all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges
on any of the loans to such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that
the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if
it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent
to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower’s loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges
that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for that period. Charges on loans
in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of such charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth
replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations
of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

The Fund participates in a Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund,
(the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their
overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to
their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference
between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

154 Annual Report 2011African Development Fund Chapter 5

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it
falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the
completion point under the HIPC framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by
additional contributions to be made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When
MDRI becomes effective for a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable
by the country and effectively take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI
are included in “Net Debt Relief” and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development
resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon discharge, cancelation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if,
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or treasury
investments at amortized cost (described in prior years as held-to-maturity investment), the amount of the loss is measured as
the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future
credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect
management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and
recognized in the income statement. If a loan or treasury investment at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount
rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges
are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Fair Value Disclosure

Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available using the bid prices. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed securities, the Fund
may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates of deposit
and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Events after the Balance Sheet Date

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the date of Statement of Net Development Resources
and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at
the date of Statement of Net Development Resources.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the date of Statement of Net Development resources are disclosed, but
do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

Annual Report 2011 155Chapter 5 African Development Fund

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect the prior year’s reported result. However, the prior period’s amounts were not restated to reflect the
effect of the changes in the classification of financial assets as described above.

The Fund has also entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December
31, 2011, the Fund had 775 contracts in Euro and 1,228 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million
of each currency unit, except for 215 US Dollar contracts and 220 Euro contracts with a nominal value of 100,000 of each currency for each contract.

   

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the
form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed
that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

According to the Fund’s loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing
from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per
annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on
the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved after
June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences
to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement. With effect from the ADF 12 replenishment, loans to
blend, gap and graduating countries carry differentiated financing terms of thirty (30) years’ maturity, grace period of 8 years
and interest rate of 1 percent, in addition to the existing standard 0.50 percent commitment fee and 0.75 percent service charge.

158 Annual Report 2011African Development Fund Chapter 5

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2011,
outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 711 million (2010: UA 4.93 million).

As at December 31, 2011, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of
UA 286.01 million (2010: UA 284.91 million) of which UA 91.10 million (2010: UA 83.09 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2011, would have
been higher by UA 2.13 million (2010: UA 2.12 million). At December 31, 2011, the cumulative charges not recognized on the nonaccrual loans amounted to UA 35.92 million, compared to UA 33.65 million at December 31, 2010.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of
20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10 percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.5 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments
were allocated as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or
programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the
ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth, eleventh and twelfth general replenishments is based on a
country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assisance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period,
rom the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible,
he grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

cii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the operaions of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment
period of 5 years thereafter.

 

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price
equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the
signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present value.
The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown
as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million, which was the write-down in respect of the debt
relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework, is included in the amount stated as net debt relief in
the Statement of Net Development Resources. The outstanding balance and net present value of the loans owed by Mozambique
and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

 

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by
reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the
original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they

Annual Report 2011 159Chapter 5 African Development Fund

come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided.
Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2011 amounted to UA 184 million and are shown as allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Develooment Resources.

   

Multilateral Debt

 

nit 2
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims
on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development
Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancelation is delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the
same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF
to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded from
net development resources, the debt cancelation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development resources.
Cancelation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2011, a gross amount of UA 5.15 billion (2010: UA 4.85 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled under
MDRI for 26 (2010: 23) HIPC completion point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2010: UA 1,225.99 million) in nominal
terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71 million (2010: UA 942.71
million). As of December 31, 2011, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

| Arrears Clearance Mechanism
Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC - In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF,
the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears
clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA
36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-9) to clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears
to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing
Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-8 as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on charges to the ADB.

160 Annual Report 2011African Development Fund Chapter 5

Fragile States Facility Framework - The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically regional member countries of ADB emerging from conflict or crisis.
The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and
long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their arrears and prepare
them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries
reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails
the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF, the ADB and private donors.
Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible fragile states not yet receiving debt relief to
fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. Contributions made by the Fund
to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state. Contributions by the Fund to the
Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund’s initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the
form of a special general increase and twelve general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement
of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note O.

The Board of Governors, by its resolution F/BG/2011/01 of 20 January 2011, approved the twelfth general replenishment of the
Fund (ADF-12), following the Deputies agreement for a replenishment level of UA 6.10 billion, of which UA 2.01 billion represents
internally generated resources, for the three-year operational period 2011 to 2013. ADF-12 came into effect on May 3, 2011 after
the State Participants had deposited with the Fund, enough instruments of subscriptions to meet the threshold of 30 percent
of pledged subscriptions. At December 31, 2011 subscriptions to ADF-12 amounted to UA 3.16 billion.

At December 31, 2011 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.94 billion, of which UA 495.60
million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid
entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note O.

 

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund
or amember of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part
of the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 377.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 375.30 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund’s activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

Annual Report 2011 161Chapter 5 African Development Fund

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its treasury investments mandatory at FVTPL (2010: held-for-trading investments) at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where
available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the
Bank. While the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent
of the disbursed and outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to
cover the cost of administering the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate
fair values for outstanding loans.

NOTE | - RESERVES

Reserves as at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

(UA thousands)

2011 2010
Reserves at January 1 114,688 177,618
Deficit for the year (58,464) (62,930)
Reserves at December 31 56,224 114,688

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to receive other
resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2011, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 3.75 million (2010: UA 4.29 million) representing
the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter’s offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects
executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA
159.33 million (2010: UA 163.96 million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by the
Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the
Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB (the
Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the
resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by one of its State Participants.

1) The outcome of the referendum conducted in South Sudan in January 2011 supported the creation of an independent state of South Sudan. After the split of the current state of Sudan into two separate nations
became effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a basis agreed upon following the ongoing negotiations
between representatives of the North and South Sudan. At the end of December 2011, no decision has been taken by the states of North and South Sudan regarding the terms and conditions of such exchange.

Reporting Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the
Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

African Development Fund

Independent Auditor's Report on the special purpose
financial statements of the African Development Fund

to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the special purpose financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2011.

NTF Replenishment

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the NTF or the Fund) is a special fun
administered by the Bank. Its resources primarily consist o
subscriptions provided by the Federal Government of Nigeria.
The NTF was established in 1976 when an agreement establish
ing the NTF was executed between the Bank and the Federa
Government of Nigeria for an initial period of 30 years, with a
rovision for extension by mutual agreement. After two annua
extensions in 2006 and 2007, the operation of the NTF was
extended for ten years with effect from April 25, 2008, follow
ing a positive evaluation of its performance during the initia
hirty (30) years of operation.

Loan Products

TF provides financing in the form of loans to the least develope:
and low-income regional member countries at highly concession:
ary rates in order to enhance economic development and socia
progress in Africa. While in the past the NTF has provided financial
support exclusively to public sector operations, for the extension
period to 2018, NTF will expand its financial support to cover private
sector operations as well, including the microfinance subsector.

 

Investments

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF are denominated
in US Dollars and amounted to UA 106.33 million at December 31,
2011, compared to UA 107.95 million at the end of 2010. Investment
income for 2011 was UA 0.17 million, representing a return of
0.16 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 10714 million,
compared to an income of UA 0.41 million in 2010, representing
a return of 0.38 percent on an average liquidity of UA 108.40
million. The low return is due to the very low level of the USD
Libor rates as well as the volatile and stressed financial environment that led to the widening of credit spreads during the year.

 

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancelations, as at December 31, 2011,
slightly decreased by UA 0.53 million to UA 245.12 million compared to UA 245.65 million at the end of 2010. During 2011, no

new loans were signed, although new approvals totaled UA 10
million compared with UA 0.7 million approved in 2010. Table 5.7
presents the evolution of loans approved, signed, disbursed
and undisbursed balances from 2007 to 2011.

As at December 31, 2011, there were 33 active signed loans with
an outstanding amount of UA 55.65 million and 39 fully repaid
loans amounting to UA 101.85 million.

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 5.02 million in 2010 to UA
8.67 million in 2011, representing an increase of 72.71 percent. As
at December 31, 2011, cumulative disbursements amounted to
UA 235.39 million. A total of 64 loans amounting to UA 220.76
million were fully disbursed as at December 31, 2011, representing 93.78 percent of cumulative disbursements on that date.
Figure 5.8 shows the evolution of loan disbursements and
repayments over the past five years.

Repayments

Loan repayments amounted to UA 5.81 million in 2011 compared to UA 6.68 million in 2010, representing a decrease of
13.02 percent over the previous year. Cumulative repayments
as of December 31, 2011, were UA 148.13 million.

Risk Management Policies and Processes

Similar to the Bank, the NTF seeks to reduce its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development-related assistance, such as liquidity, currency
and interest rate risks. Note D to the Financial Statements of
the Fund provides the details of the risk management policies
and practices employed by the NTF.

Financial Results

The NTF’s income before distributions approved by the Board
of Governors decreased from UA 1.83 million in 2010 to UA 1.52
million in 2011, mainly due to the decrease in investment income.
Investment income in 2011 decreased by UA 0.24 million as a
result of the decline in interest rates as well as the reduction in
the average investment funds.

Administrative expenses, representing the NTF’s proportion of
the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group, decreased by
UA 0.08 million from UA 0.47 million in 2010 to UA 0.39 million
in 2011. The NTF’s proportion of the total shareable expenses of
the ADB group is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven by the relative levels of certain operational
volume indicators and relative balance sheet size. However, the

Annual Report 2011Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 5

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank,
which is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria.
The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement
stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such
sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement
expired on April 26, 2006 and was extended twice for one-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of
the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion and the positive results of the independent review, the Agreement
has been extended for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Fund are summarized below:

Revenue Recognition

Interest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life
of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued for unutilized loan facilities.

Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Fund conducts its operations in U.S. Dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States Dollars
(USD). In accordance with Article VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements are presented
in Units of Account (UA).

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At
December 31, 2011, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.53527 United States Dollars (2010: 1.54003 USD).

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses
on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

Annual Report 2011 izChapter 5 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

Following the adoption of phase 1 of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011, the Fund revised the classification of its financial assets into the
following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These
classifications are determined based on the Fund’s business model. In accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial
assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized cost

A financial asset is classified as ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold the
asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial assets are
considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal
outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss’.

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments
that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued income
and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides money, goods
or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost
using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. Incremental direct
costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are considered insignificant.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category includes
all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss.

In addition, financial assets that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A financial asset may
be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or
recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses on them on
different bases.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and have a time

to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase or
sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

178 Annual Report 2011Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 5

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Prior to January 1, 2011, the Fund classified its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets held for trading; loans
and receivables; and held-to-maturity investments. Management determined the classification of its financial assets at initial
recognition on the following basis:

i) Held-for-Trading Financial Assets

All held-for-trading assets were carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio were acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Held-for-trading financial assets were measured at fair
value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the income statement in the period in which they arose.

ii) Loans and Receivables

Loans included outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund had also classified
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables
were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in an active market. They arose
when the Fund provided money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and
receivables were carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments

The Fund classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management had the intent and
ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments were carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon discharge, cancelation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if,
there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or heldto-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred),
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may
be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of
such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and
recognized in the income statement. If a loan or other investment held at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount
rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges
are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Annual Report 2011 179Chapter 5 Nigeria Trust Fund

Offsetting Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is regarded
as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing
service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length
asis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market might be inactive include
when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are few or no recent transactions
observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may not represent the prices at which
orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore may require adjustment in the valuaion process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable
judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by using
valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length
ransactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market
articipants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
janagement believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale
might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs
are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash
flows. Fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the period end market equivalent lending rate in
that currency, adjusted for estimated credit risk.

180 Annual Report 2011Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 5

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year
net income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical
experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of
financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after
the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows
of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity
investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement.

ii) Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas
such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes
in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Prior to the adoption of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2011, the Fund exercised judgment in classifying assets as held-for-trading or heldto-maturity in accordance with the guidance provided under IAS 39.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result. However, in accordance with its transitional provisions, entities adopting IFRS 9

before January 1, 2012 are not required to restate prior periods’ comparatives on their financial statements. Accordingly, the Fund

has not restated prior year’s comparative information in connection with the application of IFRS 9 in these financial statements.

Annual Report 2011 181Chapter 5 Nigeria Trust Fund

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

1) Standards, Amendments and Interpretations effective after January 1, 2011 but early adopted by the Fund

¢ IFRS 9: “Financial Instruments”

The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 “financial instruments” was issued in November 2009 as part of the IASB comprehensive project to replace IAS 39. The first part of phase 1 of IFRS 9 replaces those parts of IAS 39 relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets. IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified, based on the entity's business model for managing its
financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument, into two measurement categories: those
to be measured at fair value and those to be measured at amortized cost. An instrument is measured at amortized cost only if it
is a debt instrument and the objective of the entity’s business is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows and the
asset’s contractual cash flows represent only payments of principal and interest. All other instruments are to be measured at fair
value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 also requires that all equity instruments be measured at fair value. Equity instruments that are
held for trading will be measured at fair value through profit or loss while for all other equity instruments, an irrevocable election
can be made at initial recognition to recognize all fair value changes through other comprehensive income.

The second part of Phase 1 of IFRS 9 which deals with classification and measurement of financial liabilities was issued on
October 28, 2010. The new requirements address the problem of volatility in profit or loss (P&L) arising from the “own credit” of
an issuer choosing to measure its own debt at fair value. With the new requirements, gains and losses resulting from changes in
‘own credit risk” for liabilities measured at fair value will be reported in “other comprehensive income” and therefore not affect
reported profit or loss.

Although IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the Fund early adopted the first phase of
this standard with effect from January 1, 2011 (“the date of initial application”).

The only impact of the application of the new standard was the reclassification of the Fund’s investments from trading portfolio
(under IAS 39) to a new classification of FVTPL. On the date of initial application of the new standard, the Fund's investments
were all in the trading portfolio. In addition, the Fund had no equity investments, nor does the Fund had liabilities other than
accounts payable resulting from administrative expenses. Consequently, the application of IFRS 9 had no impact on the financial
result of the Fund for the year or on its financial position at the end of the year.

2) Standards and Interpretations Issued but not yet effective
At the date of issue of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations are not yet effective for application, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.

The following new standards and amendments are expected to be relevant to the Fund:

¢ IFRS 13: “Fair Value”

IFRS 13 was issued in May 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, with early adoption permitted. IFRS 13 defines fair value; sets out in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value; and requires disclosures about
fair value measurements.

IFRS 13 explains how to measure fair value for financial reporting which is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific
measurement. It does not require fair value measurements in addition to those already required or permitted by other standards
and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside financial reporting. However, this standard expands the concepts and principles behind fair valuation. In addition, extensive disclosures about fair value are required
under IFRS 13, and in particular when an entity relies on unobservable valuation inputs under the “level 3” fair valuation hierarchy.

The adoption of IFRS 13 is not expected to have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial position or performance.

182 Annual Report 2011Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 5

¢ IFRS 7: “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and IAS 32: “Financial Instruments: Presentation”

In December 2011, IASB issued new disclosure requirements in respect of the effect of offsetting arrangements on an entity’s
financial position, as part of a common project with the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The new requirements are set out in Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (amendment to IFRS 7), and are related to
financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. As part of the same project, the IASB also published Disclosures-Offsetting Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (amendment to IAS 32) clarifying the offsetting criteria in IAS 32 to address inconsistency in their application.

The amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 are to be applied in the financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2013 and annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014, respectively.

The Fund is in the process of evaluating the full impact of the amendments to IFRS 7 and IAS 32 on its financial statements.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course of
exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of the Fund
through the Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority sets out
the guiding principles for managing the Fund’s risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit
risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines
as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s most
senior management forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. As part of ALCO’s key functions pertinent to the administration of
he Fund, it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the
balance sheet, and confirms country credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several
standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, counterparty credit risk,
interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated to
he relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk
or the Fund arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending operaions, and counterparty credit risk. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and
processes, which are described in more detail in the following sections.

 

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses
arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. Country credit risk is managed through
financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessment.
These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its sociopolitical conditions and future
growth prospects.

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
As at December, 2011, all the Fund’s loans were made only to public sector borrowers, and such loans generally carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk
rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance,
debt sustainability, sociopolitical factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined
to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized international
bodies. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure limits, changes
in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that
country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any
previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to
or guaranteed by that borrower country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

Annual Report 2011 185Chapter 5 Nigeria Trust Fund

2) Cc party Credit

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. Various financial instruments are used to manage the Fund’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid
resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to
the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, this risk is
minimized by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards,
counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum
credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that are rated below
the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

Maturity

6 months year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in the UK and 40 year

maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the
time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits
of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to
be predominantly in the AA- or higher-rated class.

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to
mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund's investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement
obligations.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. Dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed
interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently the
available resources. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is accordingly
not hedged.

At December 31, 2011 the Fund had UA 9.73 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2010: UA 18.94 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. Dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the
Fund’s assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an
impact of approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the effect

As part of its portfolio management strategy, the Fund invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, and assetbacked securities.

For government and agency obligations with final maturities longer than 1 year, the Fund may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Investments
in money market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum rating of A.

As at December 31, 2011, all the Fund’s investments were held at fair value through profit and loss. At December 31, 2010, the

Fund's investments were held for trading, in accordance with IAS 39 rules. Investments held at fair value through profit and loss
and those held for trading under IAS 39 are marked to market using quoted prices in active market.

convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976, and the
second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was received on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 million. The first installment of Naira 35 million, equivalent to US$ 52.29 million, was received on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million, equivalent to US$ 10.87 million, was received on May 4, 1984. The third installment of Naira 7 million, equivalent to US$ 7.38
million, was received on September 13, 1985.

NOTE J - RELATED PARTIES

The NTF is administered by the ADB. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF on the basis of the terms of the
Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and
facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such facilities, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing
formula (see Note |). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2011 in respect of Fund’s share of administrative expenses was
UA 0.07 million (2010: UA 0.67 million) and is included in Accounts Payable on the balance sheet.

NOTE K - SEGMENT REPORTING
The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB regional member countries for development purposes.
The Fund’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.

Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB regional member countries and
treasury investments. External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is detailed as follows:

 

(UA thousands)

2011 2010
Interest income and charges on loans 172 1,922
Treasury investments income 173 413
Total external revenue 1,945 2,335

The Fund’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are carried out
mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on the basis
of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses ADB’s offices, staff, organisation,
services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own.

Geographical information about income from loans for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 is detailed as follows:

(UA thousands)
East North Southern West
Africa Africa Africa Africa Total
2011
Income from loans 363 142 299 968 1722
2010
Income from loans 233 142 435 1112 1922

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10% or more of the Fund's
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011.

NOTE L - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 21, 2012, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2011

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (”’the Fund”) which comprise the balance sheet as
at 31 December 2011 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set
out in notes A to L.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement
establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of
the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

195Chapter 5 Nigeria Trust Fund

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December 2011,
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

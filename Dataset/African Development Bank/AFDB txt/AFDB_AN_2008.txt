The overarching objective of the African Development Bank Group is to spur sustainable economic development and social progress in its regional member

countries (RMCs), thus contributing to poverty reduction. The Bank Group achieves this objective by (i) mobilizing and allocating resources for investment

in RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice and technical assistance to support development efforts.

The African
Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development bank
whose shareholders comprise 53 African
countries (regional member countries —
RMCs) and 24 non-African countries (nonregional member countries — non-RMCs). It
was established in 1964 and officially began
operations in 1967. It is headquartered in
Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire; however, because of
political instability in Céte d'Ivoire, the ADB
Governors’ Consultative Committee (GCC),
at a meeting in February 2003 in Accra,
Ghana, decided to move the Bank to its current temporary location in Tunis, Tunisia.

he Bank Group's primary objective is to promote sustainable economic growth to reduce
poverty in Africa. It achieves this objective
y financing a broad range of development
rojects and programs through (i) public
sector loans (including policy-based loans),
rivate sector loans, and equity investments;
(ii) technical assistance for institutional suport projects and programs; (iii) public and
rivate capital investment; (iv) assistance in
coordinating RMC development policies and
lans; and (v) grants of up to US$ 500,000
in emergency support. The Bank prioritizes national and multinational projects and
programs that promote regional economic
cooperation and integration.

he Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement) desig
 

nates the Board of Governors as the institution’s highest policy-making organ, with one
representative from each member country.
he Board of Governors issues general direcives on the Bank's operations and approves
amendments to the Agreement, the admission of new members, and increases to the
Bank's capital. The ADB Board of Governors
elects an 18-member Board of Directors
‘0 which it delegates its powers, with the
exception of those expressly reserved to
it in the Agreement. Twelve Directors are
elected from RMCs and 6 from non-RMCs
‘or a 3-year term, renewable for one term.
e Board of Directors oversees all Bank
operations.

e Boards of Governors elect the president
the Bank Group for a 5-year term, renewale for one term. The president, who must be
rom an RMC, chairs the Board of Directors,
appoints vice-presidents — in consultation
with the Boards — and manages the Bank's
daily operations.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on nonconcessional terms. In 1997, it introduced 3
new loan products to meet the needs of its
clients: a single-currency variable-rate loan,
a single-currency floating-rate loan, and a
single-currency fixed rate loan. The interest
rate for the single-currency variable-rate loan
is based on the quarter's average cost of all
outstanding Bank borrowings specifically
allocated to fund these loans. The interest
rate for the floating-rate loan is based on the

 

 

6 month LIBOR in the basket of currencies
offered by the Bank. The rate for fixed-rate
loans is based on the Bank's cost of borrowing to fund them. The repayment terms for
Bank loans are as follows:

¢ Repayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years for public sector loans;

¢ Repayment period of up to 14 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
4 years for publicly guaranteed lines of
credit; and

¢ Repayment period of 5 to 20 years,
including a grace period of 1 to 3 years
for private sector loans.

The African
Development Fund

he ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973 and
ecame operational in 1974. Its main objecive is to reduce poverty in RMCs by providing low-income RMCs with concessional
oans and grants for projects and programs,
and with technical assistance for studies and
capacity-building activities.

he Agreement Establishing the African
Development Fund (ADF) designates the
Board of Governors as the Fund's highest
olicy-making organ. The Board of Governors
meets at least once a year. The ADF Board of
Directors includes 6 Executive Directors from
non-RMCs — nominated by their constituen
 

Annual Report 2008

xicies — and 6 Executive Directors representing
the ADB; it oversees the general operations
of the Fund.

The Fund's resources come from contributions and periodic replenishments by participants, usually on a 3-year basis. For ADF-XI
(2008-2010), Deputies agreed to a replenishment of UA 5.76 billion, which represents
a 52 percent increase over the ADF-X level.
The replenishment level includes UA 3.70
billion of donor contributions and UA 2.06
billion of advance commitment capacity.

No interest is charged on ADF loans; however, the loans carry a service charge of 0.75
percent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50 percent
per annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans have a 50-year repayment peri

od, including a 10-year grace period. Lines
of credit have a 20-year repayment period
with a 5-year grace period. The Fund also
provides grants to RMCs; these do not carry
any interest charges.

The Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF is a special ADB fund created in
1976 by agreement between the Bank Group
and the Government of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria. Its objective is to assist the development efforts of low-income RMCs whose
economic and social conditions and prospects require concessional financing. The NTF
became operational in April 1976 following
approval of the Agreement Establishing the
Nigeria Trust Fund by the Board of Governors.
Its initial capital of US$ 80.0 million was
replenished in 1981 with US$ 71.0 million.

Under the terms of the Agreement
Establishing the NTF, the operations of the
Fund were envisaged to come to an end 30
years after the Agreement came into force.
Although the Bank and the Nigerian authorities agreed to 2 one-year extensions of the
Agreement from its original expiry date of
April 25, 2006, no new loans or grants have
been approved from the NTF window since
that date. In November 2006 an evaluation
of activities of the Fund was commissioned
and the exercise was completed in July 2007.
On the basis of the evaluation exercise, findings and recommendations, and subsequent
to the meetings held between the Bank and
the Nigerian authorities in November 2007,
the Agreement has been extended for a period of 10 years starting from April 26, 2008.
Approvals from this window are expected to
recommence in 2009.The African Development Bank Group

Annual Report 2008 xvMessage from the President of the African Development Bank Group
and Chairman of the Boards of Directors

am pleased to submit this Annual Report for 2008 at a time of global uncertainties. The financial crisis has developed into a fully blown

economic crisis that has affected all countries, including Africa. The full extent is still unfolding and its ramifications on the real economy
have not yet fully occurred. The crisis fed into pre-existing vulnerabilities and the threat of a reversal of the economic and social progress
hard-won over the last decade is real. But it does not have to be if we and the International Community do the right thing.

The Bank has responded to the crisis through a combination of operational and policy interventions. As an immediate step, the Bank
established a working group to monitor the unfolding crisis and its impact on RMCs as well as on the Bank itself. The Bank also organize
a meeting of African Ministers of Finance, Central Bank Governors and leaders of Regional Economic Communities in Tunis in November
2008 to reflect on the issues and chart the way forward. This was done in collaboration with the African Union (AU) and the Unite
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). A common framework of action was formulated, with the following broad objectives:
to ensure the stability of our financial systems; to mobilize domestic revenues and strengthen domestic capital markets; and to secure
African representation in the G20 process. A Committee of 10 Ministers and Governors was formed to keep these issues under constan
review and make recommendations.

Despite these exogenous shocks that impacted the continent in 2008, the Bank Group remained focused on its operational strategic
priorities and outlined a Medium-Term Strategy for 2008-2012. The Bank's strategy calls for increased selectivity, with greater quality ani
results on infrastructure, the private sector, governance, and higher education. The broad challenge will be one of remaining focused on
medium term priorities while responding to a new much more complex economic landscape. In the area of financial management, despite
the challenging market environment, | am glad to report that the Bank’s prudent, proactive financial and risk management policies an
practices continued to yield positive results, with all 3 windows broadly attaining a positive income in 2008. The Bank's AAA rating was
reaffirmed by all major rating agencies for its senior debt, with a stable outlook. This reflects the strength of the institution, its sound capita
adequacy, preferred creditor status, and solid shareholder support.

 

Finally, let me take this opportunity to extend our gratitude to the Government of Senegal for hosting the 2009 Annual Meetings of the
Bank Group. Allow me also to express my thanks to our shareholders and partners for their continued support, to our Board of Directors an\
Management for skillfully steering the Bank throughout the year, and to our staff for their devotion to duty. | look forward to a successfu
year for all our countries and the Bank Group and commend this Report to you.

Annual Report 2008 xvixviii

Executive Summary

During 2008 the Bank Group continued to pursue its institutional reforms and to scale up the selectivity of its operations in order to
enhance its development effectiveness. In this context, the Bank continued its decentralization exercise, with 23 field offices now operational and equipped with an enhanced ITC network and improved staff skills in the field. The 2 remaining offices (Algeria and Angola)
are at an advanced stage of opening. Other internal reforms aimed at improving the alignment of budgetary resources with institutional
priorities, streamlining corporate performance, and consolidating the Bank's reputation as the premier knowledge-bank for the continent.
In line with the Medium-Term Bank Group Strategy 2008-2012, the Bank continued to focus its operations on supporting infrastructure,
private sector development, good governance, and regional integration. These were supplemented by support in complementary areas of
agriculture and rural development, social and human development. During 2008 the Bank continued to harmonize its cooperation with
development partners to mobilize funding, build synergies, and leverage comparative advantages to better assist its RMCs.

Macroeconomic Context

Africa's economic performance remained
positive in 2008 despite a global backdrop
of volatility in oil and commodity prices, food
shortages (due in part to drought and poor
harvests), and the global financial crisis. The
real GDP growth of the continent registered
5.7 percent for the year, down from 6.1 percent in 2007. The continent's GDP per capita
in nominal terms increased to UA 1,055 in
2008 from UA 889.5 in 2007, largely due
to rising oil prices up to the last quarter of
2008. Growth patterns were spread unevenly
across the continent and inflation rose considerably over the year, from 7.5 percent in
2007 to 11.6 percent in 2008. Although the
continent as a whole experienced improved
terms of trade, current account and fiscal
balances in 2008, 11 countries had current
account deficits above 10 percent of GDP
and 8 countries had debt service ratios above
20 percent, which are considered high.

Looking ahead, African economies face severe
challenges arising from the global financial
crisis. Global demand for commodities has
decreased, driving down the price of African
exports. Furthermore, the financial crisis has
led to a slowdown in capital inflows into
RMCs, reduced aid flows, and substantial outflows of short-term capital. In the last half of
2008, the value of stock declined substantially
in all African stock markets except the Tunisian
Stock Exchange. These factors led to significant

Annual Report 2008

currency depreciations in most RMCs, except
for Angola and CFA zone countries. Exportoriented countries were hardest hit by the
economic downturn, particularly those reliant
on mining, tourism, and manufacturing.

In response to the crisis, in November 2008
the Bank organized, jointly with the African
Union Commission (AUC) and the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(UNECA), a high-level Conference of African
Ministers of Finance and Central Bank
Governors. The meeting was held in Tunis
and provided a forum to discuss the specific
challenges confronting the continent and
possible solutions. At this meeting, the Bank
proposed a number of innovative mechanisms, such as a Trade Finance Initiative (TFI)
and an Emergency Liquidity Facility (ELF), to
assist its RMCs, particularly in the area of
resource mobilization and trade financing.
The need for Africa to be better represented
in the G20 meeting in London in 2009 was
also discussed and a Committee of Ten, representing both Ministers and Governors, was
established. The Bank is also considering
various actions to accelerate support to ADF
countries, including greater access to ADF
resources, for the following areas: (i) budget
support, (ii) long-term infrastructure financing and (iii) private sector development.

The Bank also acted swiftly to counter the
impact of the food crisis, which affected

Africa severely during 2008, with massive
rises in food prices, particularly cereals. To
address the problem, after due consultation
with RMCs, MDBs, and international development organizations, the Bank established
in 2008 the Africa Food Crisis Response
(AFCR) initiative. This aims to reduce food
poverty and malnutrition in the short term
and to ensure sustainable food security in
the long term. The Fund will focus on agricultural infrastructure, including water mobilization for irrigation, rural access roads, and
increased provision of agricultural inputs. It
is expected to provide financial assistance
to RMCs for an approximate amount of UA
472.0 million in the short term and UA 1.4
billion in the medium to long term.

 

Bank Group Operational Activities

In 2008, Bank Group loan, grant, and other
approvals totaled UA 3.53 billion, compared
to UA 3.10 billion in 2007 — an increase of
13.9 percent. Of the total approvals, UA 3.17
billion was in the form of loans and grants,
while UA 358.5 million was allocated to debt
relief, assistance to fragile states, private sector equity participation, private guarantees,
and special funds.

The ADB, the Bank's nonconcessionary window, accounted for UA 1.81 billion (51.2
percent) of total Bank Group approvals in
2008. The ADF, the concessionary window,
accounted for UA 1.67 billion (47.2 percent),and the NTF accounted for UA 28.2 million
(0.8 percent), comprising 2 approvals for
HIPC debt relief. There were no loan approvals from the NTF in 2008, although these are
expected to recommence in 2009. Special
funds for water accounted for UA 28.2 million (0.8 percent) of total approvals.

The 2 main financing instruments of the Bank
Group are (i) project and policy-based loans
and (ii) grants. Project lending (including private sector loans) stood at UA 2.05 billion in
2008, which was an 8 percent drop from the
very high 2007 level of UA 2.22 billion. The
decrease in project lending in 2008 is attributable to the fact that ADB lending through the
private sector was exceptionally high in the
previous year. The peak in 2007 ADB lending
was largely due to the approval of 2 major
infrastructure projects — UA 333.0 million to
Eskom Holdings Expansion Project in South
Africa and UA 222.4 million loan to the Abu
Qir Power Project in Egypt. Despite the minor
decline in 2008, project lending accounted for
58.2 percent of the total approvals in 2008.
Policy-based lending, which totaled UA 51.8
million in 2007, rose more than tenfold to UA
549.4 million in 2008. This reflects the Bank’s
determination to strengthen the capacity of
its RMCs in order to enhance their macroeconomic policies and reform their structural,
institutional, and fiscal systems of governance, thereby creating a more conducive climate for investment and growth.

In respect of the sectoral distribution of loan
and grant approvals for the Bank Group in
2008, the top 4 sectors to benefit were: infrastructure, multisector, finance, and industry.
Approvals for infrastructure projects and
programs remained at a high level of UA
1.41 billion (44.5 percent of total operations approvals). Among the components of
infrastructure, the transportation subsector
received the highest share, followed by power and then water supply and sanitation.

The share of multisector in total loans and
grants increased from 3.6 percent in 2007

to 23.0 percent in 2008 — about a sevenfold rise. This reflects the Bank's promotion
of good governance as a means of building
RMCs' institutional capacity for sound and
transparent fiscal management.

Infrastructure as an engine of socioeconomic growth is well recognized by both the
Bank and by RMC governments. It creates
a more conducive environment for commercial and private sector activities, and

for investment. Regional infrastructure is
being developed by the Bank and other
DFls through such initiatives as the African
Financing Partnership, which was established in September 2008 in a drive to overcome trade barriers, create economies of
scale, and boost export earnings and GDP.
Approvals for multinational operations during the year amounted to UA 597.0 million,
which is more than triple the 2007 level of
UA 193.3 million.

Annual Report 2008In 2008, Bank Group loan and grant approvals to all 5 subregions (including multinational) amounted to UA 3.17 billion. The
subregional allocation was: North Africa, UA
819.9 million (25.9 percent); West Africa,
UA 633.5 million (20.0 percent); East Africa,
UA 569.9 million (18.0 percent); Southern
Africa, UA 475.9 million (15.0 percent); and
Central Africa, UA 74.0 million (2.3 percent)
(see Annex |I-7).

African Development Bank (ADB)

n 2008, approvals from the nonconcessionary window of the Bank Group increased by
8.4 percent to UA 1.81 billion, compared to
he 2007 level of UA 1.67 billion. The composition of the interventions was: UA 1.51
illion for loans and UA 297.7 million for
grants, HIPC debt relief, private sector equity
participation, and private guarantees. The
‘op 3 sectors to benefit from ADB loans and
grants were infrastructure (44.9 percent),
inance (19.6 percent), and industry, mining
and quarrying (18.0 percent).

he private sector continued to attract the
ulk of ADB approvals in 2008. Private sector operations stood at UA 901.2 million
in 2008, representing 49.9 percent of ADB
approvals and 25.5 percent of Bank Group
total approvals. The substantial amount
approved for private sector activities indicates the Bank's continued focus and selectivity on key drivers to accelerate poverty
reduction. Most of the private sector projects
(50.0 percent) went to support financial
intermediation, such as the equity participations in Access Bank of Liberia and Advans
Bank of the DRC, to deepen the financial
markets in these fragile states. Similarly a
number of LOCs were targeted at supporting
lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (e.g. loans to PTA Bank (multinational);
GroFin Africa Fund (multinational); Zanaco
Bank in Zambia; CRDB Bank in Tanzania).
These banks will then onlend to micro entrepreneurs, many of whom are women and
who find it difficult to access credit, and to
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).

 

 

Annual Report 2008

Lines of Credit were also extended to the
West African Development Bank (BOAD) and
‘© PTA Bank for East and Southern Africa
respectively.

he next largest recipient of private secor approvals in 2008 was industry (31.0
percent). An example is the Derba Midroc
Cement Plant in Ethiopia. This was followed
y approvals for infrastructure (14 percent),
articularly in the power, transportation,
and water subsectors. Operations such as
he Doraleh Container Terminal Project in
Djibouti aim not only to spur sustainable economic growth in the country but also to support regional integration through improved
transportation linkages.

Disbursements on ADB loans decreased by
17.8 percent, from UA 884.8 million in 2007
‘0 UA 727.5 million in 2008. Cumulative disursements (including nonsovereign loans)
amounted to UA 17.62 billion. At December
31, 2008, 768 loans were fully disbursed for
a total amount of UA 16.79 billion, representing 95.3 percent of cumulative ADB disbursements. The decrease in the level of ADB
disbursements in 2008 can be attributed
to the fact that ADB public sector disbursements in 2007 were exceptionally high. This
was due to a UA 338.0 million (US$ 500.0
million) loan to Egypt, which was disbursed
in a single tranche.

 

 

 

 

African Development Fund (ADF)

Under this concessionary window, in 2008
ADF approvals (loans, grants, and assistance for debt and debt service reduction)
amounted to UA 1.67 billion. This represented an increase of 21.0 percent over the
2007 level of UA 1.38 billion. With respect
to ADF loan and grant approvals only, they
increased by 51.4 percent from UA 1.09 billion in 2007 to UA 1.65 billion in 2008. The
2 main beneficiary sectors of these resources
were infrastructure (UA 728.3 million or
44.2 percent of total) and multisector (UA
644.0 million or 39.1 percent of total). This
aligns with the Bank's operational strategy

of focusing on infrastructure and governance
as high-impact areas of intervention.

Project and policy-based loans approved by
the Fund amounted to UA 1.09 billion of all
resources committed to operations; a rise of
39 percent from the 2007 level of UA 787.1
million. Grants increased to UA 552.6 million
in 2008, compared with UA 304.6 million in
2007; a rise of 81.4 percent. Other approvals totaling UA 19.0 million were for debt
and debt service reduction and 2 project
preparation facility interventions.

The disbursement of loans and grants on Fund
operations increased by 55.2 percent over the
12-month period, from UA 725.0 million in
2007 to UA 1.125 billion in 2008. Cumulative
disbursements as at December 31, 2008
stood at UA 11.88 billion. A total of 1,504
loans and grants were fully disbursed for an
amount of UA 9.54 billion, representing 80.3
percent of cumulative disbursements since
the Fund became operational.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)

The NTF was established in 1976 at the
initiative of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
for an initial period of 30 years. Following
the positive review and recommendation
for continuation by the independent evaluators, the Federal Republic of Nigeria and
the Bank agreed to a 10-year extension of
NTF commencing on April 25, 2008. The
extension was approved by the Board of
Governors of the Bank on May 15, 2008,
during the Annual Meetings in Maputo,
Mozambique. The Boards of Directors subsequently approved the NTF Operational
Guidelines in December 2008.

While NTF resources are primarily intended
to support public sector operations in the
lower-income countries, a long-term target of an 80:20 percent share between the
public and private sector projects will be
maintained. There were no new loan and
grant approvals in 2008, however the NTF
lending program is scheduled to recom-mence in 2009. Cumulative disbursements
(1976-2008) amounted to UA 213.2 million. In sum, 59 loans were fully disbursed
for a total amount of UA 196.2 million, representing 92.0 percent of NTF cumulative
disbursements.

Institutional Reforms and
Development Effectiveness

The Bank continued to make good progress
in advancing its institutional reforms to scale
up the effectiveness of the institution and
the development impact of its operations.
The 4 key areas of reform were: (i) Human
Resources (HR) management; (ii) operational
business processes; (iii) decentralization and
operationalization of its field offices (FOs);
and (iv) budget reforms.

¢ Human Resources has seen an accelerated recruitment and redeployment drive to
operations and the field offices. A second
new focus of HR strategy relates to the
Compensation and Benefits Framework
for 2008-2012, which creates a stronger
linkage between individual staff performance and reward.

© The operational business process reforms
have led to the formulation of detailed
operational procedures covering policies, programming, and resource utilization. This has resulted in improved quality standards, strategic alignment, coordination and accountability, improved
delegation of authority to FOs, and to
procurement reforms.

© The decentralization exercise has accelerated with 23 FOs now operational — only
2 offices (Angola and Algeria) remain to
be opened, and Host Country Agreements
for these have been signed. The decentralization process has led to a streamlining of business processes with TRA/HQ
and a better skills mix in the field. Greater
Bank presence at the country level has
enhanced dialogue with RMCs, and has
improved project preparation and supervision, thereby scaling up portfolio quality
and development impact.

¢ Budgetary reforms have given managers more direct access to resources and
greater flexibility in their use. The new
budget framework helps to ensure that
resource allocations are in line with the
Medium Term Strategy (2008-2012). It
also reinforces Management's accountability for delivery and results, by linking
program deliverables to Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs).

In a further effort to scale up its corporate
performance, in 2008 the Bank approved the
establishment of the Quality Assurance and
Results Department (ORQR) to coordinate the
implementation of the results-based agenda
in Bank operations, strategies, and reporting
systems. A new position of Chief Operating
Officer (COO) was also created to improve
corporate services delivery. Furthermore, the
Bank established the Strategy and Budget
Department (COBS), the Fragile States Unit, the
Sustainable Development, Gender & Climate
Change Unit. It also approved the proposal on
“Enhancing Corporate Services Delivery.”

Knowledge Management and
Development

During the year under review, the Bank continued its activities in the area of knowledge
management and development, which the
Medium-Term Strategy identified as a key
complement to its lending activities. To this
end, the Bank approved the Knowledge
Management and Development Strategy
(KMDS) during the year, with the objective of:
(i) generating knowledge to enhance development effectiveness; (ii) leveraging knowledge through partnerships; (iii) improving
knowledge dissemination and sharing; and
(iv) enhancing the application of knowledge.
The overarching goal of the Bank's knowledge strategy is to consolidate its role as
a premier knowledge institution for Africa,
and a leading change agent for sustainable
socioeconomic development in its RMCs.
It also seeks to establish the Bank as the
preeminent voice on pressing development
issues affecting the continent.

A number of training and statistical capacity building activities, including workshops
and seminars, were held at the TRA and in
RMCs during the year, and a total of 883
officials from RMCs attended these activiies. The Bank Group’s Joint Africa Institute
(JAI) and African Development Institute (ADI)
conducted complementary seminars, workshops, and symposia. The Eminent Speakers’
Program welcomed 2 distinguished personalities from the fields of finance and African
development. Mr. James Wolfensohn, former
President of the World Bank, spoke on the
heme “Africa in a Global World: Partnerships
‘or Success” and His Excellency Mr. Festus
Mogae, former President of Botswana, gave
a talk on “Extractive Industries and Africa's
Development: Lessons from Botswana.”

he Bank also extended its support to
strengthen statistical capacity and systems
in RMCs, specifically by helping countries to
implement the Regional Reference Strategic
Framework (RRSF) for Statistical Development
in Africa and in designing effective National
Statistical Development Strategies (NSDS).

 

Support to Middle-Income Countries
The Bank Group tailors its financing instruments and products to suit the differing
needs of its RMCs; depending on their level
of development, capacities, and expectations.
Middle-income countries have made progress
and attained higher per capita incomes than
many other RMCs; however they still require
additional support to grow their economies
and increase their global competitiveness.

In 2008, the Bank approved a Strategic
Framework for Enhancing Bank Group
Support to Middle-Income Countries. This
aims to position the Bank as the preferred
partner of MICs, based on a comprehensive
financial package designed to enhance service delivery, keep its products competitively
priced, and with the added value of providing advisory services. In this way, the Bank
seeks to support its MICs to develop into
regional hubs of economic growth.

Annual Report 2008xxii

During the year 2008, the Bank Group
approved loans for MICs (excluding multinational projects) totaling UA 1.10 billion from
the ADB window. The 3 main beneficiary
sectors were infrastructure (46.0 percent),
finance (27.2 percent), and social (17.7 percent). This reflects the strong demand from
MICs for funding in the areas of infrastructure and financial sector development. Most
of the resources for MICs in 2008 (72.2 percent) went to the North Africa subregion.

Support to Fragile States

Fragile states (including post-crisis/transitional countries) have their own special requirements in terms of support. They need to be
assisted to move toward more stable political and economic development and to reengage fully with the international community. During the year, the Bank approved 2 documents relating to fragile states: (i) the Bank
Group Strategy for Enhanced Engagement in
Fragile States and (ii) Operational Guidelines
of the Fragile States Facility. The new strategy
differentiates the Bank Group's support to 9
post-conflict/transitional countries from the
support provided to other categories of fragile states. Post-conflict states need special
attention and dedicated resources to rebuild
core institutions and rehabilitate vital serv
Annual Report 2008

ices and basic infrastructure. Total funding
from the Fragile States Facility (FSF) in 2008
amounted to UA 35.6 million, allocated thus:
Burundi (UA 12.0 million), Togo (UA 14.6
million), and Liberia (UA 9.0 million).

The 2009 Administrative Expenses
and Capital Expenditure Budgets

In December 2008, the ADB Board of Directors
approved an Administrative Expenses Budget
of UA 253.1 million, a Capital Expenditure
Budget of UA 18.5 million, and a contingency
budget of UA 2.5 million for 2009. The ADF
Board of Directors approved an indicative
Administrative Budget of UA 180.3 million
‘or the Fund for the financial year ending
December 31, 2009.

Net Income Allocation

he 2008 financial statements of the Bank
Group highlight the robustness of the Bank's
inancial position, as manifest from the combined net income before distribution of UA
315.3 million and an allocable income of
UA 275.3 million.

Credit Ratings

he ratings agencies, Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+

 

rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debt respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
the Bank's strong membership support, its
preferred creditor status, sound capital adequacy, and prudent financial management
and policies.

Borrowings

In December 2007, the Bank approved a
borrowing program for 2008 of up to UA
1.63 billion, including a UA 427.0 million
component for the Enhanced Private Sector
Assistance for Africa (EPSA) initiative. The
Bank raised UA 1.10 billion at a weighted
average cost of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR
minus 25 basis points in the capital markets.
In addition, UA 189.0 million was raised in
2008 under the EPSA initiative.

Furthermore, the Bank issued 4 transactions in public markets during the year — one
each in the US$ global bond market and the
domestic markets of Canada, New Zealand
and South Africa. These were supplemented
by offerings in the private placement and
uridashi markets, and one transaction that
was linked to Ugandan Shillings.Table 0.1: Summary of Bank Group Operations, Resources and Finance, 1999-2008

The Board of Governors is the institution's highest policy-making organ, comprising one representative from each member country. The
Board of Governors issues general directives and elects an 18-member Board of Directors, to which it delegates most of its powers. The
Board of Governors also elects the President of the Bank Group. The Board of Directors sets policies and guidelines and oversees all Bank
operations in addition to financial and administrative matters. This chapter outlines the Boards’ activities during 2008, with particular
emphasis on the 2008 Annual Meetings held in Maputo, Mozambique.

Boards of Governors

2008 Annual Meetings

The Annual Meetings of the Boards of
Governors of the African Development
Bank Group (AfDB) were held in Maputo,
Mozambique on May 14 and 15, 2008.
During the meetings, Governors approved
the 2007 Annual Report and audited financial statements for the financial year ending
December 31, 2007. In addition, they passed
several resolutions concerning the activities
of the Bank Group.

Annual Meetings Seminars

The Annual Meetings were preceded by
Ministerial Roundtable discussions and highlevel seminars which gave participants the
opportunity to exchange views and experiences on the most pressing concerns affecting the economic and social development
of Africa. More specifically, the seminars
provided a platform for discussing Africa’s
rapid urbanization. The events were attended
by about 1,500 participants, including governors, alternate governors and delegates,
members of the Boards of Directors, development partners, civil society, and observers.

The themes for the high-level seminars
focused on: (i) “Cities as Growth Poles:
Implications for Rural Development”;
(ii) “Financing Urban Development”;
(iii) “Decentralization and Governance”;
and (iv) “Upgrading Informal Settlements
in African Cities.” The plenary session of
the Ministerial Roundtable discussion was
on the theme “Fostering Shared Growth,
Urbanization, Inequality and Poverty in
Africa.” The session was jointly chaired by

Annual Report 2008

Dr. Donald Kaberuka, President of the African
Development Bank Group, and Dr. Abdoulie
Janneh, Executive Secretary of UNECA.
The keynote address was delivered by Her
Excellency Mme Luisa Diogo, Prime Minister
of the Republic of Mozambique. Subsequent
Ministerial Roundtable discussions were on
“Aid Effectiveness” as part of Africa's regional preparatory events for the Accra High
Level Forum on Aid and Effectiveness, and on
“Strategies to Mitigate the Regional Effects
of Fragility and Conflict Situations.”

Boards of Governors’
Meeting

In his opening address, Mr. Eneas Comiche,
Mayor of Maputo, welcomed the delegations
to this historic city. He stated that the Annual
Meetings in Maputo came at an opportune
moment, coinciding with the commencement of the urban development program,
aimed at improving living conditions in the

capital and strengthening its reputation as
a city of vision.

His Excellency Mr. Aiuba Cuereneia,
Chairperson of the Boards of Governors
and Governor for Mozambique, also welcomed his colleagues, delegates, and other participants to the Annual Meetings. He
acknowledged the presence of the former
President of Mozambique, His Excellency
Mr. Joaquim Chissano; His Excellency Mr.
Denis Sassou-Nguesso, President of the
Republic of Congo; and His Excellency
Mr. Armando Emilio Guebuza, President
of the Republic of Mozambique. He similarly welcomed the participation of former
Presidents of the African Development Bank
in the Annual Meetings, indicating that the
presence of these dignitaries was a source
of inspiration and encouragement for the
Bank's Management and a mark of confidence in the institution.In his opening statement, His Excellency
Armando Guebuza, President of the Republic
of Mozambique, stressed the importance of
massive public investment for the development of African countries. He underscored
his own Government's support for the Bank
Group's strategic focus on infrastructure,
education, health, and the empowerment
of the rural population. President Guebuza
welcomed the positive impact of the Bank
Group-financed operations on the development efforts of his country and appealed
0 the international community to step up
heir assistance to the African countries to
attain the Millennium Development Goals
MDGs). President Guebuza declared the
meeting open and wished Governors success in their deliberations.

n his opening address, Dr. Donald Kaberuka,
President of the Bank Group, expressed his
gratitude to the Government and people
of Mozambique for hosting the Annual
Meetings. He stated that the Bank was greatly honored by the attendance of the President
of the Republic of Mozambique and the
President of the Republic of Congo. He also
acknowledged former Bank Group Presidents
who were at the meeting. Furthermore, the
Bank Group President gave a very warm
welcome to the delegation of the Republic
of Turkey, which will be a new member of
the Bank Group.

 

 

 

He further thanked the Tunisian people and
Government, who continue to offer the Bank
their generous hospitality. In the same spirit, he extended the Bank's best wishes to
the people of Cate d'Ivoire, the Bank's host
country, as they move ahead in returning the
country to normalcy, national reconciliation,
and lasting stability.

 

The President expressed his appreciation
to the distinguished members of the High
Level Panel, particularly the co-chairs, former
Mozambican President Chissano and former
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin, for
their Report Investing in Africa's Future —

The AfDB in the 21% Century, which attests
to Africa's need for a strong development
bank that can serve as more than an aid
conduit. He noted that the AfDB will have to
“earn” that position by demonstrating that
its resources are being optimally deployed,
within a strong fiduciary framework, for maximum impact in its RMCs.

Dr. Kaberuka stated that 2007 had been a
very good year for the Bank Group. Despite
turbulence in the financial markets, the financial fundamentals of the institution remain
very robust. The Bank is also making headway in becoming more selective and results
oriented, while continuing to reform its operational, business, and budget processes to
ensure greater accountability, quality, and
responsiveness.

In respect to its staffing profile, the President
highlighted the Bank's new HR Strategy and
performance evaluation system. Other notable achievements during the year in this area
included the Bank's first comprehensive staff
survey and accelerated recruitment drive. The
decentralization exercise also accelerated
with offices operational in 23 RMCs.

Activities of the Boards Chapter 007

 

The “Strategic Review of the Bank’s Capital
Utilization” was completed in 2008 by two
external institutions. The findings confirm that the Bank has significant unused
risk capital. With respect to the ADF-XI,
President Kaberuka commended the Fund
donors for a generous and record increase,
which has massively boosted the Fund's
capability.

The expansion in 2007 of Bank Group private sector operations, investment in middleincome countries (MICs), regional integration
operations, and infrastructural development
(which almost doubled from UA 0.57 billion
in 2006 to UA 1.04 billion in 2007), attested
to the Bank Group's determination to focus
on areas that will stimulate economic growth
for its RMCs.

On the global food crisis, which is particularly impacting Africa, the President said
the response should be at 3 levels: (i) to
provide emergency support to the people
and countries most at risk; (ii) to deal with
macroeconomic stress; and (iii) to tackle the
longer-term issues of food security, in which
MDBs and governments should play a major

Annual Report 2008Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

role. There should also be greater private
investment in sectors that impact on food
production, distribution, and marketing.

Looking ahead, Dr. Kaberuka said that the
Bank's Medium Term Strategy 2008-2012
spelled out a sustained growth strategy for
RMCs. He assured member countries that
hey can count on the Bank Group as a reliable partner, given its solid financial base
coupled with its determination to become
more selective in its operations. He warned
hat 2008 will test Africa's ability to manage existing risks and overcome new threats.
he food and energy crises, the accelerating
impact of climate change, and the global
inancial downturn all present additional
challenges to sustainable socioeconomic
growth.

Finally, the President stated that the Bank
is building its internal capacity to tackle the
problem of climate change, particularly its
damaging effect on the agricultural sector.
n this endeavor, the Bank is harmonizing its
activities with partner institutions.

Governors’ Statements

he Governors expressed their appreciaion to the Government and people of the
Republic of Mozambique for their hospitality and warm welcome. They acknowledged
hat the 2008 Annual Meetings were being
eld amidst rising oil and food prices, which
was creating tensions in the economies of
African countries. They highlighted the need
‘or urgent mobilization of external financial
resources and for the international community to coordinate its support at this crucial
ime.

 

he Governors welcomed the Bank's determination to address the situation. They pointed out that 2008 marked a halfway point
in the timeline set for achievement of the
MDGs; yet much needed to be done to meet
these targets. In this regard, the Governors
highlighted the focal areas that need to be
tackled, including:

Annual Report 2008

¢ heightened selectivity in Bank Group
operations by focusing on infrastructure, regional integration, and good
governance;

© continued focus on the social sector
(health, education), agriculture, and
gender issues;

¢ increased attention to climate change
with an emphasis on combating deforestation through the development of
clean energies;

¢ priority budgetary support to countries
in need by establishing objective criteria
for allocation, in line with multilateral
partners such as the IMF;

© creating a flexible instrument for quick
response to exogenous shocks;

¢ rationalization of regional economic communities (RECs);

most needed.

The Governors welcomed the conclusions
and recommendations of the High Level
Panel, which had provided a strategic vision
for the Bank. They also expressed satisfaction at the record level of replenishment of
the ADF-XI.

They indicated their satisfaction at the
reinforcement of peace, reconciliation, and
stability in Cdte d'Ivoire, the Bank's host
country. They hoped that the calendar set
could be respected in order to facilitate the
orderly return of the Bank’s operations to its
headquarters in Abidjan. They thanked the
Government of Tunisia for having hosted
the Bank's Temporary Relocation Agency
since 2003 and for its key role in providing
a conducive environment for the smooth
continuation of the Bank’s activities.

 

The Governors adopted the resolutions on
the accession of Turkey as the 78th member
of the Bank Group and as a State Participant

of the African Development Fund. They also
welcomed the statement of the Governor for
Turkey, that his Government would spare no
effort to make a significant contribution to
the development of the African continent.
Turkey's accession reflects the confidence of
nonregional member countries in the Bank's
enhanced delivery of its services to RMCs
and its development effectiveness.

In conclusion, the Governors expressed their
satisfaction at the considerable progress
made by the Bank as well as the strong
financial results achieved during 2007. They
urged Management to continue its efforts
to position the Bank as the apex financial
institution for the development of Africa.
They reiterated their confidence and support for the Bank's President, Management,
and staff.

Xo TMA tcLa MAL eLO aChapter 002 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

During the year under review, the Bank Group continued its institutional reforms in order to improve its corporate performance, the quality of its operations, and its development effectiveness. The Bank also pursued its aspiration of being the premier development institution
for the continent, a center of knowledge and research, and the preeminent African voice on development issues. This chapter presents the
contribution of the Bank’s organizational units in realizing these strategic objectives.

INSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS

Significant progress was made, during the
past year, across all priority reform areas, by
implementing: (i) the new human resources (HR) strategy; (ii) improved operational business processes; (iii) the accelerated
decentralization; (iv) budget reforms; and (v)
enhanced corporate services delivery.

Human Resources
During 2008, the Bank continued to implement the new HR Strategy approved in
2007 by focusing on: (i) the recruitment
and deployment of higher-caliber staff to
operations and country/regional offices and
(ii) a more competitive and rationalized staff
Compensation and Benefits Framework.

The recruitment drive has enhanced dialogue
and improved effective service delivery. This
has resulted in about 72 percent of staff
(excluding management) engaged directly in
operations, while 28 percent are responsible
for corporate support and administration. The
new performance management system places greater emphasis on results and creates
a stronger link between performance and
reward. In July 2008, the Bank approved the
new Compensation and Benefits Framework
for 2008-2012, which is currently being
implemented across the Bank and country/
regional offices.

 

Operations Business
Processes

More effective operational business processes that will improve client responsiveness through enhanced programming and

Annual Report 2008

service delivery have been rolled out. To
ensure that all Complexes work in close
coordination and provide coherent, timely,
and effective Bank support to RMCs, an
Operations Committee (OpsCom) has been
established and is now fully operational.
Detailed procedures are in place, covering
policies, programming, and resource utilization. This has improved quality standards,
strategic alignment, coordination and cohesion; it has also increased accountability
and corporate level ownership. Other core
operational reforms include:

¢ a reduction in the number of projects/
programs formally discussed at the
Boards level, following the adoption of a
threshold for lapse-of-time approvals;

¢ streamlining country strategies and operational policies and updating operational
guidelines and manuals;

¢ a comprehensive revision of the
Delegation of Authority Matrix, for HQ
and FOs;

© procurement reforms; and

¢ introduction of the Project Concept Note
as a means of ensuring quality at entry
for Bank projects.

These reforms underscore the Bank's efforts
to implement the Paris Declaration and
Harmonization agenda, reduce delays and
project implementation costs, and improve
client satisfaction.

 

Decentralization

The Bank has made substantial progress on
decentralization, with offices now operational in 23 RMCs, while 2 other offices (Angola
and Algeria) are at an advanced stage of

opening. The reforms implemented during
2008 included: (i) putting in place business
processes to fully integrate country/regional
offices with the TRA and Headquarters; (ii)
enhancing IT facilities in the FOs to facilitate communication and workflow; (iii) an
accelerated recruitment and redeployment
exercise to improve the staff skills mix in
country/regional offices; and (iv) increased
delegation of authority to resident representatives for certain activities that can be
more cost-effectively managed at the country level.

Budget Reforms

The objectives of the reforms approved in
2007 are intended to: (i) strengthen the
linkage between institutional priorities and
resource allocations; (ii) establish a new
accountability and performance framework;
(iii) enhance budget flexibility through fungibility and devolved resource management
authority; (iv) introduce multi-year programming and budgeting; and (v) introduce UA
(Dollar) Budgeting. Collectively, the reforms
will underpin the Managing for Development
Results (MfDR) agenda.

 

 

With the exception of UA Budgeting, which
will be operational in 2010, these reforms
are already under implementation. Managers
now have direct control of resources, thereby
allowing for greater flexibility and a faster
response time to new challenges and reprioritizations. The new budget framework
helps ensure that resource allocations are
consistent with the Bank's strategic priorities and enables greater rigor in monitoring
Management's accountability for delivery
and results.A 3-year “rolling” budget process was
launched to prepare a consolidated programming and budgeting proposal for the
period 2009-2011. The new accountability and performance system, linking program deliverables to Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), is now in place to monitor

Annual Report 2008Chapter 002 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

Enhancing Corporate
Services and Performance

As part of the additional institutional reforms
approved in 2008, the Bank established
the position of a Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer (VP/COO) and a Quality
Assurance and Results Department (ORQR).
ORQR is responsible for coordinating Bankwide implementation of the agenda to
improve quality and strengthen the focus
on development results on the ground in
the RMCs.

The VP/COO will bring about improved
corporate coordination and performance
monitoring. The COO will be the focal point
for issues requiring presidential arbitration
and accountable to bring such issues to
the attention of the President, as necessary. Under the COO's control is a virtual
unit — the Performance Monitoring Group
(PMG) — which has the mandate of providing Senior Management with early warning
signals on areas of non-performance, or challenges in institutional service delivery; and
benchmarking internally and externally the
effectiveness of various business processes.
Also reporting to the VP/COO is the restructured Strategy and Budget Department
(COBS) and the Ethics Officer.

Other institutional reforms approved in
2008 included the establishment of the
Fragile States Unit and the Sustainable
Development, Gender and Climate Change
Unit. The corporate services reform provides for the restructuring of the existing
Departments and Unit in the CSVP Complex
in order to improve efficiency, client responsiveness, and quality of services. This restructuring entails:

(i) upgrading the Language Services Unit
to a Department;

(ii) regrouping functions within the General
Services Department with a focal point
for Client Services and FOs;

(iii) creating a new Risk Management and
Institutional Procurement function.

Annual Report 2008

COMPLIANCE REVIEW
AND MEDIATION

The Independent Review Mechanism (IRM)
has 2 key functions. The first is problemsolving (mediation), which aims at restoring effective dialogue between the source
of the request, the Bank Group, and other
interested parties, to reach a common solution to the complaint. The second is compliance review, which seeks to investigate
whether the alleged harm/damage is a result
of a violation of the Bank's policies and
procedures.

During 2008, a review panel concluded its
investigations of a complaint relating to the
Bujagali Hydropower and Interconnection
projects in Uganda. The panel's report was
approved and adopted by the Bank in July
2008. The Bank is preparing an action plan
addressing the panel’s project-specific findings, along with its recommendations.

For the IRM to function effectively, it is
imperative that those likely to be affected
by a Bank-financed project are aware of
the mechanism, its procedures, and how to
seek redress. In 2008, the Bank updated its
website (www.afdb.org/irm) with relevant
information, including the mandated reports
and decisions related to compliance review.
Moreover, the IRM brochure, which details
the requirements for submitting complaints,
has been published in 5 languages: English,
French, Arabic, Portuguese, and Kiswahili.
To raise awareness of the IRM function
further, outreach seminars for civil society
and government officials were conducted
in 7 RMCs, namely Egypt, Madagascar,
Morocco, Mozambique, Tanzania, Tunisia,
and Zambia.

KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT AND
DEVELOPMENT

The Bank Group aspires to serve as a center
of knowledge and research for the continent, and to leverage this role as a complement to its lending activities. In this connection, the Bank approved the Knowledge
Management and Development Strategy
(KMDS) in July 2008, which will be used to
improve the quality and effectiveness of its
operations. The Strategy is based on the following 4 pillars:

© to generate knowledge for development
effectiveness;

© to leverage knowledge through partnerships;

© to improve knowledge dissemination
and sharing; and

© to enhance the application of knowledge.

The aim will be to integrate lessons from
research, develop networks of think-tanks
and research institutes, actively disseminate
and share information, provide timely and
relevant advice to clients, and selectively
build capacity in RMCs. Furthermore, the
Bank seeks to position itself as the acknowledged leader in African statistics, as well
as the premier knowledge bank on African
economic and social development.

Development Research

During 2008, research activities focused
on the following topics, amongst others: “Dynamics of Youth Employment in
Tunisia”; “Poverty Analysis in the Democratic
Republic of Congo”; “Future of Smallholders’
Agriculture in a Changing African Economy”;
“Growth, Poverty and Inequalities in African
MICs”; “Enhancing the Competitiveness of
Botswana, Mauritius, Namibia and Tunisia”;
“Development Aid and Access to Water
and Sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa,”
and “Impact of Infrastructure Investment
in Africa.”The research undertaken provided a rapid
response to the global economic and food
crises, including an analysis on “The Food
Crisis in Africa and the AfDB's Response.”
Several briefing papers on the global financial crisis were produced, highlighting its
impact on African economies.

In 2008, the Bank continued to produce
and disseminate its flagship publications.
The African Economic Outlook (AEO)
2007/2008, was produced jointly with the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) and the Economic
Commission for Africa. Other publications included 3 issues of The African
Development Review (ADRv) and 7 papers
in The Working Paper Series.

Capacity Building and
Training Activities in RMCs
The Bank supports capacity building within
the institution and in RMCs through training, assistance to national institutions,
and knowledge dissemination. During the
year, a total of 883 officials from RMCs
attended the capacity building and training activities.

The Bank Group's African Development
Institute (ADI) and the Joint Africa Institute
(JAI) conducted complementary workshops,
seminars, and symposia aimed at building
capacity in RMCs. In cooperation with other
institutions, the Bank Group also organized development management seminars
and conferences, such as the 2008 Annual
Meetings seminars and the joint AfDB/
ECA roundtable discussion on “Fostering
Shared Growth: Urbanization, Inequalities
and Poverty in Africa.”

The Bank continues to partner with other
institutions in conducting capacity development events in RMCs. In this regard the
Bank, in collaboration with the Korean
Government, the Export-Import Bank
of Korea, and the Korean Development
Institute, organized workshops on the theme

“Knowledge Sharing on Korea's Economic
Development Experience” in the Central,
West, and Eastern regions. Also, in collaboration with IFAD, 4 regional Training of
Trainers (TOT) workshops were organized
on project operations management, resultsbased monitoring and evaluation, and procurement guidelines.

During the year, the Bank organized regional
workshops targeted at ministers and highlevel government officials, parliamentarians, and civil society on the following
themes: (i) “Knowledge Management for
Scaling up Poverty Reduction in Africa”;
(ii) “Public Financial Governance for PostConflict Countries”: (iii) “Performance-Based
Allocation (PBA) and the determination of the
loans/grants proportion of allocations using
the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF)";
and (iv) “Project Operations Management
and Performance Improvement Plan.”
Moreover, in July 2008, a high-level seminar was organized in Uganda by the Bank
and the Kingdom of Norway in collaboration
with the Ugandan Government on the theme
“Managing Oil Revenue in Uganda.”

Also during 2008, under the Eminent
Speakers’ Program, 2 renowned personaliies were invited to share their knowledge
of contemporary development issues facing Africa. Mr. James Wolfensohn, former
President of the World Bank, spoke on “Africa
in a Global World: Partnerships for Success.”
he second speaker was His Excellency Mr.
Festus Mogae, former President of the
Republic of Botswana, who made a presenation on “Extractive Industries and Africa's
Development: Lessons from Botswana.”
he 2006/07 Eminent Speakers’ Seminars
series titled “Sharing Visions of Africa's
Development”, Volume |, was launched on
December 4, 2008.

the Bank has engaged in an accelerated
recruitment process to fill these vacancies
and it is expected that most will be filled
by June 2009.

The Bank also continued to take steps to
decentralize staff to field offices (FOs) and
to recruit local staff in the field. In this connection, the Bank recruited 65 new staff
for the 23 FOs that were operational in
2008. This increased the number of locally
recruited FO staff from 204 in 2007 to 269
at year-end 2008. Furthermore, 2 new HR
instruments were rolled out in 2008: (i) a
results-focused performance management
system with elements of multi-rater assessment, which will be used in the 2009 evaluation and (ii) the Compensation and Benefits
Framework 2008-2012, which is geared
‘oward attracting and retaining a productive and skilled workforce.

n line with the results of the 2007 Staff
Survey, actions were taken in 2008 to make
he Bank a more family-friendly organizaion and to provide a conducive work environment. These include the introduction
of spousal employment, staff promotions
ased on individual performance, increased
staff compensation, and the Medical Plan
reform. An improved Onboarding program
0 facilitate the integration of new staff and
a streamlined Management and Leadership
Development Program to improve behavioral and people management skills were also
rolled out. The Staff Retirement Plan has
een adjusted to reduce penalties for early
retirement, encourage staff mobility, and
offer better protection to survivor spouses.

 

 

ADMINISTRATIVE
SERVICES

During the year, the Bank's Administrative
Services launched a Corporate Environmental

“Footprint” initiative, to assess the environmental impact of the Bank’s activities.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
was also concluded with the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), to better leverage established expertise in the Bank's
undertakings and initiatives.

In its efforts to provide better services,
the Bank installed a new state-of-the-art
reproduction center, which is expected to
generate savings of about UA 200,000 per
year. Another innovation that is expected to
yield cost and time savings is the travel card,
which has been recently piloted. In addition to facilitating the processing of mission
requests, it will allow more flexibility in the
payment of mission-related expenses.

In support of the Bank's decentralization
program, new premises were identified
and refurbished in Ethiopia, Egypt, and
Senegal.

INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY (ICT)
MANAGEMENT

In 2008, the Bank upgraded its telecommunications infrastructure to support its decentralization process, which requires high-quality
telecommunications between the FOs and
the TRA in Tunis. Most field offices (19 out of
the total of 23) as well as the TRA are now
connected to the new system.

The key ICT activities and applications in
2008 included the following:

¢ The Case Management System application was developed for the Integrity and
Anti-Corruption Division.

¢ Anautomated country risk rating system
was installed for country economists in
the Bank. The system will be used for:
(i) the evaluation of appropriate country
credit limits to inform individual coun

¢ The e-recruitment system on SAP was
completed and activated for Human
Resources management.
¢ The Data Platform for dissemination of
macroeconomic data on RMCs was comleted for use by country economists in
he Bank.
¢ The Bank's online consultants’ registration system (DACON) was redesigned to
make it more user-friendly.

 

EVALUATION OF
OPERATIONS

Internal evaluations of the Bank’s lending
and nonlending operations have 2 main
objectives. First, they provide a systematic assessment of the Bank's performance
in attaining expected development outcomes. Second, they identify factors that
hinder or enhance successful operations, so
that these lessons can be applied in future
operations.

In 2008, the Bank Group and IFAD launched
a joint evaluation of their agriculture and
rural development operations in Africa.
This has produced several thematic reports
assessing sector performance and the role
of partnerships for enhanced performance.

In the education sector, a review was carried
out on the effectiveness of the Bank's assistance over the past 30 years. Field visits were
made to Benin, Mozambique and Uganda
in the course of the review. The preliminary
findings show an improvement in the Bank's
performance over time, despite some concerns regarding efficiency and sustainability
of the interventions.

Annual Report 2008Chapter 002 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

The Bank completed a major evaluation of
its assistance to Ethiopia over the period
1996-2007. Ethiopia is one of the highest
recipients of ADF resources and is therefore an important case to consider. The
evaluation reveals a mixed picture. While
the Bank's contribution to macroeconomic
stabilization was substantial, its support
to economic growth and poverty reduction
was inefficiently delivered, with relatively
modest results. The results of the evaluation were taken into account during the
midterm review of the Ethiopia program at
he end of 2008, which proposed a range
of improvements.

n addition, evaluations were carried out o
he performance of the Joint Africa Institu
(JAI) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). Th
evaluation of the JAI found that there wai
a need to strengthen the approach taken
raining and capacity building, and that closer collaboration was required among the JAI
artners (the African Development Bank, the
World Bank, and the International Monetary
Fund). The partners have since undertaken to intensify their efforts under the JAI.
Regarding the NTF, the evaluation found significant underutilization of the resources and
recommended greater flexibility and ease of
access in their use. The Nigerian authorities
ave since approved a more flexible and
results-oriented approach.

Rules, approved in May 2008, have
been harmonized with those of the
World Bank, and aim to streamline the

of RMCs' project implementation personnel as well as Bank staff on the auditing of
Bank-funded projects.

The Bank Group continues to undertake
investigations into allegations of fraud, corruption, and other misconduct relating to its
activities. The Bank received 31 complaints in
2008 (the same number received in 2007),
of which 14 were referred or reviewed and
closed. In addition, the Hotline received
179 advance fee fraud complaints in 2008
(compared to 146 in 2007), which were
referred to the Security Services to follow
up. All complaints are reviewed (preliminary inquiry) and a determination is then
made whether or not to proceed to a full
investigation.

 

Other activities undertaken in this area in
2008 included integrity awareness campaigns for 8 departments/units and 1 field

MANAGEMENT

During 2008, the Bank undertook a series of

initiatives to improve

delivery of procurement

and financial management (PFM) services
while minimizing fiduciary risks and enhancing accountability. In order to address the
observed weaknesses, PFM functions were

strengthened to impr:

Operations Complexes in the review of procurement documents throughout the project
cycle. The Bank also stepped up efforts to
help RMCs improve their financial management systems.

Other activities included training in procurement for Bank staff and RMC officials.
Fourteen national project implementation
workshops and seminars were organized for
RMC officials, and 7 business opportunitiesseminars were held for government officials
and private sector representatives. During
the year, the Bank continued to cooperate
closely with the World Bank in the preparation of Country Procurement Assessment
Reports (CPARs).

CORPORATE
COMMUNICATIONS

During 2008 work continued on the redesign
of the Bank's website (www.afdb.org) to
update it and make it more reader-friendly.
The Bank Group also extended its range of
outreach products and services to broaden
the institution's corporate communications
platforms, including manuals and guidebooks for staff. Efforts were ongoing to
improve the coverage of Bank events, such
as the 2008 Annual Meetings and conferences in Maputo, while the daily newsletter,
Bank in Action, continued to inform staff of
atest developments.

During 2008 the Bank continued to streamine the operations of its Public Information
Center, multimedia center (Mediatheque),
he graphics and design unit, web-content
management program, and staff media training modules.

n line with the Bank Group's decentralizaion policy, efforts are being made to help
FOs team up with appropriate stakeholders
in setting up joint Development Information
Centers, similar to the one already estabished in Zambia.

 

GENERAL COUNSEL AND
LEGAL SERVICES

In the course of 2008, the Bank's Legal
Services function continued to provide innovative, client-oriented services in advancement of the Bank's development mandate
and Medium Term Strategy. One notable

achievement was the approval for the establishment of an African Legal Support Facility
(ALSF). This Facility will be an international
organization with a separate legal personality from that of the Bank, geared to support
RMCs in the defense of their interests against
vulture funds litigation that could erode the
benefits of HIPC and MDRI debt forgiveness.
The Facility will also enhance their capacity
for the negotiation of complex commercial
contracts in the extractive industries and
other sectors of their economies.

Similarly, by drafting the legal instruments
extending the term of the Nigeria Trust Fund,
as well as the creation of the African Fertilizer
Financing Mechanism (AFFM), the Bank has
established vehicles providing concessional
resources to its least developed RMCs to
maximize its support.

 

 

Notable activities in the work program delivered were: (i) Amendments to the Rules governing the election of the President of the
Bank; (ii) preparation of documentation
relating to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’s
application for membership of the Bank and
Fund; (iii) providing advice and documentation for implementation of the 2008 borrowing program, including the successful
completion of the Bank's first New Zealand
Dollar bond issue; (iv) legal instruments for
other resource mobilization activities, including the establishment of trust funds and special funds such as the Congo Basin Forest
Fund; (v) providing advice on legal aspects
of the staff Compensation and Benefits
Framework, the Staff Retirement Plan, and
the new performance management system;
(vi) providing legal advice on the Bank’s
responses to the international financial crisis and the food crisis; (vii) assisting the
Operations Complexes in connection with
sovereign and nonsovereign guaranteed
transactions; (viii) legal advice in relation
to the design and implementation of mechanisms for the Bank's engagement with MICs

THE ADMINISTRATIVE
TRIBUNAL

The Administrative Tribunal of the African
Development Bank is an independent organ
of the Bank. It is the ultimate forum to which
members of staff can appeal to contest an
administrative decision on grounds of nonobservance of his/her contract of employment, conditions of employment, or summary dismissal. The Tribunal’s decisions are
binding, final, and without appeal. They are
based on its Statute and Rules of Procedure,
the internal texts of the Bank (the Agreement
Establishing the Bank, the Staff Rules and
Regulations, Presidential Instructions and
Directives), the law of the international civil
service, including the jurisprudence of other
international administrative tribunals, and
general principles of international administrative law.

 

In accordance with its Statute, the Tribunal
comprises judges who are nationals of Bank
Group member states and appointed by the
Board of Directors. In 2008, 5 judges were
in office: Prof. Maurice Glele Ahanhanzo
(President); Justice Lombe Chibesakunda
(Vice President); Prof. Christian Tomuschat
(Member); Prof. Yadh Ben Achour (Member);
and Justice Salihu Modibbo Alfa Belgore
(Member). In its 10 years of existence, the

Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

During 2008 the Bank continued to implement reforms to scale up its development effectiveness at both institutional and operational
levels. Furthermore, in alignment with its Medium Term Strategy 2008-2012, it intensified the selectivity of its operations, by targeting infrastructure, the private sector, governance, and regional integration. Other focal areas included agriculture and food security,
social and human development, gender mainstreaming, environmental sustainability, and support to middle-income countries (MICs)
and fragile states. This chapter also reviews the Bank's resource mobilization activities and collaboration with development partners
in furtherance of the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

INTRODUCTION

he Bank's overarching mission of poverty
reduction and sustainable economic growth
or its RMCs continued to guide Bank Group
operations throughout 2008. However, during the year 3 global crises — namely, the
ood crisis, high volatility in the price of crude
oil, and the international financial turmoil —
seriously impacted the macroeconomic situaion in Africa, requiring an effective and swift
response from the Bank Group.

Although the price of crude oil had stabilized
y year-end, at a third of the 2008 peak of
over US$ 140 (UA 91) per barrel, the credit
crunch continued to pose a serious threat
‘© growth worldwide. From Africa’s perspecive, spillover effects could take the form of
reduced demand for Africa's exports, plus a
reduction in foreign aid, trade credits, and
FDI. In addition, the economic slowdown in
he OECD countries will pose a threat to the
growth performance and poverty reduction
achieved in Africa over the past 10 years.
Moreover, the impact of the food crisis on
Africa is forcing a re-examination of the performance and potential of the agricultural
sector to address poverty and malnutrition
in the short term, and to ensure sustainable
food security in the long term.

 

 

 

 

 

All these global macroeconomic issues affect
the strategic thrust of the Bank Group and the
prioritization of its operational resources for
maximum impact. In this respect, the Bank
Group approved its Medium-Term Strategy
(2008-2012) in late 2008, based on lessons
learned and extensive consultations with its
many and diverse shareholders throughout

Annual Report 2008

the year. The Strategy aims to equip the Bank
with a framework to respond to the more
stringent international credit conditions, coupled with a rapidly evolving international aid
architecture. The Bank will increase selectivity,
with a particular operational focus on infrastructure, the private sector, governance, and
higher education. In this context, there will
be increased engagement in and support for
regional integration, middle-income countries,
fragile states, and agriculture. Knowledge
generation, climate change, and gender will
be mainstreamed into all the Bank Group's
operations. The broad agenda will be one of
quality assurance, a greater focus on delivery, measuring development results (through
targets and indicators), improving portfolio
quality, and accelerating implementation.

In order to leverage its limited resources and
to scale up the development impact of its
operations, during 2008 the Bank continued to pursue strategic initiatives in concert with its development partners. These
include Harmonization, Alignment, and
Managing for Results (HA & MfR); the
Water Initiatives; the New Partnership for
Africa's Development (NEPAD); the African
Fertilizer Financing Mechanism (AFFM); and
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI). Delivering on the objectives of the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and
the Accra Agenda for Action is a key objective
of the institution and will require enhanced
harmonization and closer collaboration with
traditional partners, key emerging donors, and
various stakeholders in RMCs. In addition, the
Bank is continuing its institutional reforms to
scale up its effectiveness, as detailed below.

 

DEVELOPMENT
EFFECTIVENESS AND
MANAGING FOR RESULTS

Measuring

Institutional Reforms

During the year, a Bank-wide taskforce was
organized to formulate a concerted Action
Plan on Results (APR) to strengthen the Bank's
focus on Managing for Development Results
(MfDR). The APR outlines 5 priority areas of
action: (i) ensuring quality at entry for strategies and operations; (ii) instilling a resultsoriented supervision culture; (iii) enhancing
learning and accountability through evaluation; (iv) improving data and systems for
results reporting; and (v) accelerating decentralization for better results on the ground.

To further enhance the Bank's capacity, a new
Quality Assurance and Results Department
(ORQR) was established in July 2008. The
functions of this department include: (i) ensuring better quality-at-entry for the Bank's operations and improving the institutional capacity for reporting on results; (ii) promoting sustainable development by ensuring compliance
with environmental and social safeguards
policy requirements; and (ii) assuming overall leadership for the Bank's results agenda.

 

Activities undertaken in 2008 included an
awareness-raising campaign on the results
agenda priorities; introduction of more
results-oriented formats; and the development of standard sector outputs and outcomes indicators. The indicators will be used
as part of a strengthened reporting system
to record and aggregate results across
operations to ensure more regular report-ing. The Bank also continued its support
to the African Community of Practice for
Management on Results.

During the year, the Results Measurement
Framework as a tool for monitoring development effectiveness was rolled out. One set of
indicators measures progress at the country
level, while the second set monitors internal
institutional effectiveness. Performances to
date reveal improved portfolio quality at
entry, as demonstrated by a decline in the
number of problematic projects. The delegation of more power to the field offices
has contributed to improvements in project
supervision as well as enhanced harmonization with partners in RMCs.

Development Effectiveness
through the Paris
Declaration Commitments

In April 2008, the Bank held a 2-day
Preparatory Consultative Workshop in
Kigali, Rwanda, to prepare RMCs for participation in the Third High-Level Forum on
Aid Effectiveness (HLF-3), held in Accra in
September 2008. The workshop was organized by the AfDB in partnership with the
Governments of Ghana and Rwanda and
with support from DFID, the World Bank,
UNDP, and OECD-DAC. Its aim was to facilitate discussion and build consensus on how
to improve aid effectiveness and development impact in the continent. Another objective of the workshop was to assist RMCs with
their input into the Accra Agenda for Action
(AAA), which was a major output of the HLF
and which the Bank is currently in the process of implementing (see Box 3.1).

Although the Bank has made some progress
in meeting the Paris targets, it will need to
step up its performance over the coming
years. On the positive side, it has made some
progress in avoiding parallel implementation units and in the use of country financial
management/procurement systems. In this
context, the amendment made by the ADF
Deputies to the “rules of origin” for ADF

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

Box 3.1: The Accra Agenda for Action (AAA)

On September 2-4, 2008, ministers of developing and donor countries and heads of
multilateral and bilateral development institutions met in Accra, Ghana for the Third
High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness. The Bank worked closely with the Government
of Ghana and other development partners in the organization of the Accra High-Level
Forum and contributed to the deliberations and successful conclusions of the Forum.
After 3 days of far-reaching discussions, the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) was formally adopted, with the objective of accelerating and deepening implementation of
the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

The opening message of the AAA is that this is a moment of opportunity for Africa.
The ministers declared that they are as committed as ever to eradicating poverty and
to promoting peace and prosperity by building stronger, more effective partnerships
that will enable developing countries to realize their development goals. Progress has
undoubtedly been made over the past decade or so, but 1.4 billion people — most of
them women and girls — still live in extreme poverty. Access to safe water and healthcare remains a problem and new global challenges — food shortages, volatile fuel
prices, and climate change — threaten the advances made by many countries. Moreover,
progress has been uneven across countries and across the indicators. Consequently, to
meet the MDGs, much more needs to be done, not only to raise the level of aid but to
address in a systematic and coherent way the other issues of democracy and human
rights, gender equity, social progress, and environmental sustainability.

The AAA highlights 3 major challenges that need to be addressed:

(i) Strengthening country ownership is key. Governments need to take a stronger
leadership role and donors, for their part, need to support them in this process by
respecting countries’ priorities, investing in their human resources and institutions,
and making use wherever possible of country systems to deliver aid.

(ii) Building more effective and inclusive partnerships. There is a need to fully harness the skills and experience of all actors in the new development landscape —
bilateral and multilateral donors, middle-income countries, global funds, the private
sector, and civil society organizations. As part of this process, donors must avoid
duplicating initiatives and thereby fragmenting aid resources. Complementarity of
assistance is the guiding principle.

(iii) Achieving development results — and openly accounting for them. This precept lies
at the heart of the Agenda to make a positive impact on people's lives. In order to
do this, ministers stressed the need for donors to untie their aid to the maximum
extent possible and to increase the medium-term predictability of aid flows.

The AAA concludes by stressing the continued high-level political support required
to move the Agenda forward. It requests the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness to
continue monitoring progress on implementing the Paris Declaration and the AAA, in
preparation for the Fourth High Level Forum to be held in 2011. Finally, it articulates
a heartfelt desire for a future “based on a shared commitment to overcome poverty,
a future in which no countries will depend on aid.”

countries will allow the Bank to participate
in pooled funding mechanisms with other
donors. Furthermore, additional refinements
are being made to the operations business
processes to achieve improved results in
these and other targets. Some of these measures include: (i) improving the timely disbursement of resources committed for individual programs and projects; (ii) making all
conditions public linked to disbursement; and
(iii) providing regular and timely information
on rolling 3-year expenditure and/or financing plans. The Bank has also put in place a
mechanism for coordinating, monitoring,
and reporting on corporate and country level
outcomes, including self-monitoring of its
progress toward the Paris targets.

March 2008 saw the publication of the
Common Performance Assessment System
(COMPAS) report for the year 2007. The
purpose of COMPAS is to provide a platform
where the 6 members of the MDB Working
Group on Managing for Development Results
(MfDR) may jointly report on their own performance toward becoming results-based
management institutions. The 6 institutions
comprise the AfDB, AsDB, EBRD, IDB, IsDB,
and WB.

Decentralization: Increasing
the Country-Level Focus
During the year, the Bank undertook an
assessment of the impact of the Bank’s
decentralization strategy. The assessment
reveals that the expansion in the numbers
of field offices (FOs) plus the delegation of
authority for some Bank activities from the
TRA to the FOs, has had an overall positive
impact. It has contributed to broadening
and deepening country dialogue and ownership; enhanced management of the Bank's
portfolio and operations; accelerated the
processing of disbursements and procurement documents; improved the quality of
project supervision and the timely submission of project progress reports and audit
reports; and led to an increase in the volume
of operations.

Annual Report 2008

The study also shows that the increased
Bank presence at country level is positively perceived by governments and development partners alike. Bank dialogue with
governments in the respective countries has
improved as a result of frequent field staff
support in the preparation of PRSPs, National
Development Plans, CSPs, and in economic
and sector work (ESW). Heightened presence in the field has also led to greater
harmonization of efforts with development
partners, and increased interaction with
the private sector, civil society, and regional
organizations.

INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE

Sub-Saharan Africa's average growth rates
of 5-6 percent over the past 5 years have
placed a considerable strain on the continent's antiquated infrastructure. Bottlenecks
in power generation, port efficiency and
capacity, and deteriorating road and rail networks have been identified as key constraints
on the continent's sustainable economic
growth. It has been estimated by the Africa
nfrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD)
hat Africa's infrastructure requirements over
he next decade will amount to over US$ 40
billion (UA 26 billion). Although investment
generally in African infrastructure had begun
‘0 show an upward trend over 2000-2007,
he current turmoil in the financial markets is
being reflected in a sharp decline of capital
inflows to the continent, which will have a
debilitating effect on African efforts to bridge
he infrastructure deficit.

he Bank Group is fulfilling a counter-cyclical
role in this respect by continuing to invest
eavily in infrastructure at a time of a general credit shortage in the financial markets. Approvals for infrastructure projects
as at end-December 2008 amounted to UA
1.41 billion, representing 44.5 percent of
all Bank Group loan and grant approvals
for the year — the largest sectoral allocation.

 

 

 

According to the subsectoral breakdown,
ransportation received the largest portion,
ollowed by power supply, then water and
sanitation (see Figure 3.1). This confirms the
institution's continued focus on infrastrucure development as an engine of growth
or its RMCs.

he infrastructure projects approved in 2008
included national road projects in Burkina
Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, and Tunisia, in addiion to a multinational road project (Burundi/
Rwanda) that supports regional integration;
national power projects in Egypt, Ghana,
Guinea, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Tunisia, and
Uganda, as well as a multinational power
interconnection project for Ethiopia/Djibouti
and another for the countries of the Nile
Equatorial Lakes region; a major port construction project in Djibouti, and water supply and sanitation projects in Liberia, Mali,
Malawi, Mauritania, Morocco, Tanzania, and
Tunisia. The profiles of these and all other
projects approved in 2008 are presented at

Box 3.2: Evaluation of the Addis Ababa International Airport Development Project in Ethiopia

 

Objective: To increase the traffic-handling capacity of the Addis Ababa airport and to improve safety levels by constructing a new
runway, taxi lanes, upgraded apron areas, runway drainage and airport facilities.

Bank’s Role: ADF loan of UA 17.1 million. (The engineering designs for the airport had been funded through a previous ADF loan
of US$ 2.7 million.)

Total Project Cost: UA 26.0 million.

Timeline: Commencement 1997; completion 2004.

Outcomes: The airport achieved its expected outcomes in the following areas and can therefore be deemed a successful project:

Marked expansion in the capacity of the airport to handle both domestic and international flights;

Significant reduction in aircraft movement times — particularly taxi-in and taxi-out times;

Increase in international passenger traffic, from approx. 8,000 commercial flights in 1999 to around 14,500 flights in 2005; the
annual growth rate of international traffic rose from 5.3 percent in 1994-2002 to 13.3 percent in 2003-2005.

The Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) and the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) assessed at completion were about
30 percent, which was significantly higher than calculated at project appraisal stage (23 percent).

Alignment to Bank's Strategic Objectives

Demonstration Effect: The Bank fulfilled a dual role in the project. First, it acted as a cofinancier by contributing UA 17.1 million to the
total project cost. Second, its participation in the project served a demonstration effect, providing comfort to other potential investors
and acting as a catalyst to mobilize resources.

Alignment to Bank Priorities: The project focused on 2 key pillars of Bank operational strategy — namely infrastructure and regional integration. The Bank recognizes infrastructure as being crucial to sustainable growth — both economic and social — in its RMCs. Infrastructure builds
a business-enabling environment; it encourages both domestic and international investment and so spurs GDP growth. With respect to the
regional integration aspect, plans are underway to develop the airport further into a regional hub for continental and international traffic.

Alignment to National Objectives: This was a high-profile project for the Government, in line with national objectives to improve
infrastructure and boost sustainable economic growth.

The Water Initiatives

Water is critical for economic development,
health, and social welfare. It is also vital in
ensuring environmental sustainability and
‘ood security. The Bank therefore continues
‘0 place a very high priority on helping its
RMCs to meet the MDG water targets. To
his end, the Bank channels some of its support through 3 complementary water initiaives — the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
nitiative (RWSSI), the Multi-Donor Water
Partnership Program (MDWPP), and the
African Water Facility (AWF), as shown in
Box 3.3 below.

n 2008, a total of UA 236.8 million was
approved for 9 Bank Group projects and
programs in the water and sanitation secor, in addition to funding from the 3 water
initiatives.

 

DEEPENING PRIVATE
SECTOR INVESTMENT

Private sector operations amounted to UA
901.2 million in 2008 (see Figure 3.2). The
private sector program for the year concentrated on infrastructure, with a special focus
on geographical diversity (regional integration) and the inclusion of low-income countries (see Figure 3.3).

With regard to low-income countries, the private sector provided equity participation to
the Access Bank of Liberia and Advans Banque
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
to support financial intermediation in these
countries, particularly to help micro entrepreneurs, many of whom are women. In addition,
several low-income countries benefited from
regional/multinational operations through
lines of credit (LOCs) extended to the West
African Development Bank (BOAD) and to the
PTA Bank for East and Southern Africa.

In terms of the sectoral distribution of private
sector operations, financial intermediation
accounted for the largest share of privateOperational Priorities Chapter 003

Box 3.3: The Three Water Initiatives

1. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)

The RWSS|I is a flagship Bank intervention, with the overall objective to extend safe water and basic sanitation coverage to 80 percent of the rural dwellers by 2015 at an estimated cost of UA 9.22 billion. Since the start of RWSSI in 2003, 20 operations have been
approved with total financing of UA 1.40 billion, of which the Bank contributed UA 549.9 million from ADF resources, UA 48.7 million
from the RWSSI Trust Fund, and leveraged the remaining UA 0.80 billion from other donors, governments, and beneficiaries.

The rural population served with a safe water supply through the RWSSI increased from 1.2 million in 2003 to 3.3 million people by
the end of June 2008, and those served with improved sanitation increased from 600,000 to 1.7 million during the same period. In
2008, UA 24.39 million was approved from the RWSSI Fund for projects in 7 countries, plus one multinational project.

2. The Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP}

The MDWPP was established by the Bank jointly with the Netherlands, Danish, and Canadian governments to operationalize the 2000
Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy. The funds pledged as at end December 2008 for the program amounted to
UA 8.5 million, while the paid-up amount was UA 5.7 million. By end-September 2008, the program had disbursed approximately
UA 3.7 million.

The major activities financed under this program in 2008 included the following:

¢ the “First African Water Week” hosted by the Bank in Tunis in March 2008;

the assessment of IWRM planning in 12 Eastern African countries;

an assessment study “Can Africa Achieve the Sanitation MDGs?"; and

several studies on water governance and the impact of climate change on ecosystems.

3. The African Water Facility (AWF)

The African Water Facility (AWF) seeks to mobilize and distribute resources for the sector at the national and transboundary levels.
The Facility’s 3-year Operational Program has been updated for 2009-2011 and requires UA 125.6 million to implement. As at endDecember 2008, the AWF had secured UA 48.8 million in pledges, leaving a shortfall of UA 76.8 million. During the year, 14 operational activities were approved, amounting to UA 18.1 million, in support of projects in 11 countries and 4 subregions. The largest
share of the approved projects went to West Africa (38 percent); followed by East Africa (34 percent); multinational (19 percent), and
North Africa (9 percent). The AWF 2009-2011 Program will require average annual approvals at more than double the 2008 level.

sector approvals (50 percent), followed by
industry (31.0 per cent), infrastructure (14.0
percent), agriculture (3.0 per cent), and multisector (2.0 per cent) (see Figure 3.4).

One example of a transportation PPP intervention approved in 2008 was for the upgrading and rehabilitation of the Lekki to Epe
Toll Road in Nigeria (UA 52.4 million). A key
project approved in 2008 for the industry sector was the Hasdrubal Oil and Gasfield Project
in Tunisia (UA 96.3 million). The single largest
approval for a private sector operation in a
low-income ADF country during 2008 was the
Guinea Alumina Project (UA 134.4 million).

In partnership with USAID, the Bank also
approved a number of partial credit co-guarantee facilities (PCGFs) to financial intermediaries, such as the CRDB Bank in Tanzania
(UA 4.9 million) and Zanaco Bank in Zambia
(UA 14.9 million). These interventions aimed
to deepen local financial markets by supporting SMEs’ access to finance. During the year,
the Bank also continued to approve investments in equity funds, such as the multinational Third Emerging Capital Partners Africa
Fund II (UA 32.1 million), which will target
high-growth companies in the infrastructure,
industrial, and natural resources sectors.

The Bank also played a key role in establishing the African Financing Partnership
(AFP), which aims at leveraging the market
skills and knowledge of development finance
institutions (DFls) in order to mobilize private
sector resources for large-scale projects, particularly infrastructure (see Box 3.4).

Ex-ante Additionality and
Development Outcome
Assessment (ADDA) of
Private Sector Operations
During the past 2 years, there has been significant expansion of private sector operations
(see Figure 3.2). The Bank, being mindful of
the need to ensure development effectiveness
(high quality at entry) of these interventions,
approved in September 2008 the innovative

Annual Report 2008

ADOA framework for the ex-ante evaluation
of its private sector operations. ADOA aims to
record and maximize the expected effectiveness of all forthcoming private sector operations, through an independent review conducted by the Chief Economist Complex. Two
ratings are systematically produced. The first
focuses on the expected development outcomes, measured along 7 dimensions ranging from economic performance to effects
on governments and macroeconomic resilience. The second looks at additionality, i.e.
the unique role and contribution of the Bank
and other DFls; this is measured by improvements in the commercial viability or in the
expected development outcomes.

Box 3.4: The African Financing Partnership

In September 2008, the African Financing Partnership (AFP) was established by the Bank,
following a year-long, multi-stakeholder dialogue. Designed as a concrete response to the
Monterrey Consensus, the AFP seeks to harness the potential of DFls to mobilize private
capital for African development. The aim of the AFP is to optimize their consolidated
market knowledge and project financing skills and thereby mitigate financial risks for
cofinanciers. The AFP will enhance the DFls’ strong counter-cyclical financing role in the
current credit crisis and seek to leverage DF financing alongside private capital flows.

Operations by Sector

 

Finance
Infrastructure 50%

The AFP’s 3-step approach involves:

1) Creating a partnership among a limited number of larger DFls that have strong
African experience, risk-taking resources, and the capacity to undertake due diligence and appraisal on behalf of others — the Promoting Partners — these include
AfDB, FMO, DEG, Proparco, EIB, IDC, IFC, and DBSA;

Expanding and systematizing the partnership by facilitating additional cofinancing
by interested smaller DFls in a second tier of Supporting Partners;

Formalizing the AFP structure by creating a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to act as
a conduit for the commitments of the partners. At this stage, further cofinanciers
would be invited to participate, known as the Commercial Partners.

i)

Ss

In Africa there is strong demand for financing from sectors such as infrastructure and
mining, which generally involve large capital injections. The AFP focuses on very large
projects (sometimes up to several billion dollars). The Africa Infrastructure Country
Diagnostic (AICD) study estimates that annual infrastructure investment needs in Africa
are in the region of UA 25.97 billion per year, with a further UA 25.97 billion per year
for maintenance and operational costs.

The AFP projects will be determined on a case-by-case basis; and in each case a DFI with
a comparative advantage will take the lead. It is anticipated that the partnership could
finance 10-20 projects in Africa, amounting to well above UA 6.49 billion per annum.The implementation of a one-year pilot of
ADOA started on October 1, 2008. During
the last quarter of 2008, 12 operations
were assessed at either the concept note
or appraisal phase. Six ratings were issued
for operations at the appraisal stage. The
expected development outcomes were good,
with an average rating of 2 on a scale ranging from 1 (excellent) to 5 (unsatisfactory).
The additionality was found to be positive, with an average rating of 1.83 ona
scale ranging from 1 (strongly positive) to 4
(none). The main positive development outcomes stemmed from private sector development and the effects on the RMCs’ budget.
The principal source of additionality was
improved project quality, followed by financial risk mitigation.

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC
AND GOVERNANCE
REFORMS

African countries have made significant
progress in improving governance practices, but considerable challenges remain. The
advances made by Africa are real, albeit
fragile and vulnerable, in the context of an
increasingly volatile international context.
The need to strengthen the institutions of
governance remains a pressing issue for
some RMCs and the Bank actively supports
its member countries in this endeavor. Public
sector reforms help to build a more conducive environment for domestic and foreign
investment and for private sector development, since they promote efficiency, accountability, and transparency in public finances
and in procurement practices.

The Bank Group actively supports the emergence of an African agenda for good financial governance. Good financial governance
provides the foundations upon which to
build effective, capable, and accountable
states, able to deliver basic services to the
poor. It is also critical to expand the fiscal
space to respond effectively to exogenous

shocks and volatile global markets, via more
efficient domestic resource mobilization and
more effective public expenditure.

The Bank Group has reaffirmed governance
as one of its core strategic pillars. In May
2008, the Bank approved the Governance
Strategic Directions and Action Plan for
2008-2012 (GAP), which defines the basis
for greater selectivity in the Bank's support
to governance reforms in Africa. The GAP
embodies a number of earlier Bank policies
and recommendations, including; (i) a policy
on governance; (ii) a review of governance
activities in 2006; and (iii) the recommendations emerging from the ADF Deputies’
Report of 2008 and the Report of the High
Level Panel (HLP).

In line with the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness (2005) and the Accra Agenda
for Action (2008) on the use and strength
Operational Priorities Chapter 003

ening of country systems, the Bank aims
to help RMCs to: (i) improve economic and
financial governance through increased support to revenue, budgeting and auditing
systems and standards (see Box 3.5); (ii)
reduce corruption risk through the strengthening of public procurement systems; (iii)
enhance transparency and accountability
in the management of natural resources
by acceding to the Extractive Industries
Transparency International (EITI); and (iv)
support parliamentary committees and
NGOs working to enhance efficiency, transparency and integrity in the management
of public finances.

The Bank Group supports economic and
financial governance reforms through a combination of instruments, including policybased lending, budget support, investment
projects, special initiatives, nonlending activities, and upstream analytical and advisory

Box 3.5: Supporting Public Financial Management Reform in Liberia

In 2008, the Bank approved the first budget support operation for Liberia, which is
classified as a fragile state. The overarching purpose was to support reform in the
country’s public financial management (PFM) systems and modernization of its revenue
administration. The program was financed from the Fragile States Facility (FSF) for an
amount of UA 9.0 million and a grant of UA 3.0 million from the Surplus Account of
the ADB to the African Food Crisis Response (AFCR) initiative.

Expected Outcomes: The operation will support the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS),
based on a medium-term PFM program aimed at achieving the following: (i) strengthened transparency in public finance management; (ii) increased efficiency in revenue
collection after modernization of revenue administration; (iii) deepened reforms to
improve the effectiveness of the budget; (iv) improved fiscal policy design; (v) enhanced
capacity for sustainable tax revenue generation; (vi) establishment of a one-stop-shop
facility in customs; (vii) reinforced procurement and audit systems in government; and
(viii) government measures to limit the social impact of rising food prices.

General Remarks: The program supports the government's macroeconomic strategy
to lay the foundations for rapid, inclusive, and sustainable growth. There have been
no similar operations by the AfDB in Liberia. The Government's impressive progress
in reconstructing the country following the civil war demonstrates its commitment to
sound economic policies, which significantly lowers the risks to the Bank of a budget
support operation of this kind. Furthermore, progress in the country’s growth trajectory
has resulted in better CPIA indicators, thus encouraging donors to support the public
financial management reform program.

work. These instruments are deployed at
the country, sectoral, and regional levels. In
2008, the Bank financed 17 governancerelated operations amounting to UA 682.0
million, which represents 21.5 percent of
total Bank Group loan and grant approvals
for the year.

At the sectoral level, the Bank continued to
concentrate on improving governance and
promoting integrity, particularly in high-risk
sectors such as infrastructure, by supporting
initiatives such as:

¢ The Investment Climate Facility for
Africa (ICF), which aims to strengthen the enabling environment for the
development of the private sector and
the investment climate in areas such as
property rights, taxation and customs,
and business registration;

e The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which aims to
improve transparency and accountability in the extractives sector. To date, the
Bank has contributed to the achievement
of EITI candidacy status of 3 countries
— Liberia, Madagascar, and the Central
African Republic — while Botswana's
candidacy is expected in early 2009.

¢ The Making Finance Work for Africa
(MFW4A) partnership to support the
efforts of African countries to strengthen their financial sectors as a means
of accelerating economic growth and
reducing poverty.

The Bank also lends its support to regional
and subregional institutions, initiatives and
networks that promote practices, standards
and codes of sound economic and financial
governance. The Bank support targets, in
particular, improvements in the following
areas:

¢ enhancing country peer review processes
and strengthening the review mechanism through the Africa Peer Review
Mechanism;

Annual Report 2008

¢ domestic revenue mobilization through
support to reforms in tax and customs
policy and administration, notably

PROMOTING REGIONAL
INTEGRATION

Major strides are currently being made
throughout Africa to scale up economic cooperation and regional integration.
Regional infrastructure is being developed
in a drive to overcome trade barriers, create
economies of scale, and increase national economic growth and competitiveness.
his is especially important given the current credit crisis and the forecast decline in
demand for many African export commodiies in the developed countries.

Loan and grant approvals for the Bank
Group's multinational operations in 2008
stood at UA 597.0 million, which is more
han triple the 2007 level of UA 193.3 milion. Figure 3.5 indicates that in 2008, the
largest share of multinational approvals went
‘0 transportation, followed by power supply,
inance, and multisector. Notable multinational projects approved during 2008 include: the
ransportation Facilitation Program for the
Nigeria-Cameroon Highway Link (BamendaMamfe—Abakaliki-Enugu Corridor) (UA
204.8 million); the Interconnection of Electric
Grids of the Nile Equatorial Lakes Region

 

(UA 99.8 million); Line of Credit and General
Capital Increase to PTA Bank (UA 60.6 milion); financial support package to BOAD
(UA 40.1 million); and equity participation
in the Emerging Capital Partners Africa Fund
| (EAF3) (UA 32.1 million).

n accordance with the mandate conferred on
e Bank by NEPAD, infrastructure development is a major operational priority, particuarly through the NEPAD Infrastructure Project
Preparation Facility (NEPAD-IPPF). In 2008,
e Bank provided a total of UA 5.7 million
under this Facility to fund the upstream preparation of 12 projects. The Bank is also involved
in the soft side of infrastructure development
rough capacity building, creation of enabling environments, and knowledge management. It organized 3 capacity development
workshops in 2008 with the participation
of the African Union Commission (AUC),
Regional Economic Communities (RECs),
United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (UNECA), African Capacity Building
Foundation (ACBF), donors, the private sector, and other stakeholders.

SUPPORT FOR
FRAGILE STATES

In 2008, the Boards of Directors approved 2
documents relating to fragile states: (i) the
Bank Group Strategy for Enhanced Engagement in Fragile States and (ii) the Operational
Guidelines of the Fragile States Facility (FSF).
These reflect the growing global consensus
on the need to increase aid and development
effectiveness in fragile states. The strategy
differentiates the Bank Group's support to
9 post-crisis/transitional countries from the
support provided to other categories of fragile
states, and from the standard development
assistance provided to all other RMCs. The FSF
was set up in March 2008 as an operationally
autonomous, special purpose entity within
the Bank. The objectives of the FSF are to provide more integrated financing framework for
eligible fragile states; to consolidate peace,
stabilize their economies, and contribute to

sustainable poverty reduction. The resource
envelope of the FSF in 2008 amounted to UA
511.4 million and comprises UA 408.4 million
allocated from the ADF-XI replenishment and
a carry-over of UA 102.9 million from the Post
Conflict Country Facility (PCCF).

To operationalize the FSF, a Fragile States
Unit (FSU) was established in the Bank in
July 2008 with the objectives of (i) facilitating
the dissemination, coordination, harmonization, and alignment of the Bank's work in
fragile states; (ii) providing supplementary
and advisory support to the Bank's regional
and sector departments working in fragile
states; (iii) running the secondment program
of capacity building and facilitating effective
learning amongst the roster of experts; and
(iv) helping to implement the arrears clearance programs. Total FSF approvals for 2008
amounted to UA 35.6 million for 3 countries:
Burundi (UA 12.0 million), Togo (UA 14.6
million), and Liberia (UA 9.0 million).

 

SUPPORT FOR
MIDDLE-INCOME
COUNTRIES (MICs)

n 2008, the Bank Group loan approvals for
middle-income countries (MICs) (excluding
multinational projects and programs) totaled
UA 1.10 billion. The financing source of these
approvals is the ADB window, the Bank's
nonconcessional lending arm. The secors benefiting from these approvals were:
infrastructure (46.0 percent), finance (27.0
percent), social (18.0 percent), multisector
(6.0 percent), and industry (3.0 percent) (see
Figure 3.6). This reflects the strong funding
demand from the MICs in the areas of infrastructure and financial sector development.
he significant portion allocated to the social
sector confirms the need to improve human
development indicators in the MICs.

 

n terms of geographic distribution, North
Africa received the largest volume of approvals (72.2 percent), well above the share for

the Sub-Saharan region. This distribution confirms the trend recorded during the previous
5 years (2002-2007), when North Africa
received 57 percent of total loan approvals.

While MICs in Africa have attained higher
per capita incomes and relatively diversified
economies, many face high unemployment
levels, vulnerability to external and internal
shocks, and pockets of extreme poverty. In
this context, one of the Bank’s primary goals
is to help build strong MICs that can serve
as regional hubs to catalyze growth.

To meet these challenges, in June 2008 the
Bank approved a Strategic Framework for
Enhancing Bank Group Support to MiddleIncome Countries. This strategy aims to position the Bank as the preferred partner of
MICs, based on a comprehensive approach
offering the following benefits: (i) the competitive range and pricing of the Bank's
financial products; (ii) improved delivery of
services through efficient business processes;
(iii) limited provision of concessional resources; and (iv) provision of advisory services.
The Bank will continue periodic price revisions of its financial products with a view
to providing more attractive lending terms,

Annual Report 200830

Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

subject to protecting the Bank's financial
integrity, particularly given the volatility of
market conditions.

In addition, the Bank organized a conference jointly with the World Bank in Cairo in
March 2008, to examine ways in which the
MDBs and other development partners could
better meet the needs of MICs.

AGRICULTURE AND
FOOD SECURITY

Agriculture remains a key economic sector
for most African countries. Indeed, Africa's
vulnerability in this area was brought into
focus by the global food crisis, which began
in early 2008. The sustainability of this sector
is further threatened by the effects of climate
change. Consequently, the Bank's operational priorities in the agriculture sector during
2008 targeted: (i) the provision of rural infrastructure for increased crop and livestock
production, (ii) the expansion of agribusiness
including agro-industry, (iii) capacity building; (iv) natural resources management and
adaptation to climate change.

The 2008 lending program for this sector
was characterized by an increase in project
approvals to middle-income countries (MICs),
in alignment with the Bank’s Medium Term
Strategy. Another notable feature of the program was an increased number of multinational operations in the natural resources
management area. This aligns to the new
emphasis on regional integration in order
to realize economies of scale and achieve
greater development impact.

In 2008, interventions in rural infrastructure were mainly in irrigation and drainage; rural roads and rural electrification;
development of markets and storage; and
agro-processing facilities. Total Bank Group
approvals in the agricultural sector (excluding those approved under the Africa Food
Crisis Response Facility) amounted to UA

Annual Report 2008

163.9 million for 15 approvals, of which
UA 153.4 million was in loans and UA 10.5
million in grants.

The Bank also continued to pursue strategic partnerships and to use a joint donor
coordinated programmatic approach. In this
respect, in 2008 the Bank continued to support the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Program (CAADP), which was
established in 2006 under the auspices of
NEPAD. A new initiative for 2008, the Africa
Food Crisis Response strategy, aimed specifically at addressing the issue of rising food
and agricultural input prices and ensuring
food security in RMCs (see below).

Africa Food Crisis Response
Increases in food prices have the potential
to reverse gains in poverty reduction and
progress toward the MDGs. Africa, in particular, has higher levels of poverty and the
poor are hit hardest as they spend a significantly large proportion of their income on
food. Food prices during 2008 were much
higher than in previous years, particularly
for cereals — maize, wheat, and rice. The
continent's cereal import bill is estimated to
have increased by 49 percent during 2008
compared to rises of 25 percent in Asia and
31 percent in Latin America.

Food-related demonstrations occurred in a
number of RMCs during the year, threatening
political stability. In response, some countries
adopted measures to either reduce prices
and/or increase access to food, which had
negative implications on fiscal and external
balances. Despite a general decline in global
food prices in the second half of 2008, prices
in African countries did not fall by the same
margin. This clearly shows that markets on
the continent are not as efficient as elsewhere in the world. For example, in some
East African countries, maize prices are still
36 percent higher than world levels. A similar
situation holds for West African countries,
where cereal prices continued to rise until
the last quarter of 2008. This demonstrates

 

 

hat Africa's situation is unique and requires
oth short-term and long-term responses
0 address its vulnerability to unstable food
prices and to achieve food security.

© address the problem, after due consulation with RMCs, other MDBs and international development organizations, the
Bank established in 2008 the Africa Food
Crisis Response (AFCR) initiative. This aims
0 reduce food poverty and malnutrition in
he short term and to ensure sustainable
‘ood security in the medium to longer term.
he AFCR will provide financial assistance to
RMCs to the tune of UA 472.0 million in the
short term and UA 1.4 billion in the medium
‘0 long term. It is expected that the estimated requirement of UA 1.4 billion will come
rom regular Bank instruments — ADB, ADF,
and cofinancing from development partners.
hese funds will focus on agricultural infrastructure, including water mobilization for
irrigation, rural access roads, and facilities
or reducing post-harvest losses.

nthe short term, the AFCR seeks to increase
he supply of food in RMCs through increased
rovision of agricultural inputs. Its approach
is to: (i) realign the existing agricultural
portfolio and restructure non-agricultural
projects, thereby releasing funds for the purchase of agricultural inputs to boost food
crop production; (ii) stabilize food prices
through the use of a budget support instrument to quickly disburse resources to RMCs
that have experienced drastically reduced tax
revenues and exports as a result of the crisis;
(iii) boost the use of the high-yield New Rice
for Africa (NERICA) seeds in suitable projects;
and (iv) allocate specific resources from the
Bank's Surplus Account to RMCs, particularly
some of the fragile states.

 

 

The AFCR's medium- to long-term measures will run over a period of 3 years and
adopt several approaches: (i) transformation
and revitalization of the agriculture sector
by adopting/adapting new technologies;
(ii) improved rural infrastructure; (iii) opera-tionalizing the African Fertilizer Financing
Mechanism (AFFM); (iv) increasing NERICA
tice production; (v) capacity building, policy
dialogue, and trade promotion; (vi) scaling
up private sector operations for food security; (vii) promoting agricultural research,
and (viii) the establishment of the Crisis
Response Facility.

The 5 countries that benefited from the
AFCR initiative in 2008 were Central
African Republic, Comoros, Burundi, Djibouti
and Liberia. In December 2008, the Bank
approved UA 10.5 million to help these countries tackle their growing food shortages.

Strategic Partnerships in
Agriculture

Collaboration in the agriculture sector takes
the form not only of cofinancing operations
and dialogue with RMCs, but also harmonizing interventions and operational procedures
with development partners. In this respect,
the Bank in 2008 worked closely with the

AU and ECA to establish the ClimDev-Africa
Program and Trust Fund for climate risk
management. Furthermore the Bank jointly
organized a workshop with the AU/NEPAD to
develop an Agricultural Expenditure Tracking
system. Other key meetings with partner
agencies included the following:

¢ Ministerial Conference on Water
for Agriculture and Energy (Libya,
December 2008). This conference
pledged to promote water development
throughout the continent to fully exploit
Africa's agricultural and hydro-energy
potential.

¢ AU-NEPAD Food Security Workshop
(Johannesburg, May 2008). This conference aimed to assist governments
to formulate an appropriate country
framework of food security interventions to boost food production, increase
the availability and access to food for
the most vulnerable, and cope with the
volatility in food prices.

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

PROMOTING SOCIAL
AND HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT

he Bank supports RMCs in their efforts to
develop human capital through strengthened
and effective education, health and social
systems in order to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and advance
economic development. In line with the
Medium Term Strategy, the Bank's main
‘ocus is on promoting higher education in
science and technology as well as technical and vocational training, with a special
emphasis on greater access for women.
Furthermore, the Bank finances well-targeted operations in basic education and
ealth in countries where it enjoys a comparative advantage. The special situation in
tagile states is also acknowledged by the
Bank, through its emphasis on developing basic socioeconomic infrastructure (e.g.
sanitation and water supply) in these lowincome countries.

 

 

Annual Report 2008Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

In 2008, UA 224.2 million was approved for
14 projects and programs in the social sector
by the Bank Group. The sectoral distribution
shows the predominance of the education
subsector (UA 119.1 million) followed closely by the health subsector (UA 89.6 million).

Notable approvals include UA 59.9 million

presents an evaluation of an earlier povertyreduction project in Ghana, which was successfully implemented from 1999-2005.

Box 3.6: Evaluation of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Project / Social Investment Fund

Objectives: To reduce poverty by increasing community access to basic social and economic infrastructure in 80 districts and to support the expansion of local microfinance operations.

Bank's Role: ADF loan of UA 11.0 million.
Timeline: Commencement 1999; completion 2005.

Outputs: The project was rated as “highly satisfactory” in its Project Completion Report, as it achieved the following outputs:

714 subprojects supported (out of a planned 1,000; the Government stepped in to finance the remaining 225 unfunded
projects);

Sectoral distribution of the beneficiary subprojects was as follows: 53 percent for school construction or upgrading; 20 percent for
agriculture; 16 percent for health and water & sanitation projects;

Approximately 350,000 students and 5,500 farmers benefited from the subprojects;

The 166 health projects resulted in improved access to health services for over 65,000 people;

Employment generated for local workers in the school construction programs;

Over 930 community-based organizations received basic project design and management training;

Approximately 12,200 people (at least 50 percent women) benefited from the small loans provided by the 42 microfinance institutions supported by the Social Investment Fund;

Almost 20,000 microfinance institutions benefited from the project, in line with projects at appraisal.

Alignment to Bank’s Strategic Objectives:

Social Impact: The Fund had a high social impact on the poor and contributed also toward achievement of the health and water-related
MDGs. It has also created a substantial number of jobs, both in building construction and in microfinance. The training provided to
community-based organizations has also strengthened capacity building in project design and management.

Poverty Reduction through Financial Intermediation: The project targeted the poorest segments of the population by channeling small
loans through the Social Investment Fund to micro enterprises. The Fund facilitated new business start-ups, in addition to providing
resources to expand businesses and buy capital equipment.

Enhanced Dialogue with Local Communities: A social fund approach was adopted in the project design, whereby communities identified, helped to design, and contributed to the implementation and supervision of projects. This empowering approach is fully in line
with the Bank's emphasis on increasing dialogue and ownership of projects at the grassroots level, which is crucial for their sustainability in the long term.

Alignment to National Objectives The project was aligned to the national approach to poverty reduction. The Government's own com
pletion report estimated that the project directly benefited approximately 1.15 million people (57 percent of whom were women),
and that this constituted 16 percent of the poorest segment of the population.

Annual Report 2008Efforts continue to be made to mainstream
social development across all Bank-funded
projects, for example to integrate health
aspects related to sanitation, waterborne
diseases, and safe water usage. Furthermore,
to support the decentralization exercise,
in 2008, 3 social sector specialists were
deployed to FOs to increase awareness of
the activities of the Bank in this area and to
improve monitoring and supervision of social
sector projects on the ground.

Emergency

Humanitarian Assistance

In 2008, 8 emergency humanitarian assistance operations were approved for 5 countries from the Special Relief Fund (SRF),
for a total amount of UA 2.5 million. This
assistance supported victims of flood,
drought, repatriation, post election crises
and those most severely affected by rising
food prices.

CROSSCUTTING
ACTIVITIES

Climate Change Risk
Management

Climate change has emerged as a serious
threat to sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction, the quality of life, and
political stability across the globe. A large
segment of Africa's population, especially
in SSA and in the rural areas of the middleincome countries, live in conditions of acute
“energy poverty.” In this regard, 2 challenges have emerged as priority concerns
to be addressed: (i) access to energy and
(ii) climate change risk management and
adaptation.

In response, the Bank approved in March
2008 The Clean Energy Investment
Framework (CEIF). This Framework sets a
comprehensive agenda for mainstreaming
clean energy options, promoting investment in energy access and cleaner energies,
and strengthening energy efficiency in all

major sectors of the economy. Furthermore,
through its partnership with the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), the Bank aims
to further strengthen the climate resilience
aspect of its operations.

At an institutional level, in July 2008 the
Bank approved a fine-tuning of its organizational structure, which resulted in the
creation of the Gender, Climate Change,
and Sustainable Development Unit (OSUS),
with a clear mandate to address these specific crosscutting areas and accelerate their
mainstreaming in the Bank's work.

Another notable event related to the climate
change agenda took place in June 2008. This
was the launching of the Congo Basin Forest

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

Fund in London by the UK Prime Minister,
Norwegian Prime Minister, and the Bank
Group President. The Bank is playing a major
role in supporting this new initiative and will
be hosting the Secretariat at its Tunis TRA
(see Box 3.7).

FINESSE Program: The Bank’s work in
renewable energy, and specifically as outlined in the CEIF has been operationalized
partly through the Dutch-funded Financing
Small Scale Energy Users (FINESSE) Program.
During 2008, FINESSE resources supported
the integration of renewable energy into current Bank activities, as well as the preparation of standalone projects through technical
and financial support to develop feasibility
studies in several RMCs.

Box 3.7: The Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF)

This multi-donor facility was launched in London in June 2008 by Prime Ministers
Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, Jens Stoltenberg of Norway, and the Bank
Group President, Donald Kaberuka. The President reiterated the Bank Group’s strong
commitment to the project through its acceptance to host the Fund on behalf of, and
in partnership with, the 10-member states of the Central African Forests Commission
(COMIFAC), comprising Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tomé and Principe,
Rwanda, as well as the UK and Norway.

The CBFF was set up to take action to protect the forests in the Congo Basin region.
These forests, the second largest rainforest in the world, are an essential resource providing food, shelter and livelihoods for over 50 million people. The forest region covers
about 2 million square kilometers, and is home to 10,000 species of plants, 1,000 species of birds, and 400 species of mammals. The CBFF will support transformative and
innovative proposals which will develop the capacity of the people and institutions of
the Congo Basin to manage their forests, find livelihoods consistent with the conservation of the forests, and reduce the rate of deforestation. The UN estimates that 66
percent of the rainforest will disappear by 2040 if the destruction is not halted.

The Fund will support activities/projects which complement particular aspects of the
COMIFAC convergence plan. The CBFF will work closely with Central African governments,
regional institutions (COMIFAC, ECCAS), technical partners, international donors, NGOs,
and the private sector. The Fund will be run by a Governing Council chaired by Professor
Wangari Maathai, a Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and the Rt. Hon. Paul Martin, former
Prime Minister of Canada. The Fund will be managed and disbursed by a Secretariat
hosted by the Bank Group in Tunis. The initial funding has come by way of a grant of
UA 94.6 million (GBP 100 million) from the British and Norwegian Governments.

Annual Report 2008Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

Conference of Parties (COP) Program:
During the year, the Bank continued to
support the COP, which in 2008 held the
Conference in Poznan, Poland. The COP is
the supreme body of the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and is responsible for ensuring
that international efforts to address climate
change are kept on track. As a side-event
to the Conference, the Bank jointly organized with the EBRD, the EIB, and the AsDB a
meeting to discuss climate change issues in
relation to natural resources management.
In preparation for the next Conference in
Copenhagen in 2009, the Bank is supporting RMCs to develop a common position on
many of the outstanding issues being negotiated, to articulate the African viewpoint,
with a particular emphasis on mobilizing
additional finance for RMCs.

Gender Mainstreaming

As previously mentioned, in July 2008 the
Bank established a unit (OSUS) dedicated
to accelerating the mainstreaming of crosscutting issues, including gender, into the
Bank's projects and programs. Through this
mandate, the Bank has intensified its focus
on the gender agenda.

The Bank's Gender Plan of Action serves as
the key document for gender mainstreaming.
In 2008, work continued on finalizing gender
mainstreaming checklists for the infrastructure sector, as well as for higher education,
science and technology and the health sector. Moreover project-specific Environmental
and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) were
reviewed by gender specialists to ensure that
gender issues had been sufficiently addressed.
Work also continued during the year in collaboration with the statistics function of the Bank,
to support sex-disaggregated data collection
and capacity building at the RMC level.

The Bank was also represented, together
with the AU and ECA, at various key international meetings and conferences during 2008
that focused on the broad gender agenda.

Enhanced Heavily

Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative:

Progress Report

The Bank mobilizes resources for HIPC debt
relief for the 33 eligible RMCs after they have
reached their decision and/or completion
points. During the year, the Bank approved
HIPC debt relief of UA 145.7 million (NPV
terms) at decision point for Liberia and UA
14.1 million (NPV terms) at completion point
for the Gambia. Thus total HIPC debt relief

approvals amounted to UA 159.9 million in
2008. As at end December 2008, 19 RMCs
had reached their completion points, 9 were
in the interim period (between decision and
completion point), and 5 were at the predecision point (see Figure 3.7).

As shown in Figure 3.8 and in Annex II-15,
total debt relief of UA 2.58 billion (US$
3.98 billion) in NPV terms, equivalent to
about UA 3.86 billion (US$ 5.94 billion) in
nominal terms, has been committed by the
Bank Group to the 33 RMCs under the HIPC
Initiative. The breakdown of costs by HIPC
status is shown in Figure 3.8.

The total resources for the ADF-XI cycle
amount to UA 5.76 billion, made up of UA
3.70 billion of donor contributions and UA
2.06 billion of the Advanced Commitment
Capacity (representing internally generated
resources). After adjustments for carry-over
resources from previous ADF replenishments,
total ADF-XI resources available amount to UA
5.90 billion. The amounts set aside from the
ADF-XI resources for the Fragile States Facility,
regional operations, and contingencies are
respectively: UA 408.4 million, UA 953.0
million, and UA 456.7 million. This leaves UA
4.08 billion available for allocation to the 40
ADF-eligible RMCs under the Performance
Based Allocation (PBA) system.

As at end-December 2008, UA 1.25 billion
(30.6 percent) of the available resources
under the PBA system had been committed. Of the resources for regional operations, UA 409.2 million (42.9 percent) had
been committed. The Fragile States Facility
was augmented with carry-over resources
of UA 102.9 million from the former Post

Conflict Country Facility, which raised its
funding level to UA 511.4 million. During
2008, UA 35.6 million (6.9 percent of total
resources) was committed from the FSF to
Burundi, Togo, and Liberia.

The Performance-based Allocation (PBA) system determines the amount of ADF resources
allocated to each of the 40 eligible RMCs,
while the Debt Sustainability Framework
(DSF) determines the country-specific financing terms in the form of loan, grant, or a
loan/grant combination. The DSF country
classification applied during 2008 is presented in Table 3.1.

PARTNERSHIPS
AND COOPERATION
ACTIVITIES

During 2008, the Bank continued to
strengthen strategic partnerships with various development actors, including bilateral
aid agencies, multilateral development institutions, African civil organizations, regional
economic communities (RECs), and private
sector organizations. Consultations were
held with representatives of all 18 bilateral
and several multilateral development partners of the Bank. These provided the opportunity to identify common areas of interest

and to discuss how best to move the African
development agenda forward.

The objective of the Bank's partnerships
and cooperation activities is to supplement
Bank Group lending and human resources
through the mobilization of financial inputs
and technical assistance, principally through
cofinancing, technical cooperation arrangements, and secondments. This approach is
fully in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness, which calls on the international
aid community to harmonize their activities at
all levels and to leverage their internal capacities to maximize results on the ground.

It is in this context that the Bank has been
undertaking a series of measures to better align its partnership activities with its
new strategic direction and core mandate.
The key precepts of the ongoing structural
reform are: to streamline and standardize
business processes; to establish a basic information management system; to build more
proactive communications with user departments and external partners; and to deliver a
marked qualitative improvement in staffing
and teamwork. As a result, the year 2008
witnessed notable progress, particularly in
the areas of trust fund management and
institutional partnership management, as
detailed below.

Annual Report 2008Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

Cofinancing Operations

During 2008, the Bank approved 31 cofinancing projects compared to 28 in 2007.
The total cost of these projects amounted to
UA 8.05 billion, compared to UA 7.47 billion in 2007, a rise of 7.8 percent. The Bank
Group's contribution amounted to UA 1.46
billion or 18.1 percent of the total, compared to UA 1.29 billion in 2007. The amount
invested by the Bank Group in cofinancing
projects in 2008 is the highest since the start
of its activities (see Figure 3.9).

During 2008, the Bank group mobilized UA
4.74 billion from its external partners to
cofinance 26 national projects and 5 multinational projects compared with UA 4.20
billion in 2007; a rise of 12.9 percent (see
Table 3.2). The volume mobilized in 2008
from multilateral and bilateral partners was
UA 4.60 billion compared to UA 3.53 billion
in 2007. Among the multilateral partners,
the main cofinanciers were: the World Bank,
the European Union (EU), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European

Investment Bank (EIB). The principal bilateral
cofinanciers were the United Kingdom, the
Netherlands, France, Sweden, Canada, Arab
institutions, Germany, Ireland, and Denmark
(see Figure 3.10).

In addition to contributions from multilateral and bilateral partners, a further UA
139.2 million was provided by private sector institutions, notably in 3 key projects: the
Derba Midroc Cement Project in Ethiopia;
the Doraleh Container Terminal Project in
Djibouti; and the Guinea Alumina Project
in Guinea (see Project Profiles at the end of
Chapter 4 for full details).

Local firms, governments and beneficiaries
played a key role by committing UA 1.85
billion to projects and programs in 2008,
which was a 7.5 percent decrease from 2007
when the local contribution stood at UA 2.00
billion. There were in addition unspecified
contributors.

The top sector to benefit from cofinancing
in 2008 was multisector, which rose sharply
to UA 6.20 billion (total project costs), compared to just UA 485.62 million in 2007. This
reflects the Bank's new selectivity and focus,
in line with its Medium Term Strategy, on
major investments to improve governance in
its RMCs and thereby enhance the business
environment. The next largest beneficiary
sector was infrastructure — transportation,
water supply and sanitation, and power —
which together accounted for UA 1.05 billion in total project costs. Industry, mining
and quarrying was the third largest sector in
terms of total project costs with UA 371.5
million (see Table 3.2).Table 3.2: Cofinancing Operations by Source and Sector, 2008

Bilateral Technical
Cooperation Activities

The Bank mobilizes and manages Technical
Cooperation Funds (TCFs) as well as in-kind
expertise (technical assistance, seconded
staff etc.) from donors to complement its
own resources. A proportion of the TCFs
goes to build the in-house capacity of the
Bank, such as the ongoing institutional
reforms. From the existing TCFs, a total of
UA 11.1 million was allocated to 49 activities in priority sectors of the Bank, namely,
infrastructure, governance, water, private
sector, regional integration, climate change,
and the results agenda. Furthermore, a total
of 22 Technical Assistance experts continued
to work with the Bank.

Including private sources such as commercial banks, export credits and unspecified sources.

0 achieve more effective management of
existing resources (single and multi-donor),
during 2008 the Bank continued to implement its Technical Cooperation Fund Reform
Policy (TCFRP), which requires the standardization and simplification of its internal processes and donor conditions. It also requires
he alignment of Bank policies with those
of other MDBs. For the single-donor or bilateral technical cooperation funds, the Bank
is seeking to ensure that the balance of the
rust funds established pre-TCFRP is fully utiized before September 2009. New resources mobilized during the year 2008 were
negotiated in line with the TCFRP, which
romotes multi-donor thematic funds, the
introduction of a standard administrative

 

fee of 5 percent, and the setting-up of a
minimum threshold of UA 0.7 million (US$
1.0 million) for single donor TCF and UA
1.3 million (US$ 2.0 million) for multi-donor
funds. Commitment level of all funds to individual activities without prior approval from
the respective donors stands at UA 64,923
(US$ 100,000) for single donor funds and
UA 324,618 (US$ 500,000) for multi-donor
funds, in accordance with the Delegation of
Authority Matrix of the Bank.

Bilateral Trust Funds

Under the bilateral trust funds, as at endDecember 2008, UA 13.3 million had been
approved for 55 activities, compared with UA
7.6 million in 2007, representing an increase

Annual Report 2008

37Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

of 75.0 percent. The United Kingdom was
the largest donor, approving UA 6.9 million
for governance, infrastructure, water, climate
change, and aid harmonization. The second
largest donor was Korea, which approved UA
2.1 million under the Korea—Africa Economic
Cooperation (KOAFEC) Trust Fund to finance
the 2nd KOAFEC Ministerial Conference in
Seoul, and workshops in Ghana, Korea, South
Africa and Tanzania. Japan, the third largest
donor, approved UA 0.78 million for poverty reduction strategy programs and census
activities in Burundi, Cameroon, Malawi, and
Rwanda. About 75 percent of the approved
UA 13.3 million in 2008 came from the new
untied trust funds established since 2007,
in line with the Bank's TCFRP.

Accelerated Use of Bilateral Trust Funds: The
steep increase in approvals under the bilateral trust funds is largely due to the introduction of annual work programming, and
a move away from ad hoc application and
processing. The Bank's quarterly e-dissemination of updated information on available trust
funds to user departments has also made a
positive contribution to the accelerated utilization and more efficient use of trust fund
resources. This, in turn, has resulted in better
integration and mainstreaming of trust funds
into the core operations of the Bank.

Untying of Trust Funds: In line with the TCFRP
approved in 2006, the Bank has been promoting the untying of trust funds to specific
conditionalities, in order to increase efficiency and flexibility in their usage. Since
mid-2007, untied bilateral trust funds have
been established with the UK (UA 12.3 million/GBP 13.0 million), Korea (UA 3.3 million
/US$ 5.0 million), Canada (UA 2.6 million/
C$ 5.0 million), Finland (UA 1.2 million/EUR
1.35 million), and Portugal (UA 1.81 million/
EUR 2.0 million), with an additional UA 13.0
million (US$ 20.0 million) pledged by Korea
for replenishment in early 2009. Portugal
has agreed to fully untie its fund, which is
a notable departure from the previous 100
percent tied fund.

 

 

Annual Report 2008

Multidonor Thematic Funds
In 2008, resource mobilization for multidonor thematic funds included: UA 5.7 million
(GBP 6.0 million) from the UK and UA 1.8
million (EUR 2.0 million) from Germany for
NEPAD-IPPF; UA 10.8 million (EUR 12.0
million) from Spain and UA 7.7 million (EUR
8.5 million) from Norway for the African
Water Facility.

Institutional Partnerships

At the Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (TICAD) in May 2008,
Japan pledged its second loan under the
Enhanced Private Sector Assistance (EPSA)
Initiative for an amount of US$ 300.0 million (UA 194.8 million). The bilateral loan
agreement was signed in Tunis in September
2008 and the first disbursement of US$ 30.0
million (UA 19.5 million) was drawn immediately afterwards. EPSA is a joint initiative,
conceived in 2005, between the Japanese
Government and the Bank to develop the
private sector in Africa for the sustainable
development of RMCs.

In 2008, the Bank's existing bilateral partnerships were formalized with Denmark,
Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands,
Norway, and Portugal. Moreover, the partnership horizon was expanded through the
forging of new institutional arrangements
with both traditional and new partners, in full
alignment with the Bank's new focal areas.
During 2008, MOUs were signed with:

 

¢ Emerging donors: China Exim Bank,
China Development Bank, the Korea
Ministry of Strategy and Finance (UA
129.9 million/US$ 200 million has been
earmarked by the countries for cofinancing), and the Korea Communications
Commission;

¢ Private sector: Microsoft Africa;

¢ Knowledge institution: Tsukuba University in Japan (for Higher Education, and
Science and Technology);

¢ — Traditional partners: |FAD, the Development Bank of Austria, BADEA, and the

Japan International Cooperation Agency;
and

e Libya: Under this MOU, an amount of
US$ 4.00 billion (UA 2.60 billion), representing 80 percent of the resources of
the Libyan Trust Fund, will be used to
cofinance projects in the private sector.
Of the remainder, up to US$ 750 million
(UA 486.9 million) will be utilized to
provide concessional financing to public
sector projects.

In 2008, the Bank prepared a database
of all the existing Bank Group partnership
agreements formalized since its inception,
covering 125 bilateral and 66 multilateral
agreements. This will serve as the Bankwide Partnership Management Information
System, which will facilitate a comprehensive review of progress and achievements
made under each partnership agreement.
As a part of this process, priority partners
will be identified to enable a more focused
strategic partnership agenda.

 

Other Activities: Partnership
Events and Business
Opportunities Seminars

In 2008, a number of key partnership events
were organized by the Bank, including: the
launch of a tripartite AfDB-DFID-France partnership in Tunis; a AfDB-WB joint conference
on MICs in Cairo; and the launch of an AfDBEC-WB tripartite partnership, held in Tunis.

The Bank also jointly organized, with the
Government of Korea and the Export-Import
Bank of Korea, the 2008 KOAFEC Ministerial
Conference, held in Seoul in October. The
Conference served as a platform to explore
opportunities for mutually beneficial economic cooperation between Africa and
Korea. It also witnessed the adoption of
the “Seoul Initiative”, laying the foundation
for the KOAFEC Action Plan 2009/10 to foster synergies between Africa and Korea, in
particular in the areas of: (i) infrastructure
and sustainable natural resources development; (ii) information and communicationstechnology (iii) human resources development; (iv) knowledge sharing; (v) agricultural and rural development; and (vi) green
growth partnership.

In December 2008, the Bank hosted an MDB
Roundtable on Trust Fund Management and
Cofinancing. Representatives of AsDB, EBRD,
EIB, IADB, IFC, IMF, and the WB discussed
such issues as the mainstreaming of trust
funds into the institutions’ core operations,

the tying and untying of funds, opportunities
of working with emerging donors, resource
mobilization, and the financial crisis.

Furthermore, during the course of the year,
8 business opportunities seminars (BOSs)
were organized for Argentina, Austria, Brazil,
Germany, India, Japan, the Netherlands and
South Africa. These had 2 principal objectives:
(i) to inform potential sponsors/co-investors
in the wider business community about the

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

opportunities available for participation in
Bank-funded projects and (ii) to familiarize participants and potential cofinanciers
with the Bank’s procurement systems. While
the benefits of these seminars are widely
acknowledged by both the countries and the
Office of the Executive Directors concerned,
potential measures to improve cost-effectiveness, such as the introduction of e-based
seminars, are being investigated.

Chapter 004 Bank Group Operations

This chapter focuses on the Bank Group's operations for 2008. First, a brief overview of the performance of Africa's economies during
the year is provided, focusing on the effects of the global financial crisis and on the Bank's response. Next, operations during 2008 are
analyzed for the Bank Group as a whole, and for its 3 windows (ADB, ADF, and NTF). The analysis includes approvals by financing instrument, sector, and subregion and presents cumulative figures since 1967 for each of the 3 windows. This is followed by a breakdown of
Bank approvals for each of the 5 African subregions in 2008. Profiles of all projects and programs approved by the ADB and ADF during
the year are presented at the end of the chapter.

MACROECONOMIC
CONTEXT

Africa's economic performance remained
robust in 2008 despite the volatility in oil
prices, relatively weak global demand, poor
crop harvests and droughts in some parts
of the continent, and the global financial
crisis. The real GDP growth of the continent
registered 5.7 percent in 2008, down from
6.1 percent in 2007. Notwithstanding the
reduction in the pace of economic activity,
the continent's growth performance in 2008
remained only marginally below the average
6.0 percent achieved over the past 4 years
(see Table 4.1). Nevertheless, the continent's
GDP per capita in nominal terms increased
to US$ 1,625 (UA 1,055) in 2008 from US$
1,370 (UA 889.5) in 2007. The rise was due

 

- Macroecono

 

mainly to the increase in oil prices which
continued up until the last quarter of 2008,
although it dropped significantly thereafter.

However, the real GDP growth rate in 2008
masked considerable variations across the
continent. Growth in oil-exporting countries continued to be driven largely by the
escalation in oil prices, while GDP growth in
oil-importing African countries was largely
attributable to prudent economic management, supported by public sector reforms
and external factors, including debt relief.
The fiscal position of the continent improved
from an average surplus of 1.9 percent of
GDP in 2007 to 2.8 percent in 2008. There
was, however, a rise in the continent's inflation rate, from 7.5 percent in 2007 to 11.6
percent in 2008.

c Indicators, 1990-2008

Although Africa has achieved impressive
growth in recent years, the real GDP growth
rate has consistently fallen short of the 7-8
percent required in many countries to achieve
the primary Millennium Development Goal
(MDG) of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015.

For the continent as a whole, the terms of
trade improved from 3.0 percent in 2007 to
15.6 percent in 2008. In addition to the higher price of oil which benefited oil-exporting
countries, the price of some non-oil commodities, particularly metals, also rose on the
world markets. Trade balance rose to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2008 from 5.7 percent of GDP
in 2007, and the positive current account
balance increased to 3.3 percent of GDP from
2.2 percent in 2007 (see Table 4.1).

Africa's total external debt declined from
23.6 percent of GDP in 2007 to 20.4 percent
in 2008. Similarly, debt-service as a percentage of exports fell from 7.0 percent to 4.7
percent over the same period.

The macroeconomic performance across the
subregions of the continent continued to
show marked variation in 2008 (see Table
4.2). East Africa attained the highest real
GDP growth rate of 7.3 percent, reflecting
improved agricultural production and prudent economic management. North Africa
achieved the second highest growth rate of
5.8 percent in 2008. Real GDP growth was
5.4 percent in West Africa, underpinned by
strong domestic investment buoyed by the
high price of oil, while it stood at 5.2 percent
in Southern Africa. Central Africa experienced
the lowest real GDP growth rate of all the
subregions in 2008, but it still achieved 5.0
percent. Three subregions — West Africa,
Southern Africa, and Central Africa — registered growth rates below the continental
average of 5.7 percent.

Inflation in all subregions, except East Africa
(17.8 percent) and Southern Africa (15.2 percent) was lower than the continental average
of 11.6 percent in 2008. East Africa's poorer
inflation rate was caused by the high price of
oil, which also contributed to the deterioration in the subregion’s budgets and external
account balances. Southern Africa's inflation
rate excludes Zimbabwe's hyperinflation.

Looking ahead to 2009 and beyond, it is
expected that countries with accumulated
oil revenues will boost domestic demand
and invest at home to offset capacity constraints undermining productivity in Africa.
However, to achieve the MDGs, the rate of
investments in all African countries must be
accelerated considerably to promote a much
higher real GDP growth rate and to improve
income distribution across the continent.
A concerted effort is needed to tackle the
persistent development challenges facing
the continent, including the rising price of
food, chronic food shortages, and volatility
in the oil markets. It is expected that real
GDP growth will slow to around 2.8 percent in 2009, due to the negative impact
of the global financial crisis on aid inflows,

African exports, and FDI. Nonetheless, it is
envisioned that debt relief initiatives may
mitigate against these negative shocks.

The Global Financial Crisis
Despite the robust average growth that Africa
registered in 2008, the global financial crisis
that began in the second half of the year is
severely constraining growth prospects in the
short and medium term. During 2008, the
demand for, and thus the price of African primary commodities declined. Capital inflows
also started to decline during the last half
of the year, as did promised increases in aid
inflows. Although the continent as a whole
experienced improved terms of trade, current account and fiscal balances in 2008,
11 countries had current account deficits
above 10 percent of GDP and 8 countries
had debt service to export ratios above 20
percent, which are considered high by conventional standards.

In the second half of 2008, there was a
decline in the value of all African stock markets, except for the Tunisian Stock Exchange,
which gained 2.2 percent. The Egyptian
CASE-30 lost 56.4 percent of its value, followed by losses in the Nigeria Stock Exchange
(NSE) of 45.9 percent, the All Share Indices
for Mauritius, 36.2 percent; Nairobi Stock
Exchange, 34.1 percent; the Johannesburg
Stock Exchange, 25.7 percent; Morocco’s
Casa All Share, 12.9 percent; and the BVRM
Composite Index, 10.7 percent. Moreover, an
expectation of lower export revenues due to
declining commodity prices, lower inflows of
capital, and short-term capital outflows led
to widespread currency depreciations in most
RMCs during the year, except in Angola and
the CFA zone countries.

The ongoing crisis is also affecting public
finances through lower revenues, making it
difficult for countries to maintain the planned
levels of public expenditures, including longterm infrastructure investment as well as
social expenditures. This has become more
pronounced, especially among oil and min
Annual Report 2008

eral resource exporters, which witnessed
sharp price declines.

Some of the key sectors that have driven
growth over the past years are being impacted the hardest by the crisis, especially mining,
tourism, and manufacturing. For example, in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
most of the 61 foreign mining companies
have been forced to scale back, postpone,
or abandon their investment plans. Similar
constraints can be observed in other countries characterized by large-scale mining
activities, such as South Africa, Botswana,
and Zambia, leading to high employment
losses. In Uganda, for example, 15 factories closed in 2008 due to the high cost of
doing business.

In the financial sector, the crisis has led to
a tightening of credit due to a shortage in
bank liquidity as well as uncertainty surrounding the private sector. Consequently,
African banks are facing difficulties in securing lines of credit on international markets.
Similarly, governments such as Kenya, that
had planned to raise long-term finance during the year through sovereign bond issues,
have had to put their plans on hold. The
shortage of financing is particularly affecting trade financing and financing for large
infrastructure investments, both of which are
key drivers of economic growth and this will
significantly affect Africa's future development. To sum up, the financial crisis is likely
to reverse, to a great extent, the achievements attained by RMCs over the past few
years in raising growth rates and in reducing poverty.

of Africa's growth. Even though the immediate effects of the financial crisis have been
felt most acutely in countries with relatively well-developed stock markets (such as
South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, and Ghana), the

Annual Report 2008

impacts are now visible in the real economy
of most African countries. Current estimates
by the African Development Bank (ADB), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other
institutions have forecast Africa's real growth
rate at 2.8 percent for 2009 instead of the
4.8 percent projected in November 2008.

The African Development Bank has been
proactive in encouraging and supporting
African Ministers of Finance and Centra
Bank Governors to search for solutions
to minimize the impact of the crisis. In
November 2008, the AfDB, together with
the African Union Commission (AUC) an
the United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa (ECA), organized the Conference
of African Ministers of Finance and Centra
Bank Governors in Tunis, where the early
impacts of the crisis and possible solutions
for African countries were discussed. A common framework of action was formulate
with the following broad objectives: (i) to
mobilize domestic revenues and domestic
capital markets (in this respect, the meeting welcomed the Bank Group's Africa Bon
nitiative); (ii) that the Bank should consider
a General Capital Increase to scale up infrastructure and regional integration programs;
and (iii) to secure better African representaion in the G20. As a vehicle to follow up on
hese recommendations, a Committee of Ten,
representing both Ministers and Governors,
was formed.

 

Furthermore, the Bank is proposing a number
of new instruments to respond directly to
the needs of its RMCs in the current climate. First, to address the liquidity crunch, a
US$ 1.5 billion (UA 974 million) Emergency
Liquidity Facility (ELF) will provide bridge
inancing with a fast-track approval process.
Second, a US$ 1.0 billion (UA 650 million)
‘wo-phased Trade Finance Initiative (TFl) will
enable the Bank to play a countercyclical role
and provide trade finance in areas where
many international commercial banks are
retreating. The African Bond Market Initiative
is another innovative mechanism designed

 

 

 

to contribute to the deepening of domestic
financial markets, in full alignment with the
World Bank's Making Finance Work for Africa
report (2006). The Bank is also considering
various actions to accelerate and increase
support to its ADF (low-income) countries,
including: (i) budget support to offset shortfalls arising from falling commodity prices,
exports and terms of trade; (ii) long-term
infrastructure financing; and (iii) enhanced
private sector development. Currently, the
Bank's Operations departments are examining the possibility of restructuring existing
portfolios and pipeline projects in favor of
faster-disbursing instruments.

Besides its efforts to mobilize and provide
financial resources to RMCs, the Bank is
also encouraging RMCs to efficiently utilize available resources, and to maximize
domestic sources of financing. The Bank also
encourages its RMCs to adopt sound financial management practices and will continue
to provide policy advice. Finally, the Bank will
continue to be an instrument for ensuring
better coordination of donor responses and
effective advocacy and dialogue to increase
Africa's voice in global financial affairs.

OVERVIEW OF BANK
GROUP OPERATIONS

Bank Group total loan, grant, and other approvals as at end December 2008
amounted to UA 3.53 billion, compared with
UA 3.10 billion in 2007 —an increase of 13.9
percent (see Table 4.3). Of the total approvals for 2008, UA 3.17 billion was allocated
to financing loans and grants, compared to
UA 2.58 billion in 2007; while UA 358.5 million went to debt relief, private sector equity
participation, private guarantees, and special
fund allocations.

With respect to the distributional split by
Bank windows, the ADB accounted for UA
1.81 billion (51.2 percent) of total Bank
Group approvals, the ADF for UA 1.67 bil-Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

lion (47.2 percent) and the NTF for UA 28.2
million (0.8 percent). The NTF amount was
for 2 HIPC debt relief approvals. There were
no loan approvals from the NTF in 2008,
although lending is expected to recommence
in 2009. Special funds for water amounted
to UA 28.2 million (0.8 percent). There was a
rise of 8.2 percent in the ADB's total approvals for 2008 compared with 2007. Similarly,
ADF's total approvals were up by 20.5 percent relative to 2007 approvals. However,
Special Funds approvals fell from UA 45.8
million in 2007 to UA 28.2 million in 2008
—a decline of 38.4 percent.

Approvals for public and publicly-guaranteed loans in 2008 amounted to UA 1.32
billion, representing 37.5 percent of total
operations. Private non-publicly guaranteed
loans reached a level of UA 730.8 million,
representing 20.7 percent of Bank Group
operations.

Bank Group Loan and

Grant Approvals by
Financing Instrument

The 2 main financing instruments of the
Bank Group are: (i) project and policy-based
loans and (ii) grants. Project lending is specific in nature while policy-based lending is
designed to help RMCs enhance macroeconomic policy, and for structural, sectoral, and
institutional reforms. Project lending (including private sector loans) stood at UA 2.05
billion in 2008. Project lending accounted
for 58.2 percent of the total approvals in
2008 (see Table 4.3). With regard to policybased lending, there was more than a tenfold increase from UA 51.8 million in 2007
to UA 549.4 million in 2008.

Grant approvals in 2008 recorded a 84.4
percent increase over 2007, from UA 307.1
million in 2007 to UA 566.2 million. The
distribution of grant resources in 2008
comprised: 7 technical assistance grants,
14 project grants, 4 structural adjustment
grants, 5 African Food Crisis Response grants,
3 Fragile State Facility grants, and 8 emer
Annual Report 2008

gency assistance grants from the Special
Relief Fund (SRF). There were also 2 project
preparation facility grants amounting to UA
1.0 million. In addition, UA 159.9 million was
approved under HIPC debt relief, UA 145.5
million for 11 private sector equity participations, 3 private guarantees for UA 24.9
million, and 11 approvals under the special
unds totaling UA 28.2 million.

n 2008, country strategies and development priorities of RMCs continued to feaure prominently in Bank Group operations.
otal approvals for 2008 amounted to UA
3.53 billion, a 13.9 percent increase from
he previous year’s level of UA 3.10 billion.
he sectoral allocation of approvals for the
year continued to reflect the Bank's policy
of selectivity, project focus and effectiveness,
and the rising demand for infrastructure
inancing in RMCs. Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1
show that the two top beneficiary sectors —
infrastructure (44.5 percent) and multisector (23.0 percent) — jointly accounted for
67.5 percent of the total operational loans
and grants.

 

The approval of UA 1.41 billion for infrastructural projects in 2008 demonstrates the
Bank's selectivity and continued focus on
projects aiming to accelerate poverty reduction and economic growth in RMCs. Of the
UA 1.41 billion allocated to infrastructure,
transportation took the largest share (45.4
percent), followed by power supply (37.8
percent), and water supply and sanitation
(16.8 percent). There were no approvals for
the telecommunications sector in 2008.

Bank Group interventions in multisector
(loans and grants) amounted to UA 728.5
million in 2008, which was about a sevenfold
rise over the 2007 level of UA 92.2 million.
This reflects the Bank's promotion of good
governance as a means of building RMCs’
institutional capacity for sound and transparent fiscal management — which is a neces
sary precondition for foreign and domestic
investment, and to stimulate private sector
activities. The remaining 32.5 percent of
Bank Group operations was shared among
the other sectors, namely finance, industry,
mining and quarrying, social, and agriculture
and rural development.

Cumulative Loan and
Grant Approvals by

Sector and Subregion
Between 1967 and 2008, the Bank Group
approved 3,276 loans and grants, totaling UA 44.75 billion. Of the total cumula
tive approvals, the ADB window accounted
for 56.5 percent, the concessionary ADF
window for 42.8 percent, and the NTF
resources for 0.7 percent respectively. The
Bank Group’s prioritization of infrastructure
projects is also highlighted in Bank Group
cumulative loan and grant approvals for
1967-2008. Figure 4.2 shows the cumulative Bank Group approvals by sector, with
the 5 main sectors as infrastructure (transportation, power supply, and water supply and sanitation), agriculture, multisector,
finance, and social.

 

Figure 4.3 presents the subregional distribution of cumulative Bank Group loan and
grant approvals from 1967 to 2008. North
Africa received the highest share (30.7 percent), followed by West Africa (22.6 percent),
East Africa (16.3 percent), Southern Africa
(15.7 percent), Central Africa (9.4 percent),
and multiregional (5.3 percent).Table 4.4: Bank Group Approvals by Sector, 2008

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (ADB)

The ADB window is the Bank’s nonconcessional lending arm, through which it supports
development activities in 13 middle-income
countries and 2 blend countries, namely
Nigeria and Zimbabwe. The latter 2 countries also have access to ADF resources for
project and program financing. In addition, a
principal focus of the ADB window is to support the private sector in all regional member countries, involving direct loans, equity
participation, and guarantees to financially
viable private enterprises.

The ADB approved a total of UA 1.81 billion for 58 activities as at end-December
2008, comprising UA 1.51 billion for loans
and UA 297.7 million for grants, HIPC debt
relief, private sector equity participations,
and private guarantees. Approvals for ADB
operations increased by 8.4 percent from
UA 1.67 billion in 2007 to UA 1.81 billion
in 2008. This was due mainly to the increase
in the level of policy-based loans from UA
19.9 million in 2007 to UA 136.4 million in
2008 (see Table 4.5).

Private Sector Operations

The private sector is increasingly recognized as the engine of economic growth
for RMCs. Private sector approvals in 2008
stood at UA 901.2 million, representing
49.9 percent of ADB approvals and 25.5
percent of Bank Group total approvals. The
substantial amount approved for private
sector activities demonstrates the Bank's
continued focus on selectivity and areas
of priority that would accelerate poverty
reduction, in full alignment with the Bank
Group Medium-Term Strategy 2008-2012.
In 2008, there were 32 private sector activities comprising 9 project loans, 9 lines of
credit (LOCs), 11 private equity participations, and 3 private guarantees. Figure 4.4
shows the distribution of private sector
operations between loans, equity investments, and guarantees.

Box 4.1: The Doraleh Container Terminal Project in Djibouti

 

Background: The new container terminal at Doraleh in Djibouti will be the first port after Suez capable of accommodating the latest
generation of supersize container ships. Djibouti is strategically placed along the main shipping canal toward the Suez Canal, making it an ideal transshipment hub. Furthermore, the current gateway business for goods destined for Ethiopia is well established and
demand is set to grow, so the project will leverage these strategic advantages.

Amount: The total cost of the project is UA 252.9 million. The ADB is providing a senior 10-year loan of UA 60.0 million, which represents 20 percent of the total project cost. The remaining financing is to be raised through equity (34 percent), the Islamic Syndicated
Facility (40 percent), and Proparco (6 percent).

Project Description: The project will finance the construction and operation of a new terminal at Doraleh with a 1.5 km quayline
and the capacity to handle 1.55 TEUs (Twenty-Food Equivalent Units) per year from 2015. The terminal will have the deepest draft
in the region at 18 meters to cater specifically for container ships. Construction was officially launched in 2006 by the President of
Djibouti and the new terminal is due to become operational in 2009. The two sponsors are Port Autonome International de Djibouti
(PAID), which is the port authority and main shareholder, and Dubai Port World, which is one of the largest marine operators in the
world, with operations covering 28 countries.

Expected Outcomes: The project is expected to: (i) boost the country’s GDP and foreign exchange earnings, thereby helping to
reduce poverty in this low-income country; (ii) generate employment for approx. 350-500 local workers during construction and 670
full-time jobs during operations; (iii) facilitate the transfer of technological expertise from international port professionals to local
management and staff; (iv) increase government revenues to the tune of approximately UA 178.3 million in royalties and taxes; (v)
create new investment opportunities for the country; and (vi) promote regional integration.

General Remarks: This infrastructure project accords well with the Bank’s priorities in terms of the CSP for Djibouti and its Private
Sector Strategy. It will help to address Djibouti’s high level of unemployment (at around 60 percent) and to reduce poverty (45 percent
of the population currently live below the poverty line). One of the Government's objectives is to improve the country’s infrastructure
to promote greater competitiveness and foreign investment — this public-private partnership project will support this aim. The new
terminal will also enhance regional integration and establish Djibouti as a major international trading hub.

A brief description of the Doraleh Container
Terminal in Djibouti — one of the Bank's largest project investments in an ADF country —
is presented in Box 4.1.

Cumulative approvals for private sector
projects and programs as at end-December
2008 stood at UA 3.16 billion, compared to
UA 2.26 billion for 2007, which represents
an increase of 39.8 percent.

ADB Approvals by Sector,
2008

The distribution of ADB total loans and grants
according to sectors shows that infrastructure
(transportation, water supply and sanitation,
and power supply) benefited from the largest share (44.9 percent); followed by finance

Annual Report 2008

(19.6 percent); industry, mining and quarrying
(18.0 percent); social (7.4 percent); multisector (5.5 percent); and agriculture and rural
development (4.6 percent) (see Table 4.6).

The targeting of financial resources to infrastructure reflects the Bank's selectivity toward
high-impact projects that will enhance the
business enabling climate, increase competitiveness and productivity, and boost employment and sustainable growth. During the
year, approvals for infrastructure projects
under the ADB window amounted to UA
683.1 million. Among the components of
infrastructure, power supply took the largest share (48.1 percent); followed by transportation (39.6 percent); and water supply
and sanitation (12.4 percent).

Cumulative ADB Loan

and Grant Approvals by
Sector and Subregion

The cumulative ADB loan and grant approvals for the period 1967-2008 amounted
to UA 25.31 billion for 1,030 operations,
of which UA 2.98 billion was allocated for
107 private sector operations. Figure 4.5
presents the 6 top sectors for ADB cumulative approvals 1967-2008. Infrastructure
(transportation, power supply, water, and
communications) received the biggest allocation (41.2 percent); then finance (21.4
percent); followed by multisector; agriculture
and rural development; industry, mining and
quarrying; and social.(UA millions)

With respect to the geographical distribution
of cumulative ADB approvals, this followed
an almost identical pattern to that of last
year, with North Africa recording the largest share, followed by West Africa, Southern
Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, and multiregional (see Figure 4.6).

Disbursements

Disbursements on Bank loans decreased by
17.8 percent from UA 884.8 million in 2007
to UA 727.5 million in 2008. At December 31,
2008, cumulative disbursements (1967-2008)
(including non-sovereign loans) amounted to
UA 17.62 billion. A total of 768 loans were
fully disbursed totaling UA 16.79 billion,
representing 95.3 percent of cumulative disbursements. The decrease in the level of ADB
disbursements in 2008 compared with 2007
can be partly attributed to the large single
disbursement of UA 338.0 million (US$ 500.0
million) to Egypt in 2007.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
FUND (ADF)

The ADF window is the Bank Group's concessionary lending arm for countries that cannot
access funds from the ADB window, other
than for enclave and private sector projects.
ADF resources are allocated on the basis of
country creditworthiness, per capita GNI, and
country performance using the PerformanceBased Allocation (PBA) system. The PBA is
designed to ensure that proportionately more
resources go to high-performing RMCs that
can use them more effectively.

ADF approvals (loans, grants, debt and debt
service reduction, and project preparation
facility) stood at UA 1.67 billion in 2008
compared with UA 1.38 billion in 2007 — an
increase of 21.0 percent (see Table 4.7). With
regard to ADF loan and grant approvals only,
they rose from UA 1.10 billion in 2007 to UA
1.65 billion in 2008. This represents a rise of
50.0 percent over the previous year. Approvals
for debt servicing, however, declined over the
same period, from UA 284.2 million in 2007

to just UA 18.0 million in 2008. Project and
policy-based loans approved by the Fund,
excluding 2 Project Preparation Facility loans,
amounted to UA 1.09 billion, while grants
totaled UA 552.6 million.

Figure 4.7 presents the 16 countries that
benefited from ADF loan approvals in 2008.
Kenya was a relatively small borrower from
the ADF window in 2008, whereas it was
the biggest recipient in 2007. Uganda was
the third largest recipient in 2007, becoming
the top ADF borrower in 2008, followed by
Ghana and Tanzania.

In addition to loans and grants, the Fund
approved UA 18.0 million for debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative for 2 countries
(Gambia and Liberia).

ADF Approvals by Sector

Two sectors — namely infrastructure and multisector — accounted for 83.3 percent of the
operational approvals in 2008 (see Table 4.8).
Infrastructure as a sector continued to be allocated the largest share of approvals with UA

728.3 million (44.2 percent), comprising UA
484.7 million as loans and UA 243.6 million
as grants. This resonates with the emphasis
accorded to this sector in the MTS as a key
driver of poverty reduction. Of the total infrastructure allocation, transportation received
the largest share (50.9 percent), followed by
power supply (28.1 percent), and water supply and sanitation (20.9 percent).

After infrastructure, the next largest recipient of ADF approvals was multisector, which
received UA 644.0 million (39.1 percent)
of total approvals, consisting of UA 413.0
million in loans and UA 231.0 million in
grants. The increase in the allocation of
ADF resources to multisector projects in
2008 reflects the Bank’s targeting of support to good governance in RMCs, as a
prerequisite for sound fiscal policy management and to encourage domestic and
foreign investment. With regard to the other sectors, social sector was allocated 6.8
percent, followed by agriculture and rural
development with 5.6 percent, and environment with 4.2 percent (see Figure 4.8).Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

THE NIGERIA

TRUST FUND (NTF)

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) was estabished in 1976 at the initiative of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria, to provide concessional
inancing to the Bank’s RMCs. The overall
purpose of the NTF is to provide additional
resources for projects in various sectors, in
order to enhance economic development
and social progress in Africa, particularly in
he least developed countries.

he NTF was established for an initial period
of 30 years, with a provision for extension,
by mutual agreement. At the expiration of
he initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006,
the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria
agreed to an interim extension to allow for
urther consultations and an independent
evaluation of the NTF. Following the positive
review and recommendation for continuation
by the independent evaluators, the Federal
Republic of Nigeria and the Bank agreed to
a 10-year extension of NTF commencing on
April 25, 2008. The extension was approved
by the Board of Governors of the Bank on
May 15, 2008, during the Annual Meetings

 

Since its establishment in 1976, the NTF has oe

approved UA 304.6 million, for 71 operations in 30 RMCs. The 2008 level of cumulative approvals is the same as at year-end of
2006, since there were no new approvals in
the intervening period. The majority of the
NTF cumulative allocations went to infrastructure operations, followed by agriculture and
rural development, social sector, finance, and
industry (see Figure 4.11). The regional distribution of NTF approvals has also remained
unchanged since end-December 2006, with
West Africa receiving the largest allocation,
followed by East Africa, Southern Africa, and
North Africa. Multiregional projects accounted for just 4.6 percent of NTF cumulative total
approvals (see Figure 4.12).

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 5.94 million in 2007 to UA 8.46 million in 2008,
representing an increase of 42.42 percent.
As at December 31, 2008, cumulative disbursements (1976-2008) amounted to UA
213.2 million. Fifty-nine loans were fully
disbursed for a total amount of UA 196.2
million, representing 92.0 percent of cumulative disbursements.

BANK GROUP
OPERATIONS BY
SUBREGION

Bank Group Loan and

Grant Approvals by Subregion
The Bank has divided Africa into 5 subregions for its operations, namely: Central
Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern
Africa, and West Africa. Bank Group approvals for all 5 subregions (including multinational projects and programs) amounted in
2008 to UA 3.17 billion, allocated as follows: North Africa, UA 819.9 million (25.9
percent); West Africa, UA 633.5 million (20.0
percent); East Africa, UA 569.9 million (18.0
percent); Southern Africa, UA 475.9 million
(15.0 percent); and Central Africa, UA 74.0
million (2.3 percent). Approvals for multinational projects and programs amounted to
UA 597.0 million (18.8 percent). The Bank
Group's cumulative (1967-2008) loan and
grant approvals for the 5 subregions stood
at UA 42.39 billion, while that of cumulative multinational operations amounted to
UA 2.36 billion (see Annex II-7).

NORTH AFRICA

North Africa comprises 6 countries: Algeria,
Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and
Tunisia. Mauritania is classified as an ADF
country, while the others are ADB countries,
although Libya is not a borrowing country. The subregion received loan and grant
approvals amounting to UA 819.9 million in
2008, which is an increase over the 2007
level of UA 591.9 million. The approvals
represent 25.9 percent of total Bank Group
approvals in 2008, slightly higher than its
share of 22.9 percent in 2007.

Approvals in 2008 benefited 4 countries:
Egypt, at UA 302.4 million; Tunisia, UA
282.7 million; Morocco, UA 217.0 million;
and Mauritania, UA 17.7 million (see Annex
\I-7). Major projects approved in this subregion include the Ain Sokhna Thermal Power

Annual Report 2008

Box 4.2: Evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Project

(Microfinance) in Mauritania

 

Objective: To establish 7 savings and loan associations and strengthen local microfinance institutions, many of which are traditionally women-owned. The overarching
goal of the project was to reduce poverty and increase GDP.

Bank’s Role: ADF loan of 3.2 million. Capacity-building program of UA 1.8 million.
Timeline: Commencement in 1999; completion in mid-2004.

Components: Establishment of a loan fund of UA 1.8 million; development of the
capacities of selected microfinance institutions (MFls); Information, Education &

Communication (IEC) work; and literacy training.

Outcomes: The outcomes far exceeded expectations with respect to the following:

The 35 supported microfinance agencies reached a membership of over 56,000,
compared to the target of 13,000;

Savings reached UA 4.7 million against a projected amount of UA 0.5 million;

¢ Loans were extended to over 20,750 borrowers (60 percent women) compared to
a projected number of 7,500.

About 4,530 jobs were created;

Improvement in organization of supported MFls.

Alignment to the Bank's Objectives:
Poverty Reduction: The project aligned to the Bank Group's overall mission of reducing
poverty and boosting sustainable economic growth in its RMCs.

Social Impact and Gender: Some 60 percent of the owners of micro enterprises in
the country are women, who traditionally find it difficult to access credit. The project
therefore helped improve their income-generating activities. Moreover, through the
project's training component, which included basic health and hygiene, over 4,800
people received guidance, 80 percent of whom were women. The project therefore
also contributed toward achievement of the health-related MDGs.

Private Sector Development: Supporting micro-entrepreneurship by extending loans to
financial intermediaries is one of the Bank’s Private Sector Operations strategic objectives. The Bank cannot lend directly to SMEs or micro-entrepreneurs, but only through
financial intermediaries, as was the case with this project. The project helped to promote the concept of microfinance and paved the way for an expansion of the sector.
In 1998, only 10 microfinance bodies operated in the country; whereas this figure had
increased to 67 by 2005.

Alignment to National Priorities: Mauritania is a low-income country and the project
supported the Country Strategy Paper and the government's poverty reduction strategy. The intervention also directly led to the Government adopting and initiating new
legislation to promote microfinance operations in the country.Project in Egypt; 3 projects in Tunisia (Road
Project V; Water Sector Investment Project
Phase II (PISEAU II); the Hasdrubal Oil and
Gasfield Project); and the Nouakchott City

Project in Mauritania, which aims to improve
water supply to about 1 million people.
Major 2008 approvals in support of good
governance in this subregion included

Reform Support Program Phase Ill, both in
Morocco. Box 4.2 illustrates an earlier poverty reduction project in Mauritania, with a
‘ocus on supporting microfinance. This was
successfully implemented over the period
1999-2004.

The sectoral distribution of approvals in
North Africa in 2008 was as follows: infrastructure at UA 563.1 million (68.7 percent);
‘ollowed by industry, mining and quarrying,
UA 93.3 million (11.7 percent); multisector,
UA 63.2 million (7.7 percent); social sector,

and rural development, UA 29.1 million (3.6
percent); and finance, UA 8.0 million (1.0
percent). Since 2007, the Bank Group has
consistently given top priority to infrastructure development in the subregion, in line
with its new operational focus.

Although the Bank Group started operations
in North Africa in 1968 — one year later than
in the other subregions — North Africa's share
of cumulative loan and grant approvals (UA
13.73 billion) has been the largest of all the
subregions, accounting for 30.7 percent of
the total (see Annex II-7). The 4 principal
beneficiaries were Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt,
and Algeria. Figure 4.13 shows the cumulative Bank Group loan and grant approvals
by sector for the period 1967-2008. The
top 3 sectors were infrastructure (39.7 percent), finance (22.4 percent), and multisector (16.6 percent).

WEST AFRICA

West Africa is made up of 16 countries: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Céte d'Ivoire,
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, S4o Tomé and
Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. It
is the subregion with the largest linguistic,
geographical, and natural resources diversity.
Apart from Nigeria, all the other countries
in the subregion can only borrow from ADF
resources. Nigeria, being a blend country, can
borrow from both ADB and ADF windows.
Bank Group loan and grant approvals to the
subregion increased by 151.8 percent from
UA 251.6 million in 2007 to UA 633.5 million in 2008, making West Africa the second
largest recipient of approvals in 2008, after
North Africa.

The Bank Group's commitment to the subregion in 2008 accounted for 20.0 percent of
total approved loans and grants (see Annex
\I-7), compared to the 2007 share of 9.7
percent. The 15 countries that benefited
from loans and grants in 2008 were: Ghana

Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

(UA 173.0 million); Guinea (UA 146.4 million); Burkina Faso (UA 63.5 million); Mali
(UA 55.0 million); Nigeria (UA 52.4 million);
Niger (UA 40.0 million); Senegal (UA 30.0
million); Benin (UA 25.0 million); Togo (UA
14.6 million); Liberia (UA 12.0 million); Sierra
Leone (UA 10.3 million); Cape Verde (UA 5.0
million); Gambia (UA 4.0 million); GuineaBissau (UA 2.0 million); and Céte d'Ivoire
(UA 0.3 million).

Major projects approved in 2008 for this
subregion include, inter alia: the Guinea
Alumina Project (Guinea); the Lekki Toll Road
| (Nigeria); Kandadji Ecosystem Regeneration
and Niger Valley Development Program
(Niger); Poverty Reduction Support Loan
Ill (Ghana); Growth and Poverty Reduction
Strategy Support Program (Mali); and the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Program
(Senegal).

The sectoral distribution of 2008 approvals
was as follows: multisector, UA 229.6 million (36.5 percent); infrastructure, UA 214.1
million (34.0 percent); industry, mining and
quarrying, UA 144.5 million (23.0 percent);
agriculture and rural development, UA 31.9
million (5.1 percent); and finance, UA 9.2
million (1.5 percent). The sectoral distribution
indicates the Bank's selectivity and strategic
focus on projects that aim to promote good
governance, reduce poverty, and enhance
infrastructural development in RMCs.

Between 1967 and 2008, cumulative Bank
Group loan and grant approvals to West
Africa amounted to UA 10.13 billion, which
represents 22.6 percent of total cumulative
allocations. Nigeria was allocated the largest share, followed by Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire,
Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Benin,
Niger, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Togo, Guinea
Bissau, Liberia, Cape Verde, and Sdo Tomé
and Principe.

The sectoral distribution of the cumulative

loan and grant approvals shows that the
largest allocations went to infrastructure,

EAST AFRICA

East Africa is made up of 12 countries —
Burundi, Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Kenya, Rwanda, Seychelles, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania, and Uganda. Seychelles is the only
country eligible to borrow from the ADB
window. The other 11 countries are eligible
for funding from ADF resources only, with
restricted access to ADB resources for private
sector and enclave projects. East Africa was
allocated UA 569.9 million of Bank Group
loan and grants in 2008, a slight decrease
from UA 576.3 million in 2007. The approvals for 2008 represent 18.0 percent of total
approvals (see Annex II-7). The 9 benefiting countries were Uganda (UA 190.0 million); Ethiopia (UA 143.4 million); Tanzania
(UA 125.0 million); Djibouti (UA 57.8 million); Kenya (UA 25.9 million); Burundi (UA

Annual Report 2008

14.0 million); Rwanda (UA 11.6 million);
Comoros (UA 1.5 million); and Seychelles
(UA 0.6 million).

In 2008, Bank Group's allocations were
directed mainly toward multisector at UA
234.8 million (41.2 percent); followed by
infrastructure, UA 163.5 million (28.7 percent); social sector, UA 84.8 million (14.9
percent); agriculture and rural development,
UA 47.8 million (8.4 percent); and industry, mining and quarrying, UA 39.0 million
(6.8 percent). The continued focus of Bank
Group's operations on multisector and infrastructure in this subregion is consistent the
Bank’s aim of promoting good governance as
a means of strengthening RMCs' institutional
capacities for sound and transparent fiscal
management; and enhancing the development of infrastructural projects that would
lay a solid foundation for poverty reduction
and economic development.

Four of the East African countries benefited
from ADB loans and guarantees through the
Bank's private sector window. These were to
finance the Derba Midroc Cement Plant in
Ethiopia, the Buseruka Hydroelectric Power
Project in Uganda, the Doraleh Container
Terminal in Djibouti, and a Partial Credit
Guarantee Facility to support SMEs’ access
to finance in Tanzania.

Other notable projects and programs
approved from the ADF window in 2008
for the subregion include: the Protection
of Basic Services Program II in Ethiopia; the
Poverty Reduction Strategy Support Loan
Ill in Tanzania; and the following 3 projects
in Uganda: the Community Agricultural
Infrastructure Improvement Program; the
Mbarara—Nkenda and Tororo—Lira Power
Transmission Line Project; and the Post
Primary Education and Training Expansion
and Improvement (Education IV) Project.

The reform programs in Tanzania and Uganda
received assistance from the Bank in the
form of structural and sector adjustment

loans respectively. In the social sector, the
Bank provided humanitarian relief assistance
to flood-affected populations in Kenya and
Rwanda. It also supported emergency relief
operations in Kenya for victims of the post

Box 4.3: Evaluation of the Basse Betsiboka Rice Rehabilitation Scheme in Madagascar

 

Objectives: To improve the rice production potential of the Basse Betsiboka plains in order to achieve rice self-sufficiency, increase
farmers’ incomes, and reduce poverty.

Background: Basse Betsiboka is the second most important rice-producing area in Madagascar. However, from 1972 the yields
began to steadily decline, owing to deficient water utilization system, deterioration of the existing infrastructure, and the effects of
erosion on the upstream catchment area.

Bank's Role: ADB loan of UA 11.05 million; cofinancing by Government of UA 1.71 million.

Timeline: Commencement 1991; completion 2002. Notwithstanding substantial delays, the project was successfully completed and
rated “Satisfactory” in terms of the technical project goals in the Project Completion Report of August 2004.

Project Components: (i) rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure; (ii) water and soil conservation; (iii) irrigation engineering; (iv)
equipment and operating costs; (v) research, development and training; and (vi) monitoring and evaluation.

Outputs:

© 6,400 farms and 38,000 people benefited from improved irrigation;

¢ Increased acreage in terms of rice yields (23,066 tonnes) and output levels;

© Construction of 23 village wells, equipped with hand pumps;

¢ Supply of drinking water to the most underprivileged villages with a total population of 16,770;
¢ Improved rice-cultivable land increased by 5,122 hectares;

© 2.75 km of interconnecting canals constructed between Bekara and Karambo Basse schemes;

© Two dams expanded, increasing their combined capacity by 13.5 million cubic meters;

¢ Protection of catchment basin by development of pasture land, cashew trees and eucalyptus;

e EIRR 17 percent, compared to 16 percent projected at appraisal.

Alignment to the Bank's Strategic Priorities:
Agricultural Strategy: The project contributed to macroeconomic policy and sector objectives (including water objectives) by increasing rice production, promoting food security, and reducing food imports.

Poverty Reduction and Social Impacts: The project directly contributed to improved farmers’ incomes, thereby reducing poverty in the
area. It also resulted in improved access to potable water supply, thereby improving the health of the population and freeing women
from the onerous task of fetching water to engage in more productive, income-generating activities.

Alignment to Environmental Sustainability: A major component of the project was to mitigate any negative environment effects, e.g.
by control of the silting-up of dams through reforestation, agricultural engineering, restoration of soil fertility by water and soil preservation techniques, preservation of the ecology of the catchment basin, etc. The project's impact on the environment was therefore
positive.

Private Sector Development: The project contributed to private sector development as well as agricultural productivity in the
project area.

SOUTHERN AFRICA

Southern Africa comprises the 12 countries
of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. The countries that can borrow
from ADB resources are Botswana, Mauritius,
Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland. The
others are only eligible for ADF resources,
with restricted access to ADB funds for private sector and enclave projects. Zimbabwe
as a blend country can access both ADB and
ADF resources, although it has been under
sanctions since 2000. Bank Group loan and
grant approvals to the subregion in 2008
stood at UA 475.9 million compared with UA
539.6 million in 2007. The 2008 approvals
accounted for 15.0 percent of total loan and
grant approvals for Bank Group operations
(see Annex |I-7).

The 6 beneficiary countries in 2008 were
South Africa (UA 203.8 million); Madagascar

Box 4.4: Evaluation of the Electricity II Project in Mozambique

Objective: To finance the electricity supply needed for the resettlement of displaced
persons from the civil war. This entailed the extension of the electricity grid to the rural
areas of Maputo and Gaza provinces in the south of the country.

Bank's Role: ADF loan of UA 14.7 million.

Timeline: Commencement 1997; completion 2003.

Outputs: The project successfully achieved its expected outcomes, although there were
delays to the project completion date. The benefits included the following:

Reliable and affordable electricity supply to 4,600 (mainly poor) rural households
— about 1,600 more than planned;

© Reliable and affordable electricity supply to local businesses, including 11 tourist
lodges and a sugar factory, thereby boosting productivity;

Increase in volume of electricity customers: the Ponta de Ouro tourist area accounted
for only 50 customers to the electricity company in 2002. Five years later in 2007,
there were 700 individual customers and 11 tourist lodges, with each lodge employing about 30-40 people;

A number of schools and health clinics were connected to the electricity grid, also
street lighting was provided, enhancing the socioeconomic benefits;

The provision of electricity has encouraged displaced communities to resettle in villages they had abandoned during the conflict, thereby enhancing security;

A prison was relocated to the area to take advantage of the electricity supply.

Alignment to the Bank's Strategic Objectives:

Assistance to a Postconflict Country: The project is aligned to the Bank Group's objective of promoting infrastructure development, particularly in poor rural areas. Through
its focus on assisting displaced persons, the project also aligned with the Bank’s support to a postconflict country's development to help populations re-engage with the
community.

Socioeconomic Benefits: Improvements in the electricity supply have enhanced the
availability of amenities not only for poor rural households, but also for businesses,
thereby boosting productivity and profitability, and reducing poverty.

Alignment to National Priorities: The project underscored the Government's commitment
to enhance the country’s basic infrastructure network, including remote rural areas.million); Zambia (UA 58.9 million); Malawi
(UA 39.9 million); and Botswana (UA 38.2
million). South Africa received the largest
share of all Bank Group approvals for the
subregion in 2008. This was due mainly to
the Lines of Credit approved for Standard
Bank of South Africa and for Nedbank Ltd.
Since 2007, South Africa has consistently
been the highest recipient of Bank Group
approvals in the subregion.

Other notable 2008 approvals for the
subregion were for: the Pandamatenga
Agriculture Infrastructure Development
Project (Botswana); the Nkana Water Supply
and Sanitation Project (Zambia); the Poverty
Reduction Budget Support Program Phase
II (Madagascar); and the Poverty Reduction
Support Loan II (Mozambique).

The 5 sectors supported in the subregion
in 2008 were finance, at UA 212.4 million
(44.6 percent); multisector, UA 135.0 million (28.4 percent); infrastructure, UA 60.9
million (12.8 percent); agriculture and rural
development, UA 53.5 million (11.2 percent),
and social sector, UA 14.0 million (2.9 percent). The sectoral distribution of the 2008
approvals continued to exhibit the Bank's
goal of selectivity of projects that would
enhance rapid economic growth and promote good governance in RMCs. In addition
to support for projects and programs, during
2008, emergency food assistance under the
Special Relief Fund was provided to Zambia,
which had been badly affected by floods.

Bank Group operations in this subregion
started in 1969. Between 1969 and 2008,
Southern Africa received cumulative Bank
Group loan and grant approvals worth UA
7.01 billion, representing a 15.7 percent
share of all cumulative approvals for the continent. The allocation by country reveals that
Mozambique received the largest share, followed by South Africa, Madagascar, Zambia,
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Botswana, Angola,
Lesotho, Mauritius, Swaziland, and Namibia.
Figure 4.16 indicates that the leading sec
tor for cumulative approvals was infrastructure at 37.6 percent followed by agriculture
(15.5 percent), then finance (15.0 percent),
multisector (13.8 percent), and social (11.0
percent). Box 4.4 below illustrates the support provided by the Bank Group to a postconflict country in Southern Africa, namely
Mozambique in 1997-2003, to help a displaced community secure a reliable electricity supply.

CENTRAL AFRICA

Seven countries make up the Central Africa
subregion, namely Cameroon, Central Africa
Republic, Chad, Congo, Congo Democratic
Republic, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon.
wo countries in this subregion — Gabon
and Equatorial Guinea — can borrow from
he ADB window of the Bank. The other 5
countries are only eligible for ADF resources, with limited access to ADB financing
‘or private sector and enclave projects. In
2008, the subregion was allocated UA 74.0
million, accounting for 2.3 percent of total
Bank Group loan and grant approvals, compared with UA 429.5 million for 2007. The
2008 approvals represent a decline of 82.8
percent relative to 2007 loan and grants
approvals.

 

The 3 benefiting countries in 2008 were
Equatorial Guinea, with UA 63.5 million;
Central African Republic, UA 9.5 million
and Congo, UA 1.0 million (see Annex II-7).
Major projects approved in the subregion
during 2008 comprised 3 in Equatorial
Guinea (Health System Development
Support; the Training Program for Middle
and Senior Executives; and the Public Finance
Management Support Program), and one in
the Central Africa Republic (the Economic
Reform Support Program [ERSP-II]).

In 2008 the social sector received the largest
allocation of approvals at UA 50.2 million
(67.8 percent); followed by multisector UA
22.9 million (30.9 percent); and agriculture

Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

and rural development, UA 1.0 million (1.4
percent). The allocation of significant resources to the social sector and to multisector is
consistent with the Bank's goal of assisting RMCs progress toward achieving critical
MDGs and promoting good governance.

Between 1967 and 2008, Central Africa
accounted for UA 4.22 billion in cumulative Bank Group loan and grant approvals
(9.4 percent of the total). The DRC received
the largest amount, followed by Gabon,
Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Central African
Republic, and Equatorial Guinea.

Figure 4.17 presents the cumulative Bank
Group loan and grant approvals by sector.
The 4 key beneficiary sectors were: infrastructure (44.8 percent); multisector (18.6
percent); agriculture and rural development
(16.2 percent); and social (11.4 percent). The
sectoral share of the cumulative loan and
grant approvals highlights the Bank Group's
continued focus on infrastructural projects
in the subregion.

Management’s Report Regarding the Effectiveness
of Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 31, 2009

he Management of the African Development Bank Group (The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and
overall integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust
Fund have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board, while those of the African Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

he financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all
inancial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board. Management
elieves that all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ report
accompanies the audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity with
he basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies
identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit and are
revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

 

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance
with respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances.

he Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other
hings, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group's accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of
internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection
of external auditors and makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in turn makes a recommendation for
he approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting
or auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal
controls over financial reporting and any other matter that may require AUFI's attention.

 

he Bank's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that the Bank Group
maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the Financial Statements for 2008. Management is not
aware of any material control weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2008 financial statements.

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2008, the external auditors of the Bank Group conducted an
independent assessment of the Bank Group's internal control framework and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group
regarding effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2008

Scope
We have examined the African Development Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting for the year ended 31 December 2008,

based on criteria established in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for implementing and maintaining
effective internal controls over financial reporting and for assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. Management has asserted the
effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting for 2008.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether, in all material respects, effective internal controls are maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)

Chapter 006 African Development Bank Group

African Development Bank Group

Kec. Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal control over external financial reporting

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting during the

year ended 31 December 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust
Fund for 2008, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed unqualified opinions.

This chapter discusses the management of the financial resources of the Bank Group's windows—the African Development
Bank (ADB), the African Development Fund (AQF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF]—during the year. It also presents
the Audited Financial Statements for 2008 for the three windows, as well as the ADB and ADF Administrative Budgets

for the financial year 2009.

THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK

Financial Management

Capital Subscription

The authorized capital stock of the Bank
stood at UA 21.87 billion as of December 31,
2008, and has been allocated to regional and
non-regional members in such proportion so
that, when fully subscribed, the regional
group holds 60 percent of the total capital
stock and the non-regional group 40 percent.
At December 31, 2008, members’ subscriptions reached UA 21.76 billion, representing
99.50 percent of the capital stock.

The capital stock is composed of paid-up
and callable capital. The paid-up capital is
the amount of capital payable over a period determined by the Board of Governors’
resolution for the relevant General Capital
Increase (10 years for the fourth General
Capital Increase (GCI IV) and 8 years for the
fifth General Capital Increase (GCI V)). The
paid-in capital, which represents the portion
of paid-up capital that has been actually paid,
reached UA 2.34 billion. As of December 31,
2008, the Bank's callable capital was UA
19.41 billion of which UA 6.67 billion was
from countries rated double-A and higher.
The callable capital is subject to payment as
and when required by the Bank to meet its
incurred obligations, (a) by making or participating in direct loans out of funds borrowed or otherwise acquired by the Bank for
inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or
in special resources; or (b) by guaranteeing
in whole or in part, loans made by other
entities. It is a protection of the Bank's credi
ors and holders of Bank's guarantees in the
event that it is not able to meet its financial
obligations. There has never been a call on
he callable capital of the Bank.

n accordance with the Shares Transfer Rules,
shares for which payment have become due
and remain outstanding are forfeited after a
rescribed period and offered for subscripion to member countries. A member county's payment of the first GCI-V installment
riggers the subscription to the entire callable capital portion of shares allocated to
it, however, shares representing the paid-up
ortion of subscriptions are issued only as
and when the Bank receives actual payments
‘or such shares.

he position of capital subscriptions at
December 31, 2008 is shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital Stock
and Voting Power, which forms part of the
Financial Statements in this Report.

Bank Rating

he rating agencies Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+
rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debt respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
he Bank's strong membership support, its
referred creditor status, sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management
and policies.

 

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds from the
capital markets at the lowest possible cost
to support its lending activities. The top
notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank
enable it to issue securities at low interest
rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by
client and cashflow requirements, assets
and liability management goals, and risk
management policies.

here was significant turmoil in the financia
markets in 2008, which resulted in unprecedented levels of risk aversion and systemic

the private placement and uridashi markets, and one transaction that was linke

As at December 31, 2008, the borrowing
portfolio of the Bank stood at UA 6.71 bilion. The Bank is well within its debt policy
imits. The key debt ratios were as follows:

 

¢ Total debt/total callable capital (max
80 percent): 34.56 percent

¢ Senior debt/non-borrowing members’
callable capital (max 80 percent): 69.81
percent.

In December 2007, the ADB Board of Directors approved for the year 2008, a borrowing
program of up to UA 1,627 million including a UA 427 million component for the
Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa
Initiative (EPSA). In 2008, the Bank raised
UA 1.1 billion from the capital markets at a
weighted average cost of 6-month US Dol

lar LIBOR minus 25 basis points. In addition,
the Bank raised UA 189 million under the
EPSA initiative.

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments
(net of repurchase agreements) as of December 31, 2008 totaled UA 5.17 billion, compared to UA 5.42 billion at the end of 2007.
Investment income for 2008 amounted to UA
202.88 million or a return of 3.76 percent
on an average liquidity of UA 5.39 billion,
compared to UA 231.71 million in 2007,
or a return of 4.45 percent, on an average
liquidity of UA 5.20 billion.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3
portfolios, namely operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio,
each with a different benchmark that reflects
the cashflow and risk profile of its assets
and funding sources. These benchmarks are
1-month LIBID for the operational portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR,
resetting on February 1 and August 1 for
the prudential portfolio. The equity-backed
portfolio is managed against a re-pricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the
Bank's net assets re-pricing uniformly over
a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2008 amounted to UA 20.26
billion. Total outstanding loans, as at December 31, 2008 was UA 5.83 billion, UA 294.53
million higher than the UA 5.54 billion outstanding as at the end of 2007. This increase
was in spite of prepayments during the year
amounting to UA 17.04 million. Undisbursed
balances at December 31, 2008 totaled UA
2.55 billion, an increase of UA 726.38 million from December 31, 2007. The number
of active signed loans stood at 272 for a
total amount of UA 5.83 billion. Also, as at
December 31, 2008, 568 loans amounting
to UA 8.61 billion had been fully repaid. A
breakdown of the loan portfolio by product
type is presented below.

Disbursements

Disbursements on Bank loans decreased
from UA 884.75 million in 2007 to UA
727.53 million, representing a decrease of
17.8 percent. At 31 December 2008, cumulative disbursements (including non-sovereign
loans) amounted to UA 17.62 billion. A total
of 768 loans were fully disbursed amounting to UA 16.79 billion, representing 95.28
percent of cumulative disbursements.

Financial Products

Loans. The Bank offers 3 loan products: variable, floating, and fixed interest rate loans with
a selection of loan currencies, currently, US
Dollars, Euro, Japanese Yen, and South Africa
Rand. To suit the long-term financing needs
of borrowers, loans have a maximum maturity
of 20 years, including a grace period on the
repayment of the principal amount, generally
not exceeding 5 years. For the single currency
variable interest rate loan, the base rate is
determined twice a year, on January 1 and
July 1, and is based on the Bank's average cost
of a designated pool of borrowings funding
the loans in the specific currency. The base rate

for the floating interest rate loan is derived
from the 6-month market reference rate in the
specific currency, for example, LIBOR, EURIBOR or JIBAR. The base rate is reset on February 1 and August 1 each year and applies to
the 6-month period following the reset date.
For the fixed interest rate loan, the lending
rate in each currency is the fixed amortizing
swap rate derived from the 6-month market
reference rates. Borrowers may select from a
number of rate-fixing alternatives, including
fixing at each disbursement or after all disbursements have been completed. Prior to rate
fixing, the currency-specific floating interest
rate applies. The pricing formula applicable to
all 3 loan products is the same. The applicable
rate of interest is the sum of the chosen base
rate plus a lending spread. Loans to sovereign
and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers enjoy
a lending spread of 40 basis points above
the 6-month market reference rate. For nonsovereign guaranteed borrowers in both the
private and public sector, the lending spread
is computed based on the Bank's risk-based
pricing framework.

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector enterprises can be extended directly or through
a private financial institution (PFI). In an
agency line (AL), the credit risk of the borrower is borne by the Bank. In addition, the
PFI acts as an agent for the Bank, to carry
out a variety of activities, including, but not
limited to, identifying projects within certain parameters; appraising such projects on
behalf of the Bank; when approved, undertaking all of the administrative steps related
to disbursement (billing, collection of Bank's
funds, filing of security); supervising projects,
monitoring the performance of the borrower,
submitting reports thereon; and transmitting
amounts related to the repayment of the
loan to the Bank.

Guarantees. Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its preferred
creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to
obtain financing from third party lenders,
including capital markets. Guarantees willalso enable borrowers to obtain financing
in their own local currency where the Bank
is not able to provide such financing directly
from its own resources.

Risk Management Products are offered
to enable borrowers to manage the market
risks associated with their loans from the
Bank, including interest rate, currency, and
commodity price risks. These products assist
borrowers to manage their balance sheets
and their changing needs more efficiently
over time. Risk management products such as
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, interest
rate caps and collars are available to borrowers at any time during the life of the loan.

Equity Participation or Quasi Equity
Products. The Bank's ability to provide risk
capital through equity investments is a key
element of its resource mobilization role. Even
though the Bank cannot be a majority shareholder in a company, it can participate in a
project by acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred stocks or debentures.

 

Other Financial Services. \n addition
to the products described above, the Bank
may offer loan syndication and underwriting
services through its private sector window.

Risk Management Policies
and Processes

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing development finance and
related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank's
risk management policies, guidelines and
practices are designed to reduce exposure
to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal and other operational risks, while
maximizing the Bank's capacity to assume
credit risks to public and private sector clients, within approved risk limits.

The policies and practices employed by the
Bank to manage these risks are described in
detail in Note D to the Financial Statements.

Financial Results

The financial highlights below focus on
“Income before distributions approved by
the Board of Governors”, which represents
income arising from the normal or ordinary
operations of the Bank.

The highlights of the Bank's financial performance in 2008 include the following:

© Despite the difficult economic environment in 2008, the Bank earned income
before distributions approved by the
Board of Governors of UA 304.66 million in 2008, compared to UA 323.67
million in 2007. The decrease was due
primarily to the adverse effects of the
global financial crisis, as a result of
which the Bank experienced fair valuation and impairment losses amounting to UA 130.89 million. Such adverse
effects were substantially cushioned by
reductions in provisions for loan losses
that became necessary following the
clearance of the arrears of a borrowing
member country.

¢ Loan income increased by UA 10.33
million, or 3.02 percent, in 2008. The
increase in loan income was due primarily to an overall higher average volume of loans outstanding during 2008.
Investment income decreased in 2008
by UA 28.82 million, or 12.43 percent,
due in large part to the difficult investment environment in the year. However,
such decrease was partially offset by a
UA 13.11 million decrease in borrowing-related charges. In 2008, the Bank
earned income of UA 9.29 million on
investments in debt instruments issued
by entities in its regional member countries.

e At December 31, 2008, the number of
sovereign borrowers in arrears for six
months or more remained at 4 (same
level as at December 31, 2007). However,

African Development Bank Chapter 005

subsequent to year-end but prior to the
approval of the financial statements, the
Board of Directors approved the arrears
clearance for a borrowing country that
was in arrears for more than six months
at year-end. At December 31, 2008 total
accumulated provision for losses on principal and charges was UA 218.27 million,
which was 3.47 percent of gross principal and charges receivable at that date,
compared to UA 364.72 million, or 6.10
percent of gross principal and charges
receivable at December 31, 2007.

Total Bank Group administrative expenses
increased from UA 180.65 million in
2007 to UA 186.37 million in 2008. The
Bank's share of the Bank Group administrative expenses amounted to UA 46.78
million for 2008, compared to UA 42.22
million for 2007. Bank Group administrative expenses are allocated between
the Bank, the ADF and the NTF based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula
driven primarily by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators.

The Bank continues to earn levels of net
income sufficient to sustain its strong
financial position and also make contributions on behalf of its shareholders to
other development initiatives for Africa.
Total reserves plus accumulated loss provisions on outstanding loan principal and
charges at December 31, 2008 were UA
2.69 billion, compared to UA 2.90 billion
at the end of 2007. As a percentage of
gross loans, reserves plus loss provisions
on loan principal at December 31, 2008
represented 44.19 percent compared to
49.24 percent at December 31, 2007.
Against the background of the strong
tisk-bearing capacity of the Bank, the
Board of Governors in 2008 approved
distributions to various development
initiatives in Africa amounting to UA
257.30 million. The beneficiaries of these
distributions are listed under Note N to
the financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

NOTE A- OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social
progress of its regional member states. The Bank finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in
cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the
selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The
Bank also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and social
progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Development Fund (ADF or
the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the Bank. Notably, the ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to the ADB
for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic
and social development of the Bank's regional members, to promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the
Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and held by the
Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset
0 the asset's net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.
Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank's right to receive payment is established.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

he Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its member counties to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency Translation

ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated
into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are
reported in Note W-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation differences are included in the
determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. The translation difference
relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions
(CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of
receipt. When currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever withdrawn
its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that
the members are independent African and non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2008,
the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares. The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter referred
to as “the termination date.” The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against the member's liabilities
on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to the
Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent
to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase price was
determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have
been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains
liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond
if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying a former
member would have adverse consequences for the Bank's financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the risk had passed, and
indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made
until six months after the termination date.

 

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and then, if necessary, Out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject to the
prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each member country.

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit payments
to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation
of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual
inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year they occur. Past service
cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet.
The liability represents the present value of the Bank's defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

he Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to eligible
ormer staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to the post-retirement
ealthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum
service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued
over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the
statement of income and expenses. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the contribuions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses
are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year they occur. The medical plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts
payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank's post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of
he fair value of plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual rights
or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

he Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivales; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its investments
at initial recognition.

 

i) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement and gains and losses are reported in the income statement in
the period in which they arise. The investments in the trading portfolio are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short
term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ii) Loans and Receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management has the intent and ability to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method.

iv) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
The Bank has classified equity investments over which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future. Gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly in equity, until the financial asset
is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is recognized in profit or loss.

Annual Report 2008

123124

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash
is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates. The Bank
receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors the fair value of the securities and if necessary may require additional
collateral.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon acquisition of
three months or less.

2) Financial Liabilities

i) Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity management
purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest
rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding.
In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management
purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost with
interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in profit or loss and include the
amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities
may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate and currency risks. The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk management policies and practices are contained in Note D below.
Certain of the Bank's borrowings obtained prior to 1990 are interest-free loans from the governments of certain member countries of
the Bank. In accordance with the revised IAS 20 — Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such
borrowings represent a form of government assistance, the benefits of which are not quantified by the imputation of interest. Accordingly, such borrowings are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable on their due dates.

ji) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at
inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to borrowings that have
been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the borrowing at fair value through
profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that otherwise would have arisen if the borrowings were
carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

 

 

jij) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost. The
amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or cancelled or when they expire.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes.
These instruments include cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the interest rate
or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

Although IAS 39 allows hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the Bank has elected not to apply hedge accounting to any qualifying hedging relationship, but rather classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all changes in fair value
recognized in the income statement. When the criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also
carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Impairment of Financial Assets

1) Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets with
similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an
impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of
financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one
or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial
asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the noncollectibility, in whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment
loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.

2) Available-for-Sale Assets

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value,
net of any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is reclassified from equity to the income statement. Impairment losses
recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value are reversed through equity.

transaction volumes, the degree of consistency in pricing over time and between pricing sources, and the differences in bid and ask prices
the Bank concluded that the markets of most of its existing bond issues were inactive at December 31, 2008.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are base

on current bid prices. For financial assets with inactive markets or unlisted

securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These

include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted
commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments

cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques

 

 

or which market quotations are not readily available have been valued

using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such
financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale might
be different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are
based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank's borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques based on
discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread. Credit spreads are
obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank’s new public bond issues.
The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated
derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation
models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are made to the relevant observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best estimate of the
price at which the Bank could have bought back the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments carried at fair value are periodically fair valued both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises
is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods,
for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's equity participations is estimated as the Bank's percentage ownership of
the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools based on industry standard
pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest
rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject
to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported
in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans.
For multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the yearend variable lending rate in that currency, adjusted for impairment. For all loans not impaired, fair value adjustments are made to reflect
expected loan losses. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note I.

Day One Profit and Loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that
instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification
or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition, a
gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate data solely from observable markets. The
Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time) that
market participants would consider in setting a price. Day one losses are recognized in the income statement of the period while gains are
amortized over the life of the applicable borrowing on a straight-line basis.

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant influence are considered associates
of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not control, over the entity's financial and operating
policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method
be used to account for investments in associates. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and
the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to
the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2008, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately
1% of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its
subscribers since its creation in 1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank's investment in
the ADF. Furthermore, in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured
under the equity method are limited to the investment's original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Annual Report 2008

17128

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference between cost
and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

- Buildings: 15-20 years

- Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

- Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
- Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to
sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between proceeds and the asset's carrying amount
and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets
ntangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets
is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

Leases

he Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other regional memer countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made under
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an operating
lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as
an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Transfers and Distributions Approved by the Board of Governors

n accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations from
income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from prior years which
are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of transfer for specified uses have been met.
Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income Statement in the year of approval. Distribuions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously transferred to surplus account or from the current
year's income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior year's income, balance of amounts allocated to surplus
after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year net income, and expenses recognized directly
in equity as required by IFRS.

 

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results
could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant judgments
and estimates are summarized below:

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank's accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories. Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Held-for-Trading — |n classifying financial assets or liabilities as “trading”, the Bank has determined that such assets or liabilities meet its
description and set criteria for classification as such.

Fair Value through Profit and Loss — In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has determined
that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Held-to-Maturity — The Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intent and ability to hold such investments
to maturity.

2) Significant estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Loans and Advances — At each financial reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment. The
Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is
determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the
loan‘s net carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If
the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a group of
loans with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of loans
may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national
or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its
future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed
regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined by using
valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however, areas such
as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions
about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Equity Investments — The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when
there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below the carrying amount. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates any evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of prior year's amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These reclassifications
did not affect prior year's reported result.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

On February 14, 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1. The amendments
require an entity to classify as part of its equity those financial instruments that it issues that are either (a) puttable financial instruments,
or (b) financial instruments or components of financial instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rata share
of its net assets only on liquidation, if certain criteria are met. Prior to these amendments, such financial instruments were to be classified as liabilities. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, with early adoption permitted.
Subscriptions by the member countries to the Bank's capital described in Note B are puttable financial instruments that meet the requirements for equity classification under the amended standards. While the standards prior to the amendments required liability classification
by the issuer of puttable financial instruments, the Bank has always reported the subscriptions by the member countries to its capital as
equity. Under the Agreement establishing the Bank, such instruments provide an equal and residual right to its member countries that are
subordinate to the rights of its creditors. The equity classification requirements under the amended standards are fully consistent with and
confirm the Bank's prior classification of these instruments as equity. The amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 relating to puttable financial
instruments were issued after the December 31, 2007 balance sheet date but before the approval of the financial statements. The Bank
early adopted the amendments for the 2007 financial statements. The application of these amended standards had no effects on the
Bank's financial statements.

On March 5, 2009, the International Accounting Standards Board also issued amendments to the disclosure requirements under IFRS 7.
These amendments require additional disclosures of fair value measurements in a three-level hierarchy reflecting the relative reliability of
such measurements based on the significance of the inputs used. Under this hierarchy, the most reliable measurements are those based on
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Bank has early-adopted this amendment, which becomes
effective for financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009.

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations have been issued and will become effective for periods after December 31, 2008. IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which becomes
effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009, replaces the reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements with those used internally by management in the allocation of
resources and assessing performance. The amendments to IAS 1 require the Bank to present in separate statements, changes in equity
related to its shareholders and those related to comprehensive income (i.e. non-shareholder-related components), including related reclassification adjustments of those components. It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial statements when the Bank applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective
restatement. None of these new standards or amendments is expected to have a significant impact on the Bank's financial statements.

 

 

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from its lending
and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk, and operational
risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank's capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk profile consistent
with the highest credit rating.

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors, which
is chaired by the President. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors regularly review trends in the
Bank's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on the Bank’s Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority) and the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority).

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for its borrowers and separate guidelines which prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for the Bank's sovereign
and non-sovereign loan and equity investment portfolios.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the Bank's
financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM Authority covers the Bank's
entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources. It also includes the interest rate and
currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the other
oversight and control organ of the Bank's risk management activities. It is the Bank's most senior management forum on risk management
issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. Among its functions, ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms country and project credit risk ratings
and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including
country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and
financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies
and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential financial
loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign credit risk
on its portfolio of private sector, non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes,
which are described in more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through financial policies and
lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessments. These include the assessment of
the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its sociopolitical conditions and future growth prospects.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Bank's statistical loss expectations as shown in the following table.

1 Excellent Very Low Risk A - BBB
2 Strong Low Risk BB
3 Good ,
: Moderate Risk B
4 Fair
5 Acceptable
pt High Risk ccc
6 Marginal
7 Special Attention
8 Substandard oo
Very High Risk <CCC
9 Doubtful
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance, debt
sustainability, sociopolitical factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and a composite non-sovereign country risk index which in turn are converted into separate country risk
rating for the sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from
accredited rating agencies and other specialized international bodies. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure
compliance with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

Despite the fact that the weighted average credit rating of the sovereign portfolio weakened slightly in 2008, the overall risk profile of the
Bank’s sovereign guaranteed portfolio remained relatively stable. The portfolio’s weighted-average risk rating at the end of 2008 remained
virtually the same at 2.68 compared to 2.67 at the end of 2007. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s five credit
risk classes is shown in the table below.

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2008 37% 33% 6% 16% 8%
2007 37% 31% 8% 15% 9%
2006 28% 35% 10% 17% 10%
2005 26% 26% 18% 17% 13%
2004 28% 28% 21% 11% 12%
2003 25% 32% 21% 16% 6%

It is the Bank's policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes 30 days
overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors
for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on
all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid. These countries also become
ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.50% on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Annual Report 2008

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties to service their debts to the Bank on a timely basis. As previously
described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment in its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with the assessment of the incurred
loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital cushion for sovereign credit risks. The Bank's capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for all creditsensitive assets (loans and equity investments) plus contingent liabilities (guarantees and client risk management products) in each risk
class". At the end of 2008, the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio used up 40% of the Bank's total risk capital based on the Bank’s capital
adequacy framework. This compares with 37% at the end of 2007 and reflects the increased demand for sovereign products. The Bank
defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of translation adjustments. Callable capital is not included
in the computation of risk capital.

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to enclave projects it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees. The Bank may also
provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses a similar uniform internal credit risk rating as for sovereign
projects. However, these internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of four major groups of factors.

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the project company’s financial strength. This assessment looks at:
1) capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; 2) the company's operating performance and profitability;
3) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: 1) the outlook of the industry in which the project company
operates; 2) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; 3) the strength of the project company’s management
with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; 4) the quality of the information on which the analysis is based.

Thirdly, the risk factors that consider the structure of the facility in terms of maturity, the existence of third party guarantee(s), the value
of any assigned collateral and other credit enhancement are extensively examined.

Finally, the project company's risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

All new non-sovereign projects require a minimum initial credit rating and undergo rigorous project approval. The ALCO reviews the
non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend changes if justified by evolving country and project
conditions.

In 2008, the Bank increased its exposure to the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios. The weighted-average risk rating improved
marginally from 3.82 at the end of 2007 to 3.66 at year-end 2008. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the Bank's five
credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

 

' Reflecting its higher risk operating environment and unavoidable portfolio concentrations, the Bank requires risk capital backing that is three to ten times more conservative than BIS commercial banking standards. Very low risk = 25%, low risk = 28%, moderate risk = 35%, high risk = 50%, very high risk = 75%, and equity
investments = 100%.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2008 13% 16% 41% 28% 2%
2007 8% 10% 46% 31% 5%
2006 16% 15% 52% 6% 11%
2005 14% 20% 56% 7% 3%
2004 15% 14% 55% 10% 6%
2003 - 20% 62% 10% 8%

In compliance with the revised IFRS, the Bank no longer makes general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing nonsovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2008, the impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired loans in the
non-sovereign portfolio was UA 12.39 million compared to UA 12.13 million in 2007 because of the stability in the size of the portfolio
of impaired non-sovereign loans.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector projects, either directly or through investment
funds. To the extent possible, equity investments are carried at fair value. In the event that the fair value of an equity investment cannot be
reliably determined, it is carried at amortized cost, and periodically assessed for impairment. The Bank recognizes loss provision based on
accepted impairment tests measured against the carrying cost of the equity investment. At the end of 2008, the provision for impairment
on equity investment was UA 20.77 million.

© cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks. At the end of 2008, the Bank's non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately
7.1% of the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk capital sources, compared to 5.3% at the end of 2007. This level was still well below the
imit of 20% determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign operations.

Credit Exposure Limits

he Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio. The Bank manages credit
tisk at the global level (combined sovereign guaranteed and non-sovereign guaranteed portfolios) by ensuring that in the aggregate, the
‘otal country exposure limit does not exceed 20% of the maximum sustainable portfolio. The maximum sustainable portfolio is determined as the largest outstanding portfolio (outstanding loans plus potential new lending) that can be supported by the current level of
tisk capital applying the Bank's capital adequacy policy. Each specific country limit is based on the economic potential of the country and
erceived risk level. Country exposure limits are reviewed annually and are used as a risk-based benchmark to plan the Bank's medium
erm country assistance strategies.

he credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by limiting exposures to certain industry sectors, equity investments
and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to parially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

n the normal course of business, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these
inancial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation
0 the Bank.

 

Annual Report 2008

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Given the nature of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Bank minimizes
this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank's minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For
local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate availability of investment
opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies. ALCO approves counterparties that

are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings are closely
monitored.

Trading counterparties are required to be rated at a minimum of A/A2.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years

MBS/ABS No maturity limit, but repayment projections mandatory

The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa; money market mutual funds
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3; and enters into collateralized securities repurchase agreements.

As a rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any
transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A- for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include
swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 8% of the Bank's total risk capital for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit
exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Bank's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

The counterparty credit exposure of the investment and derivative portfolios continues to be predominantly AA or higher rated as shown

in the table below. The increase in the AAA rated exposure reflects the increase in investments in agency and supranational securities. The
impact of the on-going worldwide financial crisis is reflected by a sharp increase in exposure to lower rated counterparties.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity risk arises
when there is a maturity mismatch between liabilities and assets. The Bank's principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold suficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon without additional financing from the
capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML)
ased on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The PML is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four
components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net loan disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater
han zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; and 4) undisbursed equity investments.

 

o strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if required, the
Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank's core liquidity portfolio
(operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to meet the Bank's short term liquidity needs. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the Bank maintains a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also
invested in relatively liquid securities to cover its expected medium-term operational cash flow needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and
borrowings with embedded options are included in the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. A third tranche of
liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities designated as “held-to-maturity”
investments (HTM). Only HTM investments with a remaining maturity of one year or less are considered as liquid investments in the determination of the Bank's minimum liquidity requirements.

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its risk bearing capacity, the Bank's principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation risk due to fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the currency composition of the SDR (UA).
The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any
one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which they were borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency
mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to the SDR),
the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates fluctuate. The Bank's policy
is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by matching, to the extent possible, the
currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the Unit of Account). In line with this policy, throughout 2008
the Bank's currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band of the risk-neutral position in each of the currencies making up the SDR
composition. In keeping with the Bank's currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to realign the net
assets to the SDR basket each time there is a revision to the SDR currency composition. As a result of these policies and practices, despite
sharp movements in the values of the major currencies during 2007 and 2008, the Bank experienced translation adjustment loss of less
than 0.20% of net assets during the two years.

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The distribution of the
currencies of the Bank's recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in Euros, USD and Tunisian Dinar.
For 2008, the Bank's strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to cover the estimated currency composition of expenses
mitigated the unfavorable impact of those currencies movements during the year.

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies, namely the US dollar,
Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the International Monetary Fund every
five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2006. The SDR rate represents the sum of the interest rate of each currency
that is determined based on the weight and the representative exchange rate and interest rate of each currency.

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank's net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange rate of
the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes a separate 10%
appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change in the African currency holdings from 2007 to 2008, the 2008 table also includes the effect of a 10% appreciation/depreciation of each African currency against the
SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal change in net assets as a result
of currency mismatches.

Interest Rate Risk
The Bank's interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding such assets;
2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not overly sensitive
to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt
Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin on assets
funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost of
a dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds pass-through formulation
incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's pool-based loans has traditionally helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity
of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining demand for this product in favor of market-based loans,
he Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (market-based loans).
For the market-based loan products, the Bank's net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the
joans with that of the Bank's underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank may also provide borrowers with risk
management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of its market-based loan products. Although it retains
he credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche. The portfolio of
iquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank's liquidity policy and uses a six-month Libor floating rate
enchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor
loating rate benchmark.

he Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding is required
‘or one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all new borrowings into
loating rate in one of the Bank's active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where the Bank issues structured debt,
he Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired six-month Libor-based floating rate
unding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting the amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one year
(0 25% of the outstanding debt portfolio.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity

he second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant portion of
he Bank's assets with equity resources. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity resources (the SDR) affect
he net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower lending and
investment rates, which in the long-term; reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank's equity resources.

he Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the net
interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the assets funded
by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark. The Bank's repricing profile
benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10% of the Bank’s assets funded by equity reprice in each year. Using this benchmark,
he Bank's net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a ten-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.
At the end of 2008 and 2007, the Bank's overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual buckets. For
net assets repricing within one year, the Bank had a manageable gap relative to the benchmark.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity

The table below details the repricing gap by currency as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A parallel upward shift in the SDR
curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum loss of UA 5.97 million and UA 8.13 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

(UA millions} 2008 2007
USD 177 304
EUR 311 379
GBP 67 78
JPY 42 52

Total repricing gap 597 813

Loss due to a 100bps upwards shift in the SDR curve Doll 8.13

Fair Value Sensitivity

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements at fair
value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of the currencies
in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. However,
due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis for assets and liabilities denominated in
Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 20 bps.

Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios 177,141 65,809 (182,492) (74,278)

Prepayment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans committed
before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level of prepayments has
generally been within acceptable levels. In 2003 and 2004, however, driven by low market interest rates, contracting credit spreads for
emerging market borrowers and enhanced debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total loan prepayments increased sharply
to UA 471 million and UA 542 million, respectively. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70 million, due in
large part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk
by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298
million included an amount of UA 192 million in respect of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007; total prepayment amounted to
UA 199 million, of which 98% related to market-based loans. Prepayment in 2008 amounted to UA 17 million.

Operational Risk

he Bank defines operational risks to include all aspects of risk-related exposure other than those falling within the scope of credit, market and liquidity risks including specifically the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or
from external events and reputational risk.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is also exposed to controls and operational risks arising from its systems, functions and interdependencies among its departments, which could impact broadly its activities with a possible consequence of operational losses. There are
also many interdependencies among risk factors that may result in an operational risk loss.

Following approval by the Board of Directors in 2004, the Bank established an Internal Control Unit (ICU) to among other duties implement the COSO control framework to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls in all significant business operations, as
he start of a broader and phased Operational Risk Management Program. The first phase focused on the documentation and testing of
controls around financial reporting. Management attestation on the adequacy of internal controls was published in the annual reports for
he first time in 2006. Phase two of the implementation extending the COSO framework to other areas of operational risk management
commenced in 2007 and is still ongoing.

he Bank’s revised Capital Adequacy and Exposure Management Policy which is currently under consideration by the Board of Directors
of the Bank, envisages setting aside a risk capital charge of 15% of the average Operating Income for the preceding 3 years, in line with
Basle II recommendations.

 

here are other initiatives or activities in the other areas of the Bank Group that are complementing the work on operational risk management and controls including:

e Review of Code of Conduct and Staff Rules

¢ Fraud and Investigation Unit

¢ Whistleblower Protection Policy

¢ Document Retention Policy

¢ Business Continuity Planning and Preparedness

Effects of Recent Developments in the Financial Markets

Although the Bank was also affected by the global crisis that affected the world financial markets through 2008, as a result of its prudent risk management policies and practices, the impact on the Bank has been reasonably mitigated. With regards to the funding activities, notwithstanding the significant increases in credit spreads, there has been no serious adverse effect on the Bank's ability to borrow
competitively, consistent with the Bank's solid financial position as evidenced by the continued uniform top rating by all the major rating
agencies. The Bank continues to be well placed to play its intermediation role in support of the development financing needs of its member
countries. With regards to investment activities, the trading portfolio suffered a significant realized and unrealized losses while some of
the held-to-maturity and available for sale investments also suffered impairment losses. In 2008, realized and unrealized losses on trading
investments amounted to UA 74.29 million. Impairment provisions on certain financial assets amounted to UA 56.60 million. Actuarial
valuation losses of UA 85.51 million and mark-to-market adjustments on available-for-sale investments of UA 18.18 million were charged
against reserves through the Statement of Recognized Income and Expenses.

securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, crosscurrency swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money
market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum credit rating of A. Over-thecounter (OTC) options on government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does not
exceed 1 year, and such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Cross-currency and interest
rate swaps including asset swap transactions are only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with minimum
credit ratings of AA-/Aa3 at the time of the transaction.

As at December 31, 2008, the Bank had received collateral with fair value of UA 234.50 million in connection with swap agreements. Of
this amount, a total UA 111.79 million was in the form of cash and has been recorded on the balance sheet with a corresponding liability

Loan Swaps

The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into variable
rate income.

Administrative Expenses Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no open positions with respect to the
forward exchange transactions.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases
authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making
their payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in
local currency;
or

2) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the
fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the Fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to the eighth installments shall be paid
in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

NOTE !- LOANS

The Bank's loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other
non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other
freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the
amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended
for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank's own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis
points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency variable terms or retain the terms of their
existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other terms
and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum of two components, namely,
the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on
January 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate loans.
The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank's selected reference interest rate in
each market. The Bank's standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR and JIBAR)
which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency
fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate
to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains
unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank's assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, outstanding loans were as follows:

the guarantee. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31,
2008 and 2007, the Bank had no outstanding guarantee to any entity.

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development
of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African countries, and to provide
financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original
State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

Annual Report 2008160

Chapter 008 African Development Bank

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected
by State Participants. The Fund's Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share of
the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a
cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December 31,
2008 amounted to UA 138.10 million (2007: UA 135.85 million), representing 72.13 percent (2007: 73.06 percent) of the shareable
administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
provides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants in
proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2008, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.78% (2007: 0.86%).

Asa result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note W-2, the net asset value of ADF which
is the basis for determining the value of the Banks investment in the Fund declined in 2007, resulting in impairment loss on the Bank's
investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations plus disbursed and
outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points and are therefore due for MDRI
loan cancellation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations
The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies that are
in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is to promote
the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The Bank's equity
participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting
other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank's equity participation shall not exceed 25% of the equity capital of the entity
in which it invests. The Bank currently holds less than 20% of the total equity capital of most of the institutions in which it participates.
The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments
through Board representation. In the exceptional instances where the Bank has more than 20% but less than 50% ownership, such investments are accounted for as investments in associates. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29,
2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up
capital and reserves and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building. The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions
owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments
are included in the income statement.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank's owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for
the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third
party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.
At December 31, 2008, the book value of such assets is not significant.

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

It is the Bank's policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital resources to 80 percent of the
callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both senior and subordinated debt to

80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries.

As at December 31, 2008 and 2007, the senior and the subordinated borrowings were as follows:

(UA millions) 2008
Senior borrowings 5,964.64
Subordinated borrowings 742.64
Total 6,707.28

6,198.87

As of the same date, the non-borrowing members’ callable capital, total callable capital, the ratio of senior debt to the non-borrowing

members’ callable capital and the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital were as follows:

(Amount in UA millions} 2008

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities and to

lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified dates prior
to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put dates, rather than the
contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain outstanding beyond their earliest

redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings are
converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the two currencies in
order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate payment obli
gation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2008 was UA 5,729.81 million (2007:
UA 5,226.28 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31, 2008
was UA 5,304.60 million (2007: UA 5,106.32 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional amount
plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net gain of UA 12.43 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December 31,
2008 (2007: UA 21.24 million). This included a gain of UA 2.10 million which was attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk during the year ended December 31, 2008 (2007: UA 3.00 million). Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are
determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank's
credit spread on the relevant liquid markets for ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The
Bank's credit spread was not applied for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2008, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses to date
were UA 425.21 million (2007: losses of UA 119.96 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY
Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The Bank is
not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29,
1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments to
the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares to
2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and
callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the
regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the
Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the
authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

The Bank's capital as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:

(WAthousands) 2008 2007
Capital Authorized (in shares of UA 10,000 each) 21,870,000 21,870,000

Less: Amounts in arrears (1,881) (2,235)
Capital at December 31 2,345,804 2,336,457

ncluded in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 104.85 million at December 31, 2008, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing
he balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83 million callable, and
UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of
Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the
Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent
iabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or otherwise does
not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such
successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share
ransfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response
rom the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to interested nonregional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined
he invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s Official Development Assistance its pro-rata
interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries were
fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed at an
exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA
when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on a full-time

asis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of 6 months service without
interruption of more than 30 days.

dministered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November 2004,

he Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits
and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost associated
with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and were recorded in 2004. Also, new members from the local field offices of the Bank
joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million were reported in the 2007 financial statements. In 2008,
he early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior service cost of UA 8.12

ch has been immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax
led in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes

wice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

ions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the

provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive

ctive and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s liabilities. At December 31,

2008, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the following
objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well

as hedging

Annual Report 2008African Development Bank Chapter 005

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity securities,
weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking expectations.
Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and expected long-term
dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk premium. The discount
rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA corporate bonds.

For measurement purposes, the annual growth rate in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to decrease ratably
between the current period and 2010, with the growth rate assumed to remain at that level thereafter.

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by
the Bank.
The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31, 2008 and 2007 for the Staff Retirement Plan:

 

(UA thousands} 2008 2007
Debt securities 84,118 101,993
Equity securities 105,147 127,491

Total 210,294 254,982

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in time deposits.

Pursuant to an arrears clearance arrangement approved by the Board of Directors on March 6, 2009, the arrears owed by Cote d'Ivoire
were repaid through a combination of payments by Céte d'Ivoire assisted by a donor country and contributions by the Fragile States Facility created by the Bank Group. The clearance of the arrears of Céte d'Ivoire provided evidence of the need to adjust the impairment provision previously recognized as a result of the arrears status of the country at December 31, 2008. Accordingly, the impairment allowance
previously recognized on Cote d'Ivoire's loans has been reversed through the income statement in 2008.

NOTE W-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

(i)

(ii

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally co-coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World
Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions
received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual
amount of DRC's arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that
he present value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual
erms. The new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board
of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for

he DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears
DRC created extensive destruction of physica
roposed package would result in a significan

‘0 the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the
assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the
improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken.

Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently
rovided on the consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan.
Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from time to time make
‘o the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation
is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank.
Consequently, income received on the consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves to
he special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

 

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Fragile States Facility

e Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts towards re-engagement
with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool
of resources through a separate facility with allocations from the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to
ill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection, the
Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) under
he administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income of the Bank. The Board of
Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004
net income as the second installment of the Bank's contribution to the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2007/04 of May 17, 2006,
he Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank’s allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net
income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities
of the PCCF and in addition provide broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF is
‘0 consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth
of the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by
eneficiary countries.

 

Annual Report 2008

183Chapter 008 African Development Bank

(iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this initiative,
creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their
debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by
the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or their nominal values, as calculated using
the methodology agreed under the initiatives.Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid
off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates
than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently,
affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values. The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater,
faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative
and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African
countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent
of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between
the decision and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.
At December 31, 2008, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 28 ADB borrowing countries, of which 19 had reached the
completion point.

(iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the
ADF, the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of
their claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to
help 38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt
cancellation would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross
assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to
make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and outstanding
loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in the ADF's net assets. Reduction in ADF
net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund. Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and
when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancellation. The reduction in the net asset
value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

 

 

NOTE W-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Subscriptions ADF Replenishments
The resources of the ADF primarily comprise subscriptions by the State Participants
and the Bank, as well as other resources
received by the Fund including contributions
by the Bank. The cumulative subscriptions
to ADF amounted to UA 18.37 billion at
December 31, 2008, compared to UA 15.28
billion at the end of 2007.

The eleventh general replenishment of the
Fund (ADF-XI) became effective in May 2008
and covers the three-year operational period
starting in 2008 and ending in 2010. As of
December 31, 2008, State Participants had
subscribed a total of UA 2.97 billion, representing 80.27 percent of the ADF-XI target
replenishment level of UA 3.70 billion.

Commitments under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI or Initiative) became effective on
September 1, 2006' and covers the period
2006-2054. To preserve the financial integrity and the financing capacity of the African
Development Fund, donors have committed
to fully compensate the Fund for debts cancelled under the MDRI.

As of December 31, 2008, the Fund had
received from donors aggregate commitments of UA 4.37 billion, representing 78.18
percent of the MDRI cost for the period
2006-2054 of UA 5.59 billion.

Investments

ADF cash and liquid investments amounted
to UA 3.52 billion at December 31, 2008,
compared to UA 3.39 billion at the end

of 2007. Investment income for the year
amounted to UA 109.88 million, representing a return of 3.17 percent, on an average
liquidity level of UA 3.47 billion, compared
with an income of UA 147.25 million in
2007, representing a return of 4.55 percent
on an average liquidity of UA 3.24 billion.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancellations, at December 31, 2008,
amounted to UA 16.76 billion compared
with UA 15.47 billion at the end of 2007.
Total outstanding loans, as at December 31,
2008 were UA 4.87 billion, UA 706.96 million higher than the UA 4.16 billion outstanding as at the end of 2007. This increase
was in spite of debt cancellation under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative for one
additional completion point country during
the year amounting to UA 102.12 million.

 

At the end of 2008, there were 1,615
active signed loans and grants. Also at
December 31, 2008, a total of 538 loans
amounting to UA 4,540.58 million had been
fully repaid.

Disbursements

Disbursements of loans and grants increased
from UA 725.00 million in 2007 to UA
1,124.92 million, representing an increase
of 55.16 percent. As at December 31,
2008, cumulative disbursements on loans
and grants amounted to UA 11.88 billion.
A total of 1,504 loans and grants were fully
disbursed for an amount of UA 9.54 billion,
representing 80.30 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

Financial Results
The Fund earned a surplus of UA 4.66 million

in 2008, compared to UA 31.61 million in
2007. The decrease in the Fund's earnings

was primarily attributable to decreased
investment income, reflecting the difficult
conditions in the financial markets and the
sharp decline of benchmark returns.

Administrative expenses, which represent the
Fund's share of the total shareable expenses
of the ADB Group, also increased by UA 2.25
million, from UA 135.85 million in 2007
to UA 138.10 million in 2008. The Fund's
share of the total shareable expenses of
the ADB group is based on a predetermined
cost-sharing formula, which is driven primarily by the relative levels of certain operational volume indicators. As a result of a
higher average loan balance in 2008, loan
income increased by UA 6.52 million from UA
45.13 million in 2007 to UA 51.65 million in
2008. Discount on the accelerated encashment of demand obligations amounted to
UA 16.18 million in 2008 compared to UA
26.29 million in 2007.

 

a

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy,
service charges on loans made to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from loan
income if principal repayment and service
charges are in arrears for 6 months or more.
As a result of this policy, UA 1.94 million
of non-accrued loan income was excluded
from 2008 income compared to UA 3.57
million in 2007. In addition, UA 5.33 million
of loan income previously not accrued was
recovered and recognized in income in 2008
compared to UA 4.71 million in 2007. The
number of borrowers in non-accrual status
at December 31, 2008 were 4 compared to
5 at the end of December 2007.

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying debts
under MDRI as the relevant countries reach
their HIPC completion points. A summary
of the cumulative loan cancellations under
MDRI and HIPC is presented in Note E to the
Special Purpose Financial Statements.

 

' The effectiveness of the MDRI was triggered when the Fund received Instrument of Commitments representing at least 70% of the total cost of debt relief for 14
post-completion countries, of which not less than amounts equivalent to at least 75% of the cost of debt relief incurred during the ADF-X period, were unqualified

commitments for payments due in 2007.

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007

NOTE A- PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African Development
Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, promote cooperation and
increased international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

The ADF's Board of Directors has twelve (12) members, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President
of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred to as the
Bank Group. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF
is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow. The principal purpose
of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB finances development projects and
programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the
development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries,
particularly the lesser-developed countries.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other resources
received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of the Fund consisted
of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund (the Agreement). Thereafter, the
resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose Financial
Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are not intended to be a
presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources represent resources available
to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and demand obligations of State Participants.
hese special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund,
which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

he significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's special purpose financial statements are as follows:

Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements
e special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of Account as
having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of
MF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles

 

 

Annual Report 2008African Development Fund Chapter 005

of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This
was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund's Unit of Account
to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this
Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect of the Resolution, and
the Fund's UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank's UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the Statement of Net
Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment. Translation
gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

2008 2007
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentine Peso 5.318560 4.454380
Brazilian Real 3.653610 2.797830
Canadian Dollar 1.890960 1.561440
Danish Krone 8.180030 8.020210

Indian Rupee 74.626300 62.277700
Japanese Yen 140.464000 179.947000

Swiss Franc 1.638390 1.778570

United States Dollar 1.540270 1.580250

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting from the rates indicated
above.

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon
submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the ADF receives instruments of
subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the replenishment resolution. The portion
of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet
payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the
replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when
they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant's budgetary appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes. The
notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Annual Report 2008

199200

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

For the ADF-IX, ADF-X and ADF-XI replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with
the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income
generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the
cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on the cash received from State Participants
who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the
effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors of the
Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in that
regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and timely compensation for the
debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

i) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of
he total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs); and

ii) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five
ercent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-X period.

 

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with effect
from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the initiative. Donors will contribute
additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for each replenishment period, by
submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in the
contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing ADF. The contributions received from State Participants
under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which
such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately
disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement which
provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its foreign exchange
value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant shall pay to the
Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of
such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within that participant’s territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's
holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09, 2005-01 and 2008-01,
which in turn stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh
general replenishments, subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms
of agreed parities ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when
received, into UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on
Subscriptions (CEAS).

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified based on the Fund's intention on the date of purchase. Securities which the Fund has the
intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund's management has the positive
intention and ability to hold to maturity. The Fund assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for held-to-maturity investments. If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized
cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present
value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the investment is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of
the loss is recognized in the income statement. All other investment securities are classified as held-for-trading and measured at market
value. Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices where available using the bid prices. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government and agency obligations include
marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries
or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with aAAA
credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less
than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading portfolio. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Loans
The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans are not
included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future.
Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's
loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from
income on loans for that period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of such
charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants
In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the
resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth replenishment, grants
may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations of development resources and
are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

 

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under this initiative,
creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors,
including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Annual Report 2008

201Chapter 005 African Development Fund

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary
country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net
present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received
and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it falls due with
funds received from the Trust Fund.

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), loans due from eligible HIPCs are cancelled when the countries attain the completion
point under the HIPC framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans cancelled under MDRI by additional contributions to be made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the cancelled loans. When MDRI becomes effective for a
country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effectively take on the
character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans cancelled under the MDRI are included in “Net Debt Relief” and reported in the
Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current period’s presentation.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the form of
non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed that the encash
ment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

Annual Report 2008

203204

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing from the
date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per annum and from
years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent
per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date
of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a period of 10
years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers or
others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2008, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 35.57 million (2007: UA 1.90 million).

As at December 31, 2008, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of UA
450.83 million (2007: UA 534.46 million) of which UA 33.24 million (2007: UA 68.89 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual status. If
these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2008, would have been higher by UA
1.94 million (2007: UA 3.57 million). At December 31, 2008, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted
to UA 35.36 million, compared to UA 38.28 million at December 31, 2007.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund’s lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10.00 percent
under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.50 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments were allocated as
grants and grant based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18.00 to 21.00 percent of the total resources under the ninth replenishment were set
aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share
of grants under the tenth and eleventh general replenishments is based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the
seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period, from the
date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible, the grace
period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement of the operations of
existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years

thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

Annual Report 2008African Development Fund Chapter 005

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent
to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the signature of a HIPC
debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present value. The amount of the writedown, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million which was the write-down in respect of the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999
under the original HIPC framework is included in the amount stated as net debt relief in the Statement of Net Development Resources. The
outstanding balance and net present value of the loans owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04
million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the
eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework. Under
the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service reductions
which allow the release of up to 80.00 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total net present value (NPV)
of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is
granted between the decision and completion points. Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2008 amounted
to UA 184.00 million and are shown as allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the International
Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that have
reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development Committee Communiqué of
September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed
with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries
worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously
safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation is delivered by relieving post-completionpoint HIPCs' repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial
integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal
and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded from net
development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund's balance of net development resources. Cancellation
of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2008, a gross amount of UA 4.62 billion (2007: UA 4.51 billion) of outstanding loans had been cancelled under MDRI
for 19 (2007: 18) HIPC completion point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,011.79 million (2007: UA 905.77 million) in nominal terms
were covered by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the covered loans was UA 728.71 million (2007: UA 595.19 million). As of
December 31, 2008, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism
Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC - In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF, the
World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts,
he Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance mechanism,
representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources
rom the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-IX) to clear the entire stock of the DRC's arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized
he use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-VIII as a partial
ayment against the DRC's arrears on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework - The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and integrated
ramework for assistance to eligible states, typically regional member countries of ADB emerging from conflict or crisis. The purposes of FSF
are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth. The
FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities,
in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing
heir loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF, the ADB and private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible
tagile states not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group.
Contributions made by the Fund to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state. Contributions
by the Fund to the Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

 

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to
the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of a special
general increase and eleven general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions and Voting
Power in Note O.

The tenth replenishment, approved by the Board of Governors resolution F/BG/2005/01 adopted on May 4, 2005, covered the three-year
operational period to 2007.

Negotiations for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund (ADF-XI) were concluded on December 11, 2007 when the deputies agreed to a

replenishment level of UA 5.76 billion, of which UA 2.06 billion represents internally generated resources, for the three-year operational
period 2008 to 2010. ADF-XI came into effect on May 8, 2008 after the State Participants had deposited with the Fund instruments of

Annual Report 2008African Development Fund Chapter 005

subscriptions exceeding the threshold of 30% of pledged subscriptions. At December 31, 2008 subscriptions to ADF-XI amounted to
UA 2.97 billion.

At December 31, 2008 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 4.37 billion of which UA 158.57 million
had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid entitle the State
Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note O.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund or a member of the
Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of the
Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources in
the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 267.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 265.30 million, and by the
Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of the
portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based
on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the Bank. While
the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed and
outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.50 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of administering
the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding loans.

Annual Report 2008Chapter 005 African Development Fund

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund
to receive other resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or
bodies.

At December 31, 2008, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 5.48 million (2007: UA 4.31 million) representing the
balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.
NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's offices, staff,
organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing
formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects executed during the year by the
Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 138.10 million (2007: UA 135.85 million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 12-member Board of Directors, of which 6 members are selected by the Bank. The
Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF's voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. In accordance
with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB (the Bank) to carry out its functions,
for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund also
administers trust funds entrusted to it by some of its State Participants.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the special purpose financial statements of the
African Development Fund to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund
Year ended 31 December 2008

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development Fund (« the Fund »») prepared in
compliance with the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B of the Special Purpose
Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2008.

These special purpose financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of submitting approved and audited special purpose
financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund, and
are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with a recognised accounting framework, such as, International Financial Reporting
Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.

ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the special purpose financial statements are free
from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the

accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B of the special purpose financial statements for
the year ended 31 December 2008.

Investments

The cash and liquid investments of the NTF
are denominated in US Dollars and amounted
to UA 229.93 million at December 31, 2008,
compared to UA 196.68 million at the end of
2007. Investment income for 2008 amounted
to UA 5.35 million, representing a return of
2.47 percent, on an average liquidity level of
UA 216.71 million, compared with an income
of UA 10.34 million in 2007, representing a
return of 5.36 percent on an average liquidity
of UA 192.97 million. The decrease in investment income is due mainly to the sharp drop
of money market returns in 2008.

Loan Portfolio
Loans signed, net of cancellations, as
at December 31, 2008, stabilized at UA
240.81 million, about the level recorded as
at December 31, 2007. As at end 2008, there
were 34 active signed loans amounting to UA
54.79 million. There were 35 fully repaid loans
for a total amount of UA 94.82 million.

 

Annual Report 2008

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 5.94 million
in 2007, to UA 8.46 million representing an
increase of 42.42 percent. As at December 31,
2008, cumulative disbursements amounted
to UA 213.15 million. A total of 59 loans
were fully disbursed for a total amount of UA
196.20 million, representing 92.05 percent
of cumulative disbursements.

Risk Management Policies and
Processes

Similar to the African Development Bank,
the Nigeria Trust Fund seeks to reduce its
exposure to risks that are not essential to
its core business of providing development
related assistance, such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risks. Note D to the
Financial Statements provides the details of
the risk management policies and practices
employed by the NTF.

Financial Results
The NTF's income before distributions

approved by the Board of Governors
decreased from UA 19.84 million in 2007

to UA 5.99 million in 2008, due mainly to
the drop of money market returns in 2008
as well as the write-back of provision for
impairment on loans and related charges
receivable in 2007. The net write-back of
provisions for losses on loans and interest
and charges receivable in 2007 amounted
to UA 9.50 million compared to a write-back
of UA 0.03 million in 2008. Investment and
loan income in 2008 decreased by UA 4.99
million and UA 0.52 million, respectively.
Administrative expenses, which represent the
Fund's share of the total shareable expenses
of the ADB group, decreased by UA 1.10
million from UA 2.59 million in 2007 to
UA 1.49 million in 2008. The Fund's share
of the total shareable expenses of the ADB
group is based on a predetermined costsharing formula, which is driven primarily
by the relative levels of certain operational
volume indicators. The Fund's reserves net of
cumulative currency translation adjustments
increased from UA 144.88 million in 2007
to UA 158.19 million in 2008.

he African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank, which is headquarered in Abidjan, COte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund is to
assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect
or a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement
tween the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement expired in April 25, 2006 and has been extended twice for oneyear periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of
he independent review, the Agreement has been extended for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by
he International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. The significant accounting policies of the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest method during the time an investment or loan is
outstanding and held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected
ife of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued in arrears for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading investments.

Functional and Presentation Currencies
he Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In accordance with Article
VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA).

he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one Special Drawing
Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At December 31, 2008, 1 UA
was equivalent to 1.54027 United States dollars (2007: 1.58025 United States dollars).

Currency Translation

ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are transjated from U.S. dollars to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity. Capital replenishments
are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses on conversion of currencies into
UA are included in the determination of net income.

Chapter 008 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets
The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: held-for-trading financial assets, loans and receivables, and held-tomaturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments upon initial recognition.

i) Held-for-Trading Financial Assets
All held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio are
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Held-for-trading financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

ji) Loans and Receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides money,
goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

jij) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management has the intent and ability to
hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Purchases and sales of held-for-trading and held-to-maturity investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon

acquisition of three months or less.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Annual Report 2008Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized upon
discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

he Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be
reliably estimated.

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or held-to-maturity
investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial
asset's original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

 

he impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any
impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

The fair values of investments that are quoted in active markets are based on current bid prices. Fair values of financial assets listed in
inactive markets or unlisted securities, are determined by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data
inputs. These valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models
and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

Fair values for financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been determined using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction, or whether they are exchangeable at all, is not readily determinable. Management
believes these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might differ from the fair
values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Annual Report 2008

225226

Chapter 008 Nigeria Trust Fund

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash flows. Fair values
are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end market equivalent lending rate in that currency, adjusted for
estimated credit risk.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year net
income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual
results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant
judgments and estimates are summarized below:

i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets
with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for
which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset
or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment
as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events)
has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying
amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted
at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.

 

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement.

ji) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Valuation
techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and
comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and
counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could
affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments

In making judgments to designate assets as held-to-maturity, the Fund makes a positive determination at the acquisition date as to
its intent and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

Annual Report 2008Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005

NOTE C - NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

On March 5, 2009, the International Accounting Standards Board issued amendments to the disclosures requirements under IFRS 7. These
amendments require additional disclosures of fair value measurements in a three-level hierarchy reflecting the relative reliability of such
measurements based on the significance of the inputs used. Under this hierarchy, the most reliable measurements are those based on
unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Fund has early-adopted this amendment, which becomes
effective for financial statements for the annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009.

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations had been issued with effective dates after December 31, 2008 and for which the Fund has elected not to early adopt. IFRS
8, Operating Segments, which becomes effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009 replaces the segmental
reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements with those used
internally by management in the allocation of resources and assessing performance. IFRS 8 is not expected to have a significant impact on
the Fund's financial statements. The amendments to IAS 1, require the Fund to present in separate statements, changes in equity related to
its shareholders and those related to comprehensive income (i.e., non-shareholder related components), including related reclassification
adjustments of those components. It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as at the beginning of the earliest comparative period
in a complete set of financial statements when the Fund applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement.
None of these new Standards and amendments is expected to have a significant impact on the Fund's financial statements.

 

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the African Development Bank (the Bank) manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government o
Nigeria. In the course of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources
of the Fund through the Bank's General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority sets out
the guiding principles for managing the Fund's risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk an
operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank's most senior managemen
forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. As part of ALCO’s key functions pertinent to the administration of the Fund,
it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, ani
confirms country credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups tha
report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational
tisk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

 

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines are delegated to the relevan
business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those policies
and guidelines.

Annual Report 2008

227Chapter 008 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund
arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending operations, and counterparty
credit risk. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in
more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a
country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit risk through financial policies
and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessment. These include the assessment
of each country's macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

Country Exposure
The Fund's loans outstanding at December 31, 2008 were to the following countries:

(Amounts in UA thousands)

Annual Report 2008Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The Fund currently lends only to public sector borrowers, and its loans generally carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk rating
scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

| Excellent Very Low Risk A- BBB
2 Strong Low Risk BB
2 one Moderate Risk B

4 Fair

5 Acceptabl

seca High Risk ccc

6 Marginal

7 Special Attention

8 Substandard be os

9 Doubtful Very High Risk Gee
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic performance, debt
sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These country risk ratings are validated against
the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized international bodies. The ALCO reviews the country
ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve
changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

It is the Fund's policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that country,
or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved
loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member
country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

2) Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. The Fund utilizes various financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid resources prior to
disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable
to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Given the nature of the Fund's business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this
risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty
exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the Fund's minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

Annual Report 2008

229Chapter 008 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government Agencies and NAD Ab-[Aa3 Aaa

Supranationals

Banks AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non bank
financial institutions

MBS/ABS No maturity limit, but repayment projections mandatory

AIA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

The Fund invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa; and money market mutual funds
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10% of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit
exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to be predominantly AA or higher rated.

AAA AA A
2008 55% 34% 11%
2007 14% 85% 1%
2006 42% 54% 4%
2005 77% 19% 4%
2004 71% 25% 4%
2003 60% 34% 6%

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to mitigate
liquidity risk, the Fund's investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations.

Currency Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund's resources are denominated.

Annual Report 2008Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005

Interest Rate Risk

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed interest
rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently the available resources.
Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund's equity resources, and is accordingly not hedged.

At December 31, 2008 the Fund had UA 23.91 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2007: UA 32.43 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2% to 4% per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:

Currency and Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis
The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the Fund's assets
are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an impact of approximately

40% on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading investment portfolio. The table below shows the effect

of a parallel yield curve movement of +/-100bps on the portfolio as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

was 2.15% (2007: 5.81%).

NOTE F - LOANS

Loans originated prior to September 22, 2003, carry an interest rate of four per cent (4%) on the outstanding balance. With effect from
September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of June 3, 2003 and the protocol agreement between
the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated September 22, 2003, the interest rate on loans was changed from a flat four per cent
(4%) per annum to a range of 2% to 4% (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding balance and future undisbursed loans. Furthermore, a
0.75% commission is payable on undisbursed balances commencing 120 days after the effective date of the loan. Loans are granted for
a maximum period of 25 years including grace periods of up to 5 years.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At December 31, 2008, all loans
disbursed were repayable in U.S. dollars.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2008

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (“the Fund”) which comprise the balance sheet as at
31 December 2008 and the income statement, the statement of change in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out in notes A to K.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. This report
is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governor of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing
the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions
we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December 2008,
and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

* — Origin of Supply (OOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursement purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated as
evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal.
For example, a French car purchased from a local dealer in Cote d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for France.

** The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to the
Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

Notes:

- Magnitude zeros.
0.00 Magnitude less than 5 per thousand of the unit employed.

Disbursement for Policy-based Loans** a eS ee

 

Source: ADB Financial Control Department.

* — Source of Supply (SOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursement purposes means the country in which the supplier (the primary contractor) is located as
evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a
local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for Céte d'Ivoire.

** The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to
the Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

Notes:

- Magnitude zeros.
0.00 Magnitude less than 5 per thousand of the unit employed.

Refers to the constraint of 40 percent ceiling and/or the mandatory three-year program of economic reforms.

Country figures include the debt relief already committed and delivered under the original HIPC framework.

Dates for completion and decision points are tentative for the interim period and pre-decision point countries, respectively.

Entire or part of HIPC debt relief assistance had already been provided under arrears clearance operations through the FSF (previously PCCF).
Countries have had delays in reaching their completion points, as a result they are expected to fully pay their debt obligations falling due.
DRC is benefiting from exceptional HIPC debt relief assistance.

Total debt relief to be committed is an estimate.

* The arrears clearance of Céte d'Ivoire took place after the year-end but before Board approval of the 2008 financial statements.

** Includes arrears of multinational projects, arrears less than UA 25,000 in some countries, and arrears payments in the process of being regularized.

*** The amount is backed by pledges by certain donors to repay on behalf of the country, under an arrears clearance operation approved in 2007. The arrears are
therefore expected to be cleared following the fulfillment of such pledges. On the basis of such pledges and consistent with the terms of the arrears clearance
operation, the country was not under sanctions with the Bank Group at December 31 2008.

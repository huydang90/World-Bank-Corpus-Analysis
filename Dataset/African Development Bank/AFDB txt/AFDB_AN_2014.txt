Annual Report 2014Message from the President of
the African Development Bank Group and
Chairperson of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka

President of the African Development Bank Group

| am pleased to submit the Bank Group’s Annual Report for
2014. Despite a challenging global economic environment, the
Bank reports a very satisfactory operational outturn with new
commitments of USD 7.3 billion for projects and programs—a
15.1% increase over the previous year. The focused approach
was maintained with the bulk of funding going to infrastructure
and economic integration.

In spite of global financial turbulence, the Bank has maintained
excellent financial health and robust risk-bearing capacity, as
reaffirmed by all four major rating agencies at AAA for the
Bank’s senior debt, with a stable outlook. This is largely due
to strong shareholder support, prudent financial management,
sound capital adequacy and an enhanced risk management
framework.

In 2014, most African countries maintained robust economic
growth, several of them well above 7%, despite the decline in
commodity prices and the Ebola epidemic in three countries of
the Mano River Union area. Prospects in the New Year remain
solid, driven by investment, private consumption, growing
regional trade and sound macroeconomic foundations.

Annual Report 2014

The last 12 months have been a special period for the Bank:
the 50th Anniversary and particularly, the return of the Bank to
its Headquarters after 11 years of relocation in Tunis. | take this
opportunity to express my appreciation to all those who made
this possible —the Tunisian and Ivoirian Authorities, the Board
of Directors, Management and staff of the Bank. It is thanks to
the combined endeavor and commitment that we were able
to overcome the logistical challenges while assuring business
continuity in this complex process of the return to Abidjan.

The year 2015 will be a crucial one for international development.

Decisions taken will influence the development landscape for
along time, from agreement on the post-2015 development
goals and, hopefully, a deal on climate change. Of critical
importance will be the funding architecture for the Sustainable
Development Goals and as well as climate mitigation and
adaptation. The Addis Ababa Financing for Development
Conference in July 2015 will be a major landmark.

In the next few weeks, | will be handing over the reins of the
Institution to my successor, to be elected in May 2015. It has
been a singular honor and privilege to lead this great organization
over a decade at such a pivotal time for Africa. | thank the
shareholders, ADF State Participants, partner institutions in
the public and business sectors for their support. Together,
we have been able to triple the Bank’s capital resources and
more than doubled its portfolio.

We were able to provide strong counter-cyclical response
during the global financial crisis while avoiding strategic drift.

A special word of thanks to the successive Boards of Directors
and staff, with whom we have, together, steered the Institution
over the last decade.

Looking forward, let us continue to strive to contribute to
building a prosperous continent in accordance with the
roadmap, so well articulated in the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy.
My best wishes to you all.

President, African Development Bank Group,
Chairperson of the Boards of DirectorsExecutive Summary

The Bank’s 2014 Report distinguishes itself from previous
reports in a number of ways. First, it commemorates the
50th anniversary of the establishment of the Bank, now the
premier development finance institution in Africa. At end-2014,
the Bank had 1,932 staff, including 574 in the field, anda
capitalization of some USD 100 billion.

Second, it reports on an exceptional year in the African economy.
Earlier in the year, a number of West African countries were hit
by the Ebola epidemic, whose socio-economic repercussions
were felt in the rest of Africa and beyond. Later in the year, oil
and gas prices collapsed threatening macroeconomic stability
in net oil-exporting countries and creating opportunities to
net oil-importing economies.

Third, the Report tells the story of how the Bank responded
to the multiple challenges the continent faced, even as it
returned to Abidjan, maintaining momentum in operations
and preserving staff and client morale.

This Executive Summary highlights the Bank’s achievements
and challenges in the face of these and other scenarios, with
candor. It also outlines the operational strategies and policies
crafted by the Bank to implement its Ten-Year Strategy anchored
on Inclusive Growth and Transition into Green Economy.

High Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity
Growth in 2014 and mid-term outlook. Africa grew in 2014
by 3.9 percent, a marginal improvement on the 3.5 percent
growth recorded in 2013 and higher than the global growth
rate of 3.3 percent. There were variations across different
country and regional groupings. At 7.1 percent in 2014,
compared to 4.7 percent in the previous year, East Africa
recorded the highest growth, propelled by rapid growth in
Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania.

Despite the persistence of conflict in parts of the West Africa
region, the heavy human and economic toll wrought by the
Ebola epidemic, and the sharp decline in oil prices, the region
grew on average from 5.7 percent in 2013 to 6.0 percent in
2014, with Cdte d’lvoire and Nigeria growing at 8.3 and 6.3
percent, respectively. The expansion of the non-oil sectors
in the Central Africa region helped it post an average growth
rate of 5.6 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in 2013. A
multitude of bottlenecks in South Africa, the region’s major
economy, including shortages of electricity and strained
industrial relations has seen the slow-down of growth in the
Southern African Region as a whole to 2.7 percent from 3.6
percent in 2013. Growth in North Africa edged marginally
higher, to 1.7 percent from the 1.6 percent recorded in 2013.

At the continental level, growth was highest in the Low-income
Countries. Cdte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), and Ethiopia, for example, grew by more than 8 percent.

Additionally, the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in Guinea,
Liberia, and Sierra Leone in March 2014, with some cases also
reported in Nigeria, Mali, and Senegal, led to severe reversals
in the economic growth of the most affected countries.

The sharp decline in global oil prices in the second half of
2014 had both positive and negative impacts on the African
economies. Rising deficits in the fiscal balances and the
resultant pressure to run down foreign reserves or borrow from
external sources could derail growth in oil-exporting countries,
particularly Angola, Chad and Nigeria. On the other hand, the
fall in oil prices could release much needed foreign exchange,
creating a potential for better growth in oil-importing countries.

Projections of Africa’s medium-term growth remain favorable.
Growth on the continent is forcast at 4.5 percent for 2015,
and should strengthen by a further 5.0 percent in 2016. At
such high growth rates, Africa will remain the world’s secondfastest-growing continent, after Asia.

East Africa is expected to register moderate growth of 5.6 percent
in 2015, rising to 6.7 percent in 2016. Central and West African
regions are expected to grow by 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent,
respectively in 2015, rising to 5.8 and 6.1 percent, respectively, in
2016. Despite the continued turmoil in Libya, growth in North Africa
is expected to see a strong rebound, up from 1.7 percent in 2014
to at 4.5 percent in 2015. This will be a significant turnaround from
the economic stagnation that has marked the region since 2011,
the beginning of the Arab Spring. Meanwhile, growth in Southern
Africa is expected to remain weak as its largest economy, South
Africa, continues to face major hurdles. However, solid growth in
Mozambique and Zambia should lift the region’s growth to 3.1
percent in 2015, up from 2.7 percent in 2014.

Macroeconomic stability. Prudent monetary and fiscal
policies pursued by most African governments helped sustain
macro stability. The result was a marginal increase in inflation
in 2014 to 7.2 percent from 7.0 percent in 2013. Although
high when compared to other parts of the developing world,
inflation on the continent was much lower than it has been
in recent years. Projections for the medium term reflect that
inflation in Africa will be moderate, underpinned by a continued
fall in international food and oil prices.

Meanwhile, Africa saw a decline in its current account balance,
due to weak external demand, particularly from China, and
lower export earnings due to low commodity prices, including
for oil. The average deficit on the continent widened to 3.7
percent of GDP from 2.2 percent in 2013.

Annual Report 2014External financing. External financial flows to Africa in 2014
grew to a record USD 200 billion, some four times the figure for
2000. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) was at USD 60.4 billion,
up from USD 57.2 billion in 2013. The principal recipients of
this FDI were Nigeria (USD 6.5 billion), Morocco (USD 4.8
billion), South Africa (USD 4.8 billion), and Mozambique (USD
4.1 billion). Remittances from the African Diaspora, the largest
source of foreign financial flows to the continent, rose by
more than 10 percent to USD 67.1 billion. Meanwhile, Official
Development Assistance (ODA) was estimated at USD 55.2
billion, marginally lower than the USD 55.8 billion recorded
in 2013. This decline reflects a trend that began in 2000.
However, ODA remains the largest single source of external
financial flows to Africa’s Low-Income Countries (LICs).

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since their
adoption at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in
2000 by Heads of State and Government, the MDGs have
been a strong rallying force to significantly reduce extreme
poverty, hunger, disease and achieve social progress by 2015.
The Bank’s support to the MDG agenda in Africa included the
implementation, facilitation and hosting of programs designed to
improve access to water and sanitation, health and education, and
also the preservation of natural habitats and the environment, and
building resilience to the effects of climate-change. More recently,
following the adoption of its comprehensive gender strategy, this
support has included ensuring mainstreaming of gender in all of
the Bank's programs and projects in Regional Member Countries.
At another level, the Bank worked closely with the African Union
Commission (AUC), the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA),
and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on the
Post-2015 Development Agenda. The most important outcome
of this collaboration was the articulation of the “Common African
Position”, approved by the Summit of Africa’s Heads of State
and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January 2014.

The Quest for Inclusive Growth in Africa. Africa's economic
growth in the past decade averaged about 5 percent. However,
this rapid growth has not been translated into appreciable
reductions in poverty and inequality on the continent. While
AO percent of Africa’s population lives on less than USD 1.25
a day, half of the income generated on the continent goes to
just 10 percent of its population. The high levels of inequality
reflected in these figures underscore the need to intensify the
process towards inclusive growth.

Structural transformation is the key to inclusive growth in
Africa. Critical elements of that transformation should include
competiveness in the global markets and a shift towards
global value chains. Such a shift will demand good quality
and efficient infrastructure. Equipping Africa’s youth with
technical vocational education and the skills that match the
needs of the labor market will additionally help accelerate such

Annual Report 2014

structural transformation. Other conditions include the creation
of an enabling environment for private sector investment,
strengthening good governance, creation of efficient and
robust institutions, and expanding Africa’s markets through
regional integration. Gains in structural transformation will
be reflected in narrower gaps between groups, particularly
between urban and rural areas, in access to income generating
opportunities and modern services.

The African Development Bank has adopted policies and
interventions to promote inclusive growth in Africa. Indeed,
inclusive growth is one of the two principal objectives of its
Ten-Year Strategy (TYS) 2013-2022; transitioning Africa to
green growth, is the other.

Throughout 2014, the Bank approved a number of strategies
and policies that reinforced its commitment to inclusive
growth in Africa. They included support to states under fragile
situations, policies to promote gender equality, strengthening
quality governance and regional integration.

Bank Group Operations in 2014

Overview. Total Bank Group operations in the year amounted
to UA 5.05 billion, 15.1 percent higher than the VA 4.39 billion
approved in 2013. The value of approvals at the ADB window
increased by three-quarters to UA 3.20 billion from UA 1.83
billion in 2013. Approvals for various operations at the ADF
window stood at UA 1.59 billion, some 30 percent below
the amount recorded in 2013 (Figure 0.1). Other approvals
include UA 11.49 million from NTF and UA 244.22 million from
Special Funds. The drop in financing by the ADF, the Bank’s
concessional window, was partly due to the slow take-off of
activities in 2014, the first year of the implementation of the
ADF-13 Replenishment.

xiThe Bank’s efforts to diversify its client base helped extend
ADB public-sector lending to 11 countries, almost double
the number in 2013. The ADB private-sector window helped
leverage some UA 13.0 billion in co-financing, more than
double the year’s target of UA 6.0 billion.

Bank Group Disbursements. During 2014, loans and
grants disbursed by the Bank Group amounted to UA 3.16
billion, a 0.7 percent rise over 2013 levels. However, this
amount excludes financing drawn from Special Funds, equity
participation and guarantees. The continued decline in the
disbursement rate is of major concern to the Bank Group
Management and the Boards of Directors. From a peak of
93.8 percent in 2012, this declined to 88.0 percent in 2013
and in 2014 fell further to 70.1 percent. The decline in the
disbursements is linked to weaknesses in some key portfolio
performance indicators, including the time lags between loan
approval and issue of the first disbursement, the frequency
of project supervision, and the “quality at entry” of projects.
Slippages in country systems, inadequate policy dialogue, an
insufficient field presence, and weak project implementation
units are other factors.

The Bank Group's Five Operational Priorities

Bank Group interventions in 2014 focused on the five priorities
of the Bank’s TYS namely, infrastructure, regional integration,
private sector development, skills and technology, and
governance and accountability. Total Bank Group loan and
grant approvals amounted to UA 4.50 billion in the year. More
than half of that amount was allocated for infrastructure projects
in energy, transport, and water and sanitation (Figure 0.2).
Approvals for finance were at 17.9 percent of loans and
grants and mainly targeted at support for the continent’s
small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in order to ease
their financing constraints and promote financial inclusion.

Figure 0.2 Sectoral Distribution of Bank Group Loan and
Grant Approvals, 2014 (UA 4.50 billion)

Close to 11% of loans and grants was assigned to enhance
food security and productivity in the agricultural sector. The
Bank’s support to infrastructure, governance and related
reforms, particularly through improving markets and services
has additional important impacts on agricultural productivity
and performance. The social sector took up 8.2 percent
of total approvals. The funding was for skills development,
technological innovation, and improvement of health-care
service delivery.

Regional Economic Integration. Total approvals for regional
(multinational) operations amounted to UA 1.08 billion in 2014.
Nearly 75 percent of the amount was in loans and grants, 24.5
percent in private guarantees and equity participation, and 1.1
percent in drawdowns on Special Funds. Total approvals for
regional projects saw a drop of 18.2 percent from the UA 1.32
billion approved in 2013. This was due to the unavailability
of new, large-ticket infrastructure (transport and energy) and
regional integration projects in 2014.

The largest share of regional project approvals financed lines
of credit to micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises, trade
finance, guarantees and equity participation. A total of 21.5
percent of funding approvals went to the agricultural sector.
The social sector took up 19.6 percent of funding approvals
and infrastructure 18.6 percent, compared to 51.8 percent in
2013. This drop was due to fewer large transport and energy
projects presented for funding in 2014.

Multinational approvals for the social sector, as a percentage
of total approvals, increased nearly tenfold to 19.6 percent in
2014 from 2.3 percent in 2013. This increase was largely due
to emergency interventions that the Bank undertook in 2014,
notably in the fight against the Ebola epidemic in West Africa,
for which it provided, UA 147.9 million, mainly in grants. The

Annual Report 2014Bank's investments in epidemic were targeted primarily at
he strengthening of public health systems, budget support
to fight the Ebola epidemic, and technical assistance to the
hree most-affected countries to enhance their capacities to
respond to the crisis.

Private-Sector Operations. The Bank approved a total of
UA 1.59 billion to finance 48 new private-sector operations
in 2014. This was a notable increase of 51.4 percent above
he VA 1.05 billion approved in 2013. Fifty-one percent of
approvals were for the finance sector (Figure 0.3). This was
lower than the 65.5 percent of total approvals that went to
he sector in 2013. A total of 38.8 percent of approvals were
or private sector investment in infrastructure, mainly in energy
and transport.

 

The establishment of Africa50 in 2013, and its eventual
incorporation in Morocco, in 2014, was a landmark in the
Bank’s shift towards mobilizing innovative financing for the
development of infrastructure in Africa. The Bank provided UA
86 million to Africa50 as seed money to catalyze additional
financing from traditional and non-traditional sources of
financing in Africa and abroad.

Management of the Ebola Crisis. The Bank’s response
to the Ebola epidemic was, as indicated above, both timely
and effective, and aimed at supporting those at risk as well
as alleviating the socio-economic impact of the disease. The
funds were channeled through the World Health Organization
and directly to individual governments.

Transitioning to Green Growth. The promotion of green
growth is critical to preserving the African environment and
ensuring that the continent’s natural resources are managed in
a sustainable manner. In keeping with its green growth agenda,
the Bank approved UA 33.2 million for four climate-change
mitigation and adaptation projects in 2014. These included
operations to rehabilitate and strengthen the Lake Chad Basin
ecosystem and UA 2.1 million to support community work
to reduce deforestation in the DRC’s Virunga-Hoyo region.
Two renewable energy projects approved in 2014 will also
promote the transition to green growth. The Ouarzazate Solar
Complex Project (Phase II) in Morocco (UA 166.4 million) will
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by some 522,000 tons,
thus mitigating the effects of climate change. Also, the Xina
Solar One Project in the Republic of South Africa (UA 64.9
million) is expected to produce 6,927 MW power through
renewable energy by 2017.

Areas of Special Emphasis

The three areas of special emphasis in the Bank’s TYS are
agriculture and food security, gender, and countries in fragile
situations.

Annual Report 2014

Agriculture. The Bank's total approvals for agriculture and
rural development in 2014 amounted to UA 545.4 million, of
which UA 488.3 million (89.5 percent) was for loans and grants
for 18 multinational and 17 national initiatives. The approvals
included programs and projects for emergency relief, food
security, and nutrition, including the Somalia/Sudan/Eritrea/
Ethiopia Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihood
Program and the CILSS Program to Build Resilience to Food
and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS). The program
covers Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania,
Niger, and Senegal.

Gender. Approval of the Bank’s Gender Strategy in January
2014 was a hallmark of the Bank's preparatory work on more
targeted gender interventions. The strategy emphasizes the
reduction of gender inequalities, by strengthening women’s
legal and property rights, promoting women’s economic
empowerment, and enhancing knowledge management and
capacity building for gender equality in Bank operations. A
number of Bank Group operations address gender in very
specific terms. Examples include the Malawi Sustainable
Rural Water and Sanitation Infrastructure for Improved Health
and Livelihoods Project, and the Mozambique Economic
Governance and Inclusive Growth Program.

States under Fragile Situations. Bank approvals for operations
in countries facing fragile situations amounted to UA 365.8
million in 2014. A total of UA 27.8 million was for budget
support for countries in fragile situations also affected by the
Ebola epidemic. Three multinational (regional) operations of
the Bank Group were approved in 2014 to address socioeconomic challenges with the aim of assisting countries to
move out of states of fragility. These operations are:

¢ The Program to Build Resilience in the Sahel (P2RS). The
goal of the program is to address fragility and build the resilience of vulnerable populations against food and nutrition
insecurity and other socio-economic challenges in the Sahel;

¢ The Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Program
(DRSLP) in the Horn of Africa. Among other benefits, this
program is to address state fragility and strengthen the
capacities of beneficiary countries to enhance resilience
to drought; and

e The Program to Rehabilitate and Strengthen Resilience
of the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystems (PRESIBALT). This
is to directly benefit 15.3 million people living in the Lake’s
impact area.

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Governance

Institutional Reforms. The return of the Bank to its
Headquarters in Abidjan was one of its main preoccupations

xiilin 2014. Although carefully planned, the shift raised some
apprehension among staff and their families, especially with
regard to issues of housing, schooling, and health services
in Abidjan. By all accounts, however, the shift was much
smoother than anticipated, due in large measure to cooperation
of the Tunisian and Ivorian Governments, and commendable
planning by staff and the Board. By September 2014, the
Board of the Bank was able to resume business at the Bank
Headquarters in Abidjan, while the numbers of staff arriving
at its Headquarters continued to rise each month.

Other institutional reforms during the year included
continued budget reforms and implementation of the Bank’s
decentralization roadmap as well as changes to the Bank’s
organizational structure. The budget reforms aimed to align
resource allocation to the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy, as well
as provide for flexibility in the implementation of the Bank’s
work programs. The Bank’s far-reaching decentralization
effort was subjected to a mid-term review (MTR) in 2014.
Management agreed to the its main recommendations and
as a follow-up agreed to update the Bank’s Decentralization
Roadmap Action Plan for consideration by the Board in 2015.
The 2013 fine-tuning of the Bank's organizational structure
led to the creation of the following key structures in 2014:

e The Business Development Office to launch and operationalize Africa50, and similar business development initiatives, by
the Bank, designed to address Africa’s infrastructure deficit;

e The Bank Group Risk Management function under a Group
Chief Risk Officer, reporting directly to the President;

¢ The African Natural Resources Center to scale up work in
natural resources management;

¢ The Financial Sector Development Department to guide
the initiation and growth of the Bank’s business within a
rapidly-changing African landscape;

 

¢ The Delivery and Performance Management Office to manage the “Executive Dashboard” and provide early warning
on areas of slippage; and

e Upgrading of the Fragile States Unit to a fully-fledged
department re-named the Transition Support Department.

Policies and Strategies. The Boards of Directors approved the
following 7 policies and strategies in 2014: (i) The Governance
Strategic Framework and Action Plan (GAP II), 2014-2018; (ii) the
Gender Strategy 2014-2018; (iii) the Strategy for Addressing
Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa, 2014-2019; (iv) the
Policy on Diversifying the Bank’s Products to Provide Eligible
ADF-only Countries Access to the ADB Sovereign Window;

XIV

(v) the Bank Group Regional Integration Policy and Strategy,
2014-2023; (vi) the Bank’s Human Capital Strategy for Africa,
2014-2018; and (vii) the Financial Sector Development Policy
and Strategy, 2014-2019.

Development Effectiveness. With the Boards’ approval of the
Bank's Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) in December 2013,
no effort was spared in 2014 to ensure that its operations are
assessed and managed according to this system. The newly
adopted ISS is expected to enhance the Bank’s ability to
identify and minimize the risk of doing harm while working with
communities, protect the environment and promote sustainability.

Intermediate Recourse Mechanisms. The Office of the Auditor
General during 2014 reviewed a number Bank operations and
recommended changes in policies and procedures to Management.
The Bank's corporate governance culture remained robust, with
due attention given to cases reported to the Staff Integrity and
Ethics Office. The latter carried out an intensive awareness
program in 2014 to mitigate reputational risks which could
arise from lack of information with respect to issues of integrity
and ethics in undertaking the Bank’s work. With respect to the
Independent Review Mechanism, the Bank undertook outreach
missions in 2014 to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,
and Mauritania. These improved awareness of the mandate and
functions of its Independent Review Mechanism among Bank
staff, national officials and other stakeholders.

Operations Evaluation. |n 2014, several important evaluations
of the Bank’s operations were successfully delivered. Two
evaluations focused on aspects of the Bank'’s infrastructure
and private sector work. Three Country Strategy and Program
Evaluations were delivered for Botswana, Chad and Madagascar,
and further, two important corporate evaluations were completed.
These were the evaluation of Quality at Entry for CSPs/Regional
Integration Strategy Papers (RISPs) and the evaluation of
efficiency and effectiveness of the Bank’s procurement function.

Boards of Directors. The Boards of Directors continued
to exercise their oversight and fiduciary functions relating to
various operations, policies and strategies of the Bank. Activities
undertaken by the Boards of Directors in 2014 included: (i) the
Boards’ Response to the Ebola epidemic, including an exceptional
virtual meeting during the August 2014 recess, and approving
programs aimed at containing the epidemic; and (ii) diversification
of Funding Sources by which, in April 2014, the Board approved
the establishment of two new and innovative financing vehicles,
namely, Africa50, and the Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF).
The Boards also undertook official visits to a number of Regional
Member Countries, namely Burundi, Comoros, the DRC, Sudan,
Cabo Verde, Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland and Céte d'Ivoire. In
Céte d’lvoire, members of the Boards familiarized themselves
with progress on the Bank's return to its Headquarters.

Annual Report 2014The Boards emphasized policy and programing frameworks,
notably Country Strategy Papers, as the entry points for the
Bank’s work in Regional Member Countries including the
design of inclusive projects, fostering economic diversification
and strengthening the countries’ focus on agriculture and
food security.

Boards of Governors. At the Bank’s 2014 Annual Meetings
held in Kigali, Rwanda, the Boards of Governors discussed
the challenges and opportunities posed by Africa’s quest
for structural transformation and what the Bank can do to
support its RMCs as they seek sustained and inclusive growth.
A number of Governors participated in panel discussions on
Africa’s progress under the theme of The Next 50 Years: the

Annual Report 2014

Africa We Want. There was a general consensus that there
was no single model for Africa’s economic transformation but
that strong and visionary leadership was critical for success.

Sound Financial Management

Strong financial position. The Bank maintained its sound
financial standing under trying global and regional economic
conditions. Four major rating agencies (Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit Rating Agency)
reaffirmed the Bank’s AAA and AA+ credit ratings for its senior
debt, reflecting its strong capital base, the firm support of its
shareholders, and its prudent financial and risk management.
At the end of 2014, the Bank had paid-up capital amounting
to UA 4.86 billion.

High Growth Despite Regional
and Global AdversityChapter 1 High Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity

This chapter assesses Africa's economic performance in 2014 as well as its medium-term prospects.
It also reviews Africa’s progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
and the prospects for the new Sustainable Development Goals. Africa’s GDP growth in 2014
was 3.9 percent, marginally higher than the 3.5 growth rate achieved in 2013. In light of the many
shocks it experienced during 2014, including low commodity prices and the Ebola epidemic
in West Africa, the continent maintained a high degree of resilience, but with sharp variations
between regions and countries. The medium-term outlook remains positive with growth projected
at 4.5 and 5.0 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively. This outlook is premised on a stronger
world economy and political and social stability in Africa’s regions. The continent, however,
remains sensitive to downside risks emanating from lower commodity prices, tightening global
financial conditions, fiscal vulnerabilities, security issues and the lingering effects of the Ebola
outbreak in parts of West Africa.

1.1 Recent Performance

Africa’s GDP grew at 3.9 percent in 2014, with a better outlook
projected for 2015 and 2016. However, the continent faces
significant headwinds, including soft commodity prices, that
could undermine growth. While inflation rates have remained
relatively stable, fiscal and current account balances have
deteriorated, particularly among net oil-exporting countries.

Real GDP Growth. African countries grew on average by 3.9
percent in 2014, slightly higher than the growth recorded in
2013 (Figure 1.1). The performance varied considerably among
countries and regions, with some doing much better than others.

Among growth drivers, domestic demand remained important,
largely sustained by infrastructure investment and buoyant
service sectors. Agricultural production grew only moderately.
Growth was highest among the continent’s Low-income
Countries, with Céte d’lvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) and Ethiopia growing by more than 8 percent each.

In relative terms, Africa’s growth was higher than that of the
global economy which stood at 3.3 percent, Western Asia
at 2.9 percent, and Latin America and the Caribbean at 1.2
percent. Africa, however, grew slower than the emerging
markets and developing economies of the world, which
registered growth of 4.4 percent.

The performance of the leading economies of the world also
had important implications for Africa’s growth and that of
other developing regions. For instance, while the US economy
performed better than anticipated, growth in the other major
economies, especially in China, Russia, the Euro area, and
Japan, was lower than expected. China’s role in the global
economy and in Africa, reflects the country’s growing influence,
with a shock to its growth having a direct impact on the global
economy and investor perception. In 2014, China grew by 7.4
percent, with growth expected to decelerate to 6.8 percent
in 2015, and to slow down further later in the decade, as its
authorities make changes in economic policy in order meet
domestic objectives. These changes include the demand for
quality domestic goods and services. The Bank estimates
that a 1 percentage point decline in the GDP growth of China,
could take away around 0.1 percentage point growth from
Africa. The most affected African economies would be those

Annual Report 2014driven by the extractive sector, particularly those that rely on
the export of oil.

Performance by Region. A look at Africa by region brings out
some of the differences in the growth performance mentioned
above. In East Africa, average growth was 7.1 percent in
2014, compared to 4.7 percent in the previous year, with
Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Tanzania being the best performers,
growing at 10.3, 7.0, and 7.2 percent respectively. Growth
in West Africa was 6.0 percent, on average from 5.7 percent
in 2013. This was a commendable performance in light of
conflicts in the region, the Ebola crisis, and the decline in oil
prices. Nigeria, which rebased its economy earlier in the year,
posted a growth rate of 6.3 percent.

Central African countries grew at an average of 5.6 percent
in 2014, compared with 4.1 percent in 2013, reflecting
considerable resilience to shocks, which included military
insurrections and the decline in oil prices. Gabon, which grew
at 5.1 percent, saw the expansion in non-oil sectors, especially
timber processing, making up for the fall in oil prices, while
the main drivers of the 8.9 percent growth in the DRC were
mining, agriculture and infrastructure investment.

North Africa continued to recover from the slump in previous
years, recording an average growth of 1.7 percent in 2014,
compared with 1.6 percent in 2013. Algeria witnessed a
resurgence of growth to 4 percent, from 2.8 percent in 2013,
and Morocco recorded growth of 2.7 percent, from 4.7 percent
in 2013. At 2.2 percent, Egypt's growth remained stable. Tunisia’s
relatively smooth political transition was an important factor in
the country’s modest growth of 2.4 percent, from 2.3 percent
in 2013. Continued instability in neighboring Libya (with growth
of -19.8 percent), however, remains a notable downside risk for
Tunisia. The figures above underscore the region's resilience
in the last three years, notwithstanding the complexity of its
underlying social, economic, and political conditions.

High Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity Chapter 1

At 2.7 percent, from 3.6 percent in 2013, growth in Southern
Africa remained sluggish. South Africa, the region's largest and
most influential economy, which had to contend with structural
bottlenecks, strained industrial relations, and low investor and
consumer confidence, posted a growth rate of 1.5 percent, from
2.2 percent in 2013. Growth in other countries in the region
was substantially higher. With growth at 7.6 percent, compared
with 7.4 percent in 2013, Mozambique continued to be the
region's fastest growing economy, driven by foreign investment
in mineral, gas and oil prospecting. Similarly, Zambia and Malawi
both posted impressive growth rates of 5.7 percent each, (from
6.7 and 6.1 percent, respectively, in 2013). Namibia’s economy
grew at 5.3 percent from 5.1 percent in 2013.

Major Developments Affecting
GDP Growth in 2014

The Ebola Epidemic

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) and its socio-economic impact on
the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone
dominated the news on Africa in 2014. According to the World
Health Organization, 20,200 cases of EVD and 7,904 deaths
from the disease had been recorded by the end of December
2014. The epidemic had a significant economic impact. Fears
of the spread of the epidemic left agricultural fields untended.
The scaling-back of tourist flows led to significantly lower hotel
occupancy rates and staff-layoffs, exacerbating unemployment.
A scaling-down of mining operations and a decline in related
activities led to a major withdrawal of investment inflows. Most
affected in this regard were Sierra Leone and Liberia, where mining
accounts, respectively for 17 percent and 14 percent of GDP.

The total fiscal shortfall in the three countries due to the EVD
in 2014 was over half a billion USD, almost 5 percent of their
combined GDP. The lingering indirect effects and investor
aversion indicate a bleak picture for growth in 2015, estimated
at 0.9 percent for Guinea, 3.8 percent for Liberia, and -2.5

percent for Sierra Leone. These projections imply forgone
income across the three countries in 2015 alone of about USD
1.64 billion, or 12 percent of their combined GDP (Table 1.1).

Beyond the three most-affected countries, economic costs due
to the Ebola epidemic will also be incurred across West Africa
in 2015. Disruptions to travel and cross-border trade due to
the epidemic will in 2015 lead to additional losses of more than
half a billion US dollars in the regions outside the epicentre. For
example, The Gambia’s tourism sector was one of the worst
hit by news of the epidemic, with 65 percent of hotel bookings
and 50 percent of inward flights cancelled, despite the country
not having recorded a single case of Ebola. With the tourism
sector contributing 3 percent of The Gambia’s GDP, the country’s
growth forcasts for 2015 have been revised downwards from

fiscal discipline exercised by the governments and the existing
reserve positions of the countries. Thus, growth prospects for
some countries could well deteriorate if the macroeconomic
stance is not changed to address the shock (Table 1.3).

Rebasing Africa’s GDP

Recent years have seen the rebasing of a number of African
economies. This exercise involves replacing an old base year
with a more recent one, which then becomes the reference

Under normal circumstances,
this should be a regular exercise.
However, few countries in Africa
have done this regularly, hence the
large differences between current
and rebased GDP figures seen ina
number of African countries.

Kenya's GDP rebasing exercise in
2014 expanded its economy by 25
percent to USD 55 billion, while that
of Nigeria doubled its GDP to USD
549 billion, making it Africa’s largest
economy. A number of other African
countries also plan to rebase their
economies. A net result is likely to be
a significant change in the size and
structure of the continent’s economy.
Africa’s share of global GDP is likely
to increase.

Performance of Other
Macroeconomic Aggregates
Inflation. The fall in food and oil prices
kept inflation in check, with the average inflation rate rising
marginally to 7.2 percent from 7.0 percent in the preceding year
(Figure 1.3). Relative to other emerging economies and developing
countries, Africa’s average inflation remained high. However, over
the medium term, a moderation is anticipated, underpinned by
a continued fall in international food and fuel prices.

A few countries, including Ghana, Zambia, and Nigeria,

experienced significant macroeconomic imbalances in 2014.

(January 2010=100)

In Ghana and Zambia, exchange rates depreciated sharply,
stoking a rise in inflation, from 11.7 to 17.0 percent for Ghana
and 7.0 to 7.9 percent for Zambia during 2013 and 2014,
respectively. Due to concerns over deteriorations in their fiscal
positions, both countries were downgraded by international
credit rating agencies.

Meanwhile, Nigeria has instituted measures to realign falling

oil revenues and shrinking foreign exchange reserves with

spending priorities. Its central bank devalued the Naira by
more than 13 percent in 2014.

Fiscal Balance. Across the continent, fiscal deficits reached
an average of 5.0 percent of GDP from 3.5 percent in 2013.
However, this aggregate masked variations across individual
countries, and in particular differences between oil-exporting
and oil-importing countries (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). The fall in
oil revenues created fiscal tensions in many oil-exporting
countries, leading to a widening of the deficit to 5.7 percent
from 3.3 percent in 2013. It also, significantly, reduced fiscal
buffers and limited the scope for policy responses in the
event of other exogenous shocks. The fiscal balance in oilimporting countries improved marginally to 4.0 percent, from
4.1 percent in 2013.

Current Account Balance. The fall in commodity prices,
coupled with weak external demand, particularly from China,
weighed down on export receipts for African commodity
exporters. On the other hand, strong demand for capital
goods due to increased public spending on infrastructure
investment led to a rise in the import bill. The result was
deterioration in the current account positions, with the average
current account deficit widening to 3.7 percent of GDP from
2.2 percent in 2013. However, this outturn masked individual
country differences and those between net oil exporters and
net oil importers (Figures 1.4 and 1.5). For net oil exporters,
the current account saw a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP from
a surplus of 0.9 percent in 2013. Net oil-importing countries
recorded a current account deficit of 7.8 percent from 7.3
percent in 2013.

External Financing. External financial flows to Africa in 2014
grew to a record USD 200 billion, some four times the figure
for the year 2000.

FDI was at USD 60.4 billion, up from USD 57.2 billion in
2013. The principal recipients of this FDI were Nigeria (USD
6.5 billion), Morocco (USD 4.8 billion), South Africa (USD 4.8
billion), and Mozambique (USD 4.1 billion). Remittances from
the African Diaspora, the largest source of foreign financial
flows to the continent, rose by more than 10 percent to USD
67.1 billion. Here, Middle-Income Countries (MICs) were the
major beneficiaries, reflecting differences in the profiles of
Africa’s Diaspora. Meanwhile, Official Development Assistance
(ODA) was estimated at USD 55.2 billion, marginally lower
than the USD 55.8 billion recorded in 2013. However, ODA
remains the largest single source of external financial flows
to Africa’s Low-income Countries.

Africa’s resource-rich countries received the bulk of the inflows,

suggesting that natural-resource endowments remain a major
attraction for FDI to Africa.

Annual Report 20141.2 Economic Prospects

The economic outlook for Africa remains largely positive, with
growth and real per capita income projected to rise in the
medium term, especially in Low-income Countries and those
in fragile situations. Risks to this outlook include the possibility
of a further weakening of commodity prices, tighter financial
conditions, a rise in inflation rates, deterioration of fiscal and
current account balances, security problems and the lingering
effects of the Ebola disease outbreak.

Outlook. The medium-term growth prospects for the continent
remain favorable as growth is projected to increase to 4.5
percent in 2015, and strengthen to 5.0 percent the following
year. East Africa is expected to register growth of 5.6 percent
in 2015, rising to 6.7 percent in 2016. Central and West
Africa are expected to grow by 5.5 percent and 5.0 percent,
respectively, in 2015, rising to 5.8 percent and 6.1 percent,
respectively, in 2016. North Africa is projected to grow at 4.5
percent in 2015, a significant increase from the 1.7 percent
it achieved in 2014. Southern Africa is forcast to grow by
3.1 percent in 2015, up from 2.7 percent in 2014 (Map 1.1).

Future growth in most African countries will be driven by domestic
demand, supported by investments in the natural resources
sector, increased investment in infrastructure, and expansion
in the agricultural sector. Public expenditure is projected to
rise at a moderate rate as many countries, including Nigeria,

Annual Report 2014

High Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity Chapter 1

Senegal, and Ghana make progress on their fiscal consolidation
measures designed to rein-in government spending and
expand their fiscal buffers. Private consumption is also forcast
to remain strong in most countries, supported by continued
price stability and improving real per capita incomes. In view
of these favorable economic prospects, Africa is expected to
remain the world’s second-fastest-growing continent, after
Asia. However, there is growing concern about the quality of
this growth and its inclusiveness, as income inequality on the
continent widens, and poverty remains widespread.

Growth is also forcast to rise among Low-income Countries and
those in fragile situations. However, the outlook for oil exporting
and Middle-Income Countries is mixed. Growth in Nigeria, for
instance, is projected to be about 5.0 percent in 2015 and to
rise to an estimated 6 percent in 2016. The expanding non-oil
sector and the recovery in oil production will be key factors.
However, the problems of oil theft and vandalism with respect
to pipelines and the security situation in the north of the country,
which have had a negative impact on agricultural production
will require redress to sustain the recovery.

Downside Risks to the Outlook.

Lower Commodity Prices. Lower growth in emerging
market economies could result in a decline in demand, and
thus, a more rapid fall in commodity prices (Figure 1.2) than
assumed in the baseline forcast. In 2014, China’s housing
market softened considerably, with major developers reducing
prices by as much as 15 percent. Heavily reliant on housing
investment, China’s economic growth is slowing down, and
demand for raw materials may weaken further, keeping a lid
on, or even pushing down, commodity prices. Such a decline
in demand for raw materials would have a negative impact
on the exports of a host of African countries.

Tightening Financial Conditions. A rapid rise in capital market
volatility, associated with the reduction of quantitative easing
in the United States of America, remains a serious downside
risk to the continent’s economic outlook. Volatility in capital
flows had in 2014 already led some African central banks to
raise their interest to protect their economies. A sharp and
disorderly rise in interest rates or a reversal of capital flows
remains a serious concern for many African countries.

Fiscal Vulnerabilities. The fiscal position deteriorated in a
number of African countries, notably Ghana and Zambia,
although the fiscal deficit in Zambia has started to shrink.
Over-optimistic revenue estimates have also led to a build-up
of fiscal vulnerabilities in a number of countries, especially the
oil exporters. Further, elections in the near-term in countries
including Burkina Faso, Burundi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Togo, and
Uganda were expected to exert more pressures on public
finances.Chapter 1 High Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity

Security. Social and political unrest, as well as emerging
security problems remain a major threat to the economic
prospects of a number of African countries. The security
situations, caused by ethnic and religious conflicts, in the
Central African Republic and northern Mali remain precarious.
In South Sudan, the ongoing civil war has continued to disrupt
oil production. There is little immediate prospect for a political
settlement. In Nigeria, the insurgency by Boko Haram continues
to reduce agricultural production in the north. In spite of the
neighborhood effects of social strife and civil wars, Africa has
shown increasing ability to contain their spread.

1.3 Beyond the Millennium
Development Goals: Towards
Sustainable Development Goals

Despite a weak start, the pace of progress towards the
attainment of the MDGs in Africa has continued to accelerate
since 2003. The continent started on a low base on virtually
all MDG indicators, requiring large
investments and much effort to meet
the MDG targets and catch up with
comparator regions. However, in a
number of countries, progress has been
slow. In the Post-2015 Development
Agenda, the overarching goal remains
one of eradicating poverty and ensuring
that growth is more inclusive and peoplecentered. This will be underpinned by
enhancing the capacities of Africans to
sustainably manage and leverage their
natural resources in an environment of
peace and security.

Africa’s Progress towards the MDGs.
The analysis in this section relies
substantially on data from the MDG
2014 report jointly produced by the
AfDB, African Union, UNECA, and UNDP.

According to the MDG 2014 report,
Africa’s progress towards the attainment
of the Millennium Development Goals
has been mixed. While there are
variations across countries and regions,
some countries have made significant
progress towards the targets while in
other countries it has been slow. An
assessment of global performance on
the MDGs reveals that eight of the best
10 performers (i.e. those experiencing the
most rapid acceleration) are in Africa, with
Burkina Faso ranked the highest in MDG

10

acceleration. Table 1.4 below highlights the best-performing
countries for some selected targets and indicators.

Although poverty in Africa has continued to decline, the pace
of progress towards its eradication has been slow. As a result,
the continent is likely to miss the MDG target of eradicating
extreme poverty and hunger. Countries that have made most
progress in poverty reduction include Egypt, Guinea and Tunisia.

The continent is, however, on track to achieve the goal of
achieving universal primary education. Twenty-five African
countries have already achieved the prescribed net enrolment
ratios of above 80 percent. Only 11 countries, namely, Burkina
Faso, Central African Republic, Cte d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Equatorial
Guinea, Eritrea, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, and Niger,
have primary school enrolment rates below 75 percent.

Countries that have made strides in achieving the target on
universal primary education are also on course to meeting theHigh Growth Despite Regional and Global Adversity Chapter 1

MDG target of promoting gender equality and empowering
women, especially in school attendance. For many countries,
the gap between boys and girls enrolled in primary school
continues to decline. Out of the 49 African countries for which
data are available, 18 have already achieved gender parity at
the primary level of education, where the enrolment rate of
girls is as high as boys, while 28 countries are very close to
achieving it. In two countries, Chad and the Central African
Republic, the gender parity index remains low, indicating that
there are more boys than girls in primary school.

The continent has also made significant progress in increasing
the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments.
Rwanda, for instance, now ranks first in the world with regard
to the percentage of women in the national parliament (48.8
percent). Ten African countries (Rwanda, Seychelles, Senegal,
South Africa, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Angola, Algeria,
and Burundi) have attained the target of having at least 30
percent women in their national parliaments. However, limited
economic opportunities for women, and barriers to political
participation continue to impede progress on meeting this target.

On average, Africa’s progress in achieving the health-related
MDGs has been positive, but inadequate to meet the stipulated
targets. Despite remarkable improvements, the continent is
off-track on the target for maternal mortality reduction. While
average under-five mortality rates declined by 45 percent
from 177 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 98 deaths
in 2012, progress on this target falls short of the MDG target
of a two-thirds reduction by 2015. Improvements on this
MDG have been due largely to rising per capita income
and maternal education. By 2012, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia,
Malawi, Tanzania, and Tunisia had met the target. Eleven other
countries’ progress—namely Algeria, Cabo Verde, Eritrea, Libya,
Madagascar, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, South
Sudan, and Uganda—towards meeting the target, was on
course. There were, however, some reversals as under-fives’
mortality rates increased in Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland,
and Zimbabwe due mainly to HIV/AIDS-related deaths.

 

 

There has also been progress in the reduction of infant mortality
rates with figures falling from 90 deaths per 1,000 live births in
1990 to 54 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, a 39 percent
decline. Neonatal deaths (children who die within four weeks)
remain particularly high in the East, Central, Southern and
West Africa sub-regions, which account for 38 percent of the
global total. This is due to the lack of access to high quality
health care during pregnancy.

Progress on improving maternal health has been steady but
slow, meaning that Africa as a continent has not been able to
meet this MDGs target. The maternal mortality rate in Africa fell
by about 50 percent to 460 deaths per 100,000 live births in

12

2013, from 870 in 1990. This drop in the number of maternal
deaths was across the entire continent. With the maternal
mortality rate in the region falling by 57 percent between 1990
and 2013, North Africa had the most marked success. In 2013,
West and Central Africa still had maternal mortality rates above
500 maternal deaths per 100,000, the highest on the continent.
This high rate of maternal mortality is attributed to the limited
access to contraceptives, skilled birth attendants and antenatal
care in general, on the continent as well as the number of high
adolescent pregnancies. Despite these achievements, Africa, as
a whole, is unlikely to meet the MDG target on maternal mortality.

The incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults has
fallen in most parts of the continent, a result of the strong
political will to fight the illness, focused interventions and
increased access to antiretroviral therapy. The incidence of
HIV/AIDS declined from 0.85 to 0.32 over the 1995-2012
period, while the prevalence rate fell from 5.8 to 4.7 percent
during the 2000-2012 period. Between 2010 and 2011, the
proportion of the population with advanced HIV infection with
access to antiretroviral drugs increased from 48 to 56 percent
in Southern, East, Central, and West Africa. While progress
in combatting HIV/AIDS has been commendable, Africa is
not on course to meeting the target.

Notable progress has been made in the target to halt, and
begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major
diseases by 2015. Between 1990 and 2012, expanded
treatment regimes in Africa helped reduce the incidence and
death rates from malaria by an average of 31 percent and 49
percent, respectively. Progress was mainly recorded in Southern,
East, Central, and West Africa, where the incidence was high.
Despite the progress, however, Africa is not on track to meet
the MDG target on malaria.

In their bid to meet MDG 7, to ensure environmental sustainability,
most African countries have registered improvements in the
proportion of protected terrestrial and marine areas. By 2012,
a total of 32 countries had reached the target of protecting
at least 10 percent of their territorial and marine areas, up
from 19 countries in 1990. Overall, most African countries
have also recorded increased access to improved water and
sanitation. Only four countries (Djibouti, Nigeria, Sudan, and
Togo) have registered regressions.

Between 2011 and 2012 Official Development Assistance (ODA)
to Africa declined by 5 percent. Thus, progress towards the
achievement of the MDG 8 which calls for the development of
a global partnership for development, remains is lagging. Whilst
aid flows to Africa have been depressed, trade facilitation and
measures to create a level playing field in global production
measures have been stepped up. For instance, average
tariffs charged by developed nations on primary production

Annual Report 2014are now significantly lower than in
the early 2000s, and agricultural
subsidies in OECD countries have
been declining since 2000. Between
2000 and 2011, tariffs in Turkey and
Mexico fell by 50 percent, and by 40
percent in Switzerland, Iceland, and
the European Union.

Agenda for Post Millennium
Development Goals. Africa has
enjoyed high levels of growth, above
5 percent, during the MDG era, but
with wide variations at the country
level. In 2015 and further ahead,
the prospects for Africa are, thus,
significantly brighter than they were
at the turn of the millennium. However,
its performance on individual wellbeing, as measured by the MDGs has
been muted, with the continent being
off track in achieving five out of the
eight MDGs by 2015. The Post-2015
Development Agenda thus presents
a unique opportunity for Africa to
articulate its common priorities,
opportunities, and challenges.

Looking ahead to the Post-2015
Development Agenda, African
governments need to develop a
strong vision for monitoring and
accountability, with clear plans for
financing and implementation of the
strategies.

The Bank remains a significant
financier of infrastructure projects,
with a cumulative contribution of
VA 82 billion over the period of
1967-2014. The Bank’s focus with
regard to infrastructure development
on the continent is on transport,
energy, water, and information and
communication technology, all
critical to Africa’s socio-economic
development and well-being.

Several of the Bank’s transport projects
have to do with the development of

regional transport corridors that promote sustainable growth
and job creation by reducing the costs of imports, making
African producers more competitive on international markets,
and thus fostering inclusive growth. An example is the TransSaharan Highway which will connect landlocked Niger, Chad,
and Mali to growth centers in West and North Africa.

In the last 20 years, the Bank has spent USD 4.5 billion (about
12 percent of its funds) on increasing power generation and
improving rural electrification, bringing electricity and its
socio-economic benefits to thousands, many in the lower
strata of society. At another level, the Bank is fostering the
development of regional power pools, helping link the power
grids of neighboring countries into single networks that work
to provide more reliable electricity supplies.

In the telecommunications sector, the Bank continues to
finance regional and national broadband infrastructure through
investments in high-speed, high capacity Internet and telephone
cables, helping to improve communications and enhance
the numerous benefits it brings to the African people in both
urban and rural communities.

The Bank remains committed to supporting regional integration

on the continent by connecting countries, markets, and peoples
which is essential if Africa is to transform its economies and

14

achieve inclusive growth. In the last five years, the Bank has
financed more than 70 multinational projects in support of
regional integration at a total cost of USD 3.8 billion. Also, 20
percent of its ADF funds are set aside for regional integration
projects.

Indeed, the Bank is focused on improving the continent's
investment and business climate, expanding access to social and
economic infrastructure, and promoting enterprise development.
It is working with RMCs to improve the business environment,
so that businesses of all sizes can grow and generate jobs.

To support the lower echelons of society and promote inclusive
growth, the Bank has in the last three years provided finance
for 156,477 microcredits on the continent and provided 10,054
microfinance clients with training in business management.
The Bank’s direct support to enterprises has resulted in the
creation of over one million jobs, with over 4.6 million people
(of whom 53 percent are women) benefiting from investee
projects and microfinance.

The Bank’s vision is to harness the potential of a billion
Africans by building skills, creating jobs and promoting equal
opportunities. Its human development portfolio includes 77
projects worth USD 1.8 billion, covering education, health,
poverty reduction, and social protection.

The Quest for Inclusive GrowthChapter 2 The Quest for Inclusive Growth

A\rica has grown at an unprecedented pace in the past decade. However, the benefits of this
economic resurgence have not been broadly shared. Instead, growth has been concentrated in
particular sectors or geographical areas within countries, excluding large sections of people. To
lift the majority of Africans out of poverty, growth must be more inclusive. This requires creating
employment opportunities through a better business and investment climate that enables the
private sector to thrive. More importantly, remote areas must be connected to growth poles
through better infrastructure and deeper regional integration, both within countries and across
national borders. Achieving inclusive growth will also be underpinned by effective transformation
of Africa’s natural wealth into created wealth, including building human capital and skills. This
calls for prudent, effective, and sustainable management of natural resources for the benefit of
all Africans. Climate change is a threat to Africa’s sustainable future, and hence undermines
prospects for inclusive growth. Addressing climate change will therefore ensure a smooth transition
towards an environmentally sustainable growth path. This chapter presents an overview of drivers
of Africa’s performance with respect to inclusive growth and analyses of some key dimensions
of inclusive growth: political economy, rural-urban linkages, the role of the private sector, and
regional integration.

2.1 Nature of the Challenge

The African Development Bank Group defines inclusive
growth as economic growth that results in a wider access
to sustainable livelihood opportunities for a broader number
of people, regions, or countries, while protecting the
vulnerable, all in an environment of fairness, equity, and
political plurality.

Inclusive growth refers to the need for economic and social
development to be able to embrace and benefit all segments
of the population. Rapid growth is necessary for substantial
poverty reduction, but for this growth to be sustainable in
he long run, it should be broad-based across sectors, and
inclusive in terms of its impact on the wider society. Therefore,
inclusive growth refers to the pace and sources of growth,
and is concerned with opportunities for the labor force in the
low-, middle-, and high-income segments of the economy.
This approach focuses on productive employment rather
han on direct income distribution, as a means of increasing
incomes for excluded groups. It also emphasizes ways of
ast-tracking growth by moving those sectors of the labor
orce that are trapped in activities with low productivity into
high productivity and dynamic sectors, and empowering those
completely excluded from the growth process.

 

6

To measure and track progress towards inclusive growth, the
Bank has, in recent analyses, noted the importance of considering
several dimensions including economic opportunity, social, spatial,
and political inclusion. Consistent with the definition adopted,
the Bank has developed an Inclusive Growth Dashboard for
Africa which covers the following components:

(i) the pace of growth in per capita GDP; reductions in
extreme poverty and inequality (economic inclusion);

(ii) governance indicators (political inclusion);

(iii) diversification and economic sophistication (economic
opportunity);

(iv) health indicator: index combining infant mortality, life
expectancy, etc. (social and economic inclusion);

(v) education indicator: index combining secondary enrolment,
tertiary enrolment, quality of the educational system, etc.
(social and economic inclusion);

(vi) women’s participation in the labor market: this indicator

considers the proportion of women aged 15 years and

older who are in the labor market (social inclusion);
employment growth: this indicator measures the
effectiveness of economic growth in generating jobs

(economic inclusion);

spatial inclusion: an indicator that captures connectivity,

access to the nearest market, and public services.

ii)

(viii

Annual Report 2014The evidence suggests that Africa’s progress towards inclusive
growth between 2010 and 2014 has been mixed. Between
2010 and 2014, the proportion of the poor in Africa declined
from 40.1 percent to 39.7 percent. However, the number of
poor people has swelled from 384 million in 2010 to 397 million
in 2014, suggesting the fragility of recent growth in making
a deep impact on poverty. Income and gender inequality
remains high although the growth in Africa’s middle class
has narrowed asset-based inequality. On the other hand, the
mobile telecommunication revolution has transformed the
African landscape, widening connectivity. However, progress
in accessing basic services, notably in education, sanitation
and health, has been modest while the proportion of people
trapped in fragile situations has increased. The increase in
the volume of intra-Africa trade provides scope for deeper
regional integration but the cost of trading across borders
remains a major hindrance.

2.2 Political Economy of Inclusive Growth

Rapid social, economic and environmental change is placing
African societies under considerable strain. When national
institutions are resilient enough to manage such stress, the
impetus for resolute domestic action that supports development
could result. However, where countries lack inclusive political
systems and robust institutions to manage these pressures,
the changes can lead to fragility and conflict. Consequently,
capable, accountable, and responsive governance is a
precondition for inclusive growth.

Africa has, in recent years, generally made steady progress in
building capable and responsive states. Indeed an increasing
number of countries have seen peaceful transfers of power
through the ballot box, with growing voter registration and
turnout rates being evidence of a consolidation of democracy.
Only a handful of countries do not have multi-party systems and/
or fail to hold regular elections. In fact, in 2011, 18 countries
in Africa were considered electoral democracies, compared
to only four in 1991. The shift towards more democracy can
be a force that fosters inclusive growth. Similarly, the African
media is now more vibrant while the civil society is increasingly
engaging with governments on public policies, including
those concerned with the use of public resources. There is
growing evidence that more open and democratic countries
tend to also have better governance and are more inclusive
than less democratic ones.

Devolution of decision-making and power from central
government to local authorities offers an opportunity for more
enhanced inclusion. This view is supported by evidence that
decentralization benefits local populations and promotes
socio-economic inclusion as central governments delegate
authority to local authorities. Thus, strengthening sub-national

Annual Report 2014

The Quest for Inclusive Growth Chapter 2

governments and granting them control over resources
from the center could significantly improve delivery of health,
education, and basic social services.

A decade of conscientious reforms to improve public financial
management is yielding dividends. Most countries in Africa
now boast of relatively robust legal and policy frameworks for
budgeting and public expenditure management. There has
also been marked progress on institutional reforms across a
large number of countries. For example, the new constitution
of Kenya articulates core principles for devolution of resource
use and sound public financial management. It also guarantees
the autonomy of the Auditor General. Similarly, Ethiopia has
brought greater clarity into revenue assignments across different
tiers of government. Over the past decade, many countries
have managed a sustained period of sound macroeconomic
management, which has delivered lower budget deficits and
stabilized exchange rates. On aggregate, there is sufficient
room for further enhancement of policy reforms, focusing largely
on those that improve service delivery, and better targeting
of cash transfers and other social protection mechanisms.

The Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
which tracks performance outcomes across a range of policy
dimensions, shows that a number of countries have made
important strides. The average CPIA score has increased from
3.7 in 2005 to 4.02 in 2010, out of a possible 6.0. On average,
many countries have witnessed a gradual increase in revenue
collection from traditional activities, thanks to the introduction of
automated business processes for revenue capture. However,
the quest for enhanced domestic resource mobilization is
hampered by the challenges in taxing the natural resource
sector. In particular, due to transfer pricing and munificent
concessions, coupled with the effect of the global crisis which
significantly reduced commodity prices, the revenue take from
the natural resource sector has been lower than it could have
been. As a result, there has been a slight decline in the share of
tax and non-tax revenues to GDP from 28 percent in 2006 to
23 percent in 2014. Accordingly, the Bank is building capacity
in anumber of countries to enhance their ability to monitor the
flow of revenues from their natural resources.

Governance indicators also show Africa’s progress. According
to the Mo Ibrahim Index of African Governance, which looks
at the rule of law, security, and accountability, average scores
have gradually risen from 47 in 2000 to 52 in 2014, out of 100,
the maximum possible score. While the continent’s average
score has improved, there is little evidence on effective and
accountable governments. The index which tracks effectiveness
and accountable government, shows a deterioration in this
area, although women’s representation in national parliaments
and leadership has improved. Ten African parliaments have
achieved 30 percent women’s representation, compared to 18

17Chapter 2 The Quest for Inclusive Growth

percent women’s representation in the US Congress in 2012.
This augurs well for gender inclusion, but more needs to be
done, particularly in removing barriers to land and property
ownership among women.

Fragility remains another hindrance to inclusive growth. An
estimated 280 million people, representing a quarter of the
continent's population live in states under fragile situations.
Conflict-affected countries are unable to mobilize sustained
investment and resources for nation building. As a result, a
majority of them are excluded from Africa’s growth and also lag
in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals.
Improving political participation and levelling the playing field
is critical to addressing key drivers of conflict and overcoming
political exclusion.

The High Level Panel on Fragile States constituted by the Bank
identified five drivers of fragility on the continent: poverty and
exclusion, urbanization and the growing informal sector, the
youth bulge, extractive industries, and climate disruption and
resource conflicts. The Panel recommended that to address
these sources of fragility, African governments need to build
and strengthen alliances with their development partners in
order for them to leverage different mandates and expertise.

2.3 Towards Productive
Rural-Urban Linkages

Africa is currently experiencing the world’s fastest rate of
urbanization, with more than 40 percent of its people living
in urban environments. The figure is expected to exceed 50
percent by 2030 when Africa will cease to be a predominantly
rural continent. This rapid pace of urbanization is drawing a
large number of rural migrants to the urban areas, leading to
the question of how to maintain an economically inclusive and
mutually beneficial relationship between urban and rural areas.

Africa’s lack of inclusive growth is as much about a sectoral
as well as a spatial concentration of growth. The benefits of
growth have been unevenly distributed across the continent
and largely concentrated in and around urban centers. A large
segment of the rural population remains trapped in poverty,
and in general, Africa has a low population density and limited
connectivity. These factors present obstacles to the spread
of economic opportunities. African cities have expanded at
an unprecedented pace and attracted rural migrants and
businesses. Thus, although growth in the informal sector is
transforming the continent’s cities into growth poles, many
of the jobs created in the sector are low-paying, menial and
vulnerable. Thus, while a large middle class has emerged,
inequality has also deepened within cities and between urban
and rural zones, with rural economies stagnating due to the
lack of investment in agriculture.

18

Indeed, spatial inequality has worsened over time in Africa
despite substantial progress in infrastructure development
and rapid urbanization. Analysis based on a large household
survey of 40 African countries showed that close to 37 percent
of asset/wealth inequality is due to differences in regions
of residence within a country, while 13 percent is due to
household-specific characteristics such as age, education,
and sex. Robust institutions reinforce the impact of these
factors on reducing spatial inequality.

Box 2.1 illustrates regional disparities in Tunisia and discusses
their underlying causes, with the aim of drawing policy lessons.

The rapid population growth in urban locations in Africa has
stretched the capacity of existing infrastructure and facilities,
resulting in a decline in the quality of services in these areas.
In some cases, urban infrastructure and services have simply
buckled under the intense pressure. While there is a growing
consensus that urbanization cannot be reversed, it remains
important to address the paucity of social and infrastructure
services to meet the demands of expanding urban populations,
without neglecting rural populations. In particular, governments
must fast-track investments in basic infrastructure, social
services, and affordable housing.

One of the building blocks of inclusive growth is to strengthen
connections within and between countries and regions through
infrastructure. This enables producers to join with each other
in more-productive value chains, such as enabling farmers to
bring their produce to the market, and consumers to access
markets and public services. It also facilitates more efficient
use of natural resources. Therefore, improving infrastructure
has the potential to boost overall economic growth while
helping those areas lagging behind to catch up.

The continent's largest infrastructure investment needs are in
electric power. Almost half of the USD 93 billion needed annually
to improve Africa’s infrastructure is focused on boosting power
supply. African countries, with over one billion people, generate
only as much power as Germany, which has a population of
only 80 million people. It is also estimated by the Bank that
over 30 countries in Africa now face regular power outages,
at an economic cost of 1-2 percent of GDP. To compensate
for inadequate capacity, many countries are forced to turn to
small-scale diesel-powered generation, which costs twice as
much as coal or hydro-power. Tariffs for businesses in Africa
are often three times higher than those in other parts of the
developing world.

 

Another major deficit is found in the number of all-season
roads, which play a key role in enabling communities to engage
in economic activity and to access services. Roads reduce
the time and cost involved in transporting goods and have

Annual Report 2014The Quest for Inclusive Growth Chapter 2

Box 2.1 Addressing Regional Disparities: The Tunisian Case

 

In Tunisia, coastal regions have a comparative advantage given their access to the sea. Coastal regions have also received preferential access to
government-financed investment and services, with Tunisian coastal regions consequently exhibiting better indicators of social welfare. For instance, poverty
rates in the inland south are about double those in Tunis, on the coast, while unemployment rates are about 50 percent higher. These disparities were
an important factor for the eruption of the 2010-2011 “revolution”, with differences in unemployment rates reflecting both the benefits of agglomeration
and the provision of services. Tunisian cities that are further away from a port, an airport, or the major commercial centers (Tunis, Sousse, and Sfax) have
higher rates of unemployment.

Human development indicators also differ significantly across regions, with those near the coast recording better health status indices than those in the
interior. For example, life expectancy at birth was 77 years in Tunis and Sfax in 2009, compared to 70 in the inland towns of Kasserine and Tataouine,
with these differences reflecting, among other things, unequal levels of health service delivery. In short, the poorer, more isolated regions have inadequate
access to health services, compared to the richer, coastal regions. Boosting national income while narrowing inequalities will require the promotion of labor
creating industrial activities in coastal regions and increasing the productive capacity of the less diversified, more isolated ones. Coastal regions should
capitalize on their existing advantages, principally a skilled and diversified labor force and the benefit of a learning process driven by the pressure of foreign
competition. The more disadvantaged regions in the interior have more limited possibilities for economic diversification. As with the coastal regions, policies
should focus on existing advantages, in this case, either improving existing industries or promoting industries in which synergies with coastal regions can
be achieved. An important example is the production of labor-intensive goods to serve coastal markets.

 

Annual Report 2014 19Chapter 2 The Quest for Inclusive Growth

a direct impact on the poor, especially in rural areas. Africa’s
road density (length of road per sq. km), although improving,
was only 7.9 km in 2014, which represent only 30 percent of
Asia’s road density. Further, three-quarters of these roads were
unpaved and often unusable in the rainy season. To increase
investment in roads, most African countries have established
autonomous road agencies and road funds, supported by fuel
levies. By providing adequate infrastructure such as transport,
communication, energy and other basic services, mobility
problems between rural and urban areas can be eased and
access to markets, employment and other income earning
opportunities improved, thereby enhancing inclusive growth.

Access to clean water in Africa in 2014 reached, on average,
67 percent of the population, up by 6 percent over the past
decade. Access to improved sanitation increased more slowly
from 37 percent to 40 percent. However, at the current rate
of investment, most African countries are still half a century
away from achieving universal access to clean water. The
lack of coverage, particularly in rural areas, increases the
burden of disease. It also negatively affects women and
girls, who bear the primary responsibility of fetching water. A
number of countries have, nonetheless, made outstanding
progress. Mozambique, for example, has given priority to
developing its water-related infrastructure, with major schemes

 

20

Annual Report 2014for harvesting rainwater in dry regions.
Benin has, similarly, invested heavily in
simple water systems for small towns
and rural areas, achieving an increase
in rural drinking water coverage from 57
percent in 1990 to 76 percent in 2012,
as noted in the WHO/UNICEF Joint
Monitoring Programme Report. One of
the policy challenges, however, is that
public subsidies for residential water and
sanitation services tend to be regressive,
benefiting the more privileged segments
of the population that have connections
to public utilities, mainly in urban areas.

The spread of information and
communication technology (ICT) is one
of Africa’s biggest success stories, with
huge potential for inclusive growth. In
2000, there were fewer than 20 million
fixed phone lines in Africa—a 2 percent
penetration rate. Since then Africa has leap-frogged landline
development and gone straight to mobile networks. By 2013,
it had over 823 million mobile phone subscriptions—more
than either the United States or the European Union. The
Bank estimates that by 2020, the mobile phone industry in
Africa will generate 8 percent of GDP, 6.6 million direct jobs
and USD 42 billion in government revenues.

The spread of ICT has opened up access, not only to “mobile
money”, such as Kenya’s famous M-Pesa service, but also
to a wide range of new solutions to development challenges,
from tracking livestock to training teachers and managing
pharmaceutical supply chains. Mobile phones have connected
individuals, fostered the development of information and
knowledge-networks, markets, and services, thereby bridging
rural/urban gaps and also making economic information readily
available to individuals and firms, at reduced cost.

The above section has demonstrated that strengthening ruralurban linkages is crucial for inclusive growth and sustained
development. The urban bias inherent in infrastructure
development and the rolling out of new technologies must
be addressed. It will require the coordinated efforts of both
the public and private sector as well as national and local
governments. This will entail broadening opportunities in the
productive sectors, including the range of actors involved
in infrastructure development. Broader coalitions will often
be required, including partnerships with community-based
organizations, non-governmental organizations, and the private
sector. In many cases, more efficient local level bureaucracies
and empowered local communities will greatly contribute to
effective service delivery and development activities.

2.4 Role of the Private Sector

Africa’s wealth lies primarily in its people—a young and growing
population in search of opportunity. To realize this wealth,
the private sector must be re-engaged to unleash people’s
untapped potential. Inclusive enterprises integrate low-income
people into their value chain, thus creating opportunities for
this group in a targeted way. There has been considerable
innovation and entrepreneurial drive in creating inclusive
enterprise in Africa, yet several constraints in the business
environment mean that these enterprises often struggle to
upscale. Supportive environments with appropriate information,
incentives, investment, and implementation support can
stimulate development of more inclusive enterprises that
have greater impact.

Although market conditions remain challenging in many
places, the regulatory frameworks and availability of capital
are improving, thus driving significant economic growth.
Africa’s private sector has an important role to play in fostering
inclusive growth. A recent study by the UNDP shows that
inclusive enterprises integrate low-income individuals into
value chains, thereby bringing previously excluded people
into the marketplace. Rather than just being driven by a profit
motive, inclusive enterprises also take their corporate social
responsibility seriously. They protect the environment, make
an effort to address social issues, such as hunger and poverty,
and maintain high ethical standards.

Aninclusive business environment is made up of a network of
interconnected, interdependent players, whose actions help
inclusive enterprises succeed, generate impact and grow.
The Inclusive Business Environment Diamond outlines the four

primary functions required to support inclusive enterprises
(Figure 2.1). First, information provides enterprises with the
awareness, knowledge, technology, and know-how required
to operate in low-income markets. Second, incentives are
required to spur enterprise engagement with low-income
communities, by reducing the cost of doing business and
generating positive externalities. Third, investment provides
the financial backing that enables enterprises to venture into
challenging low-income markets. Finally, implementation
support provides the logistics, transaction, marketing and
communication as well as micro-business mechanisms that
allow inclusive enterprises to function in different environments.

There are several examples of inclusive enterprises in Africa
that have proven that this model is profitable and beneficial for
a wide range of stakeholders. According to the UNDP, most
inclusive enterprises are found in the agribusiness, fishing,
energy, financial services, and ICT sectors, mainly operating
as micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises (MSMEs).
Kenya and South Africa are emerging as leaders in the area of
inclusive enterprises. Kenya’s M-Pesa mobile money transfer
service is one example. In Kenya alone, M-Pesa reaches 15
million people, widening access to financial services. Similarly,
Equity Bank of Kenya also provides financial services to 8 million

v9

customers in East Africa, while South African brewer SAB
Miller sources raw materials from about 50,000 smallholders in
Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Uganda, Mozambique, and
Tanzania. Several local businesses are also creating significant
positive change in this regard. For example, Tiviski Dairy in
Mauritania sources milk from more than 1,000 camel herders,
while in Kenya, Ecotact, a social enterprise, provides toilets
for over 50,000 slum dwellers, and in South Africa Eduloan
provided study loans to over 600,000 tertiary-level students,
with the aim of unlocking potential among its client base.

Inclusive enterprises, however, operate in a challenging
environment, with low-income markets lacking many of
the conditions that enable functioning markets. According
to the Growing Inclusive Markets Initiative, reliable market
information is often absent, the regulatory environment is
usually inadequate, physical infrastructure is often dismal in
many places, low-income people initially lack the knowledge
and skills required to participate in value chain productivity,
while access to financial services is frequently minimal. When
enabling conditions are absent or insufficient, transaction costs
rise, forcing enterprises to fill the gap themselves. Therefore,
despite the enormous potential awaiting inclusive enterprises
in Africa, the challenges remain enormous.

Annual Report 2014Environment-building initiatives that coordinate different
actors at several levels to ensure that individual activities
build on and reinforce each other have been very successful
in providing inclusive business environments. For example,
the Competitive African Cotton Initiative brings agribusiness,
textile companies, development partners, and smallholder
cotton farmers together to create sustainable and inclusive
cotton supply chains in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cédte d’lvoire,
Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia. Similarly, Kenya’s Financial
Sector Deepening Initiative works with various government
agencies, banks, microfinance institutions, and educational
and research bodies to deepen access to financial services,
especially for low-income groups. Lighting Africa provides a
platform that enables lighting solution companies to have their
products quality checked and certified, and works to improve
the conditions for sale of these products in several countries
(Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Senegal, and Tanzania), and
in the process improving access to lighting for low-income
consumers.

Businesses and entrepreneurs can develop inclusive strategies
by investing in new business approaches, conducting market
research, testing the delivery of innovative services and products
at affordable prices, building technical skills, implementing
strategies for integrating low-income communities into value
chains, and providing logistical and other services that support
other enterprises. They can cooperate in the initial stages of
a business venture by helping to conduct market research or
develop innovative business models. They can also innovate
by buying goods and services from informal businesses owned
by people in low-income communities, and by increasing the
local content of inputs and other supplies.

 

Annual Report 2014

The Quest for Inclusive Growth Chapter 2

Governments can also play a key supporting role by providing
incentives for inclusive enterprises and developing regulation
that removes bottlenecks to business activity. Kenya, for
example, attracted investment in building renewable energy
capacities and increasing access to modern energy services
by improving the regulatory environment and creating incentives,
such as adjustments to feed-in tariffs. Investing in infrastructure,
information technology, and education also creates additional
incentives for inclusive businesses, enabling them to integrate
low-income communities into broader value chains. Equally
important, development partners and private foundations can
encourage the creation of local support institutions that are
lacking by documenting and analysing best practices, sharing
insights, and facilitating public-private dialogues. They could also
promote the inclusive-enterprise approach by providing assistance
to governments to support development of enabling policies.

Civil society organizations can promote the development of
inclusive enterprises by facilitating access for businesses
to low-income communities, acting as watch-dogs for the
interests of these communities, helping local entrepreneurs
set up inclusive businesses, and by raising awareness and
building capacity. Potential exists for research institutions to
offer support by providing detailed analysis of context-specific
information about what works for inclusive enterprises in
Africa. They can also gather and disseminate information on
inclusive-enterprise models, while advocating for inclusive
business approaches. Further, they can educate and train
current and future entrepreneurs, and develop better measures
of how inclusive an enterprise is and what results have been
achieved, and in this way providing the information needed
for policy makers and equally impact investors.Chapter 2 The Quest for Inclusive Growth

2.5 Regional Integration and
Socio-Economic Inclusion

Globalization has seen the world economy become increasingly
integrated. Spurred by free-market economic systems and
advances in technology and cross-border economies, global
value chains have become important parts of advanced
economies, with this interconnectivity promoting an important
part of their economic growth and development. Although
African economies need to develop and sustain profitable
links to the global economy, they must first foster integration
at the regional level before they can become fully integrated
into the global economy. Regional integration will thus, enable
Africa to realize its full growth potential and become a fully
inclusive continent.

Many African countries are still held back by their small market
size, with domestic producers not able to become more
efficient by achieving economies of scale. The continent’s
policy makers have long recognized that regional economic
integration is imperative for improving competitiveness, with
cross-border trade creating a virtuous circle, by increasing
competition in domestic markets, lowering the costs of goods
and services, and enabling firms to join with each other in
more-sophisticated regional value chains. However, while
inter-African trade increased from USD 125 billion in 2010
to USD 148 billion in 2014, it represents only 12 percent of
the continent’s total exports compared to 25 percent for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 49 percent
for the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and
65 percent for the European Union (EU). A challenge is that
leading African exporters such as Angola, Algeria, Egypt,
Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa have stronger
economic ties with the rest of the world than with their regional
neighbors. This represents a lost economic opportunity for
the continent.

In order to promote regional economic integration, African
countries need to simplify cross-border trade, reduce nontariff barriers such as restrictive rules of origin, and streamline
immigration processes. It is unfortunate that shipping a
container across Africa’s national boundaries costs an average
of USD 2,290 in administrative fees and charges, and entails
delays of 37 days on the average, compared to 20 days
in Southeast Asia. The landlocked countries are the worst
affected, with a truck driver travelling on the Koutiala-Dakar
corridor between Mali and Senegal having to pass through
about 100 checkpoints and pay an average of USD 437. Thus,
further improvements in the movement of goods and people
can have a significant contribution to growth.

Regional integration should thus focus on creating larger
and more attractive markets, linking landlocked countries to

24

international markets and supporting intra-African trade to
foster the continent’s development. It should also emphasize
industrial development as well as “soft” infrastructure issues like
trade facilitation, policy reforms and regional harmonization of
policies and regulations. Despite some progress, commitments
made at the regional level have not always been implemented
by Regional Member States.

Regional integration also requires the free movement of people
from one country to another. Africa’s laws on free movement
have been generally restrictive despite political commitments
to bring down borders and barriers. Some African countries
fail to provide even for strategic regional preferences in the
issuance of visas. North Americans, followed by Europeans
enjoy the most liberal entry into the continent by benefiting
from visa-free travel, or being able to obtain a visa on arrival,
in at least half of Africa’s countries.

Regional integration is a means to enhance inclusive growth
by mobilizing skills and creating a seamless geographical and
social space for economic interaction, as well as a gateway
for opening up markets, especially for landlocked countries.
Regions that are well connected by road transportation, ICT,
power supply and water systems will therefore, experience
enhanced inclusion. Furthermore, regions and cities that have
natural resources for exports or natural advantages such as
proximity to rivers, coasts, and transportation networks, are
likely to benefit more from external trade, whereas those
that lack these assets in remote areas will not. However,
the benefits of regional integration or globalization are not
always spread evenly, with globalization having the potential
to induce regional disparities and inequality if some regions
benefit more from external trade than others. This is because
regions and their cities have unequal exposure to trade and
dissimilar comparative advantage, and this has the potential
of causing friction at national and regional levels.

As regional integration improves the competitiveness of African
producers and brings millions more consumers within their
reach, the continent will see a swelling of intra and inter-regional
trade as a share of all trade. African countries also need to
simplify cross-border trade, reduce non-tariff barriers, support
regional infrastructure, and streamline immigration processes.
These will go a long way in helping the continent overcome
some of the barriers to inclusive growth.

2.6 Why Muted Progress Towards Inclusion?

By historical comparison, Africa’s recent economic growth
is unprecedented. For the first time since the late 1980s,
growth has been high and sustained over a longer spell,
creating optimism for transformed lives. Although growth has
accelerated at historically high rates, the benefits of this rapid

Annual Report 2014growth have not been equitably shared among the population
with majority of Africa’s poor still trapped at the lower end
of the pyramid. Thus, although poverty rates are declining
in some countries, the basic needs of many Africans are not
yet being satisfied.

For more than a decade, economic growth in Africa has been
high, averaging above 5 percent. The continent hosts some
of the fastest growing economies in the world. As a result,
the size of the middle class has expanded. This increase
has created dynamic changes in consumer patterns across
anumber of countries. Bank estimates show that consumer
spending is expected to increase three-fold from USD 680
billion in 2008 to USD 2.2 trillion in 2030. If growth is sustained
at such high rates, and the middle class continues to expand,
most African countries will have attained middle-income status
by 2025. Besides the commodity boom, the acceleration in
Africa’s growth has been underpinned by a quadrupling in
foreign direct investment in the past decade. Foreign direct
investment flows rose to USD 60.4 billion in 2014, fromm USD
17.4 billion in 2004. Over the same period, remittances have
seen their largest increase, reaching USD 67.1 billion from USD
19.5 billion. The rise in consumer spending and opportunities
for high investment returns is increasingly making Africa an
attractive market for investors.

Whilst Africa’s growth has been phenomenal in historical
terms, many parts of the continent and many segments of
the population suffer from historically high poverty levels.
Disturbingly, across the region, income inequality is widening.
In the now common parlance, Africa's growth has not been
inclusive. Unemployment, especially among the youth and
women, remains high, with poverty and inequality widespread.
The average poverty rate in Africa stands at 39.7 percent, with
over 400 million people still living on less than USD 1.25 per
day (the world’s highest rate of extreme poverty). Relative to
other regions of the world, the pace of poverty reduction in
Africa has been significantly slow (Figure 2.2). Furthermore,
although the size of the middle class has increased, many
remain vulnerable to economic shocks and are at high risk of
relapsing into poverty should the economic situation suddenly
deteriorate.

Although Africa’s Gini coefficient (a standard measure of income
inequality) has improved in recent years, it remains markedly
high, at 42.6. Africa is thus the world’s second-most-unequal
continent, after Latin America. Six of the 10-most-unequal
countries are in Africa with evidence suggesting that the
rich, who account for less than 5 percent of the population,
hold about 20 percent of the continent’s total income. In
contrast, the poor, who account for 60.8 percent of Africa’s
population, hold only 36.5 percent of this income. Africa’s
high rate of inequality is evident from Figure 2.3. Although

inequality is falling, its rate of decline in Africa is slower than
that of other region.

The unemployment challenge in Africa is exacerbated by
the “youth bulge”. The youth, aged between 15 and 25 and
representing more than 60 percent of the continent's total
population, account for 45 percent of the total labor force. It
is expected that by 2020, an additional 112 million workers,
comprising mainly youth, will join the labor force.

Indeed, the problem of unemployment is intrinsically tied to
the nature of African growth itself—that of dominance of the
extractive sector, lack of economic diversification, and the
relative absence of growth in manufacturing. For instance,
reflecting a lack of diversification, the extractive sector accounts
for more than half of Africa’s exports, reaching 90 percent in
some countries. This is markedly less than the 10 percent in

Asia. This depicts a lack of diversification in Africa. However,
Africa’s extractive sector is largely capital-intensive with fewer
employment-creating opportunities. As can be seen from
Figure 2.4, despite high real GDP growth on the continent,
employment has not responded correspondingly.

A lack of growth in productive employment, despite high
growth rates, is what has led to Africa’s growth being
characterized as jobless growth. To make growth more
inclusive, Africa needs to create more opportunities for quality
and productive employment. This entails removing barriers
to the full participation of individuals, groups, and regions in
income-generating and welfare-enhancing activities. Access
to economic opportunities must also not be defined by age,
gender, religion, ethnicity, culture, or geographic location.

26

2.7 Conclusion

Africa is changing at a remarkable pace, becoming one of the
world’s most economically dynamic continents and recording
impressive economic growth rates over the past decade. With
increasingly stable governments, more-conducive business
environments and a rapidly growing middle class, the continent
is attracting ever greater amounts of foreign investment, and
gradually becoming the destination of choice for investors.
However, serious economic, social, and political challenges
remain, and may be escalating in some countries. To ensure
that this economic resurgence is sustained over the long run,
and is also widely shared, the continent needs to continue
along the path of economic transformation that engenders
inclusive growth.

It is imperative that African countries tackle critical infrastructural
bottlenecks by investing in major transport networks to
open up their rural areas and link their economies with each
other and with the global market, as well as in rural roads to
support inclusive growth. Their investments in power, water,
and telecommunications will help businesses to grow, and
working closely with each other, they will be able to provide
the hard and soft infrastructure that is required for regional
economic integration and inclusive growth.

It is imperative that African countries tackle critical infrastructural
bottlenecks by investing in major transport networks to open
up their rural areas, and ink their economies with each other
and with the global markets. Critical too, is the development
of rural roads to support inclusive growth. Government
investments in power, water, telecommunications will help
businesses to grow. Working closely with each other will
enable them to provide the hard and soft infrastructure that is
required for regional economic integration and inclusive growth.

Africa’s Quest for InclusionChapter 3 Bank’s Response to Africa’s Quest for Inclusion

This chapter examines the Bank’s response to the need for inclusive growth in Africa, in the belief
that inclusion will not happen without a supportive political and economic policy environment.
Accordingly, the Bank has been providing support for public-sector reforms, especially those
targeted at the development of institutions that help link disadvantaged areas and groups to
markets, public services, and productive off-farm activities. The Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy is the
most important recent example of its policy thrust in this regard. The Bank has also undertaken
analytical work on structural transformation, rural and urban development, supported capacity
building, and data generation and management. The Bank’s report on development effectiveness
provides useful feedback loops that help to determine whether its inclusive-growth objective is

being met, as does its report on the independent evaluation function.

3.1 Fostering Inclusion in
Bank Policies and Strategies

Sustainable development requires a well-defined policy
framework. The Bank’s Ten- Year Strategy, 2013-2022, is based
on the objectives of inclusive growth and transition to green
growth. The former implies growth that ensures equal access
to economic opportunities across age, gender, ethnicity and
geography. This also requires the provision of social safety
nets that mitigate the effects of transitory shocks to livelihoods
and prevent the prevalence of extreme poverty. On the other
hand, the transition to green growth will ensure that African
countries preserve the environment and the natural-resource
base on which their economies depend.

The Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy, 2013-2022 (TYS), is its
overarching approach to achieve sustainable growth and
development in Africa over the next decade. The strategy is
anchored on two objectives, namely, inclusive growth and the
transitioning of African economies to green growth (Figure 3.1).
The Strategy identifies five operational priorities: (i) infrastructure
development, (ii) regional economic integration, (iii) private-sector
developmert, (iv) governance and accountability, and (v) skills
and technology. The strategy also underlines three areas of
special emphasis: states in fragile situations, agriculture and
food security, and gender.

The path to inclusive growth will demand greater investment
in infrastructure to help to unlock the potential of Africa’s
private sector, raise competitiveness and enhance broad
community participation, including that of youth and women.
Inclusion also requires that vulnerable communities and
groups are given the skills they need to remain competitive,

28

while the capacity of policymakers for policy formulation is
enhanced by, among others, training and policy dialogue.
More broadly, the Bank envisages increased support for the
development of effective institutions, good governance and
robust regulatory environments, with an emphasis on the
protection of property rights, ensuring equal access to justice,
and participation in decision-making. The Bank envisages
the private sector playing a key role in the promotion of
inclusive growth and sees the micro-, small-, and mediumsize enterprises as engines for important job creation.
Fragility is a threat to sustainable growth and inclusion. It
will be important, therefore, to adopt flexible approaches in
assisting communities and countries in fragile situations to
help them become more robust, especially in light of their
often-weak institutional environments.

Within the framework of the TYS, the Bank has a number of
more specific strategies that cover various aspects of inclusion.
The Policy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in
Africa, 2014-2019, was developed in 2014 to ensure that
countries in fragile/transition situations can be assisted to
enhance their institutional capacities and their ability to return
to sustainable growth paths. On the other hand, the Gender
Strategy 2014-2018 seeks to improve women’s social, legal,
and economic status, and to strengthen the knowledge
management and capacity-building aspects related to gender
issues in Regional Member Countries (RMCs), and within the
Bank itself.

The Bank’s Human Capital Strategy for Africa 2014-2018 aims
to support equitable access to quality basic social services,
including those in which there is emphasis on skills and
technology development, youth employment, and economic

productivity. This strategy also sets out to ensure that gender
equality is a mainstream issue. In a continent known for the
paucity of its credit and financial markets, the Bank’s Financial
Development Policy and Strategy 2014-2019 reflects a
seminal effort to expand access to financial services for the
under-served, notably in the informal sectors and rural areas.
The Bank’s new Regional Integration Policy and Strategy
2014-2023 focuses on support to regional infrastructure, the
promotion of intra-African trade and industrial development
through the economics of agglomeration.

3.2 Promoting Inclusiveness in
Bank Operations

The effectiveness of the Bank’s strategies and policies must
be reflected in real impacts on the ground. Recent Bank
projects and programs have included, in both design and
implementation, priorities aimed at maximizing the impact on
economic sustainability and inclusion. These projects cover
such areas as financial markets, infrastructure development—
notably [CT—and the private sector. Specific examples
include programs to support recovery in North Africa in the
wake of the Arab Spring and, more recently, those targeted at
containing the spread and impact of the Ebola virus disease
in parts of West Africa.

Annual Report 2014

Ideally, all Bank operations should be designed and implemented
with a view to maximizing their impact on economic sustainability
and inclusion. This section examines the extent to which
recent projects and programs have been inclusive. It examines
projects and programs with the potential of positive impact
on growth that benefits all segments of society.

Overall Infrastructure. For the Bank, infrastructure comprises
operations in transport, ICT, energy, water, and sanitation. A
question now frequently posed is whether or not modern
infrastructure is inclusive in terms of its promotion of sustainable
development and social equity. The Bank believes that improved
infrastructure facilities can have a positive impact on inclusive
growth by facilitating access to income-generating activities,
creating employment opportunities, and enhancing the welfare
of the people, especially women, youth, (both boys and girls)
and the marginalized.

Transport. The Bank's portfolio for the transport sector includes
large-scale projects for the development of highways, railways,
and regional corridors that have the potential to promote spatial
inclusion. These projects are critical to the opening up of trade
routes, including one-stop border posts that ease business
transactions for border communities and other businesses,
especially small entrepreneurs and farmers. Transport infrastructure

 

DoChapter 3 Bank’s Response to Africa’s Quest for Inclusion

 

also links landlocked economies, which are often more vulnerable
than their coastal neighbors, to regional economic hubs.

A good example is the Bank-funded Kankan-KourémaléBamako transnational interurban network, completed in
2013. This is an extension of Mali’s road network and links
Mali to the corridor that connects it with Guinea. The project
has spurred important transformation through positive health,
security, and economic impacts. The road has reduced travel
time and lowered accident rates. It has also reduced transport
costs and the prices of goods. First-hand accounts from
beneficiaries confirm that vehicle maintenance and repair costs
have dropped by approximately 60 percent. Its importance
to inclusive growth is also reflected in its provision of easier
access to health, educational, and administrative facilities;
improved school enrolment rates, in particular those of girls;
easier access to water supplies; access to increased economic
activity and jobs, and the establishment of new businesses.

The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Revolution.
The Internet and related communication facilities have produced
economic benefits for a number of African countries, including
raising productivity in a range of sectors, such as the informal
economy. The Bank’s support for ICT development on the
continent in recent years has included the financing of cable
systems, satellites, broadband services and backbone systems.

An assessment of the Bank-funded East African Submarine
Cable System (EASSy), for example, shows that it greatly
improved the affordability of ICT services in the region,
reducing wholesale bandwidth prices by 60 percent and

30

up to 90 percent in Tanzania and Kenya,
respectively. The utilization of international
bandwidth in the two countries doubled
within six months. Uptake in previously
marginalized rural areas and other underserved areas rose, often from a zero or a
minimal service base. Some rural schools
were also able to introduce computers
in their classrooms. Mobile phones and
associated technologies became a common
staple, boosting commerce in the informal
sector and allowing farmers to obtain realtime information on market prices in their
neighborhoods or farther afield.

Energy. Electricity and other forms of energy
are an essential prerequisite for much
economic activity. The Bank’s support of
the sector in Africa has had a positive impact
on inclusive growth. Approved in 2014, the
Southern Tunisia Gas Pipeline Project, for
example, will create 1,000 employment
opportunities during construction and 102 jobs during the
operation phase. In another example, the Mozambique
Energy Reform and Access Program will contribute towards
improving productivity, and the quality of life of peri-urban
and rural communities by providing them with electricity
that will help them establish or expand income generation
activities, including irrigated agriculture, agro-industries and
small businesses.

Water and Sanitation. The Bank’s water and sanitation projects
have helped bring critical services to populations across Africa.
They have improved food security as well as sanitary conditions
in underprivileged and densely populated neighborhoods of
Africa’s rapidly expanding cities, and those in under-served
rural areas. Where wells and other sources of water were far,
women’s security has been enhanced by bringing water closer
to their homes. Better access to water has helped free up time
for women and girls, normally responsible for fetching water,
and enables girls to attend school more regularly.

Agriculture and Agro-Business. The Bank sees agriculture in
Africa as an area of special emphasis, with broad potential for
inclusiveness. The Bank is committed to supporting initiatives
aimed at promoting integrated agricultural value chains,
improving market linkages and agribusiness, supporting youth
entrepreneurship in agriculture, and encouraging a paradigm
shift that sees agriculture as a business. Accordingly, the Bank
has financed a number of innovative initiatives to support the
growth of agriculture in Africa. These include support for the
establishment of modern markets (Uganda), food and nutrition
enhancement (Mali), initiatives to kick-start industrialization

Annual Report 2014through agro-processing (Céte d'Ivoire), and supporting the
establishment of modern irrigation to create employment
opportunities for youth in the countryside (Malawi).

Financial Sector Development and Support to Small- and
Medium-size Enterprises (SMEs) and Under-served
Groups. The Bank has developed a number of products
to support the lower levels of the business sector in Africa.
These include direct investments into smaller enterprises for
demonstration effects and lending to dedicated funds active
in microfinance. An example is the Bank’s USD 12 million
line of credit to Nigeria’s LAPO Microfinance Bank in 2014.
LAPO Microfinance has 1.1 million clients and 327 branches.
LAPO bank has a unique group-lending model based on a
community-insurance approach. It specializes in support for
women, who comprise over 90 percent of its total client base.

Operations Targeted at Transition Economies. Conflicts,
epidemics, and natural disasters have prevented many countries
in Africa from reaching their full socio-economic potential.
Conflicts in the Horn of Africa, the Great Lakes Region, the
Sahel, and the Mano River area, have retarded growth. In
response, the AfDB has initiated a number of programs to
address the challenges of fragility and the socio-economic
impacts of the conflicts and natural disasters in these areas
(Box 4.3). In the Mano River region, the recent Ebola epidemic
has slowed down the return to sustained growth. In the latter
part of 2014, for example, the Bank embarked on projects to
help countries in the area deal with the effects of Ebola and
help launch a reconstruction process.

Human Development Projects. The AfDB’s projects for
human capital development in Africa range from enhancing
the quality of skills, science, technology and innovation, to
the promotion of new education models that ensure that
young school graduates have skills that match the needs
of the labor market. At the tertiary level, the Bank supports
the African Virtual University and the Pan-African University.
Both exist to provide opportunities for higher education to
as many people in Africa as possible, at a reasonable cost.
Another notable project supported by the AfDB is the Social
Inclusion and Cohesion Enhancement Support Program in
Céte d'Ivoire. This project aims at integrating ex-combatants
into the job market by addressing the social and psychological
damage caused by the past civil conflict. The project also
aims at nipping all conflicts in the bud in order to guarantee
greater political stability and more equitable economic growth.

Governance and Strengthening of Public Institutions.
Governance and inclusive growth are intertwined. In the
absence of effective public institutions, African countries
cannot make much progress on the inclusive growth agenda.
To support governance through effective institutions, the Bank
has in recent years provided a number of policy-based loans
aimed at enhancing the performance of Africa’s public sector.
Across the continent, streamlined government functions
have helped reduce the cost of doing business, which in
turn boosts private-sector participation in the economy
and growth. The Mozambique Economic Governance and
Inclusive Growth Program, and the Sierra Leone Inclusive
Economic Management Program, both approved in 2014,

“ae

 

3Chapter 3 Bank’s Response to Africa’s Quest for Inclusion

are examples of governance-related programs showing a
positive impact on inclusive growth. In all, the Bank in 2014,
provided support for public-sector reforms and governance
to close to 50 percent of its RMCs.

Strengthening the Bank as a Gender-Responsive Institution.

The Bank’s Gender Strategy is a response to the reality that
gender equality is critical to Africa’s economic and social
development. The strategy recognizes the need to strengthen
the legal and property rights of African women, promote
their economic empowerment, and enhance gender-related
knowledge management and capacity building in the Bank’s
operations. In line with its TYS and Gender Strategy, the
mainstreaming of gender in the Bank's corporate policies,
practices and operations has improved considerably. Gender
indicators, for example, are now included in the Bank’s
Corporate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and are monitored
monthly through the Executive Dashboard. Initiatives in the
pipeline designed for a high impact in promoting women’s
empowerment include: (i) The Busara Micro-, Small-, and
Medium-size Enterprises (MSME) Facility to invest in African
Women led/managed SMEs with high growth and impact
potential; (ii) The Ebola Social Investment Fund that aims to
address the socio-economic impact of the Ebola epidemic on
women in the Mano River Union, and (ii) the establishment of
African Digital Marketplace for women that provides access
to information, markets and finance, and provides them with
a safe place to make transactions.

Bank Operations Approved in 2014 that

have Potential Positive Impact on Inclusive Growth

A few examples of the Bank’s interventions in various sectors
that show how inclusive growth is being fostered in Bank
Group operations are presented below.

¢ The Malawi Sustainable Rural Water and Sanitation Infrastructure
for Improved Health and Livelihoods Project was approved
in April 2014. The project will contribute to inclusive growth
by improving access to clean water and sanitation and
improving watershed management in the project locations.
The improvement in access to water will free up the time spent
by women and girls in fetching water and free up their time
for more productive activities such as agriculture and off-farm
activities. By eradicating water-borne diseases, the project
will enable the population to become more productive and
take advantage of various economic opportunities.

¢ The Mozambique Economic Governance and Inclusive Growth
Program, approved in September 2014, aims to promote
inclusive and sustainable growth by consolidating transparent
and accountable public financial management and improving
the enabling environment for private-sector development in the
country. Expected outcomes include: (i) improved efficiency

32

and transparency in the management of natural resources;
and (ii) expanded opportunities for business creation, growth,
and employment which will ultimately be reflected in new jobs.

The Horn of Africa Drought Resilience and Sustainable
Livelihoods Program (DRSLP), Phase II. This multinational
program aims to address the impacts of severe droughts
and chronic food insecurity in the region. Phase Il of the
program (USD 153 million), approved in 2014, will cover
Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan. A large proportion of
the 20 million agro-pastoralists in the region are food insecure,
exposed to drought and institutional weaknesses that lead
to debilitating cyclical poverty. This innovative, multi-phase
program enhances inclusiveness through infrastructure
programs for water mobilization and management, livestock
health and production, and marketing. Communities will
have direct access to these services. Women will benefit
from specialized training. Overall, the project will enhance
the resilience of rural households and communities against
the impacts of climate change.

The Multinational Program to Build Resilience to Food and
Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS). This program was
approved in October 2014 for the benefit of Mauritania and
other Sahel Countries in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Chad,
The Gambia, Mali, Niger, and Senegal). The program’s overall
objective is to contribute to inclusive growth by reducing
poverty and improving food and nutrition security in the
Sahel. Its specific objective is to increase, on a sustainable
basis, agro-pastoral and fishery productivity. The program
will improve the living conditions of over three million people,
51 percent of whom are women.

3.3 The Bank’s Knowledge Management,
Capacity Building and Advocacy

In keeping with its knowledge generation and management
mandate, the Bank produced a number of flagship publications
in 2014. These include the African Development Bank Group
Annual Report 2013, the African Economic Outlook Report
2014 on the theme of global value chains, and the African
Development Report 2014 on Regional Integration and
Inclusive Growth.

The African Development Report 2014 focused on how
economic integration could contribute to inclusive growth, a
relatively new notion in development. The publication identified
competitiveness, regional value chains, broadening market
access, and allowing the mobility of populations as key aspects
of regional integration that could improve inclusiveness. The
four editions of the African Development Review produced
in 2014 and 20 Working Papers also addressed the issue
of inclusiveness.

Annual Report 2014The theme of the African Economic Conference for 2014, held
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was Knowledge and Innovation
for Africa’s Transformation, while Inclusive Economies was
the theme of the forum co-sponsored by the Bank, the
Rockefeller Foundation, and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, in Nairobi, Kenya. These knowledge
products and events provided opportunities for African and
other stakeholders to benefit from the Bank’s leadership of
the discourse on promoting inclusive growth in Africa.

The core research in the Bank has also gravitated towards
sustainable and inclusive growth. The Bank’s research on
affordable housing in Africa is one such example. This research
indicates that the bulk of the interventions in Africa’s housing
markets by international finance institutions and the private
sector, by default, target the upper middle classes who are
seen as creditworthy. The Bank’s research on trade finance
shows that small businesses are seriously rationed and require
a mechanism to sustain them, as current lending rates on
the parallel markets are prohibitively high.

Further, the Bank partnered with the Korean Development
Institute in undertaking a study on inclusive growth in Africa. It
also carried out a joint study with the World Bank and Cornell
University on “Agriculture in Africa: Myths and Realities and
Inclusive Growth”.

In view of the importance of training and capacity development
for the attainment of inclusive growth, the Bank developed
the elnstitute Knowledge Portal (http://einstitute.afdb.org)
in 2013. The platform now contains over 40 training and
knowledge products that cover inclusive growth, green
growth, and value for money in the social sector. The elnstitute
aims to become the lead platform for distance learning and
eLearning for generating and sharing knowledge for capacity
development in Africa. In pursuit of improved access to
knowledge and new ideas, the Bank has facilitated networking
opportunities among African think tanks to enhance their
engagement in its policy dialogue for inclusive growth and
economic transformation.

Inclusive growth requires high quality and reliable statistics
and tools for analysis. It is broadly acknowledged that good
data are vital to policymaking and policy implementation,
monitoring, evaluation, and review. In this regard, the Bank has
undertaken measures to strengthen its Statistics Department
and ensure it provides statistical leadership in the inclusive
growth debate. In particular, the statistics function has focused
on strengthening the development effectiveness of the Bank’s
operations and statistical capacity building in RMCs. A result
has been a significant improvement in data coverage, quality,
reliability and harmonization in RMCs. The re-launching in 2014
of the Bank’s Africa Information Highway (AIH) Initiative has

Annual Report 2014

Bank’s Response to Africa’s Quest for Inclusion Chapter 3

made it possible for virtually anyone with Internet access to
obtain detailed official data on African economies. The Bank’s
data-gathering platforms include those for agricultural and
rural statistics, labor force surveys, and regionally comparable
consumer price indices. Publications based on the Bank’s
statistical work have included those on gender, poverty,
environmental indicators, the Africa Tourism Monitor, and a
volume on Africa’s middle class.

3.4 Looking Ahead

The inclusive-growth agenda calls for vigorous action. While
policy options are well known, effective implementation
has sometimes fallen short of expectations. Political will,
accompanied by effective bureaucracies, will be needed to
ensure progress in the future.

Although the Bank has made progress in incorporating
elements of inclusiveness in its operational work and knowledge
products, there are undoubtedly some challenges still to
overcome. The development process is complex and dynamic
and involves many components. As such, there is certainly
no silver bullet to tackling these challenges. As experience
has shown, Bank lending alone, even when accompanied
by capacity-building efforts, might not be sufficient to push
countries on to a sustainable and inclusive growth path. Rather,
fostering inclusion calls for dedicated policymaking and strong
leadership and participation of all citizens, if desired results
are to be attained.

One important area on which the Bank needs to focus in
the coming years is the strengthening of its capacity to learn
from its past operations through impact evaluation (IE). As
noted earlier, IE is important in determining whether or not
an intervention works and under what contexts it works
and will therefore help in scale-ups and redesign of similar
new projects. First, IE needs to be institutionalized in the
Bank so that it is conducted under a clear framework, with
clear incentives for projects that have an IE component.
Incentives could include having a score for IE in the project
preparation process (readiness review, for instance). Second,
more resources, including human and financial, need to be
dedicated to IE to ensure quality analyses of the impact of
Bank interventions and to ensure that the Bank gets value
for money from the projects implemented.

Knowledge generation, skills, and technology —key ingredients
for achieving inclusive growth and poverty reduction —will
continue to be a major area of focus for the Bank. Through
dedicated research and the provision of advisory services, the
Bank will help countries boost their capacity-building initiatives
and support their provision of quality education, especially
vocational training and skills development.

33Chapter 3 Bank’s Response to Africa’s Quest for Inclusion

Private-sector development activities promote inclusive growth
across all economic sectors and firms, ranging from microenterprises to large corporations, generating growth, jobs and
economic opportunities for all, especially the poor. In Africa, the
private-sector accounts for over 80 percent of total production,
two-thirds of total investment, three-quarters of total credit
to the African economy, and 90 percent of the labor force.
Given its important role in the economy, the current levels of
the Bank's support to the private sector must be sustained.

Further, the Bank should broaden the coverage of both its
sovereign and non-sovereign investments and operations.
This will give it greater headroom to support financial sector
activities in Low-Income Countries (LICs), as well as states
in fragile situations. The Bank should prudently deploy its
diverse range of financial products— guarantees, risk capital/
equity investments, and grants—to respond to market needs
and context while also balancing the associated risks. The
most appropriate way to proceed will be to pilot solutions
in each region. Successes should be replicated and scaled
up in other countries that share similar economic and/or
regulatory constraints.

Access to markets is central to inclusive growth and ensuring
he broad creation of economic opportunities. More competitive/
lexible agricultural commodity markets should be promoted
‘0 create opportunities that enable poor farmers to access
domestic and export markets. This should be complemented
by adequate regulatory frameworks. Further, it is imperative
hat access to agricultural markets is promoted by providing
production-side investments that improve productivity and
product quality, while responding to the challenges of poorly
unctioning domestic and regional markets and costly transport
systems that significantly increase farmers’ costs and crowd
hem and African traders out of domestic and regional markets.

By global standards, African women are both economically
active and highly entrepreneurial. They form the bulk of
he agricultural labor force and also own and operate the
majority of businesses in the informal sector. However, they
are concentrated in low-productivity occupations. Closing
he productivity gap for African women could make a huge
contribution to inclusive growth.

 

Addressing the challenges of multinational programs on
issues of fragility and socio-economic problems (see Box 4.3
in Chapter 4) requires significant resources, and a concerted
effort from development partners and national entities. It calls
for effective and well-coordinated partnerships and capacity
building. The relevant program-coordinating institutions, in
particular regional organizations such as the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD), the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS), and the Permanent Interstate

34

Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS), can
be strengthened to coordinate regional programs, in close
collaboration with national agencies. For example, the Common
Programs developed by countries in the Horn of Africa to build
resilience against drought and promote sustainable livelinoods,
can provide a good common framework for interventions that
also coincide with national priorities. Such programs can be
replicated elsewhere on the continent.

The next three chapters outline how the challenges noted
above were addressed by the Bank through its delivery of
projects and advisory services in 2014.

Bank Group OperationsChapter 4 Bank Group Operations

The Bank's lending activities are conducted through three windows of the Bank Group: the
African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria
Trust Fund (NTF). In the charged calendar for 2014, which included the Bank’s return to Abidjan,
particular attention was paid to project quality as well as to project alignment to the Bank’s
Ten-Year Strategy, which entered its second year of implementation. Bank Group operations
amounted to UA 5.05 billion in 2014, an increase of 15.1 percent over 2013. An overview of
the overall Bank Group performance in its operations is followed by a review of performance by
sector. The Bank’s operations are also presented according to Africa’s five sub-regions. Further,
the chapter looks at other non-lending areas of intervention, including partnerships and HIPC/

MDRI debt-relief operations.
a

41 Overview

In 2014, Bank Group operations increased by 15.1 percent over
2013. As in previous years, and in line with the TYS, infrastructure
operations, mainly in energy and transport, received the bulk of
Bank Group resources. For the ADB window, operations rose
by 74.8 percent to UA 3.20 billion with both the sovereign and
private-sector operations exceeding their targets. Although ADF
lending met its target for 2014, there was a decline of 29.8 percent
in operations in comparison with 2013. The slow take-off of ADF
activities in 2014, the first year of the ADF-13 Replenishment
was an important factor. At the ADF window, the social and
agricultural sectors showed strong performance, as did lines
of credit to SMEs and trade finance under the ADB window.

Bank Group operations in 2014 were aligned with the Bank’s
Ten-Year Strategy (TYS), which emphasizes infrastructure
investments (energy, transport, water and sanitation, and ITC).
Infrastructure investments during the year accounted for over
55 percent of the Bank’s operations. Bank interventions in
the social sector included support for Ebola emergency relief
operations. These took up about 40 percent of the Bank’s loan
and grant resources invested in social sector interventions.
Despite the impact of the Ebola outbreak, the mixed impact of
depressed oil prices and other head and tailwinds, continued
implementation of the Bank’s TYS, which entered its second
year in 2014, is expected to contribute to Africa’s accelerated
and inclusive growth in the years ahead.

Overview of Bank Group Operations by window. Total Bank
Group operations (including loans and grants, equity participation,
guarantees and Special Funds) amounted to UA 5.05 billion in
2014, an increase of 15.1 percent over 2013. Both the private
and public sector operations of the ADB window exceeded

38

their targets for 2014. Operations at the ADB window increased
by 74.8 percent to UA 3.20 billion over the previous year while
ADF window operations fell by 29.8 percent to UA 1.59 billion
(Figure 4.1), although they still exceeded the lending target for
2014. The weaker performance at the ADF window was partly
due to the slow take-off of activities in 2014, the first year of
the implementation of the ADF-13 Replenishment.

Closing the infrastructure gap is vital to Africa’s economic
progress. Accordingly, the demand for the financing of power
and transport was high at the ADB private-sector window. The
ADB public-sector window saw a similar trend, with strong
demand for the financing of water projects. A UA 8.95 million
provision for business development and diversification of the
client base in the 2014 budget had positive results as it helped
increase the ADB's public-sector lending to 11 countries from

six in 2013. Further, the ADB private-sector window helped
leverage approximately UA 13.0 billion in co-financing, more
than double the year’s UA 6.0 billion target.

The Nigeria Trust Fund approved two projects, a UA 6.5-million
agricultural project and UA 5.0 million water supply project.
This brought its total approvals in 2014 to UA 11.5 million
(Table 4.1), a 63.2 percent decline on 2013 figures.

A total of UA 4.50 billion (89.1 percent) of the Bank Group's total
approvals were for loans and grants, while UA 549.9 million
(10.9 percent) were for private-sector equity participation,
guarantees, and resources from Special Funds (Table 4.1).

Annual Report 2014

Approvals from Special Funds amounted to UA 244.2 million,
a decline of 3.6 percent from 2013. Special Funds included
the African Water Facility, the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Initiative, the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program, the Middle East and North Africa Transition Fund,
the Nigeria Technical Cooperation Trust Fund, the Fund for
African Private Sector Assistance, the Microfinance Capacity
Building Fund, and the Governance Trust Fund. Other Special
Funds, specifically related to climate change, were the
Global Environment Facility, the Climate Investment Funds,
the Climate Technology Fund, the Sustainable Energy Fund
for Africa, the Congo Basin Forest Fund, and the Special
Climate Change Fund.

39Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

While Africa’s economic growth continues to rise, the continent's
large infrastructure deficit remains a major constraint. An AfDB
study, “Infrastructure Deficit and Opportunities in Africa” states
that only 34 percent of Africa’s population has access to roads,
compared to 50 percent in other parts of the developing world.
Transport costs on the continent are 100 percent higher than
they are in other parts of the developing world. The study also
notes that only 30 percent of Africa’s population has access
to electricity, compared to 70-90 percent in other parts of
the developing world. Further, Africa’s water resources are
underutilized, with only 5 percent of the continent’s agriculture
under irrigation. Similarly, Internet penetration on the continent
is ata mere 6 percent, compared to an average of 40 percent
elsewhere in the developing world.

Given these gaps, a priority of the Bank’s TYS is to close
the continent's infrastructure deficit. This is in the belief that
improved infrastructure in Africa will facilitate increased
intra-regional and international trade, reduce the cost of
doing business, and enhance Africa’s competitiveness in
the global economy. It will also act as a catalyst for Africa’s
economic diversification and transformation. The sectoral
distribution of Bank Group operations in 2014, illustrated
below (Figure 4.2a), is in line with the TYS emphasis on
infrastructure development.

Summary of Bank Group Operations by Sector. Figure
4.2a shows that Bank Group approvals for infrastructure
stood at UA 2.50 billion (65.5 percent of total approvals). Of
this total, energy (29.3 percent) and transport (20.4 percent)
accounted for the largest share of approvals while water and
sanitation took up 5.7 percent. The relatively large share of
approvals for infrastructure underscores the emphasis that
the Bank has placed on narrowing Africa’s infrastructure
deficit, a barrier to inclusive growth.

Figure 4.2a also shows that approvals for Africa’s finance
sector were at 17.9 percent of the total. These approvals were
targeted primarily at alleviating credit constraints faced by smalland medium-size enterprises and fostering financial inclusion.
The chart shows that agriculture took up 10.9 percent of total
approvals. The Bank’s goals in the sector are to enhance food
security and raise farm productivity and rural incomes. The
chart also shows that the social sector received 8.2 percent
of total approvals. Here, the focus continues to be on skills
development, technological innovation and improving health
sector infrastructure. There were also smaller approvals for
multi-sector, industry and environment operations.

Figures 4.2b and 4.2c show that infrastructure approvals by
window, ADB and ADF, were significant. However, approvals
for social sector-related activities, agriculture, and multi-sector
activities (for governance-related operations) from the ADF

window were larger than those for the ADB. For the ADB
window, on the other hand, finance operations for lines of
credit, trade finance, and support to micro-, small-, and
medium-size enterprises were significant.

Bank Group Approvals and Disbursements. During 2014,
Bank Group loan and grant disbursements, excluding Special
Funds, equity participation and guarantees, amounted to UA
3.16 billion, a 0.7 percent increase over 2013 (Figure 4.3).
However, the ratio of total disbursements to total approvals,
declined to 70.1 percent in 2014, compared to 88.0 percent
in 2013, and 93.8 percent in 2012. The high volume of
approvals in 2014, at UA 4.50 billion, a 26.5 percent increase
over approvals in 2013, was a key factor in the drop in this
disbursement ratio to 70.1 percent in 2014. The increasing lag
between loan approval and first disbursement, infrequent project
supervision, the inadequate quality at entry of some projects,
and other slippages were also factors in the decline in the
disbursement rate. The weaknesses in portfolio performance
that led to the lower disbursement rate in 2014, compared
with 2012 and 2013, needs to be addressed in order to raise
both the level and rate of disbursement in the years ahead.

With regard to the Bank’s financing windows, the total
disbursements in 2014 for the ADB were UA 1.94 billion (61.4
percent of the Bank Group total); UA 1.22 billion (88.5 percent)
for the ADF, and UA 3.1 million (0.1 percent) for the NTF.

Annual Report 2014

The Bank Group’s loan and grant approvals and actual
disbursements (Figure 4.3) peaked in 2009. This is explained
by the Bank’s response to extraordinary and unusually high
demand for resources from RMCs at the height of the 2008/2009
global financial crisis, as their other sources had dried up. To
meet this demand for financing, the Bank devised countercyclical measures in the form of quick disbursing budget
support operations and short-term trade and liquidity facilities.

Bank Group loan and grant approvals have since returned to
normal levels, with total annual approvals at between UA 3
and 5 billion. For total Bank Group approvals, including equity
participation, guarantees, and drawdowns from Special Funds,
the normal range is between UA 4 and 6 billion.

ADB Approvals by Country. In 2014, ADB approvals stood
at UA 2.90 billion, 57.7 percent for public-sector operations
and 42.3 percent for private-sector operations. Figure 4.4
illustrates this distribution.

ADF Approvals by Country. Of the total ADF approvals (UA
1.58 billion), 44.6 percent went to multinational operations
while the remaining 55.4 percent went to 30 ADF recipients.
This distribution is illustrated in Figure 4.5.

4.2 Bank Group Operations by Priority and
Areas of Special Emphasis (including
Management of the Ebola Crisis)

This section looks at Bank operations with regard to the
priorities and areas of special emphasis in its TYS. The
analysis highlights the operations approved by the Bank in
2014. These include infrastructure in its main components,
namely energy, transport, water and sanitation; private-sector
development; regional integration; governance, and skills
and human development. This section also reviews the three
areas of special emphasis under the TYS: gender, agriculture

and food security, and states under fragile situations. Two
subsections review the Bank's budget support, relief operations
and the socio-economic impact and management of the Ebola
epidemic and the Bank’s programs to address fragility and
other socio-economic challenges in the Sahel Region, Horn
of Africa, and Lake Chad Basin.

Transport. Loan and grant approvals for 24 transport sector
operations in 2014 stood at UA 918.7 million, representing
36.8 percent of the UA 2.50 billion approvals for infrastructure.
(Figure 4.6). West and Central Africa were the main beneficiaries.
During the year, there was one large private-sector transport
project in South Africa (Transnet) and a few smaller publicsector projects in Eastern Africa.

The largest of the public-sector operations financed by the
Bank in 2014 was the multinational Road Development and
Transport Facilitation Program (UA 140.9 million) in the Mano
River Union (MRU) in West Africa. The program seeks to
help the three MRU countries, namely Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea
and Liberia, to overcome fragility and will benefit road users,
transporters, farmers, and some 2.83 million people, especially
disadvantaged groups, women and children. The program is
financed from the countries’ ADF loan allocations and grants
from the Transition Support Facility. Another large public-sector
operation approved by the Bank was the UA 136.1 million to
finance Cameroon's Batschenga-Ntui-Yoko-Tibati- Ngaoundéré
road project under the country’s Transport Sector Support

infrastructure, support regional economic integration, provide
a platform for private-sector development, reduce carbon
dioxide (CO,) emissions and promote the transfer of new rail
technology skills to local workers. In particular, the operation
will deliver the efficient transportation of agricultural produce
to markets.

Energy. Bank Group approvals to the energy sector in 2014
stood at UA 1.46 billion, of which UA 1.32 billion was in loans
and grants, UA 127.8 in million Special Funds, and UA 8.2
million in guarantees. Public-sector financing took up UA
1.01 billion (76.5 percent) while private-sector financing stood
at UA 310.0 million (23.5 percent). Map 4.1 presents major
public and private-sector energy projects approved in 2014.

The single largest approval for the sector was the UA 645.3
million, 48.9 percent of total energy approvals, for the Angola
Power Sector Reform Program, a public-sector initiative. The
program will expand access to electricity at affordable rates for
the rural communities, especially who comprise 45.2 percent
of Angola’s population. It will also cover a restructuring of
Angola’s power sector, and regulatory environment.

Another major approval for the sector was the UA 194.7 million
loan for the private-sector-financed Dangote Oil Refinery and

imports by 80 percent and address the country’s high oil import
bill by doubling refining capacity. Further, the construction of
the refinery will create temporary jobs during construction,
and 2,900 full-time jobs when it is fully operational.

Other approvals included two renewable energy projects,
namely, the Ouarzazate Solar Complex Project (Phase Il),
a public-private partnership in Morocco (UA 166.4 million);
and South Africa’s private-sector-funded Xina Solar One
operation (UA 64.9 million). This project is a key component
in the South African government’s renewable energy program
(Map 4.1 and Box 4.1).

Environment and Climate Change. During the year, the
Bank approved four operations in the environment and social
change sector totaling UA 33.2 million, representing 0.74
percent of the total Bank Group loan and grant approvals
(Figure 4.2a). The approvals were for Cameroon, Chad, Niger
and the Central African Republic to rehabilitate and strengthen
the resilience of their common Lake Chad Basin habitat.
There was also an approval for a UA 2.1 million Special Fund
operation for work with communities to reduce deforestation
in the Virunga-Hoyo region in the Democratic Republic of
Congo. These climate-financing operations support the TYS’s
transition to green growth agenda.

Box 4.1 highlights some attributes of other projects that
promote Africa's transition to green growth.

Box 4.1 Transition to Green Growth Operations

 

The Quarzazate Solar Complex Project (Phase Il) in Morocco was
approved in December 2014 to achieve a power generating capacity
of approximately 500 MW by developing two power plants (NOORo II
and NOORo Ill) under a public-private partnership. The plants will use
thermodynamic solar power technology that can store energy for more
than five hours. The project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
some 522,000 tons, thus mitigating the effects of climate change. The
knowledge generated by the project will enable Morocco and other RMCs
to better design and leverage similar ventures.

The Xina Solar One Project in the Republic of South Africa was
approved in October 2014 as a key component in the government's
renewable energy program which aims to produce 6,927 MW power
through renewable energy by 2017. The project, in keeping with South
Africa’s energy diversification strategy, will help reduce the country’s
current over-dependence on coal-fired power plants. This project is fully
in line with the Bank’s emphasis on renewable energy projects.

Water Supply and Sanitation. |n 2014, the Bank Group
approved 17 water and sanitation projects of UA 290.1 million.
These projects, mainly in water, will promote inclusive growth
by improving access to water and freeing up time for girls to
attend school more regularly, and for women to invest their
time in more productive activities such as agriculture. Six of
the 17 projects were financed by loans and grants totaling
UA 258.5 million (89.1 percent) while the 11 others were
funded exclusively through Special Funds (UA 31.6 million
(10.9 percent). The single largest approval was UA 132.5
million (61.2 percent of loans and grants) for Nigeria’s Urban
Water Sector Reform and Port-Harcourt Water and Sanitation
Project. Nearly all the loans and grants were used to finance
operations in ADF-eligible RMCs.

 

45Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

The African Water Facility (AWF) funded eight of 13 Special
Funds operations, while five others were financed from Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI) sources. The
funds will support (i) the sustainable development of requisite

infrastructure for water supply and sanitation; (ii) coordination
of water-related activities within the Bank and in RMCs; (iii) the
creation of an enabling environment for water and sanitation
sector development at national and regional levels; and (iv)

management of water-related knowledge activities.

Box 4.2 The Three Water Initiatives

 

African Water Facility (AWF). This is an initiative of the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) which is hosted and administered by the African
Development Bank. It was established in 2004 as a Special Water Fund to help African countries achieve the Africa Water Vision 2025 objectives. In
2014, eight AWF projects and one multinational studies program were approved for six countries, with a combined cumulative commitment of UA 13.7
million. These initiatives comprise three project preparation interventions (Nigeria, Mozambique and Somalia), two small strategic investments (Kenya), and
one knowledge management project (South Africa). The Somalia project is in support of a state under transition. All six approvals emphasize the role of
women, youth and the poor. Notably, sanitation services will be improved for the urban poor while employment opportunities will be created through small
businesses for women and the youth. As part of its efforts to mainstream climate-change activities in all of its projects, the AWF in 2014 launched a Call
for Proposals for the preparation of Climate Resilient Water Resources Development Operations program in Africa. Approval of the program is expected
to provide up to EUR 16 million for the financing of new projects in Africa. The program expects to leverage EUR 600 million in downstream co-financed
investments to strengthen enabling environments for adaptation/mitigation actions.

Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI). This initiative was conceived by the Bank in 2003 as a regional framework for mobilizing partners,
knowledge and the investments needed to meet water supply and sanitation development goals in rural Africa. In line with the African Water Vision, it aims
to provide full and equitable access to safe, adequate and affordable water supply and sanitation in rural Africa by 2025. Five of the nine projects approved
by RWSSI in 2014 (UA 105 million) were for Guinea, Senegal, Ethiopia, Malawi and Zambia and focused on rural water supply and sanitation. Preparations
for operationalization of the Kigali Action Plan (KAP), an African Union Commission initiative to be implemented within the framework of the RWSSI, started
in 2014. The action plan, and its resources, will be managed under the RWSSI Trust Fund. The RWSS! increased its visibility and outreach in 2014 through
enhanced communication efforts.

Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP). The MDWPP, launched in 2002, aims to promote effective water management policies and practices at
regional and country levels, and to operationalize the Bank’s Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) policy in RMCs. It catalyzed the establishment
of the AWF and RWSS! that have strengthened Bank and RMC capacities for integrated water resource management. The program’s active portfolio in
2014 comprised 16 initiatives with a total budget of EUR 2.83-million. Notable products and activities that were prepared and/or completed under MDWPP
in 2014 include: (i) a study on the AfDB’s role in achieving regional integration through trans-boundary basin development and management; (ii) climate
change mainstreaming guidelines for the water and sanitation sector, and (iii) a framework and business plan for operationalization of the Permanent
Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS).

46 Annual Report 2014Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

Box 4.3 The Bank’s Programs in the Sahel, Horn of Abrica, and Lake Chad Basin

 

The Sahel Program. The Bank's assistance to the Sahel is centered primarily on building climate resilience, promoting regional integration and trade
facilitation through infrastructure and capacity development. The Bank has pledged USD 4 billion for the Sahel over the next few years. The funding is to
help make the Sahel a region of stability and economic growth. In October 2014, the Bank approved a UA 155.8 million flagship Program to Build Resilience
to Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel (P2RS) that covers seven countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal.
The program’s goals are to address fragility and build the resilience of vulnerable populations against food and nutrition insecurity, as well as cope with
uncertainty, and adapt to climate change in a sustainable manner.

The Horn of Africa Initiative. The Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Program (DRSLP) is a multi-phased program which covers eight vulnerable
Horn of Africa countries (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda). In November 2014, the Bank approved USD 153 million
for Phase ll of the project. This phase will benefit four countries, namely, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The project will develop infrastructure for water
mobilization and management, and livestock production, health, and marketing. It will also build the capacity of the region’s populations and governments to better
cope with the effects of climate change. An estimated 20 million agro-pastoralists affected by drought and land degradation will benefit directly from the project.
Other direct beneficiaries will include the governments of the region by strengthening their capacities to enhance drought resilience and regional integration.

Program to Rehabilitate and Strengthen Resilience of Lake Chad Basin Ecosystems (PRESIBALT). In December 2014, the Bank approved UA 33.2
million for PRESIBALT. The program is aligned with the Bank's TYS and emphasizes inclusive and green growth. It is also in line with the Bank’s 20142019 Strategy for addressing fragility and strengthening resilience, as well as the Bank’s Action Plan on Climate Change. It aims to improve resilience
of vulnerable populations in Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, the Central African Republic and Chad, who depend on the Lake Chad Basin’s natural resources
for their livelihoods. Specifically, the program will (i) strengthen the resilience of the basin’s socio-ecological systems, (ii) develop key products to support
adaptation to climate-change impacts, and (iii) strengthen social peace through sound governance of shared resources. The program will directly benefit
15.3 million people living within the lake area, 52 percent of whom are women, by improving their incomes, food security, and access to basic social
infrastructure. The lake had shrunk from 25,000 sq. km in the 1960s to some 2,500 sq. km in 2014.

Worthy of note is the significant rise in social sector approvals
from 2.3 percent in 2013 to 19.6 percent in 2014, largely due
to the Bank’s multinational emergency response to the Ebola
virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa. Social Sector
anti-EVD approvals in 2014 stood at UA 147.9 million, mostly
as grants to strengthen West Africa’s public health systems, as
budget support to fight the epidemic, and technical assistance
to the three most affected countries.

Two other large regional operations included the loan to the
African-Export-Import Bank (UA 180.7 million) to cover lines of
credit, trade finance and risk participation, and a UA 86.0 million
equity participation in Africa50—the new fund created by the
Bank to mobilize up to USD 100 billion for Africa’s infrastructure
development. Another major multinational operation was a
UA 140.9 million loan for the regional Road Development and
Transport Facilitation Program within the Mano River Union
that comprises Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia.

Besides the provision of financial support and technical
assistance, the Bank was also an active participant in
multinational programs seeking solutions to the socioeconomic challenges in the Sahel region, the Horn of Africa,
the Mano River Region and the Lake Chad Basin, among
others. In October 2014, the Bank Group President and

Annual Report 2014

Senior Management together with global figures went on a
joint field mission to the Mano River Union (MRU) countries
to gain a first-hand picture of the impact of the Ebola crisis.
There was also a similar mission to the Horn of Africa to obtain
a fuller understanding of the most urgent issues there. Box
4.3 presents the Bank’s programs in the Sahel, Horn of Africa,
and Lake Chad Basin.

4]Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

Private-Sector Operations. The Bank in 2014 approved
UA 1.59 billion to finance 48 new private-sector operations,
84 national and 14 multinational operations. The amount
represented an impressive 51.4 percent increase over the UA
1.05 billion approved for private sector operations in 2013.
Approvals to the financial sector, mainly in the form of trade
finance, lines of credit, guarantees and equity participation,
represented 51.0 percent of the total for the private sector
(Figure 4.8). However, this was relatively lower than the sector’s
65.5 percent share in 2013. Private-sector investments in
infrastructure, which accounted for 38.8 percent of total private
sector approvals, were in energy and transport operations,
while smaller amounts were approved for agriculture, social
and multi-sector operations.

The Dangote Oil Refinery and Fertilizer Projects (UA 194.7 million)

in Nigeria, and Transnet expansion project (UA 170.7 million) in
South Africa were the largest private-sector projects approved.
Another major approval was that for the Bank’s UA 86.0 million
equity participation in Africa50, a fund to catalyze and draw
innovative financing from African and other sources in support
of Africa’s infrastructure development (Box 4.4).

Box 4.4 Africa50 Incorporated

The African Legal Support Facility (ALSF). The ALSF has
continued to grow and deliver on its mandate of supporting
African states to address creditor litigation issues and negotiate
better agreements, especially in the natural resource sector
and on major infrastructure projects. In 2014, the facility was
able to intervene in some major projects with the potential for
long-lasting development impact (Box 4.5).

African Natural Resources Center (ANRC). The ANRC was
established in December 2013 to scale up work in Africa’s
natural-resource management. Its long-term goal is to improve
inclusive growth from renewable resources management
(fisheries, forestry, land and water) and non-renewable
resources (oil, gas and minerals) in Africa. In particular, the
center seeks to promote effective public and private-sector
governance and institutional frameworks to support poverty
reduction, contain potentially adverse physical and social
environmental impacts, protect renewable resources, and
foster sound revenue management practices, among others.

During the year, the ANRC provided technical support to the
Fisheries Committee of the West Central Gulf of Guinea (FCWC).

 

In April 2014, the Board of Directors approved the Bank’s UA 86 million aggregate equity participation in Africa50’s project finance and project development
entities. In September 2014, Africa50 was incorporated in Casablanca, Morocco, after a competitive selection process among RMCs. The fund has since
drawn interest from diverse investors including pension funds and development finance institutions as well as several African governments. Africa50

expects to reach a capitalization of close to USD 1 billion by the end of 2015.

Africa50 is a new, landmark investment vehicle, focused exclusively on Africa’s infrastructure opportunities. It was incubated by the AfDB as an independent,
profit driven, and commercially managed entity. The fund will provide attractive risk adjusted returns to its investors throughout the project value chain,
from project development to equity and debt investments in infrastructure assets. Africa50 has a triple bottom line. This is to achieve commercial returns,

create business opportunities for all market players, and make an impact on building the Africa of the future.

The public-private nature of the fund means that it has the benefits of private sector rigor, the convening power of the AfDB and the political commitment
of its early capital providers, African governments. Commitment from African governments creates a perfect alignment of interests between investors
and countries, significantly reducing investment risk. Africa50 will be a true catalyst, mobilizing further private sector funding to provide infrastructure

investments at scale for both countries and regions.

The vehicle is specifically designed to tap into the USD 50 billion annual market opportunity in African infrastructure. The Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA), launched by the African Union, is a program designed to develop a vision and strategic framework for the development of
regional and continental infrastructure. PIDA alone presents an opportunity of USD 68 billion in projects to which Africa50 will have privileged access.

 

Africa50 is targeting USD 3 billion in equity, coupled wit!

 

an international single-A credit rating. This will enable it to tap into international capital markets

with an appropriate level of flexibility, provide leverage to boost returns on equity, and scale up investment. The objective is to increase Africa50’s capital
base to USD 10 billion through single A-rated bonds, which will mobilize African resources such as those of African central banks and pension funds, as
well as international capital markets. Through its strategic partnership and specific design, Africa50 aims to create USD 100 billion of project opportunities

 

for global market players.

Annual Report 2014Box 4.5 African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) in 2014

 

he activities of the ALSF in 2014 were supported by its major funders,
namely the African Development Bank, Canada, UK, France, Norway,
he Netherlands, USAID, and the Islamic Development Bank. The facility
approved 24 projects for capacity building in the negotiation of complex
commercial agreements with external investors in RMCs.

During the year, the facility successfully defended the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) against a major vulture fund (FG Hemisphere) before the
United States’ Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. The DRC’s victory in the case
meant huge savings for the country in the suit for which it would have
een required to pay over USD 100 million claimed by the vulture fund.

Another major success story for the facility in 2014 was the support
rovided to Niger, which successfully negotiated a new uranium mining
concession with Areva subsidiaries following the expiry of Areva’s concession
at the end of 2013. With the support of the facility, and through the work
carried out by selected legal counsel, Niger and Areva agreed on several
key issues, thereby avoiding potential litigation, and leading to increased
returns for Niger.

 

 

Through provision of support to their defense against vulture funds, the
facility ensures that RMCs’ resources are preserved for development
operations. The ALSF is also facilitating negotiations in at least 15 RMCs,
helping them to resolve issues in major natural-resource contracts. Further,
the Facility has been supporting negotiations on a variety of infrastructure
deals, thereby facilitating investment.

The facility has, meanwhile, enhanced partnerships intended to generate
key knowledge instruments necessary for African negotiators. These
include participation in the development of a handbook, “Understanding
Power Purchase Agreements”, in partnership with the Natural Resource
Governance Institute and Columbia Center for Sustainable Investment for
the Resource Contracts initiative, as well as the launch of the African Mining
Legislation Atlas with the World Bank (access material at: http://a-mla.org).

At the FOWC’s request, the ANRC worked with a consultant to
assist the FCWC’s six member countries with the ratification and
implementation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
“Agreement on Port States Measures”, and with compliance
to EU anti-illegal fishing regulations. Also, following a request
from its government, the ANRC embarked on discussions
with internal and external partners to coordinate the Bank’s
technical support to the Simandou South Iron Ore and
Infrastructure Project in Guinea, the world’s largest mining
development and private-sector investment in Africa. With the
ALSF, the ANRC also coordinated the Bank’s participation in

Annual Report 2014

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

the 2015 Mining ‘Indaba’, Africa’s largest mining investment
conference. As the regional development financial institution
in natural-resource management, the Bank’s participation in
the annual event is aimed at increasing its visibility to mining
investors, governments and civil society organizations.

Supporting Economic and Governance Reforms. The Bank's
work in governance is guided by the Governance Strategic
Framework and Action Plan (GAP Il) 2014-2018, approved
by the Bank’s Boards in 2013. The Bank’s work towards
implementation of the GAP Il is organized around three main
pillars: (i) public-sector and economic management (PSEM);
(ii) sector governance; and (iii) investment and business climate.
There are also three cross-cutting issues—anti-corruption,
gender and regional integration—which intersect and support
the three GAP II pillars. In 2014, a total of 18 operations of UA
885 million were approved in support of good governance
initiatives across 16 countries. Some of the key projects and
programs approved in 2014 under Governance are highlighted
under the three GAP II pillars below.

Public Sector and Economic Management (PSEM) Interventions.
The Bank's interventions in the area of PSEM have centered
on strengthening governments’ capacity for transparent and
accountable use of public resources and citizens’ ability to
hold governments to account. Examples of such interventions
in 2014 included: (i) a UA 5 million institutional support project
in Togo to modernize the country’s Revenue Authority and
increase transparency in the extractive industries; (ii) a UA
12 million program-based operation (PBO) in Guinea for
modernizing taxation and enhancing transparency and revenue
collection from extractive industries; and (iii) a UA 2.3 million
institutional support project in Sierra Leone co-financed
with the World Bank, the United Kingdom’s Department for
International Development, and the European Union, aimed
at strengthening fiscal control, accountability, and oversight
through various instruments, including support to parliament
and civil society organizations.

The Bank continues to lay special emphasis on states under
fragile situations, which in 2014 constituted half of the countries
that benefited from its new governance interventions. The Bank
also demonstrated flexibility and responsiveness in situations
of crisis and emergency. For example, in early 2014, the
Bank responded to the socio-political crisis in Central African
Republic with an urgent UA 15 million PBO to support policy
measures focused the restoration of public service delivery and
improving conditions for economic recovery. Further, the Bank
responded to the protracted political crisis in Madagascar by
providing a UA 25 million PBO for policy measures targeted
at strengthening domestic resource mobilization and budget
management.

49Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

Sector Governance. |n 2014, the Bank continued to scale up
interventions aimed at improving sector governance, focusing
specifically on strengthening transparency, accountability and
tackling procurement-related corruption at the sector level,
while leveraging policies, legal frameworks, institutions, and
incentives to deliver high quality services. Special emphasis
was given to the natural resources and infrastructure sectors,
as well as critical social services.

Investment and Business Climate. Interventions aimed at
promoting private investment and sound business climates
involved strengthening legal and institutional frameworks to
foster private-sector development. Examples include: UA 40
million support to Burkina Faso to promote SME and MSME
growth by supporting business incubators, credit guarantee
schemes and export promotion agencies, and a UA 13 million
PBO to Cabo Verde to support the establishment of one-stop
shops for investors, as well as the creation of an incentive
scheme for micro- and small businesses, simplifying registration,
licensing, and taxation procedures, and amending laws to
better cater for small businesses. These interventions are
aimed at fostering financial inclusion by broadening access
to finance and financial services by MSMEs, and enabling
women-owned businesses to become beneficiaries.

Promoting Skills and Human Development. A milestone in
the Bank’s skills and human development in Africa was the
approval of the first Human Capital Strategy, 2014-2018. This
defines priorities for the Bank’s work on human development
in the continent and opens up new initiatives in this field.

 

50

This strategy was instrumental in informing the Bank’s swift
and effective response to the Ebola epidemic.

In 2014, the Bank Group approved UA 366.9 million in loans
and grants for 47 operations to support skills and human
development on the projects and programs in various countries.
This included 22 national projects and programs for the core
operations in skills and technology, employment, training, and
technical vocational education for a total of UA 225.2 million
(61.4 percent of total loans and grants). The other 25 operations,
for a total of UA 141.7 million (88.6 percent), comprised 20
multinational and five national operations specifically focused
on Ebola epidemic relief and emergency assistance.

The largest, amongst the core sector national operations
approved in 2014, the largest was the UA 49.3 million Skills,
Employability and Entrepreneurship Program (SEEP Il) in
Rwanda. The program's goal is to support policy reform efforts
that promote inclusive growth and poverty reduction. The
expected outcomes are (i) enhanced employable skills and
attitudes for the labor market; and (li) increased entrepreneurship
and business development sustained over time.

Other major approvals included the Technical Vocational
Education, Training, and Teacher Education Project in Tanzania
(UA 34.0 million), and the Social Cohesion and Enhancement
Support Program in Céte d’lvoire (UA 30.0 million).

The 25 multinational operations for alleviating the effects of the
Ebola epidemic were mostly grant funding to strengthen West
Africa’s public health systems, provide
budget support to fight back the epidemic,
and crisis response technical assistance in
the three most affected countries Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Bank Support and Management of
the Ebola Crisis. The outbreak of the
Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in
West Africa was first reported in Guinea,
West Africa, in March 2014. The outbreak
quickly became the deadliest pandemic
of its kind since the first case of Ebola
was reported in the DRC in 1976, then
known as Zaire. According to World
Health Organization (WHO) estimates,
reported cases in Africa were estimated
at 20,200, including 7,904 deaths by
the end of 2014. Most of these deaths
occurred in the Bank’s three mostaffected RMCs, namely Liberia (3,423),
Sierra Leone (2,748), and Guinea (1,708).
Two others—Nigeria and Mali—recorded

Annual Report 2014eight and six deaths, respectively. These two countries have
since been declared Ebola-free. Senegal reported one case
and no death. Outside Africa, six cases were recorded in the
USA, UK, and Spain, with one reported death in the USA.

Since the outbreak, the Bank has approved UA 147.9 million
for 25 operations to fight the epidemic, covering the three
most-affected countries and also Céte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal,
Mali and the DRC. The support has included multinational
operations comprising (i) UA 100.2 million for 10 operations
under the Ebola Sector Budget Support Fight Back Program
(EFBP); (ii) UA 37.4 million for four operations under the
Strengthening West Africa’s Public Health Systems Response
to the Ebola Crisis (SWAPHS) program; (iii) UA 5 million for five
Crisis Response—Technical Assistance Support operations; and
(iv) one multinational and five national emergency assistance
operations to fight the EVD in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia,
Nigeria, and DRC. The funds were channeled through the
WHO and the respective country governments. There were
also four additional operations under preparation. These were
(i) the establishment of an Africa Center for Disease Control;
(ii) a preventive regional program for Central Africa; (iii) the Ebola
Social Investment Project; and (iv) support for the establishment
of medical laboratories in the ECOWAS countries.

The crisis response technical assistance component was
implemented in association with the African Union and
ECOWAS and involved: (i) deploying health workers from
across Africa to Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia; (ii) a
motivational/incentivized scheme designed to supplement the
salaries of over 2,000 health workers in the three countries;
(iii) training local health extension and community workers;
and (iv) deepening cooperation with the private sector—both
national and international—in the fight against Ebola.

The Bank’s support to the fight against Ebola has been
commended for significantly contributing towards addressing
the impact of the epidemic in the affected countries. In
particular, in Mali, the Head of the UN Mission for Emergency
Action against Ebola hailed the Bank’s support as exceptional
in terms of speed and level of resources mobilized to stop
the spread of the epidemic. The Bank’s support covered
critical activities such as capacity building, recruitment and
deployment of 20 field epidemiologists. It also strengthened
logistics (including the purchase of vehicles) and functioning
of the Emergency Operations Center in Mali.

The national and international responses to the Ebola
epidemic have resulted in a number of improvements in public
health within the three most-affected West African countries
and some neighboring countries in the sub-region. These
improvements are in the form of safe burial practices, early
case detections, an increased number of health workers

Annual Report 2014

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

and treatment facilities, public awareness campaigns, and
better contact tracing, among others. The policy and behavior
responses have contributed to a lower risk of the disease
spreading across borders.

Despite improvements in the fight against Ebola, there is
ongoing work in the Bank on the socio-economic impact of
the Ebola epidemic. A Bank study recently reported that the
epidemic had destabilized livelinoods and economic activities.
Apart from the death toll, collective fear of the epidemic literally
cut off the most affected countries from the rest of the world
and significantly weakened the resilience of their economies.
The AfDB Statistics Department thus downgraded economic
growth forcasts for 2014 from 4.5 percent to 0.6 percent
for Guinea, 6.8 percent to 1.8 percent for Liberia, and 11.3
percent to 6.0 percent for Sierra Leone. These estimates were
based on the assumption that Ebola in the region would be
fully contained only in 2015.

The Bank’s study further noted that the epidemic would have
long-term implications far beyond the immediate short-term
social and economic effects. In particular, the very poor in
society were likely to have borne the brunt of the epidemic.
Projections were that in Liberia, for instance, the Ebola
outbreak was likely to have left at least a quarter of a million
more people in poverty by 2018 than would have been the
case had incomes continued to grow at pre-Ebola levels. In
Guinea and Sierra Leone, the figure was close to 300,000 and
over half-a million, respectively. The Bank’s study estimated
that as a result of the Ebola epidemic, nearly five out of 10
Sierra Leoneans would live under extreme poverty by 2017,
compared to four out of 10 if the epidemic had not occurred.
In Liberia, the figure was eight out of 10 and seven out of 10
if the epidemic had not occurred.

These projections underscore the importance of (i) Ebola and
broader pandemic preparedness in African countries; and (ii)
reaching the goal of zero new cases in the three most-affected
countries, as soon as possible.

At a historic meeting on November 8, 2014, in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, the Bank, together with the African Union, the
Economic Commission for Africa, and leading businesses
in Africa, committed to joining forces to create and support
a funding mechanism to deal with the Ebola outbreak and
its consequences. The Ebola response fund will be used to
support an African medical corps—including doctors, nurses,
and laboratory technicians—to care for those infected with
Ebola, and strengthen the capacities of local health services
and staff at Ebola treatment centers in the three most-affected
countries. The resources mobilized will, partly, be invested in
a longer-term program to build Africa’s capacity to deal with
the likelihood of similar epidemics in the future.

5lChapter 4 Bank Group Operations

TYS Areas of Special Emphasis

Besides the five operational priorities as
addressed above, the TYS also focuses
on support to agriculture and food
security, gender mainstreaming, and
addressing fragility in states under fragile
situations. Operational activities in these
areas during 2014 are reviewed below.

Agriculture. Approvals for operations
in agriculture and rural development
amounted to UA 545.4 million. This
includes UA 488.3 million in loans and
grants (89.5 percent) and UA 57.0 million
from Special Funds (10.5 percent). There
were 35 loan and grant operations, 30
of which were public-sector operations
totaling UA 376.5 million (77.1 percent)
while the rest were private-sector
operations of UA 111.8 million (22.9
percent).

Eighteen of the 35 operations were multinational (UA 230.8
million, 47.3 percent) while 17 were national projects (UA 257.5
million, 52.7 percent). Multinational operations were mainly
for emergency relief, food security and nutrition projects and
programs, and included approvals for (i) the Somalia/Sudan/
Eritrea/Ethiopia Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihood
Program; and (ii) the CILSS Program to Build Resilience to
Food and Nutrition Insecurity in the Sahel, covering Burkina
Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal
(Box 4.3).

At UA 57.5 million, the sector’s largest single operation was
Phase II of Uganda’s Markets and Agricultural Improvement
Program (MATIP-2). This program, an extension of MATIP-1,
is designed to revamp markets in 21 municipalities and town
councils in Uganda. Impacts expected from the program include
improved marketing conditions, value addition/processing and
trading capacity, and increased employment and incomes.
The primary beneficiaries include 16,950 registered vendors.
Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at 900,000 households
within the catchment areas of the markets.

Gender. Approval of the Gender Strategy. The Gender Strategy,
Investing in Gender Equality for Africa’s Transformation,
2014-2018, was approved in January 2014. The Strategy
emphasizes the reduction of gender inequalities by strengthening
women’s legal and property rights, promoting their economic
empowerment, and enhancing knowledge management
and capacity building on gender equality in the Bank’s
operations. Several Bank Group operations approved in 2014
have built-in components that address the issue of gender

52

 

equality, promoting women’s empowerment and providing
opportunities to enhance the well-being of women and girls.
Some examples include:

e The Malawi Sustainable Rural Water and Sanitation
Infrastructure for Improved Health and Livelihoods Project,
approved in April 2014, in which the improvement in
access to water will free up the time spent by women and
girls fetching water for more productive activities such as
agriculture; and

e The Mozambique Economic Governance and Inclusive
Growth Program, approved in September 2014, which will
create new jobs through support for micro-, small-, and
medium-size enterprises (MSMEs), with an emphasis on
the inclusion of women and youth.

Strengthening Gender Mainstreaming. A number of initiatives
were put in place in 2014 to operationalize gender mainstreaming
in the Bank. These include a roster of gender experts and
a coordination committee to review the Bank’s knowledge
development functions for gender equality. As part of its
advocacy work, the Office of the Special Envoy on Gender
(SEOG) and the Bank President in March 2014 led Bank staff
and elected officers in the commemoration of International
Women’s Day. The Office of the SEOG also mobilized Bank
staff to mark the International Day for the Elimination of
Violence Against Women. There is now improved gender
mainstreaming in the Bank's corporate policies and practices.

Regional and Global Advocacy, and Bank Positioning. With

support from the South Korean and Norwegian governments,
the Bank organized the third African Women’s Economic Summit

Annual Report 2014(AWES) in Zambia. The summit focused on promoting and
strengthening women’s access to finance, in particular, and
on strengthening the ability of women-owned businesses to
grow from micro- to small, small to medium, and medium to
large enterprises. Following the summit, several institutions
made pledges to increase women’s access to finance.

Other gender initiatives, led by the Bank’s President, included
joining hands with African Heads of State to find solutions
‘o the Ebola crisis. The Ebola Social Investment Fund is a
product of this initiative. The Fund seeks to address the social
and economic impacts of Ebola, more generally, and those
hat affect women, specifically.

Progress was also made during the year in the design of
he African Gender Equality Index, to be launched in 2015.
This index will not only support the measurement of gender
inequalities in development outcomes, such as education
and employment, but will enable policy-makers and others
‘© make appropriate adjustments.

 

States Under Fragile Situations. The Fragile States Unit
was upgraded to a fully-fledged department—the Transition
Support Department (ORTS)—at the end of 2013. The change
was meant to ensure that the Bank's interventions in fragile

 

Annual Report 2014

Bank Group Operations Chapter 4

situations obtain the highest possible levels of attention.
The Bank’s lending and non-lending engagements in fragile
situations thus emphasize (i) strengthening state capacity
and establishing effective institutions; and (ii) promoting
resilient societies through inclusive and equitable access
to employment, basic services and shared benefits from
natural-resource endowments.

The ORTS is charged with responsibility for coordinating the
implementation of the Bank’s Strategy for Addressing Fragility
and Building Resilience in Africa (2014-2019) and managing
the Transition Support Facility (TSF)—formerly the Fragile
States Facility. The 2013 strategy marks a new phase of Bank
support in addressing fragility.

In 2014, the Bank approved UA 365.8 million for operations
in countries under fragile situations. Of this amount, UA 123.9
million was to be drawn from Pillar | (supplemental top-up
resources to ADF performance-based allocations), and Pillar
Ill (critical capacity-building interventions) of the Transition
Support Facility. Most of the resources approved under the
TSF were channeled towards capacity building, social services,
and infrastructure development. In addition, UA 27.8 million of
TSF resources helped bridge budget gaps in countries facing
emergencies arising from the Ebola epidemic.

53Chapter 4 Bank Group Operations

Three multinational (regional) operations of the Bank Group
(presented in Box 4.3 above) were approved in 2014 to
address socio-economic challenges and enhance regional
integration objectives, with the aim of assisting countries to
move out of states of fragility. These operations are:

¢ The Program to Build Resilience in the Sahel (P2RS). The
goal of the program is to address fragility and build the
resilience of vulnerable populations against food and nutrition
insecurity and other socio-economic challenges in the Sahel;

The Drought Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Program
(DRSLP) in the Horn of Africa. Among other benefits, this
program is to address state fragility and strengthen the
capacities of beneficiary countries to enhance resilience
to drought, and

The Program to Rehabilitate and Strengthen Resilience of
the Lake Chad Basin Ecosystems (PRESIBALT). This is
to directly benefit 15.3 million people living in the Lake’s
impact area.

An ambitious transition support program for non-operational
activities was developed in 2014 as part of the Bank’s
deliverables under the mandate of ORTS. Key deliverables
included the new strategy document approved in June
2014 as well as accompanying operational guidelines. In
addition, the department produced two knowledge products
in 2014: “Scaling up AfDB’s Development Impact in States
under Fragile Situations” and “Peace and State-building in
Post-2015 Context”.

4.3 Bank Group Operations by
Sub-Region

The year under review was characterized by significant variations
in Bank Group operations by sub-region. For example, in 2014,
the Bank had public-sector commitments in 17 countries as
opposed to six countries in 2013. In view of the Ebola epidemic
in 2014, Bank Group operations increased in West Africa
to accommodate the socio-economic impact of the crisis.
Bank Group operations in both East and Central Africa also
increased, in view of improved socio-economic conditions.

Bank Group Approvals by Sub-region. A summary distribution
of operations by sub-region is shown in Figure 4.9 while Table
4.2 provides a more detailed overview. West Africa received
the largest share of operational approvals, representing 27.7
percent of the total, while approvals for Southern Africa stood at
25.7 percent, the share for East Africa was 13.8 percent, and
that for Central Africa 8.2 percent. At 6.8 percent, North Africa
had the lowest share of total approvals. For all sub-regional
operations, the single largest approval was the UA 645.3
million to support the power sector reform program in Angola.
This amount bolstered the share of approvals for Southern
Africa, significantly. The share of approvals to sub-regional
operations was somewhat low in view of the relatively large
share (17.8 percent) for multinational operations.

Central Africa. Among the sub-region’s eight countries,
Gabon and Equatorial Guinea are ADB-eligible countries,
Cameroon is a blend, eligible for both ADB and ADF
resources, and Congo will become ADB-eligible by 2016.
The other four countries—the Central African Republic, Chad,
DRC, and Sao Tomé and Principe are ADF-eligible (Table
4.2), although they can also borrow from the ADB window,
largely to finance private-sector operations and enclave
projects (projects specially designed to avoid indebtedness).
Congo and the four ADF-eligible countries are also states
under fragile situations, and are partly funded from the
TSF. For the region as a whole, loan and grant approvals
amounted to UA 369.2 million. This represented an increase
of more than 50 percent of the amount approved in 2013,
reflecting an improvement in the region’s socio-economic
conditions that served as a catalyst for enhanced funding for
infrastructure operations. Infrastructure approvals accounted
for 77.3 percent of all approvals for the sub-region. These
comprised transport operations, with Cameroon's Transport
Sector Support Program (Phase |) taking up the largest
amount of UA 143.0 million while UA 55.6 million was for
the financing of the Batshamba-Tshikapa Road Improvement
Project in the DRC.

East Africa. Of the 13 countries in the sub-region, only the
Seychelles is eligible for borrowing from the ADB’s sovereign

Box 4.6 Nairobi-Thika Highway Improvement Project
— 2014 Presidential Award Winner

 

he Nairobi-Thika Highway comprises a 45 km eight-lane highway and nine
related interchanges between Nairobi’s central business district and the
own of Thika. The road’s improvement has benefited 100,000 residents in
Kasarani, Kiambu and Thika by reducing their commuting time from three
ours to just 30 minutes. It has decongested traffic, improved connectivity,
and opened up opportunities for people and businesses. More than 3,600
unskilled and semi-skilled workers and 600 technicians and engineers
were employed during its construction, with strong multiplier effects along
he road corridor. Sustainability is being addressed through a credible road
und. An important gender dimension reveals that a large proportion of the
roject’s beneficiaries are women who sell food items sourced from Thika
and beyond. In addition, most operators in the roadside markets, including
he Masai Market at Nairobi’s Globe Cinema, are women. Half of the students
attending the universities served by the new highway are female.

 

otal financing for the project amounted to USD 438 million. The Bank
Group contributed the largest share of the USD 186 million invested in the
project, including a USD 4.8 million grant. The project also leveraged USD
168 million additional financing from the Government of China and a USD
84 million counterpart fund contribution from the Government of Kenya.

 

 

Annual Report 2014

window. Six countries in the sub-region—Burundi, Comoros,
Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan—are classified as
countries under fragile situations and therefore receive support
from the TSF. By the end of 2014, financing approvals for East
Africa amounted to UA 623.1 million, a 4.3-percent increase
over 2013 (Table 4.2). Of the total approvals for the sub-region,
half were for infrastructure development. Agriculture and rural
development accounted for a fifth of total approvals for the
year while finance, comprising a private-sector line of credit
to Equity Bank in Kenya of UA 100.1 million, accounted for
16.1 percent. The share for the social sector was 13.6 percent.
The Nairobi-Thika Highway improvement project won first
prize in the 2014 AfDB Presidential Awards for its innovation
and excellence (Box 4.6).

North Africa. Of the six countries in North Africa, five are
ADB-eligible and only one country (Mauritania) is eligible for ADF
funding. Libya does not borrow from the Bank while Algeria
has not borrowed from the Bank or other multilateral/bilateral
donors since 2006. In 2014, the Bank’s main operational
activities for the sub-region focused on two core priority
areas: supporting governance, and infrastructure operations.
In support of these operations, the Bank approved 17 new
operations worth UA 304.2 million, a third higher than approvals
in 2013. Three of these operations were from the private-sector

5DChapter 4 Bank Group Operations

window (40.5 percent) while the other 14 were public-sector
operations, accounting for 59.5 percent of the total.

The Bank’s strategies in the region were sustained by a
high-level policy dialogue around the findings of Economic
and Sector Works (ESWs), particularly the Country Strategy
Paper and Country Portfolio Performance Rating (CSP and
CPPR) joint review for Morocco and the (Interim-Country
Strategy Paper (i-CSP)) for 2014-2015 in Egypt and Tunisia.
In Libya, the Bank was innovative, adapting its assistance to
the country’s particular needs. Notably, the Bank focused on
strengthening institutional capacity and leadership capabilities
and specialized secondment schemes that support the
Libya-Africa Partnership.

Given the region’s tumultuous three years since the Arab
Spring, Bank lending to eligible countries has been constrained.
For instance, Egypt’s elevated risk status in 2014 did not
support the Bank’s lending objectives. Instead, the Bank’s
support took the form of grants and resources from the
Clean Technology Fund, one of the Bank’s Special Funds,
to promote development of renewable energy resources.
Thus, Morocco remains the country with the largest share of
Bank operations, with three large projects approved in 2014:
(i) Financial Sector Development Project—Phase Ill (UA 84.9
million), (i) Ouarzazate Solar Complex Project —Phase II (UA
166.4 million), and (iii) Attijariwafa Bank Line of Credit (UA 62.4
million). The Ain Beni Mathar Thermosolar Plant project, which
inspired development of Ouarzazate Solar Project, was among
three projects that received the 2014 Presidential Award for
innovation and excellence in Bank operations (Box 4.7).

Box 4.7 Morocco: Ain Beni Mathar Thermosolar Plant

 

he Ain Beni Mathar Thermosolar Plant project was one of three recipients
of the Bank’s 2014 Presidential Awards, recognized for innovation and
excellence in Bank operations. Initiated in 2005, this project demonstrates
ow the Bank supports Middle-Income Countries (MICs) in promoting
inclusive and green growth. With strong commitment from Morocco’s
Government, the Bank financed 62 percent of the plant, which cost a
otal of UA 400.7 million. This gas and solar thermal power plant has
increased Morocco’s power capacity by 470 MW and reduced CO,
emissions by 33,500 tons. Local road and bridge construction around the
roject site has benefited 1,128 rural households. In terms of inclusive
growth, the project has facilitated access to social services, increased
school attendance and promoted local commerce. The project has also
rovided valuable lessons on quality at entry and procurement. These
lessons are currently being integrated into Morocco’s Ouarzazate Solar
Power Complex project, approved in 2014.

Southern Africa. Six of the 12 countries in this sub-region
are ADB-eligible countries; five are ADF-eligible countries,
and one (Zambia) is a blend eligible for both ADB and ADF
resources (Table 4.2). All 12 RMCs are members of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC). Mozambique was
among the fastest growing economies in Africa, recording
over 7 percent real GDP growth in 2014. Approvals for the
sub-region for 2014 stood at UA 1,157.0 million, a significant
increase of 88.1 percent over the UA 615.2 million approved in
2013. At 88.8 percent, the share of infrastructure dominated
the Bank’s operations in this sub-region, with 67.6 percent
of the approvals for energy, 17.3 percent for transport and
3.9 percent for water and sanitation infrastructure. About
55.5 percent of 2014 approvals for the sub-region went to
the largest project, the UA 645.3 million power sector reform
support program in Angola which also contributed to the 89.1
percent increase in total approvals in 2014. The project’s
beneficiaries will include public-sector institutions, Angola’s
population in general, and the private sector, all of whom will
benefit from better access to reliable and affordable electricity
as well as the transparent and efficient management of public
finance and procurement practices.

West Africa. Among 15 countries in this sub-region, seven
(Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Sierra
Leone and Togo) are considered states under fragile situations,
with access to the Bank's Transition Support Facility (TSF).
All the countries, except two, are ADF-eligible RMCs while
two—Cabo Verde and Nigeria—are transitioning to becoming
ADB-eligible countries in three to five years, respectively. At
the end of December 2014, approvals for the region stood
at UA 1,244.5 million, a 25.6 percent increase over 2013
approvals. This excludes over UA 147 million in Ebola-related
multinational approvals for Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone
and for general strengthening public health systems in West
Africa. Of the UA 1,244.5 million national project approvals,
infrastructure took the lead with 43.9 percent, followed closely
by finance (41.3 percent) for lines of credit to MSMEs and
trade finance, with smaller shares allocated to multi-sector
(6.5 percent), agriculture (4.9 percent), and the social sector
(3.4 percent) for skills and technology development.

The two largest approvals for this sub-region, highlighted earlier,
were: (i) the private-sector-financed Dangote Oil Refinery and
Fertilizer Projects in Nigeria for UA 194.7 million, and (ii) the
publicly funded multinational Road Development and Transport
Facilitation Program for UA 140.9 million, for the benefit of
Céte d’lvoire, Guinea and Liberia.

Leveraging Resources and Partnerships in 2014

The resource envelope for the financing of Bank Group
operations is finite. Accordingly, the Bank has been exploring
opportunities to leverage financial and technical assistance

resources through co-financing, mainly with bilateral and
multilateral development partners. The Bank Group also
mobilizes additional resources through Special Funds and
technical cooperation trust funds. These resources are
channeled mainly towards financing pre-investment feasibility
studies, enhanced project cycle work, and capacity building.

In 2014, the Bank expanded its engagement with the Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust Fund was
established for collaboration on issues related to water and
sanitation, agriculture, and health, among others.

The establishment of the Gates Foundation Trust Fund adds
to a sizeable number of trust funds that the Bank currently
managed by the Bank, held in various currencies, but totaling
UA 796.4 million. At the end of 2014, thematic trust funds
representing funds linked to themes aligned with the TYS
operational priorities, accounted for 85 percent of total trust
fund resources, with bilateral trust funds accounting for the
rest. During the year in review, several resource mobilization
activities were initiated by the Bank. These included the
Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF) which was established
with China (USD 2 billion) for the co-financing public and
private-sector projects on regional integration, private-sector
operations and infrastructure development.

In 2014, approvals from bilateral trust funds amounted to
UA 15.9 million. These approvals were fully reflective of the
TYS (Figure 4.10), focusing mainly on skills development and
knowledge products, governance, and infrastructure. Other

smaller approvals were for social, agricultural and genderrelated operations.

Approvals for thematic trust funds stood at UA 32.6 million,
with support for infrastructure taking up the largest share. This
was followed closely by approvals for governance reforms,
agriculture, and private-sector development. Funds were
also allocated for Knowledge products, social sector and
climate-change operations (Figure 4.11).

The Bank Group and the HIPC Process. Africa’s debt burden
has been significantly reduced, as a result of the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). At the end of 2014, 29
of 33 countries eligible under the HIPC Initiative had reached
completion point and qualified for irrevocable debt relief and
MDRI debt cancellation. However, Chad is still in the interim
period of the HIPC Initiative, between decision and completion
points, and has made some progress in recent years. It is on
target to attain the HIPC completion point in 2015. Although
the Bank continues to participate in debt-relief programs,
there was minimal activity on this front in 2014.

Three pre-decision point countries—Eritrea, Somalia, and
Sudan—are yet to start the process of qualifying for debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative. Zimbabwe (not yet HIPC-eligible)
remains in debt distress, but has made some progress towards
meeting the technical requirements for arrears clearance under
the Bank’s Transition Support Facility. This should enable the
country to achieve full re-engagement with the Bank and the
broader international community in 2015.

57Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

Africa has seen considerable change over the past few decades. For its part, the Bank has
adapted to these changes and undertaken a number of internal reforms to ensure that it remains
agile and responsive to the needs of its clients on the continent. This chapter discusses the
institutional reforms and other corporate decisions implemented by the Bank during 2014, a
year that marked the beginning of its return to Abidjan. The chapter reports, in particular, on
the Bank’s development effectiveness and quality assurance, and outlines the activities of its
independent operations evaluation function. Further, it outlines how the previous decisions of the
Board, notably with respect to the adjustments to the institutional structure, were implemented.
It also discusses the progress made towards implementation of the commitments made as part of
the ADF-13 Replenishment. In addition, it looks at the Bank’s deployment of human resources
during 2014. The latter sections of the chapter discuss the activities of the institutions providing
intermediate recourse mechanisms, including the units for Audit, Integrity, Compliance, and
the Administrative Tribunal.

5.1 Institutional Reforms and
Related Adjustments
The Bank returned to its statutory Headquarters in Abidjan in

2014, after over 11 years of operating from the Temporary
Relocation Agency in Tunis. The implementation of this

undertaking was bound to impact on the Bank's other activities.

However, with planning and foresight, the Bank managed to
continue with a broad range of initiatives, uninterrupted, and
without compromising the overall objective of relocation to
Abidjan or its ability to respond to the growing and complex
needs of its clients. This section provides an update on the
performance of key structures established during the Bank’s
organizational restructuring in 2013. It reaches the conclusion
that the Bank has been both resilient and innovative, using
its enhanced brand value to attract resources and new ideas
for the continent’s development.

Return to Abidjan

The Bank’s return to Abidjan in 2014 was an important test
of the strength and resilience of the Institution in the face of
major challenges posed by this relocation. The shift was fraught
with major risks which, if ill-managed, would have led to major
disruptions in the Bank's operations. There was, therefore, the
need to ensure that despite any unforeseen challenges, the
Bank would continue to meet all its obligations and deliver its
2014 operations program. The Bank’s greatest challenge during
the year, however, was coping with the Ebola epidemic that
struck a number of countries in West Africa. Concerned that

60

the epidemic could spread to Céte d'Ivoire, to where it had
just relocated, the Bank’s Management took robust measures
to protect staff and their families from infection, and and thus
mitigated the risks of disruption of the Bank's business.

Aligning the Budget to the Ten-Year Strategy. One of the
Bank’s key strategic objectives in 2014 continued to be the
realignment of resource allocation to the new priorities in its TYS.
To this effect, the Bank completed the design of a new cost
accounting system to facilitate its determination of the full cost
of providing products and services to clients. The system is also
designed to provide cost information that should strengthen
the link between resource allocation and results. This should
also strengthen the Bank’s budgeting system. Bank staff now
record, on a regular basis, the amount of time they spend on
activities associated with the Bank’s key performance indicators
(KPIs). These KPIs are tracked through quarterly, mid-year and
retrospective reviews of budget and work program performance.

To ensure the sustainability of the Bank’s financial health, the Bank,
also implemented a variety of cost rationalization measures in
2014. Anumber of business development initiatives were also
undertaken. In keeping with its budget reforms of 2008, the
Bank was able to respond to urgent and unplanned demands
for its resources rather timeously. This was most evident in
the Bank's response to the 2014 Ebola crisis..

Decentralization. The Bank’s decentralization program
underwent a mid-term review (MTR) in 2014. It assessed the

Annual Report 2014Bank's 15-point Decentralization Roadmap Action Plan, adopted
in 2011, and noted the progress made so far. Management
agreed to the MTR’s main recommendations. The Bank,
during the year, also undertook a review of fiduciary risks and
safeguards in its Field Offices. This was aimed at strengthening
the decentralization effort and improving operational risk
management. The outcomes of both the MTR and the
fiduciary risks and safeguards review will inform the updates
to the Decentralization Roadmap Action Plan to be delivered
in mid-2015, for consideration by the Board of Directors.

The number of Regional Member Countries in which the Bank
has a field presence reached 38 in 2014, with the creation of
a customized presence in Congo. Customized offices have a
limited staff whose role is to strengthen policy dialogue and
improve aid coordination with Regional Member Countries.
In addition to the two Regional Resource Centers, the Bank
currently has 29 Field Offices, and seven customized offices
(Benin, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Mauritius, Congo,

a Ak om

and Sao Tomé and Principe). At the end of 2014, 49.6
percent of the Bank’s operations staff was based in the field.
This is a notable achievement, given the target of 40 percent
for 2014. In 2014, field-based staff managed 51 percent of
Bank operations, above the target of 50 percent. Similarly,
field-based staff supervised 52.2 percent of projects, above
the target of 45 percent for the year.

Return to the Headquarters. The return of the Bank to its
Headquarters in Abidjan was a prime preoccupation in 2014.
Although carefully planned, the shift raised some apprehension
among staff and their families, especially with regard to issues of
housing, schooling, and health services in Abidjan. The shift has,
however, by all accounts, been much smoother than anticipated,
due in large measure to cooperation of the Tunisian and Ivorian
Governments, and commendable planning by staff, management
and the Board. By September 2014, the Board was able to
resume business at the Bank Headquarters in Abidjan, Céte
d'lvoire, while the numbers of staff arriving at Headquarters

élChapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

continued to rise each month. By March 2014, the Bank had
442 staff in Abidjan. In the following nine months a total of 982
staff and Board members arrived in Abidjan. During the first
half of 2015, a further 83 members of staff were expected to
join others at Headquarters. The full complement of arrivals
by June 2015 is expected to be 1,507. The renovation of the
Bank’s Headquarters building is expected to be complete
during 2015. Meanwhile, the Ivorian Government has put a
major office block, the /mmeuble du Centre de Commerce
International d’Abidjan (CCIA), at the disposal of the Bank. The
building has been fully refurbished and is of appropriate quality.

The African Development Bank:

50 Years in the Service of Africa

Origins. The African Development Bank was created on
August 4, 1963 in Khartoum, Sudan, when 23 newly Independent
African states signed the Agreement establishing the Institution.
At the time, only independent African countries were eligible
for shareholding and were the sole providers of the Bank’s
capital. The Bank was created in the belief by a number of
African leaders that the continent needed its own development
finance institution. The founders wished to create an African
Bank for Africans and ensure that the poorest countries on
the continent were able to finance infrastructure, education,
health and other vital projects of long-term maturities and
non-financial returns.

From Humble Beginnings. The inaugural meeting of the
Board of Governors of the Bank was held in Lagos, Nigeria, in
November 1964. Fifty years ago, the Bank began operations
in rented offices in Abidjan, its Headquarters. There were
initially 10 members of staff while the Bank had a meagre
initial authorized capital of UA 250 million. By 1966, the
Bank’s operations had taken off in earnest and were largely
focused on transport.

Concessional resources. The Agreement Establishing the
African Development Fund (ADF) was signed on November 29,
1972 by the African Development Bank and 13 Non-Regional
countries (State Participants). This establishment of the ADF
introduced a soft window within the AfDB from which the
low-income members of the Bank could borrow funds at
concessional interest rates with a high grant element. The ADF
began operations in 1974. In 1976, a second soft window,
the Nigeria Trust Fund, was established by an agreement
between the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank Group for an initial period of 30 years, with a
provision for extension, by mutual agreement. The Agreement
was signed on April 25, 1976.

 

Reforms. The Bank’s 1994 Annual Meetings in Nairobi, Kenya,
were marked by the release of the Knox Report on the Bank’s
future and reorganization of its structure. The Knox Report

62

revealed an institution crippled by management problems, a
lack of accountability, and boardroom dysfunction. The release
of the report kindled the onset of major reforms in the Bank
when a new President took office.

Relocation and Return to Headquarters. Following political
and civil strife in Céte d’lvoire the Bank was forced to relocate
to Tunis, Tunisia, in February 2008, where it was based for 11
years. It returned to its Abidjan Headquarters in 2014.

Highlights from 50 Years of Operations. |n the five decades
of its existence, the Bank has attained a number of milestones
and any choice of the most important would be rather subjective.
However, in terms of impact on its operations, four key landmarks,
presented in chronological order, are worth mentioning:

e The vision of the Founders for a soft window of the AfDB to
mobilize and lend concessional resources was realized when
the African Development Fund (ADF) was created in 1972.
This soft window for low-income members of the Bank lends
at concessional interest rates, with a high grant element. The
ADF has been replenished several times since its creation.
Total investment in the fund was UA 22.8 billion, prior to the
commencement of the 13th Replenishment in January 2014,
and with additional UA 5.35 billion agreed by ADF Deputies
covering the 3-year ADF-13 operational period, 2014-2016.
The ADF has provided resources to over 40 countries, the
latest being South Sudan. It has contributed to economic
development and poverty reduction in Africa while its support
to regionally significant infrastructure projects has boosted
regional integration on the continent. This contribution has
come from its financing and co-financing of projects in
transport and energy infrastructure, water and sanitation,
information and communication technology (ICT), health,
and education facilities.
Second, the Bank provided innovative and unwavering
support to its Regional Member Countries in the wake of the
unprecedented global financial meltdown of 2008-2009. The
AfDB was quick to deploy strong countercyclical measures
to address the crisis and also partner with leading global
agencies to confront the threats to Africa’s trade finance.
Measures taken by the Bank included the establishment of
quick disbursing budgetary support and short-term trade
and liquidity facilities to help African countries meet their
demand for financing, as their traditional sources had dried
up. A result was that total Bank Group lending peaked,
the highest ever, at UA 8.06 billion in 2009, at the height
of the global financial crisis. Further, the Bank created the
Committee of 10 (C-10), comprising five finance ministers
and five central bank governors, to undertake periodic
assessments of the global situation and galvanize Africa’s
response to the crisis, and also make recommendations
to, among others, the G-20 Summit.

 

Annual Report 2014¢ Third, in response to the global financial crisis, it became
clear that the Bank needed more capital to meet the needs
of its regional members. The Bank, therefore, argued
successfully for an early increase of its capital base. At its
Annual Meetings of May 2010, in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire,
the Bank’s Board of Governors approved the Sixth General
Capital Increase, which raised the Bank’s callable capital to
USD 100 billion, an increase of 200 percent. The increase
now allows the Bank Group to sustain a higher level of
lending including to the private sector.

Fourth, in the past decade, the Bank launched two key
strategies, in both cases after broad consultation within
and outside the Bank. The launch of the Medium-Term
Strategy (MTS) in December 2008, for the period 20082012, coincided with the onset of the global economic and
financial crisis and provided a critical compass for prioritizing
the Bank's operations. Notably, infrastructure became a key
feature of Bank Group operations, as did governance and
private-sector development. A number of salient features of
the MTS have been included in the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy
for 2013-2022. This Strategy has two pillars, inclusive growth
and transitioning Africa to green growth. It also has five
priority areas, namely infrastructure, technology and skills,
regional integration, the private sector, and governance and
accountability. Further, the TYS places a special emphasis
on gender, states under fragile situations, and agriculture
and food security.

Innovative Instruments for Bank Operations. |n recent years
the Bank has introduced a range of innovative instruments for
development financing both in response to demand from its
clients but also in line with internal requirements for more agile
and efficient operations. These changes demonstrate that the
Bank has learnt lessons from its long period of operations on
the continent and can respond with confidence to the needs
of its regional membership, within the structures of the market
in which it operates.

e In 2014, with guidance and support from the Board, the
Bank launched the Africa5S0 facility in Casablanca. Africa50
is as an autonomous entity whose role is to provide finance
for the continent’s infrastructure development, mainly from
private sources. Africa50 is expected to garner resources
from within Africa, including those from insurance and
pension funds, and the rest of the world. The emphasis
will be on “game-changing” infrastructure projects. It is
innovative in its emphasis on the need to support project
pipeline development together with lending.

The Bank's recent amendment of its credit policy, approved
in May 2014, is already having a positive impact on its client
base. Countries eligible for borrowing from the ADF, but
with moderate and low risk of debt distress, can now also
access the ADB window. A number of countries, notably

Annual Report 2014

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

Uganda and Rwanda, are already taking advantage of the
Bank’s new credit policy.

The Bank has established a new Private Sector Credit
Enhancement Facility (PSF) with seed money of approximately
UA 165 million from the ADF-13 Replenishment. The PSF
will scale up ADB private-sector financing in low-income
ADF countries and provide credit enhancement to the ADB
when lending to these countries. The facility will mitigate
the risks related to lending and enable its risk capital to be
“stretched” over more non-sovereign-guaranteed projects,
including those in states under fragile situations.

The Bank’s Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) covers private
lenders against the risk of a government or a state-owned
enterprise failing to meet its obligations toward a private
project. The Bank used the PRG in 2013 to support the
Lake Turkana Wind Power (transmission line) project in
Kenya and independent power producers in Nigeria to
help them generate an additional 1,380 megawatts of
power by 2016. A related Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG)
is designed to enable performing Low-income Countries
with low risk of debt distress, and state-owned enterprises
in ADF countries with low or moderate risk of debt distress,
to attract non-Bank sources of financing on the basis of a
risk guarantee provided by the ADF.

The milestones cited above and the innovative financing
instruments introduced over the last decade provide a favorable
impression of the Bank’s achievements. The Bank now faces
the challenge of accelerating the progress it has made so far
to reaffirm its status as the premier development financing
agency for the continent.

Update on the 2013 Fine-Tuning of the Organizational
Structure. In September 2013, the Bank undertook institutional
reforms to fine-tune the Bank’s organizational structure. The
reform was designed to enhance the Bank’s capacity to
implement its Ten-Year Strategy. Among the key changes
made were the following:

¢ Creation of the Business Development Office (COBD) to
launch and operationalize Africa50 and similar business
development initiatives that address Africa's infrastructure
deficit;

© Creation of a Bank Group Risk Management Function under
a Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO), reporting directly to the
President;

© Creation of the African Natural Resources Center (ANRC)
to enable the Bank to scale up work in natural resources
management;

¢ Establishment of a Financial Sector Development Department
(OFSD) to guide the initiation and growth of the Bank’s
business within a rapidly-changing African financial sector
landscape;

63Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

© Creation of a Delivery and Performance Management Office
(DPMO) to manage the “Executive Dashboard” and provide
early warning on areas of slippage, and

e Upgrading of the Fragile States Unit to a fully-fledged
department, renamed the Transition Support Department
(ORTS).

The Transition Support Department is operational and is
the Bank’s focal point on all issues related to Bank Group
operations in states under fragile situations. The department in
2014 prepared the project documents for the Bank’s provision
of the much needed support, totaling UA 365.4 million, to
states under fragile situations through the Transition Support
Facility (TSF), as discussed above in Chapter 4.

In 2014 the Business Development Department (COBD) led the
design, fund raising and operationalization of AfricaS0, relying
ona task force established for that purpose. In consultation
with key stakeholders, COBD elaborated a business model
and structure for Africa50, following the approval of the
Bank’s cornerstone investment in Africa50 and the strong
interest created in the market. Africa50 was incorporated
in Casablanca Financial City on September 1, 2014. It is
expected to be fully operational in 2015.

The Group Chief Risk Officer discharged the Bank Group risk
management mandate in 2014 through several initiatives that
included (i) a policy review of the Bank’s capital adequacy
framework to assess the relationship between the risks the
Bank assumes and its risk-bearing capacity; (ii) undertaking
credit risk management to monitor the loan portfolio and provide
periodic reports on credit and investment risks; (iii) co-leadership
of the review of the Bank’s annual market risk report and the
design of the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility
(PSF) framework; and (iv) active engagement in strengthening
the Bank's reporting, operations, and compliance objectives
through operational risk management.

During the year, the African Natural Resources Center (ANRC)
provided technical support to the Fisheries Committee of West
Central (FCWC), Gulf of Guinea by assisting its secretariat and
six member countries in the ratification and implementation
of the FAO’s ‘Agreement on Port States Measures’ and with
compliance to the EU anti-illegal-fishing regulation. In response
to a request from the Government of Guinea, ANRC also
coordinated the Bank's technical support to the country’s
Simandou South Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project.

The Financial Sector Development Department prepared the
Financial Sector Development Policy and Strategy (FSDPS)

2014-2019 that replaced the 2003 Financial Sector Policy.

Approved in October 2014, this new policy and strategy rests
on two pillars: it increases access of Africa’s under-served

64

populations to a full range of financial services and broads
and deeps of Africa’s financial systems.

Meanwhile, results supported by the Delivery and Performance
Management Office in 2014 include: (i) a full delivery of lending
targets across the three Bank Group financing windows; (ii) a
granular review of portfolio performance through the Portfolio
Flashlight; (iii) a gradual improvement of corporate data integrity
through enhanced transparency and accountability for data
quality; (iv) a reversal of the upward trend of the cost-to-income
ratio, through a reflection on expense rationalization measures;
and (v) a close follow-up and mobilization of additional staff
capacity for strategic institutional initiatives, including the return
to Headquarters, operationalization of new departments, and
reform of procurement.

Information Technology. During 2014, the Bank continued
to pursue key priority projects in keeping with its IT Strategy.
In light of the Bank’s return to Abidjan, the focus was on
enhancing IT infrastructure and services to support a smooth
systems transition and to ensure business continuity. Key
achievements were:

e The Bank installed modern communication infrastructure
at its Headquarters and in all its Field Offices and Regional
Resource Centers. This has improved communications
among all staff and also between staff and member countries
and business partners. Connectivity to information systems
has also been improved, making it easier for staff to share
documents and for staff to collaborate on Bank activities.
This has led to significant efficiency gains in Bank operations
Managerial tools were enhanced in a variety of ways. A
robust and flexible staff performance evaluation management
system was successfully launched. Initial components were
implemented in 2014 while others will be put in place in
2015. The Executive Dashboard Project for the reporting
of strategic key performance indicators was completed
during 2014. This is a key tool that Senior Management of
the Bank now uses to measure performance.

The MapAfrica Project, which has enabled the geocoding of
the Bank’s projects on a map, was launched. The project’s
initial results were shown to participants at the Bank’s 2014
Annual Meetings in Kigali, Rwanda.

The Data Center at the Bank’s Temporary Headquarters in the
center of Tunis was successfully migrated to the Zahrabed
building in the city’s suburbs, without any negative impact
on the Bank’s business.

Business Continuity Management. The Bank’s return
to Abidjan was an important test of its business continuity
management plan. The relocation was a critical challenge
fraught with major risks that were, however, well managed.
Key was the early development of a business continuity plan

Annual Report 2014used to manage the risks and ensure that the Bank would
continue to meet all its obligations.

There were, however, challenges in RMCs that required the
Bank to trigger its business continuity plan. Examples include
the impact of civil strife in the Central African Republic, South
Sudan, and Burkina Faso. However, the most important
challenge to business continuity in 2014 was the onset of
the Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra
Leone, and to a lesser extent, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali.
The Bank has a field presence in all six countries. There was
also a real risk that the disease could spread to neighboring
countries, including Céte d’lvoire, to where the Bank had
just relocated. Strong measures were taken at Headquarters
and in all the Bank’s offices in the field to prevent the risk of
infection of staff and their families and also prevent the risks
of disrupting the Bank’s operations.

The Bank's business continuity preparedness plays a key role
in its evaluation by the rating agencies, providing them the
assurance of the Institution’s capacity to continue operations
in the face of disruptions in its business environment.

5.2 Policies and Strategies

The implementation of the Bank’s Ten-Year Strategy entered its
second year in 2014, focusing on policies and strategies that
support inclusive growth and Africa’s transition to green growth.
In view of the changing global aid architecture, policies and
strategies that enhance the financing of Africa’s development,
as well as innovative means to administer development
assistance received special attention. These factors influenced
the design of seven new policies and strategies that were
reviewed and approved by the Boards in 2014.

The Governance Strategic Framework and Action Plan
(GAP II), 2014-2018. The Boards approved GAP II in May
2014. This marked an important milestone for the Bank’s
interventions on governance during 2014-2018. The strategy
seeks to build strong, transparent and accountable institutions
in Regional Member Countries to enhance their capacity to
deliver on the agenda for inclusive and sustainable growth. It is
anchored on three pillars, namely, public sector and economic
management, sector governance, and improvement of the
investment and business climate. It, however, also emphasizes
the importance of the cross-cutting areas of anti-corruption,
gender equality, and regional integration. Further, the strategy
addresses the issues of political economy and capacity building
in state bureaucracies.

GAP II will be implemented by leveraging the Bank’s presence

and visibility in Regional Member Countries through its Field
Offices, and by stepping up country-level policy dialogue and

Annual Report 2014

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

advice. The Bank’s interventions will be informed by careful
diagnostic assessment of the drivers and impediments to
reforms, so as to mitigate risk of failure.

Gender Strategy 2014-2018. This strategy was approved
by the Boards in January 2014. Gender plays a critical role
in the Bank’s TYS. Women and girls in Africa are among
the poorest and most illiterate in the world. Strengthening
women’s legal and property rights and promoting their
economic empowerment is therefore central to accelerating
Africa’s inclusive development, as is knowledge creation
and management and capacity building on issues of gender
equality. The Gender Strategy was designed, under the
guidance of the Boards, with the mandate to ensure that
the Bank’s country and regional strategies and operations
reflect gender mainstreaming, building equally on external
and internal transformation.

External transformation emphasizes (i) gender-focused
governance; (ii) legal reforms and property rights; (iii) a reduction
in gender-based violence; (iv) ensuring women’s economic
empowerment through increased access to and control over
financial resources and services; and (v) knowledge management
and capacity building on issues related to reporting of results
on progress towards gender equality.

Internal transformation reflects the Bank’s ability to demonstrate
leadership and commitment to gender equality within its
own structures. The goal is for the Bank to become a more
supportive, gender-responsive institution, sensitive to the
different needs of male and female staff by treating them
equally and ensuring they are protected from all forms of
discrimination and harassment, including violence.

Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in
Africa, 2014-2019. This strategy to address fragility in Africa
was approved by the Boards in June 2014, replacing that of
2008. The new strategy followed findings and recommendations
of the High Level Panel on Fragile States constituted by the
Bank to investigate the causes and consequences of fragility
in Africa. The Panel noted that fragility is reflected in elevated
risks of institutional failure, societal collapse, or—the most
common factor—violent conflict. The strategy has strong pillars
for fostering inclusive development in Africa, stressing that
fragility could stem from any source and arise in any country.

To enhance the Bank’s response in states under fragile
situations, the Fragile States Unit (OSFU) was upgraded to a
fully-fledged department, the Transition Support Department
(ORTS), with the mandate to oversee all operational activities
related to fragility, including a specialized financing vehicle, the
Transition Support Facility (TSF), which replaced the Fragile
States Facility (FSF).

65Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

Diversifying the Bank’s Products to Provide Eligible
ADF-Only Countries with Access to the ADB Sovereign
Window. This much anticipated policy by low-income Regional
Member Countries was approved by the Board in May 2014.
It includes provisions for a case-by-case consideration of
each country’s access to ADB sovereign resources. Four
conditions will have to be met: (i) the country must be at
low or moderate risk of debt distress, as determined by a
debt sustainability assessment (DSA) of the IMF; (ii) it must
have headroom for non-concessional borrowing, again as
determined by the IMF’s DSA, and in compliance with the
IMF's sustainable lending limit (SLL) policy for countries under
Fund-supported programs and the Bank Group’s Policy on
Non-Concessional Debt Accumulation; (iii) the country must
have a sustainable macroeconomic position; and (iv) the
country’s request for financing must be approved by the
Bank’s Credit Risk Committee, based on the country’s risk
assessment. The Bank Group’s Risk Management Framework
will be the paramount screening tool to guide Management's
decisions with regard to eligibility and loan amounts.

The Bank Group Regional Integration Policy and Strategy,
2014-2023. This policy and strategy was considered and
approved by the Board in November 2014. It is anchored on
two pillars: regional infrastructure development, and enhancing
trade and industrial development on the continent. The new
policy and strategy will be implemented at national and
regional levels through Regional Integration Strategy Papers
and Country Strategy Papers. Bank support to regional
infrastructure development is to be guided by continental and
regional priorities, especially the Program for Infrastructure
Development in Africa’s (PIDA) Priority Action Plan. The Bank
will also promote public-private partnerships in regional
infrastructure development—from planning, design, preparation
and construction to operations, management and monitoring.

The Bank’s Human Capital Strategy for Africa (HCS),
2014-2018. This strategy, the first for the Bank on human
capital development, was approved by the Boards in May 2014.

It will be the basis for the Bank’s support to investments
in skills and technology development in all RMCs through
knowledge work, policy dialogue and lending operations.
Interventions will address the challenges of unemployment
and underemployment among the youth and women, labor
market-skills mismatches, and low productivity in the informal
sector, where many youth and women are employed. In addition,
Bank operations focusing on human capital will increasingly be
underpinned by economic and sector work and also integrate
impact evaluations. The Bank will foster such analytical
work through joint effort with other development partners,
as it prepares its operations. It will also adopt a systemic
approach to project evaluation, including building on current

66

practice. The implementation of the HCS will leverage other
Bank strategies —including those for gender, private-sector
development, governance, and fragility—to build human capital
in Africa. It will underscore the human capital dimension in all
core operational priority areas of the TYS, emphasizing skills
and technology as crucial for development of a productive
workforce and competitive economies, within the inclusive
and green growth agenda.

The Financial Sector Development Policy and Strategy
(FSDPS), 2014-2019. The FSDPS, was approved by the
Board in October 2014 and replaces the 2003 Financial Sector
Policy. It has two pillars: one is increasing access of the underserved to the full range of financial services, and the other is
the broadening and deepening of Africa’s financial systems.

In implementing the FSDPS, the Bank will aim to ensure
further geographic diversification of both its sovereign and
non-sovereign investments and operations. To increase the
proportion of the Bank’s financial sector activities in Low-Income
Countries (LICs) as well as in states under fragile situations,
the Bank will continue to prudently deploy products such
as guarantees, risk capital/equity investments and grants to
respond to market demand and context while balancing the
associated risk. The Bank will also combine and complement
its lending activities with advisory and technical assistance
services. These services will be geared towards supporting
development of financial markets, financial service providers
and relevant institutions in the low-income areas and in states
under fragile situations.

5.3 Development Effectiveness and
Quality Assurance

During the year, the Bank Group enhanced the quality of its
operations. It established quality, social and environmental
safeguards, and strengthened its ability to measure and
manage for development results.

Enhancing the Quality of Operations. Since 2013, the Bank
has put in place a systematic, harmonized and integrated
operational rating system, capturing the performance of
all of the Bank’s public sector operations: (i) at entry in the
Readiness Review which assesses the compliance of the project
documentation with the Bank’s quality at entry standards;
(ii) during implementation in “the Implementation Progress
and Results Report which adopts a new evidence-based
and results-focused method to monitor and rate operational
performance”; and (iii) at exit in “the Project Completion Report
which rates project performance based on an assessment
of the relevance, the effectiveness, the efficiency, and the
sustainability of the operation, highlighting lessons learnt in
these various aspects”. Throughout the cycle, the results-based

Annual Report 2014logical framework is used to plan, track and report progress
towards operational outcomes and outputs, forming the
backbone of the results-based rating system.

The rating system has three essential features: (i) it is focused
on results (i.e. progress towards outcomes and outputs as set
out in logical frameworks); (ii) it is based on evidence gathered
on the field; and (iii) it facilitates issues identification so as to
prompt corrective action. Ultimately, the rating system aims
at maximizing the Bank’s operational results and impact. It
will deliver its intended benefits facilitated results tracking and
reporting, identification of problem areas, proactive project
management — only if rigor and candor are exercised in rating
and assessing performance. The introduction of operational
quality assurance tools is a major step towards enhancing a
culture of results across the Bank.

Compliance with the new system is monitored through quarterly
progress reports and the Quality Assurance Dashboard (QAD)
“annual report” which aims at monitoring progress made by
the Bank in mainstreaming operational quality assurance tools
throughout the project cycle. The QAD does not assess or
re-assess project performance itself, but rather looks at the
quality of the reports and the way the ratings are derived. As
of end-December 2014, overall, the new integrated rating
system has been successfully introduced in Bank operations.

Ensuring Social and Environmental Safeguards. The
Bank acknowledges that its vision of a developing Africa
must adhere to well-formulated environmental, social and
climate-change safeguards. With the approval in December
2013 of the Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System (ISS), no
effort is spared to ensure that its operations are assessed
and managed according to these stipulations. The newly
adopted ISS is expected to further enhance the Bank's ability
to identify and minimize risks of Bank-funded projects doing
harm while working in or with communities, to protect the
environment and promote sustainability.

The Bank’s Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP), 2011-2015,
approved by its Boards in 2012, provides guidelines for attainment
of the Bank’s objectives with regard to climate change. The
CCAP is designed to help African countries strengthen their
capacity to respond to climate change, including the mobilization

Annual Report 2014

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

of necessary resources from current and proposed sources of
climate finance, the private sector and market mechanisms.
The three pillars of the CCAP are: (i) low-carbon development;
(ii) climate resilient development; and (iii) a funding platform.
Close to USD 6.51 billion for financing the activities of the
CCAP has been mobilized in the past three years to support
adaptation and low-carbon development in Africa. For each
activity in the CCAP, specific agencies are earmarked for its
financing. The resources for financing the activities of CCAP are
drawn from ADF replenishments and the Sixth General Capital
Increase, bilateral trust funds and existing, or new climate finance
instruments, including the Climate Investment Fund (CIF), the
Global Environmental Facility (GEF), the Congo Basin Forest
Fund (CBFF) and the ClimDev-Africa Special Fund. Based on
the climate finance tracking, USD 5.41 billion was allocated
at the rate of 70.3 percent and 29.7 percent, respectively, to
financing mitigation and adaptation operations.

In the past three years, after its approval of the CCAP, the
Bank has provided training to more than 600 development
experts on issues related to climate change in Africa. Further,
eight countries have benefited from the assistance provided
by the Bank to mainstream climate-change issues in their
Country Strategy Papers as well as their own policies.

At the international level, the Bank provided technical and
logistical assistance to its RMCs during the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
negotiation processes leading to the 20th session of the
Conference of the Parties (COP 20) from December 1 to 12,
2014 in Lima, Peru. The Bank has continued to support up
to 50 African delegates to these annual negotiations, at an
annual cost of up to USD 2 million.

The Bank continues to play an important role as a climate
change knowledge bank, with a stock of over 60 climate
change related knowledge products, including books, working
papers, and briefs produced over in the last three years.

Tables 5.1 and 5.2 below use a traffic light system to depict
scores on the progress made at four levels: (i) development
progress in Africa (Level 1); (ii) Bank’s contribution to development
in Africa (Level 2); (iii) Bank’s operational performance (Level 3);
and (iv) AfDB’s organizational efficiency (Level 4).

5.4 Update on Implementation of
ADF-13 Replenishment

The ADF-13 Replenishment is now effective following the
adoption of the ADF-13 Resolution and approval of the ADF-13
Deputies Report by postal ballot in January 2014.

At the end of the ADF-13 Replenishment consultations in

September 2013, ADF Deputies agreed on a replenishment
of UA 4.831 billion for the Fund. This comprised (i) donor

at have available data with baseline and actual data built in. As more projects have started to include
robust and complete.

e contribution the Bank is making to development through its operations in Africa. The Bank's performance is measured by comparing expected and

contributions of UA 3.789 billion; (ii) an advance commitment
capacity from the Bank Group of UA 976 million; (iii) UA 66 million
from an initial subscription from Angola (UA 10 million); and
(iv) supplementary contributions of UA 56 million.

Total resources expected to be available for the ADF13
period (2014-2016) will amount to UA 5.375 billion, comprising
the above replenishment of UA 4.831 billion and carry-over
resources from the ADF-12 of UA 544 million. However,
contingencies for exchange rate risk and for qualified and late

Annual Report 2014contributions, which together amount to UA 404 million, are
netted out, leaving total allocable resources at UA 4.971 billion.
Three allocations (for Pillars |, Il, and Ill) have been made
for the Transition Support Facility (TSF) envelope (UA 662
million), the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF),
(with a contribution of UA 165 million discussed above),
and the Regional Operations (RO) envelope, (21 percent of
allocable resources). After netting out for these set-asides,
UA 3.100 billion is left over for country allocations through
the performance-based allocation (PBA) methodology over
the three years of the ADF-13 cycle (2014-2016).

A quarterly monitoring report tracks the ADF-13 resource
utilization by country and by envelope or set-aside. The
report also includes information on the utilization of resources
available from cancellations of Bank projects.

5.5 Independent Evaluation of
Bank Operations

The name of the Operations Evaluation Department (OPEV)
was changed to Independent Development Evaluation (IDEV) to
reflect the department’s independence. Its functions, however,
will continue to be guided by the AfDB Independent Evaluation
Strategy, 2013-2017, which focuses on the complementary
objectives of learning, accountability and the promotion of
an evaluation culture, in support of the overarching goal of
improving development effectiveness.

In 2014, several important evaluations were successfully
delivered. Highlights included:

¢ Two thematic evaluations that focus on the areas of
infrastructure and the private sector, including an evaluation
of the transport sector, and an evaluation of the Bank’s
Additionality and Development Outcomes Assessment
(ADOA) Framework for private-sector operations.

¢ Three Country Strategy and Program Evaluations for
Botswana, Madagascar, and Chad were delivered, and
directly informed the development of the new Bank
strategies for these countries. The evaluations noted
that the tendency for Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) to
focus on individual projects, rather than their linkages to
the broader economy, requires redress, towards a more
programmatic approach.

¢ Two important corporate evaluations were completed in
2014. These were the evaluation of Quality at Entry for
CSPs/Regional Integration Strategy Papers (RISPs) and
the evaluation of efficiency and effectiveness of the Bank’s
procurement function. These evaluations informed the
development of new policies and guidelines in these two key

Annual Report 2014

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

corporate areas. The first evaluation underscored that the
CSP and RISP preparation processes were cumbersome
and would benefit from streamlining. The second evaluation
recommended a clearer and stronger delegation of authority
co the field in areas of procurement, better use of post-reviews
and audits, and greater attention to capacity building and
use of country systems. A joint Evaluation of Multilateral
Development Bank (MDB) Support to the Climate Investment
Funds was also completed in 2014.

The evaluations above provided credible, evidence-based
information that can help inform the Bank’s strategic direction
on inclusive growth and the transition to green growth.

Other evaluations, begun in 2014, are expected to be completed
in 2015. These include: (i) an evaluation of Bank support to
microfinance; (ii) an evaluation of Bank support to SMEs;
(iii) an evaluation of the Bank’s Private Equity Investments;
(iv) impact evaluations of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
programs in Ethiopia and Tanzania, and (vi) evaluations that
will contribute to the evaluation of the Bank’s GCI and ADF
commitments and the comprehensive evaluation of the Bank’s
development results.

 

During the course of the year, IDEV continued to strengthen the
dissemination of the lessons learnt from its evaluations through
various forms of Bank outreach and knowledge sharing. The
Bank during the year published four editions of its quarterly
knowledge magazine ‘eVALUation Matters’. A number of
dissemination and learning events were conducted throughout
the Bank and in the field, including a regional dissemination and
learning event in Senegal and a training program for knowledge
management practitioners at the annual conference of the
African Evaluation Association (AfrEA). IDEV is implementing two
initiatives to further institutionalize evaluation and maximize the
use of evaluation results in the Bank. These are: (i) development
of the Management Action Record System (MARS); and (i)
roll-out of the Evaluation Results Database which consolidates
evaluation findings, recommendations and lessons from past
projects, policies, and programs.

5.6 Procurement and Fiduciary Services

Procurement and Fiduciary Services are key management
and governance functions of the Bank. Regional Member
Countries have received direct assistance through well
designed capacity building in public financial management,
including procurement, with positive impacts on other areas
of the Bank’s work such as project implementation and
financial governance.

As in previous years, the Bank’s Procurement and Fiduciary
Services contributed to the design, preparation, appraisal,

7)Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

supervision and completion of projects and programs
financed by the Bank. Capacity-building efforts continued in
RMCs through innovative programs such as Fiduciary Clinics
provided by the Bank’s African Development Institute (EAD).
Direct and focused assistance was provided in public financial
management and procurement, among other areas. These
efforts had a positive impact on project delivery and financial
governance and also enhanced public sector capacities in
public finance management in the RMCs. Internal capacity
building continued with training on procurement issues provided
to some 100 Bank staff.

The Bank’s emphasis on timely submission of project audits
yielded results with on-time submission of reports remaining
at the level of 90 percent in 2014 as in 2013.

5.7 Intermediate Recourse Mechanisms and
Administrative Tribunal

The Bank’s intermediate recourse mechanism units continued to
play significant roles in 2014 as agencies of corporate restraint
and responsibility. Their work was particularly demanding
during the Bank’s recent preparations for its return to Abidjan.
By playing their roles as intermediaries in resolving conflicts
and disputes, harmonizing and improving working relations
among staff, management and the Bank, the Recourse
Mechanisms and Administrative Tribunal contributed, indirectly,
to enhancing the effectiveness of the Bank’s operations and
implementation of the TYS’s priorities.

Audit. The Office of the Auditor General in 2014 reviewed a
number of areas of Bank operations that required changes
in policies and procedures by management. The reviews
covered the Bank’s equity fund operations, application of
environmental and social policies and procedures, credit risk
in treasury operations, IT strategy and governance, and the
Bank's operational risk framework. The Office continued to
help enhance the Bank Group’s capacity to bring about a
systematic and disciplined approach to the evaluation and
improvement of risk management and control and governance
processes.

Staff Integrity and Ethics. The Bank’s corporate governance
culture remained positive in 2014. Due attention was paid to
the few cases reported to the Staff Integrity and Ethics Office,
which had put in place an intensive awareness program to
mitigate reputational risks. The ethics function continued to
provide advice to staff and management to ensure that Bank
operations and staff-to-staff relations were conducted in the
most ethical manner possible. The Bank's staff integrity function
will continue to investigate allegations of staff misconduct,
including violations of staff rules, and ensure appropriate
measures are taken.

 

72

Ombudsman. During the year the Office of the Ombudsman
received a number of grievances, ranging from abuse of
authority to concerns about career development. As at endDecember 2014 the Office had handled a total of 77 cases,
of which 48 percent were on career development and job
security. Almost 50 percent of the total number of cases was
brought to closure almost immediately. In 2014, as part of the
Outreach and Needs-Based Mission, the Office undertook
back-to-back field missions to the Chad Field Office (TDFO)
and to the Department Overseeing the Return to Abidjan
(DIRA) in Céte d’lvoire, to attend to a number of grievances
that staff there had raised. This exercise demonstrated the
importance of proximity as well as that of good understanding
of the rules and regulations of the Bank. In its continued efforts
to reduce staff work-related grievances in the Field Offices
and the Resource Centers, the office initiated the election of
15 new values promotion champions (VPCs) and later held
a training session for 25 VPCs at the Bank’s Headquarters.
The aim of the exercise was to equip the VPCs with various
skills required for them to perform their roles more effectively.

Integrity and Anti-Corruption. The Bank’s sanctions regime
comprises the Sanctions Office, headed by the Sanctions
Commissioner, and the Sanctions Appeals Board and considers
cases as they are received. At the beginning of 2014, the
number of cases brought forward from the previous year
stood at 81. After new cases were registered, some were
closed after first review and others opened for preliminary
and full investigation, resulting in a total number of cases in
progress in 2014 of 94. Of these, 18 cases were closed. The
findings on four sanctionable practices were submitted to the
Sanctions Commissioner's Office. Seven entities entered into
a Negotiated Settlement Agreements (NSA) with the Bank,
while five cases were transferred to the Staff Integrity and
Ethics Office (SIEO).

The Bank Group operates a two-tier process in deciding on
the penalties for proven sanctionable practices in projects
administered, financed or supported by the Bank. As at
end-December 2014, eight entities had been debarred by
the Bank’s Sanctions Commission and cross-debarred by
other MDBs. This brought the number of entities that had
been cross-debarred by the Bank Group, in line with the
Cross-debarment Agreement with other MDBs, to 98.

In early 2014 the Bank concluded its first set of Negotiated
Settlement Agreements (NSA) with four multinationals that
had engaged in corrupt practices in the context of a Bankfinanced project in Nigeria. In June 2014, the Bank also
resolved a case of fraudulent practices in the context of a
technical and vocational education training project in Eritrea
with a UK-based supplier of educational equipment. Similarly,
in November 2014, the Bank concluded a case of collusive

Annual Report 2014and fraudulent practices in connection with a road project in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Further, the Bank
allowed a multinational corporation to enter into a self-reporting
agreement regarding public allegations of corrupt practices
in connection with Bank-financed projects in Uganda and
Mozambique.

Compliance Review and Mediation. The Bank’s Independent
Review Mechanism (IRM) is administered by the Compliance
Review and Mediation Unit. The IRM receives and responds to
complaints from people adversely affected by Bank-financed
projects.

A request was received in February 2014 regarding the
Bank-funded project on the Improvement of Health Services
Delivery at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Those
making the request for review claimed that they owned the
plot of land on which the Bank-financed hospital is being built.
This case is being handled through problem solving. Other
cases relating to the construction of the Marrakech-Agadir
Motorway in Morocco, and the Road Support Project II in
Tanzania, were brought to a satisfactory conclusion through
the problem-solving method.

In 2014, the Bank undertook outreach missions to the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and Mauritania. These
missions improved awareness of the mandate and functions
of the IRM among Bank staff and national officials as well
as other stakeholders, including the private sector and civil
society organizations. In the Democratic Republic of Congo,
a total of 205 participants benefited from these seminars.

Administrative Tribunal. The Bank’s Administrative Tribunal
held its 23rd Judicial Session in Tunis in June 2014 during
which it disposed of two applications. This session also marked
the end of its activities from the Bank’s Temporary Relocation
Agency in Tunis, Tunisia. Subsequently, in December 2014,
the Tribunal held its 24th Judicial Session and a plenary at
the Bank’s Headquarters in Abidjan, where three applications
were heard and disposed of. In the first quarter of 2014, the
Tribunal’s Secretariat undertook outreach programs in Field
Offices, in collaboration with the Staff Council and the Staff
Appeals Committee. These training and information sharing
events were conducted in the Zambia, Zimbabwe, and
Madagascar Field Offices and the Southern Africa Resource
Center. Similar missions followed in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali
and Morocco during the second quarter of 2014.

5.8 Deployment of Human Resources

The Human Resources Development function has been
at the center of institutional reforms at the Bank and also
played a pivotal role in the Bank’s return to its Headquarters

Annual Report 2014

Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management Chapter 5

in Abidjan. The Bank has devised a People Strategy aimed
at making it the employer of choice for those working on
African development. The Human Resources Action Plan is
the business plan for the management of human resources,
focusing on establishing an attractive culture of professional
satisfaction and personal advancement.

People Strategy. The Bank’s People Strategy 2013-2017
was approved by the Board in 2013. During the year, four
champions were identified for each of the strategy’s four
pillars: (i) for Priority | on Leadership — the Director of Strategy
and Operational Policies; (ii) for Priority Il on Performance and
Accountability — the Vice-President of Finance; (iii) for Priority
Ill on Employee Engagement and Communication — the
Secretary General and Vice-President, and (iv) for Priority IV
on Developing a Workforce of the Future — the Vice-President
of Sector Operations. Under the leadership pillar, the strategic
staffing exercise and the skills audit launched in the latter part
of 2014 will provide a robust foundation for talent development
and career planning.

To improve employee engagement, a new onboarding program
was designed and launched in Abidjan and a web version was
planned for 2015. The performance management tools and
processes were revamped to facilitate improved interactions
and dialogue between staff and their supervisors, and establish
a credible and congruent performance management culture.
Progress made in staff engagement will be monitored through
staff surveys.

Under the ‘Workforce of the Future’ initiative, key targets set
towards streamlining and improving recruitment initiatives
were met. There was a renewed focus on improving work
arrangements and the work environment to attract and maintain
a workforce of the future. A rest and relaxation guideline was
developed for staff working in hardship locations, while a
pilot project was launched to test remote work arrangements.
Through the Office of the Special Envoy on Gender, the Bank
launched a gender study that examines and identifies gender
gaps, and propose strategies for gender mapping.

Human Resource Action Plan. Under the Human Resources
Action Plan, the Bank's Performance Management process and
tool was revised and launched in December 2014. During the year
the Bank also embarked on a strategic staffing exercise across
the institution. Results of the exercise were to be compiled and
analyzed in early 2015. For better information sharing, the Bank
piloted a platform through SharePoint collaboration software
with a few users and a larger roll-out was planned for 2015.

With the Bank’s return to Abidjan, a temporary hold was placed

on recruitment. However, key positions that could affect business
continuity continued to be filled. The 2014 intake of the Young

73Chapter 5 Institutional Reforms and Corporate Management

Professionals Cohort was deferred to 2015 while the Bank staff
complement declined by 6.4 percent from 2,065 at the end of
2013 to 1,932 at end-December 2014. The total staff of 1,932
included 1,263 professional staff, 340 (26.9 percent female),
and 631 general service staff with 431 at Headquarters (64.3
percent female) and 200 in the Field Offices (44.5 percent
female). Of the 631 general service staff, 366 (58.0 percent) were
female. Female managerial staff (including two Vice-Presidents)
totaled 50 (30.7 percent of 163 managerial staff). See Table
5.3 below for the details.

During 2014 the Bank embarked on the creation of a talent
management and learning/development infrastructure. This will
involve leader-led learning, business-aligned learning investments,
the strengthening of professional practice groups, a focus on
results, and ensuring impact and value for money with regards
to investment in staff. In-house and online training, available to
a broad spectrum of staff members, continued to be delivered
in 2014. To enhance bilingualism, virtual language classes were
reactivated. With a large number of staff having moved to Abidjan
by the fourth quarter, language classes also commenced in Abidjan.

Annual Report 2014 75Chapter 6 The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities

The Boards of Governors and the Boards of Directors are, respectively, the highest decision
making organs of the Bank Group. The Bank activities described in the previous chapters were

undertaken by Management under their purview. This chapter describes briefly how the oversight

or accountability functions of the Boards were discharged in 2014, and provides a flavor of the

discussions relating specifically to their key decisions, including returning the Bank to its statutory

headquarters in Abidjan.

6.1 Roles of the Boards

This section provides an overview of the roles of the Boards
of Governors and Boards of Directors the two apex decisionmaking organs of the Bank Group.

The Boards of Governors are the highest decision-making
organs of the Bank and the Fund. Each member country is
represented on the Board by a Governor, usually a Minister
of Finance, Planning or a Central Bank Governor, or a duly
designated alternate. The Governors execute their mandate
with the support of five subsidiary organs: (i) the Bureau,
(ii) the Joint Steering Committee, (iii) the Steering Committee
on the Election of the President of the Bank, (iv) the Standing
Committee on the Conditions of Service of Elected Officers,
and (v) the Governors’ Consultative Committee.

The day-to-day decision-making organs are the resident Boards
of Directors, which act on delegated authority from the Boards
of Governors. As such, they are entrusted with the conduct of
general operations, including approval of strategies, policies,
loans and grants, equity investments, guarantees, and the
administrative budget. In the discharge of their duties, the
Boards of Directors exercise all the powers of the Bank and
the Fund, except those expressly reserved for the Boards of
Governors by each entity's constitutive instrument.

The 20 Executive Directors of the Bank are elected by the
Board of Governors for a period of three years, renewable once.
The 53 regional (African) member states are represented in
the Bank by 13 Executive Directors (EDs), while the remaining
seven represent the non-regional (non-African) member
states. The Board of Directors of the Fund is composed of
14 Executive Directors, half of whom are appointed by the
State Participants of the Fund, and the other half designated
by the Bank from among regional Executive Directors.

In 2014, the work of the Boards of Directors was supported by
seven standing committees; (i) The Committee on Administrative

78

Affairs and Human Resource Policy Issues (CAHR); (ii) the
Audit and Finance Committee (AUF); (iii) the Committee on
Operations and Development Effectiveness (CODE); (iv) the
Committee on Administrative Matters Concerning the Board
of Directors (AMBD); (v) the Committee of the Whole on the
Budget (CWHOLE); (vi) the Committee for the Enforcement
of the Code of Conduct for Executive Directors (Ethics
Committee); and (vii) the Committee for the Preparation
of the Bank Group Annual Report (ANRE). In addition, an
ad-hoc committee —the Working Group on the Return to the
Headquarters—oversaw the effective return of the Bank’s
operations to Abidjan, Cdte d'Ivoire.

During the year, the Boards oversaw in particular the work
of the following units which worked independently from
the rest of the Bank: Office of the Auditor General (OAGL),
Integrity and Anti-Corruption (IACD), Independent Evaluation
(IDEV), Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (CRMU) and
Administrative Tribunal (TRIB).

6.2 Highlights of Activities of the
Boards of Directors

The Boards of Directors of the Bank Group commenced their
2014 activities in January in Tunis at the Temporary Relocation
Agency but the year was concluded in Abidjan, following the
Bank’s return. The Board insisted on minimal disruption to
Bank operations during the transition, a goal largely achieved.
The Bank, as noted above, required quick action to combat
Ebola, bringing a project document to the Board during its
August recess and cleared at a virtual meeting by the Board of
Directors. In all, 144 formal and informal meetings, seminars
and briefings were held by the Boards. This section highlights
some of the major decisions and activities undertaken by the
Boards during the year, listed in five broad categories: business
continuity and responding to urgent and unexpected needs;
budget, effectiveness and return to Abidjan; strategies and
policies to enhance operations; emphasizing the developmental
thrust of country strategy papers; and implementing the TYS.

Annual Report 2014The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities Chapter 6

 

Business Continuity and Unexpected Events

Return to Headquarters. |n the context of the Bank’s
return to its statutory Headquarters, the Board oversaw the
implementation of the roadmap for the effective return of the
Bank’s operations to Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire. The Board provided
guidance relating to measures to safeguard the interests of
staff while sustaining their morale. Members also provided
guidance on the adoption of realistic yet robust schedules for
the timely delivery of renovation works to avoid cost overruns.

During the year, the Board’s Working Group on the Return to
Headquarters undertook several missions to Abidjan, Cote
d’lvoire, to assess progress on preparations for the return,
including renovations to the Headquarters building.

Response to the Outbreak of the Ebola Hemorrhagic
Fever Epidemic. The Board responded strongly to the Ebola
crisis that seriously affected parts of West Africa and required
timely intervention by the Bank. The Board of Directors held
an exceptional virtual meeting during the August recess to
discuss a project to fight the disease. The project it approved
provided affected countries, most particularly Guinea, Liberia
and Sierra-Leone, access to quick-disbursing resources,
including budget support, and emergency and technical
assistance to strengthen health systems. To limit contagion,
support was also extended to neighboring countries.

Budget, Institutional Reforms and Effectiveness

Budget Framework 2014-2016 and Three-Year Rolling
Program and Budget Document (PBD). The Board in
December approved both the Budget Framework and the

Annual Report 2014

PBD and also welcomed the proposed prudent management
of Bank Group resources they contained. It was noted that the
budget framework and PDB would enable the Bank Group
to expand operations without substantially raising its current
administrative costs. The Board also expressed satisfaction
with improvements in the Bank's efficiency ratio (cost-to-income
ratio). Nevertheless, the Board called on Management to take
all measures necessary to ensure the financial sustainability
of Bank Group operations, including increasing Bank revenue
and budget cuts. It also advised Management that the desired
budget cuts should not be at the cost of quality, operational
effectiveness and longer-term human resource goals like
training and knowledge development. Further, the Board
emphasized the need to ensure that budget reductions did
not impair the ability of the Bank’s independent oversight
departments to discharge their responsibilities.

Total Compensation Framework. |n 2014, the Board held
extensive discussions on proposals for a comprehensive
review of the Staff Total Compensation Framework designed
to position the Bank as the employer of choice for top talent
that will deliver on African growth and development in the
context of the Bank’s TYS. The Board called on Management
to ensure that the final proposals for the framework are not
only equitable but also sustainable in the long run, and that
they were strongly linked to staff performance. The Board will
conclude its deliberations on the proposals in 2015.

The One-Bank Results Measurement Framework 2013
2016. To underscore the importance of managing for results,
the Board approved this framework in January 2014, and

719Chapter 6 The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities

welcomed the level of attention it paid to gender and capacity
building, particularly with regard to data collection, given the
importance of data in the results measurement process. The
Board also considered proposed revisions to the framework
later in the year and recommended that the framework should
be harmonized with similar approaches in other Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs).

Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Implementation of the
Decentralization Roadmap. The Board noted the results of
the decentralization process that had been carried out, and
advised on the need to avoid duplication of positions and
tasks in Regional Resource Centers and Field Offices with
those at Headquarters. It proposed a review of the skillsmix
required to ensure the effective functioning of Field Offices
and emphasized the importance of a change in behavior at
Headquarters and more-effective delegation of authority to
decentralized offices. In addition, the Board called for the
development of outcome indicators and their periodic reporting
to the Board. Management promised to develop a proposal
on the revision of the decentralization roadmap, which will
be discussed by the Board in 2015.

Strategies and Policies to Enhance Operations

The Bank Group Regional Integration Policy and Strategy,
2014-2023. Noting that regional integration is at the heart of
the Bank’s mandate and remains a priority for the continent,
the Board in November 2014, approved a policy and strategy
to foster regional and economic integration on the continent
by increasing the effectiveness of the Bank Group support
to RMCs, the private sector and sub-regional and regional
organizations. Board members noted with satisfaction the wide
level of consultation undertaken in preparing the document
and stressed the need to ensure ownership by RMCs as well
as the importance of coordination to achieve results. The
Board also affirmed its earlier approval, in April, of the Revised
Regional Operations Selection and Prioritization Framework
which underlined the importance of working together with
Regional Economic Communities (RECs) to secure unwavering
commitment for deeper regional integration.

Gender Strategy 2014-2018. The Board approved this
strategy aimed at “Investing in Gender Equality for Africa’s
Transformation” in January 2014. It welcomed the initiative as
timely, ambitious and important for the Bank’s implementation
of its Ten-Year Strategy. Board members called for strong
leadership for the attainment of gender parity within the Bank
and for the allocation of adequate resources to facilitate the
implementation of commitments and coordination with other
organizations working on gender issues.

The Governance Strategic Framework and Action Plan
(GAP II), 2014-2018. This was approved in May, and outlines

80

the Bank’s strategic intervention in strengthening governance
and accountability on the continent. The Board underscored
that the Bank needs to: (i) ensure robust and consistent policy
dialogue with Regional Member Countries (RMCs), and other
development partners; (ii) build the capacity of Field Offices
to enable them to play a key role in policy dialogue; (iii) track
the implementation of the Action Plan and document key
lessons; (iv) prioritize combating corruption and illicit financing;
and (v) mobilize resources to ensure long-term technical
assistance to RMCs.

In furtherance of the governance objective, the Board also
approved the first phase of an Economic Governance and
Inclusive Growth Program (EGIGP) which aims to promote
inclusive and sustainable growth in Mozambique through two
complementary and mutually-reinforcing components, namely,
improving public finance and natural-resource management,
and creating a conducive environment for private-sector
development. The Board called upon the Bank’s African
Natural Resource Center to: (i) support the authorities in the
country in ensuring equitable distribution of natural-resource
revenues; and (ii) support human capital development as
well as policies to foster macroeconomic stability and better
management of risks associated with natural-resource booms.

Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience
in Africa, 2014-2019. In June 2014, the Board approved this
strategy, which is aimed at addressing fragility in Africa in all
its forms and to help pave the way for a more resilient and
inclusive development for the continent. The Strategy highlights
hat fragility knows no borders and could affect all countries
on the continent. The Board urged the need for adoption of
a realistic implementation timetable and a well-defined results
ramework. It underscored the need for the Bank to provide
strong leadership and to enhance collaboration with and
coordination of the efforts of other development partners for
imely interventions that achieve the expected impact.

Financial Sector Development Policy and Strategy
2014-2019. The Board approved this policy and strategy,
he objectives of which are to open up access to financial
services for a greater number of people, deepen and expand
he African financial markets, and preserve the stability of the
African financial system. Board members advised on the need
‘or coordination, selectivity, strategic partnerships, and greater
inclusion in the delivery of financial services, in order to reach
under-served groups. It also urged for the strengthening of
hematic areas such as gender, governance, green growth
and support to small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs).

 

Amendments to the Bank’s Credit Policy: Diversifying the
Bank’s Products to Provide Eligible ADF-only Countries
Access to the ADB Sovereign Window. |In May 2014, the

Annual Report 2014Board approved a proposal to amend the Bank’s credit policy
to also provide eligible ADF-only countries access to the ADB
resources for public-sector operations. Before this decision, ADF
countries had access to ADB resources for only private-sector
projects. The eligibility for ADF countries is now based on a track
record of good economic performance, low or moderate risk
of debt distress, positive growth prospects and headroom for
non-concessional borrowing. The Board cautioned Management
to be mindful of debt sustainability issues. It directed that an
evaluation to identify the risks involved and necessary adjustments
made after three years of implementation.

Diversification of Funding Sources. |n recognition of the
global decline in development assistance brought about by
tight fiscal positions especially those of traditional development
partners, the Bank has been exploring opportunities to
diversify its sources of funding in order to provide additional
resources to meet the growing financing needs of its RMCs
and private-sector clients. In April 2014, the Board approved
the establishment of two new and innovative financing
vehicles. The first vehicle is the Africa Growing Together Fund
(AGTF), supported by the People’s Bank of China. The Board
welcomed this trust fund and advised Management to ensure
that projects to be financed through this facility remained fully
compliant with all Bank policies, procedures, and standards.
It also emphasized the need for the Bank to recover its costs
for managing trust funds such as the AGTF.

The second, named Africa50, is an innovative financing vehicle
sponsored by the Bank and specifically designed to narrow
Africa’s infrastructure finance gap. The Board welcomed the
innovative proposal and requested for regular updates on
its development. The Board authorized the Bank to take the
necessary action for the incorporation of Africa50, with the
Bank’s equity participation in its project finance business
line for an amount not exceeding USD 100 million. Board
members advised Management to identify and fully exploit
areas of complementarity between the Bank and Africa50,
and to be cognizant, of and address the risk of debt distress
that the fund could pose to Low-income Countries.

Developmental Thrust of Country Strategy Papers

Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). These are the central
tools that guide the Bank’s support for the development of
Regional Member Countries. As a general rule, the Board
ensures that CSPs are closely aligned with the Bank’s TenYear Strategy. In 2014, the Board ensured that each CSP that
it approved was well tailored to a country’s specific needs
and circumstances. Furthermore, that it focused on regional
integration, emphasized strong policy dialogue, addressed
gender equality and economic diversification, and was
underpinned by a strong fragility analysis. Moreover, inclusion
would be a major component of each CSP’s analysis and thrust.

Annual Report 2014

The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities Chapter 6

For instance, in considering the CSP for Kenya (20142018), the Board called for a strong policy dialogue with the
Government, noting the need for close monitoring of Bank
interventions, particularly in connection with implementation
of the devolution process and provision of advisory services.
For Cabo Verde (2014-2018), the Board stressed the need
to address informality in the labor market and the need for
stronger support to SMEs. In the Board’s consideration of
Swaziland’s CSP (2014-2018), it called for urgent action to
address the problem of widening inequalities, paying particular
attention to the gender dimension of income disparities.

Mauritius has been hailed as a leader in economic management.
However, the country’s CSP (2014-2018) highlighted growing
geographical and gender inequalities. The Board called on the
Bank's interventions to address the two interrelated issues.
On Namibia’s CSP (2014-2018), the Board emphasized
enhanced business development and stronger engagement
with the Government.

The Board also considered the Interim Assistance Paper
for Transition (2014-2016) for the Central African Republic
(CAR). In its deliberations, it called for stronger inclusiveness,
increased transparency, and the Bank’s strong presence to
ensure a close follow-up of activities, to address the country’s
fragility and enduring socio-political challenges.

 

Implementing the Ten-Year Strategy

Enhancing Development Impacts in Private Sector
Interventions. The Board restated its support for the Bank's
operations aimed at fostering the growth of the private sector,
apillar of the TYS, particularly SMEs. It called for determination
of the development impact of projects supported by lines of
credit. In Keeping with this approach, a number of lines of credit
were approved for disbursement to financial intermediaries
for on-lending to SMEs, commonly seen as Africa’s engine
of growth and job creation. The Board emphasized the need
for the Bank to study the impact of these interventions on
job creation, economic transformation and the potential
risks to market distortion. Accordingly, the Board called on
Management to include such indicators in future proposals
of a similar nature.

Strengthening Agriculture and Food Security. The Bank
has made agricultural development and food security one
of the three areas of special emphasis in its TYS for Africa’s
long-term development. Thus in 2014, the Board approved
a number of projects in support of this priority. The Board
welcomed Zambia’s Agriculture Productivity and Market
Enhancement Project (APMEP) as critical to fostering economic
diversification, improving livelihoods and attainment of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Board encouraged
Management to conduct similar projects in other RMCs. It

8IChapter 6 The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities

urged the Bank to closely monitor the implementation of this
project to ensure its long-term viability.

Food insecurity remains a major concern in Africa, especially
in the Sahel region and the Board has been supporting the
Bank's initiatives aimed at reversing this state of affairs on
the continent. In this regard, the Board in 2014 approved
a Multinational Programme to Build Resilience to Food and
Nutritional Insecurity in the Sahel. This program is expected
to benefit Burkina Faso, Chad, The Gambia, Mali, Mauritania,
Niger and Senegal. The Board emphasized the need for a
robust coordination and monitoring mechanism to ensure that
the program addresses the issue of rapid population growth
that tends to overwhelm food production efforts. The Board
also called for the rigorous application of a fragilitylens in such
interventions paying close attention to the sensitivity of the
region to conflict, and to putting in place adequate preventive,
as well as remedial measures.

Enhancing Skills and Technology. Africa’s high rate of youth
unemployment is partly attributed to the lack of appropriate
skills. The Board recommended that the Bank must work on
regional integration with regard to higher education, including
harmonization of rules and diplomas. The Board also approved
Phase | of the program for the establishment of Centers of
Excellence for Skills and Tertiary Education in Biomedical
Sciences in East Africa. The purpose of these centers is
to develop skills in biomedical sciences in Kenya, Rwanda,
Uganda, and Tanzania. This approval demonstrated the Board’s
support for the development of scientific and technical skills
as a means of reducing the continent’s youth unemployment.
The Board emphasized the importance of ensuring that such
training programs receive international accreditation and that
their graduates would find employment in the labor market.
The Board also underscored the importance of financial
sustainability in the program to ensure that it continued long
after the Bank’s exit.

In the Field

Boards’ Consultative Missions. Within the framework of annual
consultations, members of the Board undertook missions to
Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Cabo Verde, Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland and Sudan. The visits
were fielded to engage governments, development partners, the
business community and civil society actors on the relevance
and effectiveness of the Bank’s strategy and presence, and
the extent to which this was helping the countries address
economic and development challenges. Board members
also visited projects financed by the Bank Group to assess
progress on the ground. Following the missions, the Board
recommended that the Bank: (i) gives greater focus to policy
dialogue with governments and civil society; (ii) strengthens
coordination with other development partners; (iii) supports

82

the creation of strong national institutions; (iv) builds capacity
in economic governance; and (v) develops the infrastructure
necessary for social, spatial and economic inclusion.

6.3 Highlights of Activities of the

Boards of Governors

The Boards of Governors meet once a year at the Annual
Meetings during which they participate in the Governors’
Dialogue to examine issues and address the challenges
facing the African continent, approve major Bank policies,
and exercise their statutory duties by adopting resolutions
on key decisions and conclusions of the Annual Meetings.

The 49th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the
African Development Bank and the 40th Annual Meeting of
the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund
were held in Kigali, Rwanda, from May 19 to 23, 2014. The
theme of the events was The Next 50 Years: The Africa We
Want. As mandated by the respective constitutive instruments,
the Boards of Governors considered the importance of
innovative financing through strategic partnerships. In this
regard, they approved the Africa Growing Together Fund,
discussed earlier.

At the Annual Meetings, the Governors’ Dialogue examined
causes, effects and possible solutions to various challenges
faced by the African continent in the five decades after the
Bank was established. The discussions centered on four
sub-themes: (i) strategic leadership; (ii) regional integration;
(iii) productive employment; and (iv) conflict and fragility.

The Governors encouraged African countries to intensify efforts
to remove all physical and non-physical barriers to regional
integration. They also underscored the importance of strategic
and visionary leadership that will lead the identification and
exploitation of opportunities on the continent, particularly
in agriculture and natural resources, for Africa’s economic
transformation and industrialization. They said they were
optimistic that the next 50 years would see a fully integrated
Africa in which growth was both inclusive and sustainable.
They also expressed their optimism about the future of the
continent as one that would be at the service of its people
and at peace with itself. To this end, they urged the Bank to
partner with other development institutions and the private
sector to address the continent's infrastructure and other
challenges. Further, the Governors recognized that, if left
unaddressed, the threat of conflicts and fragility could derail
Africa’s transition to inclusive development. In this respect,
they welcomed the report of the High Level Panel on Fragile
States and urged the Bank to urgently finalize and implement
the proposed Strategy for Addressing Fragility and Building
Resilience in Africa (2014-2019).

Annual Report 2014The Boards’ Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities Chapter 6

 

The Governors also acknowledged the tremendous opportunities
for job creation, wealth generation, and environmental
preservation offered by emerging blue economy initiatives,
and encouraged the Bank to develop a fund to support
these initiatives.

The Governors also welcomed the Bank’s Gender Strategy as
a vehicle to foster gender equality and women’s empowerment.
They called for full implementation of the strategy across country,
regional and sector operations, and in the Bank’s budgeting
and programming, in order to foster inclusive growth.

In addition, the Boards of Governors exercised their statutory
duties and adopted resolutions on the following: (i) The Annual

Annual Report 2014

Report and Audited Financial Statements for the ADB and ADF
for the Financial Year Ended December 2013; (ii) The Annual
Report and Audited Special Purpose Financial Statements for
the Year Ended December 31, 2013; (iii) The Timetable and
Procedure for the Election of the next President of the Bank
Group; (iv) The Accession of the Republic of South Sudan to
the African Development Bank Agreement; (v) The Allocation
and Distribution of the Allocable Income of the ADB for the
Financial Year Ended December 31, 2013; (vi) The distribution
of part of the income of the Nigeria Trust Fund for the financial
Year Ended December 31, 2013; (vii) The establishment of
The Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF); and (viii) The
Thirteenth General Replenishment of the Resources of the
African Development Fund.

Management's Report Regarding the Effectiveness of
Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting Date: March 25, 2015

The Management of the African Development Bank Group is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall integrity of the
published financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund (The Bank
Group). The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, while those of the African
Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

The financial statements have been audited by the independent audit firm KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records
and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Boards. Management believes that
all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ reports accompany
he audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity wi
he basis of accounting. The system of internal control includes monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencie:
identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit an:
are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statemen

os

ao

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance with
respect to financial statements preparation and presentation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change over time.

 

The Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other
hings, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of
internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection
of external auditors and makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in turn makes a recommendation for
he approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or
auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls
over financial reporting and any other matter that may require AUFI's attention.

The Bank’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on criteria established in “Internal Control — Integrated
Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of
this assessment, Management asserts that the Bank Group maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained
in the financial statements as of December 31, 2014. Management is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the
reliability of the 2014 financial statements.

 

IN addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2014, the external auditors of the Bank Group
conducted an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Bank Group's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2014 and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Group regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

Year ended December 31, 2014

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African Development
Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established
in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control. Management has asserted the effectiveness of internal controls
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, issued by the
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal control was maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence
we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

KPMG S.A

 

Annual Report 2014 89KPMG. African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank Group regarding
the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2014, based on criteria established in “Jnternal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust

Fund as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have
expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

90 Annual Report 2014THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Financial Management

Capital Subscription

The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and
callable capital. The paid-up capital is the amount of capital
payable over a period determined by the Board of Governors’
resolution approving the relevant General Capital Increase.
The Bank’s callable capital is subject to payment as and when
required by the Bank to meet its obligations on borrowing
of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or
guarantees chargeable to such resources. This acts as
protection for holders of bonds and guarantees issued by
the Bank in the unlikely event that it is not able to meet its
financial obligations. There has never been a call on the
callable capital of the Bank.

Following the Board of Governors’ approval of a 200 percent
increase of the Bank’s capital base in 2010, the authorized
capital of the African Development Bank was increased to
UA 67.69 billion with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares
with a par value of UA 10,000 each. Six percent of the shares
created under this Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI),
(UA 2.62 billion), are paid-up, while 94 percent (UA 41.12 billion)
are callable. In accordance with the resolution governing this
capital increase, the GCI-VI shares were allocated to regional
and non-regional members in such proportions that, when
fully subscribed, the regional group holds 60 percent of the
total capital stock and the non-regional group 40 percent.

 

The paid-up portion of the GCI-VI subscription is payable in
eight equal annual installments for non-regional member as
well as Regional Member Countries eligible to borrow from
ADB, and 12 equal annual installments for Regional Member
Countries eligible to borrow only from ADF. Some member
countries have elected to pay their subscription in fewer
installments, opting for an advance payment scheme, and
will receive a discount on their GCI-VI subscription payment
accordingly.

Table 7.1 Bank Authorized and Subscribed Capital, 2011-2014
(in UA millions)

African Development Bank Chapter 7

Prior to the GCI-VI and by resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and
B/BG/2009/05, the Board of Governors authorized two
special capital increases to allow the Republic of Turkey and
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of
the Bank. On October 29, 2013, the Republic of Turkey was
formally admitted as the 78th member country of the Bank
(the 25th Non-Regional Member Country) after completing
the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the
Bank and in the General Rules Governing the admission of
Non-Regional Countries to membership of the Bank. On
May 29, 2014, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became the
79th member country of the Bank — the 26th Non-Regional
Member Country.

On May 31, 2012, by its Resolution B/BG/012/04, the Board
of Governors approved a special capital increase to permit
the membership of South Sudan. The country is finalizing the
formalities for its formal admission as a member of the Bank.

A member country’s payment of the first installment triggers
the issuance of the shares corresponding to the entire callable
capital portion, and shares representing the paid-up portion of
subscriptions are issued only as and when the Bank receives
the actual payments for such shares.

As at December 31, 2014, the paid-up capital of the Bank
amounted to UA 4.86 billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the
portion of paid-up capital that has been actually paid) of
UA 3.44 billion, compared with UA 4.96 billion and UA 3.15
billion of paid-up and paid-in capital, respectively, at the end
of 2013. The Bank’s callable capital at December 31, 2014
stood at UA 60.27 billion including UA 21.57 billion from nonborrowing member countries rated A- and higher, compared
with UA 60.25 billion and UA 21.25 billion, respectively, as
at the end of the previous year. The evolution of the Bank’s
capital over the past four years is shown in Table 7.1 below.

 

In accordance with the Bank’s Share Transfer Rules, shares
for which payment have become due and remain unpaid are
forfeited after a prescribed period and offered for subscription

Details of the Bank’s capital subscriptions at December 31,
2014 are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions to the
Capital Stock and Voting Powers, which forms part of the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

Bank Rating

The Bank monitors and manages its key financial strength
metrics in a stringent manner and is rated by four major
international rating agencies. The Bank continues to attract
high rating by all these agencies. For 2014, the rating agencies,
Standard & Poor’s, Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan
Credit Rating Agency have reaffirmed their AAA and AA+ rating
of the African Development Bank’s senior and subordinated
debts respectively, with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
and confirms the Bank’s strong liquidity and capital position,
strong membership support, its preferred creditor status,
sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management
and policies.

Borrowings

The top-notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank enables it to
issue securities at attractive interest rates. Its borrowing activities
are guided by client and cash flow requirements, asset and
lability management guidelines, and risk management policies.
The 2014 borrowing program in the capital markets was
approved on December 4, 2013 for a maximum amount
of UA 3,188 million including an envelope of up to UA 130
million under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance (EPSA)
or Africa Facility. On July 7, 2014, the Board approved an
increase in the 2014 borrowing program to UA 3,258 million
in order to accommodate an increase of UA 70 million on the
EPSA envelope. Under both components including the EPSA
facility, the Bank raised a total of UA 3,219 million.

 

Targeted efforts were made to canvass new investors, new
currencies and new markets throughout the year. Borrowings in
2014 were in line with the Bank's funding strategy to maintain a
regular presence in the Global benchmark market and strategic
domestic markets. Notably, the Bank issued two new USD
1 billion dollar global transactions for 3-years and 7-years, the
latter being its first-ever offering at this tenor. It also issued its
maiden transactions in Swedish krona through the green bond
market, and continued to build its curve in Australian dollars while
returning to both the Sterling and New Zealand dollar markets
after a long absence. The year also saw the Bank issue its
inaugural Naira bond in the domestic market of Nigeria, as well.

The Bank has also been active with various private placements,
African currency-linked notes and uridashi transactions in

92

Japan. Euro Commercial Paper borrowings complete the
range of markets utilized during the year.

As at December 31, 2014, the Bank’s outstanding borrowing
portfolio stood at UA 14.38 billion.

The borrowing program for 2015 was approved by the Board
of Directors for a maximum amount of UA 4,507 million, made
up of two components: up to UA 4,302 million to be raised
in the capital markets, and an envelope of UA 205 million
under the EPSA facility.

Green Bonds

The Bank is committed to supporting climate-smart and low
carbon investments that produce visible and sustainable
outcomes on the continent. It is in this context that the Bank
launched its green bond program in 2013, targeting socially
responsible investors (SRI) across the globe who wanted to
make a difference with their investments by helping to finance
climate change solutions in Africa.

In February 2014, the Bank executed a SEK 1 billion fiveyear floating-rate green bond benchmark, fully-placed with
a Swedish life insurance and asset management company.
The transaction was the Bank’s inaugural issue in the SEK
market and the second green bond to be issued off its green
bond program. The success and positive momentum of the
initial offering led to a follow-on transaction in March 2014,
with the Bank executing a second five-year SEK 1 billion (UA
100 million) fixed-rate green bond. Swedish domestic demand
accounted for 65 percent of the investors in the transaction.
Proceeds of the Bank’s green bonds support the financing of
low carbon and climate resilient projects. The total amount of
ADB green bonds outstanding at the end of 2014 (including
past private placement/uridashi issuance) stands at USD
864 million (UA 577 million). Full details of the Bank’s eligible
projects benefiting from green bond proceeds can be found
on its green bond website and annual newsletter.

Themed Bonds

In addition to its green bond program, the Bank is also active
in issuing bonds linked to various social themes. Demand from
Japanese retail investors in 2014 has been focused around
the theme of food security with the Bank successfully issuing
the first food security-linked uridashi bond in Brazilian Real
and raising UA 79 million in the process. The Bank also issued
an infrastructure bond to institutional investors in Japan. The
proceeds of these themed bonds are included in the ordinary
capital resources of the Bank and under the terms of the
bonds, an amount equal to the net proceeds of the issues
are directed on a “best-efforts” basis to lending to projects
related to the relevant theme, subject to and in accordance
with the Bank’s lending standards and guidelines.

Annual Report 2014Table 7.2 below provides a snapshot of the Bank’s activity in
the sectors financed.

Financial Products

The ADB offers an attractive and diversified menu of financial
product options that allows borrowers to tailor their financing
requirements to their circumstances. The Bank’s financial
products comprise loans (including those denominated in local
currency, and syndicated loans), lines of credit (including for
trade finance), agency lines, guarantees, equity and quasi-equity,
trade finance, and risk management products. In addition to
the aforementioned financial products, the Bank provides
technical assistance to its clients through grant funds. Each
of these products is briefly discussed below.

Loans

The ADB provides loans to its clients on non-concessional terms.
The Bank's standard loans are categorized either as Sovereign
Guaranteed Loans (SGLs) or Non-Sovereign Guaranteed Loans
(NSGLs). SGLs are made to Regional Member Countries
(RMCs) or public sector enterprises from RMCs supported
by the full faith and credit of the RMC in whose territory the
borrower is domiciled. Multinational institutions are eligible
for SGLs if they are guaranteed by an RMC or by the RMCs
in whose territory or territories the projects will be executed.

NSGLs are loans made either to public sector enterprises,
without the requirement of a sovereign guarantee or to private
sector enterprises.

The Bank's standard loan product has evolved over time, with
terms that are increasingly more responsive to client needs.
The current standard loan product offered to sovereign and
sovereign-guaranteed clients is the Enhanced Variable Spread
Loan (EVSL) which gives borrowers some degree of flexibility to
manage their interest rate risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed
clients the loan product offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for Euro

 

Table 7.2 Overview of Themed Bond Activity in Each Sector
(Amounts in UA millions)

African Development Bank Chapter 7

and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is a function
of the Bank's cost of funding relative to LIBOR, EURIBOR or
JIBAR computed every six months, and a contractual spread,
that was set at 60 basis points (bps) with effect from January 1,
2011. At a borrower's request, the EVSL offers a free option to
convert the floating base rate into a fixed base rate (amortizing
interest rate swap rate set at borrower's request for disbursed
and outstanding loan balances). The repayment period for
sovereign and sovereign guaranteed loans is up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3 month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating
until maturity date or a fixed base rate plus a risk-based
credit spread. NGSLs have a repayment period of 15 years
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

In December 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved the
introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) product to the suite
of products available to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed
borrowers. The FFL embeds risk management features currently
offered through the Bank’s risk management products in SGLs,
thereby providing full customization flexibility in interest rate
and currency conversion to borrowers. It also introduces a
maturity-based pricing structure due to the lengthening of
the maximum tenor, grace period and average loan maturity
(i.e. the weighted average time to repay a loan which considers
both repayment dates and amounts in order to provide a
better estimation of how quickly a loan is repaid) of SGLs
from the current 20, 5 and 12.75 years to 25, 8 and 17 years,
respectively to allow borrowers to select loan profiles that
match their funding needs and debt management capacities.

The lending rate of the FFL product is consistent with that of
the EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity-based pricing, loans with maturity less than or equal
to 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium. However,
loans with average loan maturity greater than 12.75 years but
less than or equal to 15 years will attract a 10 bps maturity

premium, while loans with an average maturity greater than
15 years will attract a 20 bps maturity premium.

The FFL will be available as the Bank’s standard loan product
offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers in
respect of all loans signed on or after an effective date to be
communicated by Management in 2015.

Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel
and A/B loan syndications, and local currency loans. The
Bank can provide local currency loans in the following RMC
currencies: Egyptian pound, CFA Franc (XOF and XAF),
Ghanaian cedi, Kenyan shilling, Nigerian naira, Tanzanian
shilling, Ugandan shilling and Zambian kwacha. Lending in
these currencies is only offered if the Bank is able to fund
efficiently in the relevant local currency market. These local
currency loans are offered under the FSL pricing framework
with a cost-pass-through principle to ensure that the overall
cost of funds is fully covered.

Lines of Credit

The development of a dynamic small- and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs) sector in the continent is an important
objective of the Bank as is the development of private financial
institutions (PFls). To this end the Bank offers lines of credit for
loans to PFls for on-lending to SMEs. The terms of the lines
of credit specify the conditions under which Bank funds will
be provided to the PFI for on-lending. The credit risks of the
sub-loans are borne by the PFls.

Agency Lines

The Bank makes resources available for SMEs under agency
arrangements with local financial intermediaries. The selection
of individual projects for Bank support is largely delegated to
he intermediaries, which draw on Bank resources to make
loan or equity investments for the Bank’s account in projects
meeting pre-agreed criteria. As part of an agency agreement,
inancial intermediaries are required to commit their own funds
in each investment in parallel with the Bank and to supervise
he investee companies. The financial intermediary acts only
in an agency capacity for the Bank when investing the latter’s
unds and assumes no risk in this regards. The credit risk of
he borrower is borne by the Bank.

Guarantees

Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to obtain
inancing from third-party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their
own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide
such financing directly from its own resources. The Bank’s
guarantees can generally be classified into two categories:
Partial Credit Guarantees (PCGs) and Partial Risk Guarantees

 

94

(PRGs). PCGs cover a portion of scheduled repayments of
private loans or bonds against all risks. PRGs cover private
lenders against the risk of a government, or a government
owned agency, failing to perform its obligations vis-a-vis a
private project.

Risk Management Products

The Bank currently offers Risk Management Products (RMPs)
to its borrowers only in respect of obligations outstanding to
the Bank or new Bank loans to enable them to hedge their
exposure to market risks including interest rate, currency
exchange and commodity price risks, thus allowing them to
optimize their debt management strategies. RMPs offered by the
Bank include interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity
swaps and interest rate caps and collars. These products are
available to borrowers at any time during the life of the loan.

Equity and Quasi-Equity Participations

In addition to its participation in ADF the Bank takes equity
positions in qualifying business enterprises in its RMCs as part
of its strategic development financing mandate. The Bank’s
ability to provide risk capital through equity and quasi-equity is
a key element of its resource mobilization role. The use by the
Bank of equity and quasi-equity participation as instruments
of investment have the objectives of promoting the efficient
use of resources, promoting African participation, playing
a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders to
financially viable projects as well as promoting new activities
and investment ideas. The Bank may invest in equities either
directly or indirectly, through appropriate funds and other
investment vehicles. Additionally, it may choose to invest via
quasi-equity instruments including redeemable preference
shares, preferred stock, subordinated loans or convertible loans.

Trade Finance Program

In February 2018, the Board approved a Trade Finance Program
(the “Program”) of up to USD 1 billion dollars for a 4-year initial
phase, to address the shortage of trade finance for Regional
Member Countries (RMCs) and to address the structural gap
between the demand for trade finance and the market supply
through the provision of liquidity and risk mitigation solutions to
financial institutions actively involved in trade finance in Africa.

The Program provides to eligible clients, funded and unfunded
products including: (a) Risk Participation Agreements
(Guarantee), (b) Trade Finance Lines of Credit, and (c) Soft
Commodity Finance Facilities.

Risk Participation Agreement

The Risk Participation Agreement (RPA) is both a funded and
a non-funded trade finance product that enables the Bank
to share risk with a select group of international and regional
confirming banks, who provide documentary credit confirmation

Annual Report 2014services to African issuing banks, with the objective of supporting
and expanding trade in Africa. Under this product the Bank
shares trade finance credit risk (generally no more than 50% of
a trade transaction exposure) on a portfolio of eligible issuing
bank trade transactions of partner confirming banks. RPAs
operate on a portfolio basis and do not require the Bank to
sign direct agreements with the local issuing banks.

Trade Finance Lines of Credit

The Trade Finance Line of Credit (TFLOC) is similar to the
conventional line of credit offered by the Bank to local financial
institutions except that the TFLOC will be used to finance
exclusively trade-related transactions in RMCs. Trade transactions
financed by the TFLOC include, among others, pre-shipment
and post-shipment financing, capital expenditure, letters of credit
discounting, factoring/forfaiting, import and export trade finance.

Since most trade transactions have maturities of less than
one year, the intermediary financial institutions are permitted
to utilize the line of credit as a revolving credit facility to trade
finance clients until the final maturity of the TFLOC itself, which
in any case will not exceed 3.5 years. The facility is available
to local banks engaged in trade finance in Africa.

Soft Commodity Finance Facility (SCFF)

The Soft Commodity Finance Facility (SCFF) is a funded trade
finance product that is used to support mainly the import
and export of agricultural commodities and inputs across
RMCs. This includes, for instance, the provision of pre-export
financing to commodity aggregators for the purchase and
export of soft commodities. Commodity finance is usually
structured and has credit protection in such forms as pledge
of underlying commodity, assignment of proceeds, letters
of credit, and private or state guarantees. SCFF is provided
directly to entities such as commodity aggregators, which
are not necessarily financial institutions. These entities could
include state-owned commodity boards or agricultural
cooperatives that meet the eligibility criteria for Bank private
sector borrowing. Intermediaries such as commodity traders
would not be direct counterparties of the Bank.

Other Financial Services

In addition to the products described above, the Bank may
occasionally offer technical assistance through grant funds
to supplement its financial products for both the public and
private sector windows. The Bank's technical assistance is
primarily focused on increasing the development outcomes of
its operations by raising the effectiveness of project preparation
which is vital in ensuring the best developmental and povertyreducing outcomes for projects that receive Bank financing. In
addition, technical assistance may aim to foster and sustain
efforts in creating enabling business environment in order to
promote private sector investment and growth.

Annual Report 2014

African Development Bank Chapter 7

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The Bank’s development operations are undertaken within a risk
management framework which includes: (i) a clearly defined
risk appetite statement for lending credit risk, (ii) a capital
adequacy and exposure management policy (iii) credit policy;
(iv) risk management governance framework; (v) credit risk
management guidelines; and (vi) an end-to-end credit process.

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are
not essential to its core business of providing development
finance and related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank’s risk
management policies, guidelines and practices are designed to
reduce exposure to interest rate, currency, liquidity, counterparty,
legal and other operational risks, while maximizing the Bank’s
capacity to assume credit risks to public and private sector
clients, within approved risk limits.

Over the past few years the Bank has considerably enhanced
its risk management framework and end-to-end credit
processes to ensure that its risk management functions remain
robust. Some of the specific measures taken have included:
(i) creation of the office of Group Chief Risk Officer, reporting
directly to the President of the Bank; (ii) strengthening of the
Credit Risk Committee; (iii) enhancement of the credit risk
assessment skills of Bank staff through training and hiring of
experienced and competent credit officers; (iv) implementation
of robust and optimized credit risk assessment models; (v)
strengthening of the credit risk infrastructure by improving
quality at entry; (vi) continuous efforts to fully implement the
operational risk management framework which was recently
approved by the Board; and (vii) implementation of best of
breed solutions in the form of an integrated and workflowdriven software platform that allows all stakeholders involved
in the credit risk assessment process to streamline their work
in order to enhance efficiency. The Bank has, additionally,
strengthened the monitoring of the current portfolio and
continued to proactively undertake portfolio restructuring
measures including cancellation of long-standing “signed
but not disbursed” loans to free up capital for new lending.

The Bank continues to serve all its member countries, including
those under stress. To support such continued engagement,
the Bank maintains capital buffers to provide some flexibility
in continuing its countercyclical financing role, while covering
any potential unexpected losses. Close collaboration with
sister institutions (the World Bank and IMF) has helped to
improve the coordination of current and future interventions
in those countries. Above all, the Bank has continued to
explore measures to increase portfolio diversification, an
important step in its efforts to mitigate concentration risks
within its current portfolio. The Bank also improved its collateral
management framework to ensure that an adequate collateral
value is maintained.

95Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The Bank continues to be well capitalized. The stress testing
of its capital adequacy shows that it can adequately withstand
anumber of extreme shock scenarios. The risks to the Bank's
balance sheet are actively monitored on a risk dashboard
developed in 2012.

The policies and practices employed by the Bank to manage
these risks are described in detail in Note D to the Financial
Statements.

Financial Reporting

Corporate governance within the Bank is supported by
appropriate financial and management reporting. The Executive
Board of Directors makes strategic decisions and monitors the
Bank’s progress toward achievement of set goals. While senior
management manages the Bank's day-to-day operations and
activities, the Board provides oversight, advice and counsel on
issues as wide-ranging as long-term strategy, budgets, human
resources, benefits management and new product development.

Based on the COSO internal control framework, senior
management has put in place a robust and functioning
mechanism to be able to certify the effectiveness of the
Bank's internal controls over external financial reporting. This
annual certification statement is signed by the President and
Vice President — Finance, as well as the Financial Controller.
A separate attestation is also provided by the Bank’s external
auditors. The Bank has a comprehensive system of reporting
to the Board of Directors and its committees which includes
periodic reporting by the Office of the Auditor General to the
Audit and Finance (AUF I) Committee of the Board of Directors.

External Auditors

The Bank’s external auditors are appointed by the Board of
Governors, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
or a five-year term. Under Bank rules, no firm of auditors can
serve for more than two consecutive 5-year terms.

The external audit function is statutory and is regulated by
he International Standards on Auditing (ISA), issued by the
nternational Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the
nternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The
external auditors perform an annual audit to enable them to
express an opinion on whether the financial statements of
he Bank present fairly the financial position and the results
of the operations of the Bank. They also examine whether the
statements have been presented in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as described above,
he external auditors also carry out a comprehensive review
and provide opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal
controls over financial reporting. This attestation is provided by
he external auditors as a report separate from the audit opinion.
At the conclusion of their annual audit, the external auditors

 

 

96

prepare a management letter for Senior Management and the
Board of Directors, which is reviewed in detail and discussed
with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board. The
management letter sets out the external auditors’ observations
and recommendations for improvement on internal controls and
other matters, and it includes management’s responses and
actions for implementation of the auditors’ recommendations.

The performance and independence of the external auditors is
subject to periodic review by the AUFI Committee of the Board.
There are key provisions in the Bank’s policy regarding the
independence of the external auditors including a requirement
for the mandatory rotation of the Engagement Partner, in cases
where the term of the audit firm is renewed for a second and final
5-year period. The external auditors are prohibited from providing
non-audit related services, subject to certain exceptions if it is
judged to be in the interest of the Bank and if such services
do not compromise the external auditors’ independence. In
any case, the provision of such services requires the specific
approval by the Audit and Finance Committee.

Anti-Corruption Regime within the Bank

The Bank has a robust regime for discouraging corruption.
The prohibited practices under the Bank’s anti-corruption
regime include not only bribery but also receiving bribes, fraud,
coercive practices and collusion.

The Bank has three main anti-corruption legal instruments — its
Procurement Rules, the Guidelines for Preventing and Combating
Corruption and Fraud in Bank’s Operations, and the International
Financial Institutions’ Uniform Framework for Preventing and
Combating Fraud and Corruption. Each of these instruments
defines the prohibited practices and prescribes mechanisms
for implementing anti-corruption measures. The Procurement
Rules prohibit the use of Bank funds to finance corruption and
the financing by the Bank of contracts corruptly procured.
The Guidelines prescribe preventive measures to be taken
throughout the lending cycle. The Uniform Framework also
prescribes preventive measures and investigation procedures.

The Bank’s anti-corruption implementation mechanisms
include the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department which
has an investigative and a preventive role, a Whistleblower
and Complaints Handling mechanism including a hotline
administered by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department,
and protection for whistleblowers.

The Bank has implemented the International Financial Institutions’

cross-debarment agreement by which it will apply the sanctions
of the other institutions and have its sanctions applied by these
institutions. A key step in this process has been the appointment of
a Sanctions Commissioner, an Alternate Sanctions Commissioner
and the members of the Sanctions Appeals Board.

Annual Report 2014Finally, the Bank is collaborating with the OECD in an ongoing
initiative to support business integrity and anti-bribery efforts
in its Regional Member Countries.

Performance Management and Monitoring

In managing its operations the Bank uses quantified performance
measures and indicators that reflect the critical success factors
in its business. These are monitored on a continuous basis
and results achieved are used to assess progress attained
against stated objectives and to inform required action in
order to improve future performance. Management uses a
wide array of measures both at the corporate and business
unit level to monitor and manage performance. Some of the
key financial measures and indicators used by management
are discussed in Table 7.3, together with their relevance to
the operations of the Bank.

Financial Results

The highlights of the Bank’s financial performance in 2014
include the following:

¢ Net interest margin (NIM) improved in 2014, largely due to the
replacement of certain matured fixed-rate interest borrowings
with lower floating-rate borrowings during the year. Interest
income from loans increased marginally. Similarly, investment
income increased during the year with the overall treasury
portfolio continuing to perform well, and sometimes above

Table 7.3 Key Financial Performance Indicators, 2014 and 2013

African Development Bank Chapter 7

the set benchmark. Net interest income increased by 12.65
percent in the year, in line with increases in gross earning
assets of 13.17 percent. Income on loans increased by 2.12
percent while income from treasury investments increased
by 4.71 percent during the period.

In 2014 the Bank earned income, before allocation and
distributions approved by the Board of Governors, of UA
151.69 million, compared to UA 180.33 million in 2013.
Adjusted for the effects of the fair valuation of borrowings
and derivatives, income before allocation and distributions
amounted to UA 181.52 million for the current year compared
to UA146.22 million in 2013. The fair valuation of borrowings
and derivatives amounted to a loss of UA 29.83 million in the
current year compared to a gain of UA 34.11 million in 2013.

Total Bank Group’s administrative expenses increased to
UA 372.10 million in 2014 from UA 337.24 million in 2013.
Total manpower expenses (excluding actuarial valuation
effects of benefit plans) increased by UA 34.44 million (15.07
percent) from UA 228.50 million in 2013 to UA 262.94
million in 2014, mainly due to the additional one-time costs
associated with the return of the Bank’s operations to its
Headquarters in Abidjan, Cdte d'Ivoire. The Bank’s share of
the total Bank Group administrative expenses amounted to
UA 123.16 million for 2014 compared to UA 110.97 million
in the previous year, an increase of 10.99 percent. Bank
Group administrative expenses are shared between the
Bank, the ADF, and the NTF, based on a predetermined

cost-sharing formula driven primarily by the relative levels
of certain operational volume indicators and relative balance
sheet size.

The Bank continues to maintain a strong capital position.
Despite the ongoing challenges in its operating environment,
the Bank continues to generate sufficient levels of income to
facilitate contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other
development initiatives in Africa. The Bank's reserves, plus
accumulated loss provisions on outstanding loan principal
and charges, stood at UA 3.19 billion at the end of 2014
compared to VA 3.21 billion at the end of 2013.

Distributions Approved by the Board of Governors

In 2014, the Board of Governors approved distributions from
the 2013 income to various development initiatives in Africa
amounting to UA 120 million. The beneficiaries of these
distributions are listed under Note N to the financial statements.
In accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies, such
distributions are reported as expenses in the year they are
approved by the Board of Governors. The Boards of Directors
have also agreed to recommend to the Board of Governors,
at its Annual Meetings in May 2015, distributions totaling UA
124 million from the 2014 income to various development
initiatives in RMCs. If approved by the Board of Governors,
such distributions and any others that may be approved by
the Board of Governors during 2015, will be reported as
expenses in the 2015 financial statements.

Control of Administrative Expenses

In order to maximize the resources available for development
financing and technical assistance activities in its member
countries, the Bank has an ongoing responsibility and
commitment to ensure maximum efficiency in the management
of its administrative and capital expenditures. Accordingly, in
the management of its administrative and capital expenses, the
Bank continues to focus on a high level of budgetary discipline,
effective cost controls and proactive cost-recovery programs.
For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Bank Group’s
general administrative expenses, excluding the expenses
related to the return of its operations to its Headquarters
in Abidjan, charges for depreciation and amortization, were
UA 321.46 million, compared to UA 334.92 million in 2013.
For 2015, the Bank’s administrative expenditure is budgeted
at UA 306.34 million. Management will continue to explore
and implement effective and transparent cost management
strategies in order to ensure that cost outcomes are effectively
tracked against the Bank’s long-term strategic objectives.

Investments

The Bank maintained a robust investment strategy in 2014,
consistent with a frequently changing global financial market
environment which has been characterized by low interest rates.

98

The Bank continued to adopt a prudent investment strategy
prioritizing capital preservation and liquidity over attempting to
generate higher income by taking on additional risks. As such,
the Bank continued to target high-quality liquid assets with
short maturities with a focus on secured investments where
possible. As a result, the credit quality and liquidity profile of
the Bank’s treasury investments remained very strong, whilst
volatility of returns was limited. During the year, the Bank’s
treasury trading portfolios benefited from a tightening of credit
spreads, a function of ample liquidity provided by the various
quantitative easing programs of the major central banks. This
has translated into mark-to-market gains, which produced
an overall outperformance against the benchmark.

The Bank’s cash and treasury investments (net of repurchase
agreements) as of December 31, 2014 totaled UA 7.35 billion,
compared to UA 7.04 billion at the end of 2013. Investment
income for 2014 amounted to UA 132.41 million or a return
of 1.62 percent on an average liquidity level of UA 8.17 billion,
compared to an income of UA 126.45 million, or a return of
1.69 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 7.50 billion
in 2013. All key portfolios at fair value outperformed their
benchmarks during the year with total investment income
generated exceeding the 2013 levels by UA 5.96 million. This
was largely due to the higher average liquidity invested in 2014
compared with 2013. The reduced return in 2014 compared
to 2013 was as a result of lower interest rates during the year.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3 portfolios, namely
operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed
portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the
cash flow and risk profile of its assets and funding sources.
These benchmarks are 1-month LIBID for the operational
portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR, resetting
on February 1 and August 1 for the prudential portfolio. The
operational and prudential portfolios are held for trading.
The equity-backed portfolio is managed against a repricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank’s net assets
repricing uniformly over a period of 10 years, and is held at
amortized cost.

Loan Portfolio

The Bank makes loans to its Regional Member Countries
and public sector enterprises guaranteed by the government.
Loans are also extended to private sector enterprises without
government guarantee.

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31,
2014 amounted to UA 32.24 billion. This is UA 1.18 billion
higher than the balance at December 31, 2013 when the
cumulative loans signed stood at UA 31.11 billion. Table 7.4
presents the evolution of loans approved, disbursed and
undisbursed balances from 2010 to 2014.

Outlook for 2015

The continuing turbulence in the global macroeconomic,
political and financial markets is expected to impact the
Bank’s financial results given their sensitivity to changes in
these domains. The Bank will continue to diligently monitor
such impacts on the volume of its lending and the timing of
repayment of its loans to ensure that it continues to deliver on
its development mandate. The new 10-year strategy of the

Bank approved in 2013 is expected to continue to shape its
interventions and operations over the ten years planning horizon
to 2022. The strategic focus on two overarching objectives
of inclusive growth and transition to green growth, with five
operational priorities including infrastructure development,
regional integration, private sector development, governance
and accountability, and skills and technology provides the
Bank with a unifying framework for effective management of
its operational activities in 2015 and beyond.

With the Bank’s move back to its statutory headquarters in

stability and therefore efficiency in the Bank’s operational set
up has been restored in the short-term. In the long term, the
completion of the move is expected to result in the stabilization of
the level of administrative expenses which spiked somewhat at
the peak of the move, particularly in 2014 and 2015. A positive
consequence of this is that the achievement of the target cost/
income ratio of 30 percent will be possible in the medium term.

Managing the Dynamics of a

Turbulent Economic Environment

The high rates of economic growth in many African countries
are expected to continue, against the backdrop of the global
economic recovery. This growth is in spite of the continued
volatility in the global financial markets and the Ebola epidemic
in West Africa. Indeed, the economic outlook for Africa remains
largely positive, with growth projected to rise from the average
of 3.9 percent in 2014 to 4.5 percent in 2015 and 5 percent
in 2016. In order to leverage the opportunities that these
economic developments provide for the growth of its support
to RMCs, the Bank must ensure that its strategic initiatives
are clearly prioritized while it also maintains focused policies
with the resilience and the flexibility necessary to deliver on
its mandate in a variety of market conditions.

Meanwhile, the Bank has taken significant steps to ensure
that it has the necessary flexibility and responsiveness to
not only sustain growth in its business operations, but that
it is also capable of meeting the other challenges that it may
encounter in the external environment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014

 

NOTE A — OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic
and social progress of its Regional Member States. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire. The Bank
finances development projects and programs in its Regional Member States, typically in cooperation with other national
or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and
preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank
also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic
and social progress of the Regional Member States. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African
Development Fund (ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund
(NTF), which is a special fund administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets
and liabilities. There is no recourse to the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was
established to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and
its operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any
obligation to pay, withhold or collect any tax or duty.

NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Bank’s individual financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies applied by the Bank in the preparation of the financial statements are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected
ife of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

Dividends are recognized in income statement when the Bank’s right to receive the dividends is established in accordance
with IAS 18 — Revenue.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised,
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies
of all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005, as it was concluded that the UA most
faithfully represented the aggregation of economic effects of events, conditions and the underlying transactions of the Bank
conducted in different currencies. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of
he Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

 

08 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into
UA at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at
historical rates. Translation differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded
in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is
reported in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the
difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When
currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has
ever withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the
membership reflects the fact that the members are African and non-African countries, committed to the purpose of the Bank
to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its Regional Member Countries individually
and jointly. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2014, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to
member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a
member, hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased
against the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct
obligations and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the
termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not
have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required
to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been
taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable on any call,
subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to respond if the
impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example,
paying a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank's financial position, the Bank could defer payment
until the risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may
be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board
of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such
distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share
of each member country.

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides
benefit payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service
and remuneration. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit
Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three
years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses as well
as the differences between expected and real returns on assets are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income
in the year they occur. When benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that
relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The pension liability is

Annual Report 2014 109Chapter 7 African Development Bank

recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank’s
defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment health care benefits
to eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement
to the post-retirement health care benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement
age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from
plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions
by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent
body created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the
contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between expected
and real return on assets are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. The medical
plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value
of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

Further details and analysis of the Bank’s employee benefits are included in Note R — Employee Benefits.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank’s balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual
rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank manages its financial assets in line with the applicable business model and, accordingly,
classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL); and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOC)). In line with
the Bank’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net
interest margin or for liquidity management. The Bank’s investments in the equity of enterprises, whether in the private or
public sector is for the promotion of economic development of its member countries and not for trading to realize fair value
changes. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost
A financial asset is classified as at “amortized cost” only if the asset meets two criteria: the objective of the Bank’s business
model is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives
embedded in debt investment are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment
of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include some loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain
debt investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Receivables comprise demand obligations,
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other amounts receivable. Loans and receivables
meeting the two criteria above are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. However,
incremental direct costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred; as such amounts are considered
insignificant. The amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

Loans that have a conversion option that could potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely
payments of principal and interest are measured at FVTPL as required by IFRS9. The fair value is determined using the
expected cash flows model with inputs including interest rates and the borrower’s credit spread estimated based on the
Bank’s internal rating methodology for non-sovereign loans.

110 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at
amortized cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes as well as certain loans for which either
of the criteria for recognition at amortized cost is not met. Gains and losses on these financial assets are reported in
the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss.

In addition, debt instruments that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A debt
instrument may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces
a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the gains
and losses on them on different bases.

iii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOC)
On initial recognition, the Bank can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments not held for trading as financial assets measured at FVTOCI.

Equity investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair
value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative
gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments and no impairments are recognized in
the profit or loss. Dividends earned from such investments are recognized in profit and loss unless the dividends clearly
represent a repayment of part of the cost of the investment.

Recognition and Derecognition of Financial Assets

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which
the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial
assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial
assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements, Securities Lent Under Securities Lending Agreements and
Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements and Payable for Cash Collateral Received

Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities lent under securities lending agreements, and securities sold under
repurchase agreements are recorded at market rates. The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements,
monitors the fair value of the securities and, if necessary, closes out transactions and enters into new repriced transactions.
The securities transferred to counterparties under the repurchase and security lending arrangements and the securities
transferred to the Bank under the resale agreements do not meet the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale. Therefore,
securities transferred under repurchase agreements and security lending arrangements are retained as assets on the Bank
balance sheet, and securities received under resale agreements are not recorded on the Bank’s balance sheet. In cases where
the Bank enters into a “reverse repo” —that is, purchases an asset and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the
same at a fixed price on a future date—a receivable from reverse repurchase agreement is recognized in the statement of
financial position and the underlying asset is not recognized in the financial statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a Known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to
maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Annual Report 2014 NMChapter 7 African Development Bank
2) Financial Liabilities

iD Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity
management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities
at fixed or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in
meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to
financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding.

In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity
management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance
sheet at amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are
recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined
using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably interest rate
and currency risks.

The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk
management policies and practices are contained in Note D to these financial statements. Certain of the Bank’s
borrowings obtained prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free
loans. In accordance with the exemption provided in the provisions of IAS 20 — Accounting for Government Grants and
Disclosure of Government Assistance, such borrowings are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable on their
due dates.

ii) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to
borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation
of the borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that
otherwise would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related
swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

In accordance with IFRS 9, fair value changes for financial liabilities that are designated as at fair value through profit or
loss, that is attributable to changes in the Bank’s “own credit” risk is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes
in fair value attributable to the Bank’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

iti) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized
cost. The amounts include certain borrowings, accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and
hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings
are used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is
established on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component
of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

The Bank classifies all derivatives at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the

criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in the income statement.

112 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

The Bank assesses its hybrid financial assets (i.e. the combined financial asset host and embedded derivative) in its entirety
to determine their classification. A hybrid financial asset is measured at amortized cost if the combined cash flows represent
solely principal and interest on the outstanding principal; otherwise it is measured at fair value. As at December 31, 2014,
the Bank had hybrid financial assets that were measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9.

Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics were not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract was not carried at
fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and
measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Hedge Accounting

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge the interest rate risk exposure
associated with its fixed rate loans. Under fair value hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the income statement.

At inception of the hedge, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Bank documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when
the Bank’s risk management objective for the hedging relationship has changed, when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value adjustment to
the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.

Impairment of Financial Assets

Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group
of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective
assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if,
and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition
of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the
asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated
impairment representing present value losses arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due. For
non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management’s best estimate of the non-collectability, in whole or
in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement. If a loan or investment carried at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are
accrued on all loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease,
the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

Annual Report 2014 113Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a current legally enforceable right to
offset the recognized amounts. A current legally enforceable right exists if the right is not contingent on a future event and
is enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and
all counterparties and there is an intention on the part of the Bank to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously. The Bank discloses all recognized financial instruments that are set off and those subject to an
enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset. Information relating
to financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangement is provided in Note D.

Fair Value Disclosure

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions
onan arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market
might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are
few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may
not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore
may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily
determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in active
markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments the Bank measures
fair values using other valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.

The objective of the valuation techniques applied by the Bank is to arrive at a reliable fair value measurement.

Other valuation techniques include net present value, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, comparison
to similar instruments for which market observable prices exists and other valuation models commonly used by market
participants. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk free and benchmark interest rates, credit
spreads and other premiums used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates
and expected price volatilities and correlations.

The Bank uses widely recognized valuation models for measuring the fair value of common and more simple financial
instruments, like interest rate and currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little management judgment
and estimation. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgment and
estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with the measurement of fair value. Observable market prices and
inputs available vary depending on the products and markets and are subject to changes based on specific events and
general conditions in the financial markets.

Where the Bank measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of net exposures, it applies judgment
in determining appropriate portfolio level adjustments such as bid-ask spread. Such judgments are derived from observable
bid-ask spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the measurement of fair value:

Level 7: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data. Included in this category are instruments valued using: quoted market prices

in active markets for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less
than active, or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.

114 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which significant input is not based on observable market data and the unobservable
inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. Instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices for
similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between
the instruments are included in this category.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety is determined on the
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance
of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs
that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. A valuation
input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling
external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in measuring the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit
spread. Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties
for the Bank’s new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation
techniques to value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates,
yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews.
When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate adjustments are
made to the relevant observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best measure of the price at which the Bank could have
sold the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

For borrowings on which the Bank has elected fair value option, the portion of fair value changes on the valuation of borrowings
relating to the credit risk of the Bank is reported in Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IFRS 9.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments are periodically fair valued by
fund managers or independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises is
based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate
methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is measured as the Bank’s
percentage ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when
possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation
tools based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The
models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial
models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its sovereign loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for these loans. The Bank’s
loan assets, except for those at fair value, are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost. The fair value of loans carried
at amortized cost are reported in these financial statements for disclosure purposes only and represents Management's best
measures of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. The fair valuation of loans has been measured
using a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates in the relevant currency including impairment,
when applicable, and credit spreads for non-sovereign loans. In arriving at its best estimate Management makes certain
assumptions about the unobservable inputs to the model, the significant ones of which is the expected cash flows and the
discount rate. These are regularly assessed for reasonableness and impact on the fair value of loans. An increase in the level of

Annual Report 2014 115Chapter 7 African Development Bank

forcast cash flows in subsequent periods would lead to an increase in the fair value and an increase in the discount rate used
to discount the forcast cash flows would lead to a decrease in the fair value of loans. Changes in fair value of loans carried at
fair value through profit and loss are reported in the income statement. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note |.

Valuation Processes Applied by the Bank
The fair value measurements of all qualifying treasury investments, borrowings, loans and equity investments are reported to
and reviewed by the Assets & Liabilities Committee (ALCO) in line with the Bank’s financial reporting policies.

Where third-party information from brokers or pricing experts are used to measure fair value, documents are independently
assessed and the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusions.

The assessment and documentation involves ensuring that (i) the broker or pricing service provider is duly approved for use in
pricing the relevant type of financial instrument, (ii) the fair value arrived at reasonably represents actual market transactions,
(iii) where prices for similar instruments have been adopted, that the same have been, where necessary, adjusted to reflect
the characteristics of the instrument subject to measurement and where a number of quotes for the same financial instrument
have been obtained, fair value has been properly determined using those quotes.

Day One Profit and Loss

The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is based on fair value as defined under IFRS 13. A gain or loss may
only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison
with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based
on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss
may not be recognized when using a fair value which is not defined under IFRS 13. The Bank only recognizes gains or losses
after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would
consider in setting a price.

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is not based on quoted
prices in an active market at the measurement date. Such financial instruments are initially recognized at the transaction
price, although the value obtained from the relevant market participants may differ. The difference between the transaction
price and the fair value measurement that is not evidenced by a quoted price in an active market or by a valuation technique
that uses only observable market data, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized over the
life of the transaction; or (b) deferred until the instrument's fair value can be measured using market observable inputs or is
realized through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day
one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate
reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant
influence are considered associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence,
but not control, over the entity’s financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is
described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased
or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's
share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the investor’s income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to
the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2014, such subscriptions cumulatively represented
less than 1 percent of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF.

Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972,
IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in accordance
with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity
method are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

116 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized as a separate
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the
cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

¢ Buildings: 15-20 years

e Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

¢ Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
¢ Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of
the asset's fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference
between proceeds and the asset’s carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. An intangible asset
is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits
attributable to it will flow to the Bank. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write
down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other
member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the
lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required
to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Allocations and Distributions of Income Approved by the Board of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations
from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from
prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of distribution
for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses on the Income
Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously
transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts
allocated to surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income,
and expenses recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, Management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances.

Annual Report 2014 V7Chapter 7 African Development Bank
The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories.
Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Fair Value through Profit and Loss — In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank
has determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Amortized Cost and Embedded Derivatives — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 9 on classifying financial assets and
those with embedded derivatives in their entirety as at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss. In making this
judgment, the Bank considers whether the cash flows of the financial asset are solely payment of principal and interest on
the principal outstanding and classifies the qualifying asset accordingly without separating the derivative.

Consolidation — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 10 in ascertaining if there are any entities that it controls, and that
may require consolidation.

2) Significant Estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost — At each financial statements reporting date, the
Bank reviews its financial assets measured at amortized cost for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective
evidence of impairment exists for individual assets. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting
expected future cash flows using the asset’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the asset's net
carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired assets requires significant judgment.
If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed asset, that asset is
included in a group of assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence
of impairment for a group of assets may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the
payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in
the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and
objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology
and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any
differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models
are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation
models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations
require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value
of financial instruments. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. The determination of what constitutes “observable” requires
significant judgment by the Bank.

Post-employment Benefits — The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial
assumptions used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate
and other variables to be used to determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations. The discount rate is
based on market yields at the end of the year of high-quality corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the Bank’s UA,
and the estimates for the other variables are based on the bank best judgment.

118 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Events After the Reporting Period
The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date, but do not result in an adjustment of the
financial statements themselves, are disclosed.

Reclassification and Restatement
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C — THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

The Bank early adopted in 2013 the revisions to IAS 32 which became effective on January 1, 2014. The revisions clarified
the circumstances in which netting is permitted; in particular what constitutes a currently legally enforceable right of offset
and the circumstances in which gross settlement systems may be considered equivalent to net settlement. The application
has no impact on the financial position of the Bank as the amendments merely clarify the offsetting criteria and how these
are to be applied in practice.

Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Issued but not yet effective

At the date of issue of these financial statements, a new and amended International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 9
was not yet effective for application and had not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The new standard
which is expected to be relevant to the Bank is discussed briefly below:

IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
The final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued on July 24, 2014 and is effective for annual periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2018. The revisions in this standard introduce a third classification and measurement category for
financial assets, require the expected credit loss impairment model in place of the IAS 39 incurred loss model and some
revisions to hedge accounting.

Although preliminary indications are that the Bank will be affected by the new standard, the Bank is still assessing the full
impact of this new pronouncement on its financial position and performance.

The Bank has already adopted phase 1 of the IFRS 9 with effect from January 1, 2011.

No other new or revised financial reporting standard, applicable to the Bank, became effective in 2014.

NOTE D — RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty
risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

Risk Governance and Risk Appetite

The highest level of risk management oversight in the Bank is assured by the Board of Executive Directors, which is chaired by
the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving
all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Bank’s risk profiles and performance to
ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

Annual Report 2014 119Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Three management level committees perform monitoring and oversight roles: the Asset and Liability Management Committee
(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control
organ of the Bank’s finance and treasury risk management activities. It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on
finance and treasury risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance. The Credit Risk Committee
(CRC) ensures effective implementation of the Bank’s credit policies and oversees all credit risk issues related to sovereign
and non-sovereign operations, prior to their submission to OPSCOM. OPSCOM is chaired by the First Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer and reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The ALCO, CRC and OPSCOM meet on a regular basis to perform their respective oversight roles. Among other functions,
the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and treasury risk management reports and financial projections and approves
proposed strategies to manage the Bank’s balance sheet. The Credit Risk Committee is responsible for end-to-end credit risk
governance, credit assessments, portfolio monitoring and rating change approval amongst other responsibilities. ALCO and
CRC are supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign
credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

In late 2013, a Group Chief Risk Officer position was created reporting directly to the President of the Bank. Day-to-day
operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines are delegated
to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department and the office of the Group Chief Risk Officer are
responsible for monitoring the day to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity.
This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank’s capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent
risk profile consistent with the highest credit rating. The Bank allocates its risk capital between non-core risks (10 percent),
with sovereign and non-sovereign operations sharing equally the remaining balance (45 percent each).

Policy Framework

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market,
credit, product, and other developments. The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its risks are governed by the
Bank’s Capital Adequacy Policy, the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority), the General Authority
on the Bank’s Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority) and the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.
The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
he Bank’s financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for
managing the Bank's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.
The ALM Authority covers the Bank's entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid
resources, including the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity investment
operations.

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services
or its borrowers and separate guidelines prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for
he Bank's sovereign and non-sovereign loan, guarantee and equity investment portfolios.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more
detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee
(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM).

 

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the different sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

120 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
for financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising
essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk in its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign
credit risk in its portfolio of non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk in its portfolio of treasury
investments and derivative transactions used for asset and liability management purposes. These risks are managed within an

integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the sections that follow.

The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk before collateral received or other credit enhancements for 2014 and 2013 is
as follows:

Equity participations 645,288 574,656
Other securities 94,111 82,901

 

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from
the borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, the Bank is exposed to country risk which includes
potential losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages
country credit risk through its policies related to the quality at entry of project proposals, exposure management, including
individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These include the assessment of the
country’s risk profile as determined by its macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political conditions and
the conduciveness of its business environment.

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management is a systematic credit risk assessment framework, through underlying
models and their associated risk factors that have been optimized to ensure more predictive power of the rating parameters
and to better align with widely-used rating scales and ensure consistency with best practices. The credit risk assessment is
measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale, optimized to provide: (i) increased granularity; (ii) better differentiation
between obligors; (iii) smoother grade distribution to alleviate the current grade concentration; and finally (iv) to create a
common framework when communicating credit risks to risks takers. The level of granularity helps in measuring probabilities
of default in order to better differentiate between obligors.

129 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

The credit ratings at the sovereign level are derived from a risk assessment of five risk indices that include macroeconomic
performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and the Bank’s portfolio performance. These
five risk indices are combined to derive a composite country risk index for both sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. The
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and
other specialized international organizations. The CRC reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they
reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The CRC also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their
country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if required.

The following table presents the Bank’s internal measurement scales compared with the international rating scales:

Annual Report 2014 193Chapter 7 African Development Bank

It is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
80 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to
the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore,
for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue
amounts have been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.5 percent
on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on
non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their debts to the Bank on a
timely basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate
with the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential Expected Losses (EL) and Unexpected Losses (UL) related to credit, the Bank maintains a prudent risk
capital cushion for credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for
public sector and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities
(guarantees and client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private
sector operations which have a higher probability of default and loss-given default than public sector operations. At the end of
December 2014, the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio used up to 32.8 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital based on the
Bank's capital adequacy framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital net of exchange adjustments,
plus accumulated reserves. Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers and to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees.
The Bank may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a
sovereign guarantee.

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses several models to assess the risk of every
project at entry. The models are tailored to the specific characteristics and nature of the transactions. The result of the credit
risk assessment is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale as described above.

Non-sovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) project finance; b) financial institutions;
and c) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of predetermined critical factors.

a) Project Finance
The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower's financial strength. This assesses:

Primarily, i) the capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating performance
and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project
company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project
company’s management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the
information on which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

b) Financial Institutions

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model: i) Capital
adequacy—analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution’s capital; ii) Asset quality, operating policies
and procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision-making framework; iv) Earnings and
market position—an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy—an assessment
focusing on the entity’s ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk—an assessment of the impact of
interest rate changes and exchange rate fluctuations.

194 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

c) Private Equity Funds
The assessment of Private Equity Funds takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

¢ Financial strength and historic fund performance;
¢ Investment strategy and risk management;

¢ Industry structure;

¢ Management and corporate governance; and

¢ Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require an initial credit rating and undergo a rigorous project approval process. The NonSovereign Working Group of the CRC reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may
recommend changes for approval by CRC if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its non-sovereign loan and equity exposures. The weighted-average risk rating
was 3.73 at the end of 2014 compared to 3.58 at the end of 2013. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across

the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

Risk Profile of the Outstanding Non-Sovereign Loan and Equity Portfolio

 

 

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2014 31% 21% 31% 14% 3%
2013 36% 17% 31% 14% 2%
2012 33% 19% 36% 9% 3%
2011 36% 20% 35% 5% 4%
2010 24% 20% 30% 24% 2%
2009 27% 18% 28% 24% 3%

 

In compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing nonsovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit
impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2014, the cumulative impairment allowance to cover the incurred
loss on impaired loan principal in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 55.39 million compared to UA 52.49 million in 2013.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk
capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from Basel Il Advanced Internal Rating-Based Approach (IRB). At
the end of December 2014, the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 22.2 percent of the
Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 45 percent determined by the Bank
for total non-sovereign operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, equity participations required as risk capital
approximately 9.1 percent of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This is still below the statutory limit of
15 percent established by the Board of Governors for equity participations.

Credit Exposure Limits

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given
point in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign-guaranteed and nonsovereign portfolios) by ensuring that in aggregate, the total exposure to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the
Bank’s total risk capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s
capital adequacy framework.

Annual Report 2014 25Chapter 7 African Development Bank

In the revised capital adequacy and exposure management approved by the Board in May 2011, the 15 percent (of the
Bank's total risk capital) global country concentration limit is meant to allow for adequate portfolio diversification.

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit with regard
to the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of
collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, and beyond its development related exposures, the Bank utilizes various financial
instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates,
and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying
degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Given the nature
of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk; however, the Bank minimizes this
risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards,
counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Bank’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for
Finance. For local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate
availability of investment opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies.
The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored for compliance with established criteria.

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral

originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/
MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of
acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Bank may also invest in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized
securities repurchase agreements.

The Bank uses derivatives in the management of its borrowing portfolio and for asset and liability management purposes.
As a rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to
undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating
agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Lower rated
counterparties may be used exceptionally for local currency transactions. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to the minimum rating requirements for derivative counterparties, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure
limits to different counterparties based on their credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of the Bank’s total
risk capital (equity and reserves) for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across
all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored
regularly against the Bank’s credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

Annual Report 2014 97Chapter 7 African Development Bank

The credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolios continues to be dominated by highly rated counterparties as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA-rated entities decreased from the previous year as
a result of the downgrade of some agencies.

Credit Risk Profile of the Investment and Derivative Portfolios

2010 69% 24% 71%
2009 65% 25% 10%

 

The Bank’s exposure to the stressed Eurozone economies remains very limited at approximately UA 0.5 million or less than
0.1 percent of the portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative
risk capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2014, the
Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 2.1 percent
of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity
risk arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management
objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon
without additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank maintains
a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling 1-year period. The PML
is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net
loan disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of commit-ted guarantees;
and 4) undisbursed equity investments.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to
meet the Bank’s short-term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are
included in the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the
Bank maintains a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to
cover its expected medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s
equity resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective
of stabilizing the Bank’s net income. In determining its level of liquidity for compliance with the PML, the Bank includes cash,
deposits and securities in all the treasury investments, with appropriate hair-cuts based on asset class and credit rating.

Annual Report 2014 129Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in
its risk-bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation
risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the
currency composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency
exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is
achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which
they were borrowed (after-swap activities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to
service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are reported in Units of Account (equivalent
to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates
fluctuate. The Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by
matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. In keeping
with the Bank’s currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to realign the net assets to the
SDR basket each time there is a misalignment or when there is a revision to the SDR currency composition.

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The

distribution of the currencies of the Bank’s recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in
Euros, US Dollars and Tunisian Dinar.

Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible,
the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four
currencies, namely the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is
determined and reviewed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) every five years and the last revision became effective on
January 1, 2011 based on the value of exports of goods and services and international reserves. The SDR rate represents
the sum of specific amounts of the four basket currencies valued in US dollars, on the basis of the exchange rates quoted
at noon each day in the London market.

Currency risks arise with the uncertainty about the potential future movement of the exchange rates between these currencies
on the one hand, and between the exchange rates of the SDR currencies and the other non-SDR currencies (mainly African
currencies) used by the Bank on the other hand. In this regard, the Bank carries out an annual sensitivity analysis of the
translation results of its net assets with regard to the movement of the different exchange rates. The analysis consists of a
set of scenarios where the exchange rates between the US dollar and the other SDR and African currencies are stretched
out by large margins (10 percent appreciation/depreciation).

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange
rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown
assumes a separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a
moderate change in the African currency holdings the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/depreciation
of each African currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank
shows a minimal change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

Interest Rate Risk
The Bank's interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1. the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding
such assets; and

2. the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank’s principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not
overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Annual Report 2014 137Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt

Two thirds of the Bank’s interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest
margin on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the
corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the
average cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating
rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates.
The cost of funds pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s pool-based loans has
traditionally helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view
of declining demand for this product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding
down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (marketbased loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the
interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank
may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of
its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market
risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio
tranche. The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different
business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity
policy and uses a 6-month Libor floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected
operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all
new borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard 6-month Libor rate reference. Where
the Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the
desired 6-month Libor-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one
alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by: (i) limiting the
amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio; and
(ii) trying to match the average maturity of loans priced with a fixed spread with borrowing with similar lifetime.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant
portion of the Bank’s assets with equity resources. These assets are mostly made up of fixed rate loans and investments with
a lifetime of 10 years. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank’s equity resources (the SDR) affect the
net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower lending
and investment rates, which in the long term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the
sensitivity of the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the
repricing profile of the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing
profile benchmark. The Bank’s repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s
assets is funded by equity and repriced in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest margin on assets funded
by equity tends to track a 10-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

At the end of 2013 and 2014, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual
buckets.

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity
A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain in income statement of UA 5.96
million and UA 5.66 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Fair Value Sensitivity

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial
statements at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100
bps of each of the currencies in the investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2014
and 2013, respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity
analysis in 2014 and 2013 for assets andi liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield
curve of +/- 10 bps.

Fair-valued borrowings and derivative portfolios (149,845) (149,795) 122,221 149,428

 

Prepayment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans
committed before 1997 on which the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty. In practice the level of prepayments
on such loans has generally been within acceptable levels. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects
itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates.
Since 2006, total annual prepayments on loans particularly those committed prior to 1997 have been declining over the
years. Prepayments in 2014 amounted to UA 50.59 million compared to prepayments of UA 96.73 million realized in 2013,
none of which related to loans committed prior to 1997.

Operational Risk
Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes.

Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems,
and from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse reputational impact. Operational risk is present
in virtually all the Bank’s transactions and includes losses attributable to failures of internal processes in credit and market
operations.

The office of the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) of the Bank is responsible for implementing the Integrated Internal Control
Framework (IICF) which consists of two phases. Phase one relates to the implementation of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting (ICFR) based on the COSO Framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of
the Bank's internal controls in all significant business processes with financial statement impact. As part of this process,
Management’s attestation on the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s annual report.

 

Phase two of the IICF entails the implementation of Operational Risk Management Framework which is intended to address
risks inherent in other business processes not covered by ICFR. The Operational Risk Management Framework (ORM) was
approved by the Board of Directors in March 2012 as the first step in addressing risks related to business processes and
the implementation process is ongoing. Full implementation of ORM will ensure a structured and well-coordinated approach
to risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation and control as well as risk reporting across the Bank. It will also provide
the basis for applying advanced measurement approach in measuring operational risk capital. Currently, the Bank’s Capital
Adequacy and Exposure Management Framework provides for an operational risk capital charge of 15 percent of the average
operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basel Il recommendations for operational risk.

Annual Report 2014 139Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Itis the primary responsibility of the management of each business unit to implement adequate controls in their respective business
processes based on the prevailing institutional standards. Management is required to sign attestation of compliance annually.

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General
of the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with
summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect
the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and non-borrowing),
bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in its office locations.
Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive Crisis Committee, chaired
by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from the Operations Crisis
Committee (OCC); (ii) the OCC, chaired by the Corporate Vice President, that closely monitors all developments affecting
the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate the relevant risks; and (iii) the business continuity Unit (BCPU)
that follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is also responsible for periodic tests of the overall business
continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management practices include compliance with the Code of conduct and staff
rules, the work of the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department (IACD) and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

The Bank’s policy is to recognize transfers out of level 3 as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused
the transfer.

Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1,

include active listed equities, exchange-traded derivatives, US government treasury bills and certain non-US sovereign
obligations. The Bank does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.

Annual Report 2014 141Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices,
dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2.These include
investment-grade corporate bonds and certain non-US sovereign obligations, listed equities, over-the-counter derivatives
and a convertible loan. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets and/or are subject to
transfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on
available market information.

Investments classified within Level 3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade infrequently or do not trade at all.
Instruments in Level 3 include loans to Regional Member Countries, private equity and corporate debt securities including
some structured asset and mortgage backed instruments. As observable prices are not available for these securities, the
Bank has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value. However, as noted earlier, the fair values for loans and some
securities are derived merely for disclosure purposes rather than for reporting on the balance sheet.

The primary products classified at Level 3 are as follows:

Debt Securities — Asset and Mortgage-Backed Securities

Due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded,
obtaining external prices is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not.
Therefore, once external pricing has been verified, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant
liquidity based on its credit rating and sector. If a security is of low credit rating and/or is traded in a less liquid sector, it will
be classified as Level 3. Where third party pricing is not available, the valuation of the security will be estimated from market
standard cash flow models with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount
margins derived from comparable securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings. These securities are also
classified as Level 3.

Equity Shares — Private Equity

The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows
or net asset value (NAV). The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated as the Bank’s percentage ownership
of the net asset value of the investments.

Derivatives

Trading derivatives are classified at Level 3 if there are parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products
where the performance is linked to more than one underlying. Examples are derivative transactions and derivatives attached
to local currency transactions. These unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market, through
methods such as historical analysis and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data.

Quantitative Information about Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)

The table below shows the valuation techniques used in the determination of fair values for financial assets within level 3 of
the measurement hierarchy as well as the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation models. The Bank has determined
that market participants would use the same inputs in pricing the financial instruments. Management considers that changing
the unobservable inputs described below to reflect other reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not result ina
significant change in the estimated fair value.

Significant Unobservable Inputs
Although the Bank believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions
could lead to different fair value results.

The valuation techniques applied with significant unobservable inputs are described briefly below:

Comparable Pricing

Comparable pricing refers to the method where valuation is done by calculating an implied yield from the price of a similar
comparable observable instrument. The comparable instrument for a private equity investment is a comparable listed company.
The comparable instrument in case of bonds is a similar comparable but observable bond. This may involve adjusting the
yield to derive a value for the unobservable instrument.

Yield

Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash flows in a discounted cash-flow model.

Correlation

Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. Credit correlation
generally refers to the factor that describes the relationship between the probability of individual entities to default on obligations
and the joint probability of multiple entities to default on obligations. Similarly, equity correlation is the correlation between two
equity instruments. An interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates. FX correlation represents
the correlation between two different exchange rates.

144 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Liquidity Discount
A liquidity discount is primarily applied to unlisted firms to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase
in liquidity discount in isolation will result in unfavorable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm.

Volatility

Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or Index will change in value over time.
Volatilities are generally implied from the observed option prices. For certain instruments, volatility may change with strike
and maturity profile of the option.

Credit Spreads
Credit spreads represent the additional yield that a market participant would demand for accepting an exposure to the credit
risk of an instrument. A change in the assumptions could lead to different fair value results.

Sensitivity Analysis of Valuations of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Using Unobservable Inputs
For fair value measurements in level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used would have the following effects:

Investments
The fair value of level 3 investments is sensitive to sources of pricing used. The fair value variance arising from using other
sources of prices amounted to UA 0.01 million or 0.002 percent. (2013: UA 0.25 million or 0.14 percent).

Borrowings and Derivatives

The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of the currencies in the level
3 borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. However, due to the low level of interest rates
across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2014 and 2013 for liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen
reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps:

NOTE F — TREASURY INVESTMENTS

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government, agency, supranational, bank and
corporate obligations, time deposits, mortgage and asset-backed securities, funded risk participation program, secured
lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, cross-currency
swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

Annual Report 2014 145Chapter 7 African Development Bank

For government, agency and supranational obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank
may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by
governments of member countries or other official entities with the same rating criteria. For maturities beyond 15 years and
up to 30 years, a AAA rating is required. For mortgage and asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities
with a AAA credit rating. For bank and corporate obligations with final maturity longer than 6 months and less than 5 years,
the Bank may only invest with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA-. AAA rating is required for debt obligations
beyond 5 years and up to 10 years. The purchases of currency or interest rate options are permitted only if the life of the option
contract does not exceed 1 year. Such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above.
All derivative transactions, including options, cross-currency and interest rate swaps including asset swap transactions, are
only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with which the Bank has entered into Master Derivative
Agreements and a Collateral Support Agreement with minimum credit ratings of A-/A3 at the time of the transaction.

As at December 31, 2014, the Bank had received collateral with fair value of UA 455 million in connection with swap
agreements. Of this amount, a total UA 257 million was in the form of cash and has been recorded on the balance sheet
with a corresponding liability included in “Other accounts payable”. The balance of UA 198 million was in the form of liquid
financial assets and is kept in custody by the Bank.

Loan Swaps
The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into
variable rate income.

Futures Contracts

The Bank has entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at December 31,
2014, the Bank had 3,640 contracts in Euro and 14,755 contracts in US Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one
million of each currency unit, except for 200 contracts with a nominal value of Euro 100,000 for each contract.

Forward Exchange Transactions to Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of
the principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP, TND and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed
forward exchange transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2014 there were no
open positions with respect to forward exchange transactions.

148 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Hedge Accounting

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge its interest rate risk exposure
associated to fixed rate loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments are recognized in profit or
loss. The hedged item is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with the gain or loss
attributable to the hedged risk being recognized in profit or loss.

The fair value of the loan swaps designated and effective as hedging instruments as at December 31, 2014 was a liability of
UA 145.48 million. The fair value loss on these loan swaps for the year ended December 31, 2014 was UA 76.52 million. The
fair value gain on the hedged loans attributable to the hedged risk was UA 77.31 million. Therefore, the hedge ineffectiveness
recognized in profit or loss was a gain of UA 0.78 million.

Hedge accounting treatment for swaps at the designation date requires the amortization of the difference between the net
carrying amount of loans and their fair value from inception. For 2014, the amortization of fair value adjustment on the hedged
risk amounted to UA 5.17 million.

NOTE H — NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the
capital increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following
two options for making their payments:

1. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in
local currency; or

2. Five (6) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments
commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to
the Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes
of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency
in five (5) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely
convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and
consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second
to the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution B/
BG/2010/08 of May 27, 2010 each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund only
shall pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while
Middle Income Countries, Blend countries and Non-Regional Member Countries shall pay for the paid-up portion of their
respective subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments.

Annual Report 2014 149Chapter 7 African Development Bank

Payments for shares under GCI-VI are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes encashable
on or before the due date for payment.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the non-negotiable notes’ balances were as follows:

NOTE | - LOANS AND GUARANTEES

Loans

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain
other non-sovereign-guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed
by the Bank or in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of
these currencies shall be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period
of 20 years, including a grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of
financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe
there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the terms applicable are described below:

Loan Portfolio: The Bank’s loan portfolio is currently made up of three primary types of loans based on the financial
terms: fixed rate, floating rate and variable rate loans. Fixed rate and variable rate loans have both multi-currency and
single currency terms—that is, offered in multi-currency or in a single currency. While floating rate loans only bear single
currency terms.

Other Loans: The Bank also offers parallel co-financing and A/B loan syndications. Through syndications the Bank is
able to mobilize co-financing by transferring some or all of the risks associated with its loans and guarantees to other
financing partners. Thus, syndications decrease and diversify the risk profile of the Bank’s financing portfolio. Syndications
may be on a funded or unfunded basis and may be arranged on an individual, portfolio, or any other basis consistent
with industry practices.

The Bank also offers its RMCs local currency loans if the Bank is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The local
currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loan pricing framework with a “cost-pass-through” principle to ensure that

the overall cost of funds is compensated.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, outstanding loans were as follows:

The Bank is exposed to a loan that is measured at FVTPL due to the existence of a conversion option in the loan that could
potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely payments of principal and interest as required by
IFRS 9. Accordingly, the fair value of this loan, and similar loans, is determined using the expected cash flows model with
inputs including interest rates and the borrower's credit spread estimated based on the Bank’s internal rating methodology
for non-sovereign loans.

guaranteed for an entity are not made. Guarantees provided by the Bank outstanding at December 31, 2014 amounted to
UA 164.11 million (2013: UA 73.78 million).

NOTE J — EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social
development of African countries, to promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the African
countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were
provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the
Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of
Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and
7 members selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of
representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays
a share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated
annually on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the
number of programs and projects executed during the period. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative
expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December 31, 2014 amounted to UA 248.57 million (2013: UA 225.87 million),
representing 67.32 percent (2013: 68.69 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The
accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

154 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata
to its participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any
outstanding claims against the participants. At December 31, 2014, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.51
percent (2013: 0.54 percent).

Notwithstanding the exercise of 50 percent voting power in the Fund by the Bank, the conditions for control under IFRS 10,
Consolidated Financial Statements, are not met since the Bank does not have absolute voting interest to control ADF, no
rights to variable returns from its relationship with ADF and has an economic interest of less than 1 percent in the Fund.
Consequently, the Fund cannot be consolidated in the Bank’s Financial Statements.

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note V-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss
on the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand
obligations plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC
completion points and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector
companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in
such equity investments is to promote the economic development of its Regional Member Countries and in particular the
development of their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources,
promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of
domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests, but
closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2009/10 of May 13, 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate
amount of the Bank’s paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

Under IFRS 9 equity investments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, where the equity investment
is not held for trading, an entity has the option to take fair value changes into other comprehensive income (OCI), with no
recycling of the change in fair value to profit or loss if the investment is subsequently derecognized. As the Bank’s equity
investments are currently held for strategic purposes of enhancing development in Regional Member Countries rather than
for trading, the Bank has opted to designate all its equity investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The land on which the HQ building stands was originally granted for the unlimited use by the Bank, but with ownership
retained by the Government of Céte d’lvoire. However, in 2013 the Government of Céte d'Ivoire agreed to transfer the title
to the land to the Bank and the relevant processes to perfect the transfer of title to the Bank are underway.

NOTE M — BORROWINGS

As at December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Bank’s borrowings were as follows:

 

 

(UA millions)

2014 2013
Borrowings at fair value 13,481.63 12,127.91
Borrowings at amortized cost 894.32 819.53
Total 14,375.95 12,947.44

 

The Bank’s borrowings as at December 31, 2014 included subordinated borrowings in the amount of UA 489.33 million

(2013: UA 462.20 million).

The capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors adopted the use of a single debt to usable capital ratio
to monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank’s total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable capital. Usable
capital comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s
usable capital at December 31, 2014 was UA 27.60 billion.

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities

and to lower its funding costs.

158

Annual Report 2014Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified
dates prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put
dates, rather than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain
outstanding beyond their earliest indicated redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from
borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange
of the two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which

African Development Bank Chapter 7

transform a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

A summary of the Bank’s borrowings portfolio at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2014 was UA 13,481.63 million
(2013: UA 12,127.91 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at
December 31, 2014 was UA 13,452.87 million (2013: UA 12,499.58 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is
equivalent to the notional amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net loss of UA 36.73 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended
December 31, 2014 (2013: net gain of UA 46.82 million). The fair value loss attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit
risk included in the other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2014 was UA 32.14 million (2013 : gain
of UA 46.08 million).

Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows
or the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid markets
ior ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread was
not applied for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than 1-year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2014, the cumulative unrealized fair value
losses to date were UA 828.27 million (2013: losses of UA 611.04 million).

 

NOTE N — EQUITY

Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS).
The Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase
and the six General Capital Increases (GCI) made so far. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board
of Governors of the Bank on May 29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states
and entry into force of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized
capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share.
The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%)
paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional members
such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and non-regional
members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

162 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Prior to the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board of
Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to UA 22,120
million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. The membership
of these two countries became effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement establishing the Bank
and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional countries to Membership of the Bank. Consequently, on
October 29, 2013 and May 29, 2014, the Republic Turkey and The Grand Duchy Luxembourg respectively were formally
admitted as the 78th and 79th member countries of the Bank.

In 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea offering to subscribe, temporarily,
to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and UA 0.19 billion, respectively. This
proposal was adopted by the Board of Governors on February 22, 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of the
Bank increased from UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710 non-voting shares. These
non-voting callable shares were to be absorbed by the subscriptions of Canada and the Republic of Korea to GCI-VI when
they become effective.

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 27, 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital
stock of the Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares
created are to be allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the
regional group shall hold 60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The new
shares and the previous ones described above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of 6 percent
paid-up shares and 94 percent callable shares.

Upon conclusion of the GCI VI capital increase and following the Board of Governors’ resolutions, the temporary non-voting
callable shares of Canada and Korea described above were effectively retired in 2011 and 2012, respectively thereby reducing
the authorized capital of the Bank for each of these periods by 163,296 and 19,414.

Following its Resolution B/BG/2012/04 of May 31, 2012, the Board of Governors authorized a Special Capital Increase
of the authorized share capital of the Bank to allow for: (i) subscription by a new regional member country (the Republic
of South Sudan) of the minimum number of shares required for it to become a member; and (ii) the resulting subscription
by non-regional members of the number of shares necessary to comply with the 60/40 ratio requirement between the
shareholding of regional and non-regional members. Accordingly, the Board of Governors, decided to increase the authorized
capital of the Bank by the creation of 111,469 new shares, out of which 66,881 shall be available for subscription by the
Republic of South Sudan, and 44,588, shall be available for subscription by non-regional members. In 2014, by Resolution
B/BG/2014/02, the Board of Governors revised down to 33,895 shares the initial subscription of South Sudan, in line with
its IMF quota. The additional shares are subject to the same terms and conditions as the shares authorized in the GCI-VI.
The membership of the Republic of South Sudan shall become effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the
Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Regional Countries to Membership of
the Bank. As at December 31, 2014, such formalities had not been completed.

The Bank's capital as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 1,841.83 million at December 31, 2014 was an amount of UA 38.83 million
representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83
million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the
Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states
of the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling
certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of
December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the
pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be
reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules.
The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response
from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to
interested non-Regional Member States and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one
of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s
Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia.
The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the Non-Regional Member
Countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, and subsequent capital increase payments by regional
and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represented the
value of the US Dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on July 1,
1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA when
received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

 

 

 

(UA thousands)

Reserves

Reserves consist of retained earnings, fair value gains/losses on investments designated at fair value through other comprehensive
income, gains/losses on fair-valued borrowings arising from “own credit” and remeasurements of defined liability.

NOTE Q — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred for the operations of the Bank and those incurred on behalf of
the ADF and the NTF. The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on
an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational
expenses and relative balance sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall
not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s gross income.

year. Leases may be extended for periods that are not longer than the original term of the leases.

NOTE R — EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30,
1989, became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed
by the Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon
completion of 6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees.
In November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the
calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the
SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. Also, new members from the Field Offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007. Accordingly the
associated past service costs associated with these changes were reported in the financial statements of respective years.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior
service cost of UA 8.12 million, which was immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate
of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has
been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on
the results of annual actuarial valuations.

170 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the mandatory staff retirement age in the Bank from 60 to 62
years effective January 1, 2012. Participants of the Plan as of May 11, 2011 were given up to December 31, 2012 to make
the election on either to retire at 60 years with no penalty for early retirement or accept the extension and retire at age 62.
The option to retire at age 60 is not available to staff joining the Bank from January 1, 2012, the date of effectiveness of the
change. Most of the existing participants opted for the revised retirement age. The impact of the change on the actuarial
valuation of SRP was a curtailment of UA 10.90 million and was reported in the financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2011.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes
other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or for the satisfaction of the
SFP’s liabilities. At December 31, 2014, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these
were invested in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio—to track as closely as possible, the returns
of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated
future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio—to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index
as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Post-Employment Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of
July 17, 2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees
contribute a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but
may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

Contribution rates by staff members and retirees are based on marital status and number of eligible children. An MBP board,
composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management
and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance
with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making
claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependents.

The pension and post-employment medical benefit expenses for 2014 and 2013 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined
(the Bank Group) comprised the following:

Assumptions used in the latest available actuarial valuations at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

 

 

(Percentages)
Staff Retirement Plan Medical Benefit Plan
2014 2013 2014 2013

Discount rate 3.07 412 3.07 412
Rate of salary increase 3.73 3.80 373 3.80
Future pension increase 2.23 2.30
Health care cost growth rate

—at end of fiscal year 5.00 6.00

— ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.00 5.00
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2015 2014

 

The SRP mortality assumptions are based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes 2008 (SAPSO8) tables, specifically
referenced from the experience of United Kingdom self-administered pension schemes. Similarly, the MBP mortality assumptions
are also based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) tables, specifically referenced from the experience of
United Kingdom occupational schemes. These SAPS tables assume normal health participants, and have been updated
using Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) 2009 projections to factor in future longevity improvements.

The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AA
corporate bonds.

The medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced
by a wide variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of
hese calculations, the initial medical cost inflation rate was assumed at 6 percent per annum between January 1, 2014 and
December 31, 2014, thereafter a constant rate of 5 percent per annum will be used.

The Bank’s obligation and costs for post-retirement medical benefits are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding medical
cost inflation.

 

The average duration of SRP and MBP is 17.9 years and 24 years, respectively.

rust funds, which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social
progress of its Regional Member Countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the NTF as well as certain multilateral
and bilateral donor funds created in the form of grants.

The ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of the
ADF is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors of which 7 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises
50 percent of the voting power in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry
out its functions, the ADF utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses
he Bank based on an agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year.

 

The Bank’s investment in the ADF is included in Equity Participations and disclosed in Note J. In addition to the amount
reported as equity participation, the Bank periodically makes allocations from its income to the Fund, to further its objectives.
Net income allocations by the Bank to ADF are reported as Other Resources in the Fund's financial statements. Net income
allocation to the Fund in 2014 amounted to UA 42 million (2013: UA 35 million).

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors
conducts the general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in this regard, the Bank consults
with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for
which it reimburses to the Bank its share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses
reimbursed to the Bank by both the ADF and NTF is disclosed in Note Q.

Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other
entities are generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction
operations and technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such
grant funds at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are disclosed in Note V-5.

The Bank charges fees for managing some of these funds. Management fees received by the Bank for the year ended
December 31, 2014 amounted to VA 2.12 million (2013: UA 2.05 million).

The Bank also administers the SRP and MBP. The activities of the SRP and MBP are disclosed in Note R.

staff amounted to UA 6.48 million (2013: UA 6.71 million).

NOTE T — SEGMENT REPORTING

The Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its Regional
Member States. The Bank’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner

across borrowers.

Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s operations, management has determined that ADB has only one reportable segment
since the Bank does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net

income from individual borrowers.

The products and services from which the Bank derives its revenue are mainly loans, treasury and equity investments.

External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is detailed as follows:

NOTE V-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES
i) Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF),
the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its
reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under
the arrears clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance
of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were
consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the present
value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted average
interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following
factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of
DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created extensive
destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed
package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are
taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that
may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited
from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears
clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors
may from time to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan.
The amount of such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically
occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC
loans in current earnings is transferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer,
in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Fragile States Facility

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their
efforts towards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these
countries reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan
arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with
allocations from the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving
debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In
this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict
Countries Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003
net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an
additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to
the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2006/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final
installment of the Bank’s allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the Board of Directors
approved the establishment of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF and in addition
provide broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF are to consolidate
peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term economic growth of
the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by the ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to clear the debt owed
to the Bank by beneficiary countries.

Annual Report 2014 179Chapter 7 African Development Bank

iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under
this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended
period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible
beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of
the loans or their nominal values, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives.

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present
value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value
discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected
ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved
by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under
the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as
they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion
points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

As at end December 2014, the implementation of the HIPC initiative shows that out of the 33 eligible countries, 29 RMCs
have reached their completion points while Chad is still in interim period. Three countries, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea
(pre-point decision) are yet to reach the decision point.

iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to
help 38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt
cancelation would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross
assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to
make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of
disbursed and outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of
that date in the ADF’s net assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank’s investment
in the Fund. Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion
point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancelation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not
include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

NOTE V-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of
Special Funds.

At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of
the Bank:

i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African
Development Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a
period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to
the Government of Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on April 25, 2006, the Bank
and the Federal Republic of Nigeria agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations
and an independent evaluation of the NTF.

Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years
starting from April 26, 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25
million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank

on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first
installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million
(US$ 10.87 million) was received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million)
was made on September 13, 1985.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria authorized the withdrawal of
an amount of US$13 million (UA 8.41 million) from reserves to settle its commitment on the arrears clearance of debt owed

by Liberia under the internationally coordinated arrears clearance mechanism for Post Conflict Countries.

The resources of the NTF at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized below:

ii) The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution
20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in
1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified
fields are likely to facilitate the Bank’s objective of meeting the needs of Regional Member Countries in those fields. The
resources of this Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

At December 31, 2014, a total of UA 3.31 million (2013: UA 2.60 million) had been committed but not yet disbursed under

the Special Relief Fund.

iil) Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF): Pursuant to the Board of Governors resolution B/BG/201 4/06 of May 22, 2014,
the agreement establishing the Africa Growing Together Fund was signed between the Bank and the Peoples Bank of China
on May 22, 2014 to co-finance alongside the ADB eligible sovereign and non-sovereign operations. Following the entry
into force of the AGTF agreement, an initial contribution of USD 50 million towards the Fund was received by the Bank on
November 28, 2014.

NOTE V—4: TRUST FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration
of the Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in
Africa. These funds, held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted
for in specific currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby
Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward
staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of
July 4, 1974. Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from
the Government of Algeria to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected
by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975, an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a
balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. Following the approval by
the Government of Algeria of the request from Guinea Bissau in their letter dated January 29, 2014, loan balance due and
outstanding from Guinea Bissau, amounting to US$ 1,000,000 was canceled and written off the books. The accounts of
the Fund have, therefore, been closed definitively at the end of the first quarter of 2014.

182 Annual Report 2014African Development Bank Chapter 7

iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th
Meeting of Heads of State and Governments of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African
Unity (OAU) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the
objective of giving assistance to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended December 31, 2014

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (the Bank) which comprise the balance
sheet as at December 31, 2014 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity

establishing the Bank. This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d)
of the Agreement establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to
the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at December 31,

2014, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of the African Development Fund (the ADF
or the Fund) primarily consist of subscriptions by the Bank,
subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, as well
as other resources received by the Fund. The cumulative
subscriptions to the ADF amounted to UA 26.24 billion at
December 31, 2014.

Subsequent to the initial subscriptions, additional resources
have been provided to the ADF in the form of periodic
general replenishments, typically done every three years. The
thirteenth (ADF-13) replenishment was adopted by the Board
of Governors on January 31, 2014 and became effective on
March 31, 2014 with the total resource envelope amounting
to UA 5.35 billion, comprising donor subscriptions of UA 3.80
billion, supplementary contributions of UA 0.06 billion, Advanced
Commitment Capacity or internally generated resources of
UA 0.98 billion, and a technical gap of UA 0.51 billion. The
replenishment covers the 2014-2016 operational period. As
of December 31, 2014, State participants had subscribed a
otal amount of UA 3.35 billion, representing 88 percent of
the ADF-13 pledged amount.

Commitments under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), donor
countries agree to compensate ADF for the cancellation of its
loans to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that have
reached, or will reach the completion point under the enhanced
HIPC initiative. The MDRI became effective on September 1,
2006 and covers the period, 2006-2054. To preserve the
financial integrity and the financing capacity of the Fund, the
terms of the MDRI require donors to fully compensate the
Fund for debts cancelled under the MDRI. Donors have also
agreed that periodic adjustments would be made under the
initiative to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs
to the Fund resulting from debt forgiveness.

 

As of December 31, 2014, the Fund had received from donors
aggregate commitments of UA 4.68 billion, representing 82
percent of the MDRI cost of UA 5.69 billion for the period,
2006-2054.

Financial Products

The ADF is the concessional financing window of the Bank
Group that provides Low-Income Regional Member Countries
with concessional loans as well as grants for projects and
programs, risk guarantees and support through technical
assistance for studies and capacity building.

Annual Report 2014

African Development Fund Chapter 7

Loans

Prior to the ADF-13 Replenishment, the ADF was operating
under differentiated lending terms for ADF-eligible countries
classified as blend, gap and graduating versus ADF-only
countries. Accordingly, loans extended to blend, gap and
graduating countries had a maturity period of 30 years, including
an 8-year grace period with an interest rate of 1 percent per
annum. For ADF-only countries, their loans had a maturity
period of 50 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with
no interest rate. The standard commitment fee of 0.50 percent
per annum on undisbursed amounts and service charge of
0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances, were still
applicable for all ADF loans.

With the view to preserving the long-term financial sustainability
and capacity of the ADF, the ADF-13 Replenishment introduced
(i) hardened and differentiated lending terms; and (ii) two subgroups of ADF-only countries: the “regular” or the “advance”
group. The financing terms for regular and advance ADF-only
countries, as well as for blend, gap and graduating countries,
were hardened. An accelerated repayment clause and a
voluntary prepayment framework were also introduced.

Accordingly, new loans extended under ADF-13 to regular ADF
countries have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period
of 10 years; and loans extended to advance ADF countries
have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
The standard commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on
undisbursed amounts and service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum in outstanding balances remain applicable. Loans to
blend, gap and graduating countries have a maturity of 30
years including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate
charge of 1 percent per annum in addition to the standard
commitment and service fees.

Guarantees

As ameans of stimulating additional private sector investments
in Low-income Countries, the ADF Partial Risk Guarantee (ADFPRG) instrument was introduced as part of ADF-12 to leverage
resources from the private sector and other co-financiers for
ADF countries, including fragile states. The ADF-PRG protects
private lenders against well-defined political risks related to the
failure of a government or a government-related entity to honor
certain specified commitments and incentivize governments
to undertake policy and fiscal reforms necessary to mitigate
performance-related risks.

Starting with the ADF-13 Replenishment, the Partial Credit
Guarantee (PCG) has been added to the suite of ADF
instruments. The ADF-PCG is an instrument designed to
address the challenges faced by well performing ADF only
countries and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), in their quest
to mobilize both domestic and external commercial financing

part of the ADF-13 Replenishment. This was partially offset
by lower liquidity and a lower level of interest rates in 2014
compared to 2013.

Development Activities

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net of cancellations, at
December 31, 2014, amounted to UA 26.67 billion, compared
to UA 25.24 billion at the end of 2013. Table 7.6 presents
the evolution of loans approved, disbursed and undisbursed
balances from 2010 to 2014.

Total outstanding loans, as at December 31, 2014 was UA
8.97 billion, UA 0.79 billion higher than the UA 8.18 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2013.

At the end of 2014, there were a total of 1,163 active loans
and grants and a total of 697 loans amounting to UA 5.55
billion had been fully repaid or canceled through MDRI.

Disbursements

Loans and grants disbursed by the Fund decreased by
28.23 percent to stand at UA 1.22 billion in 2014 from UA
1.70 billion in 2013. As at December 31, 2014, cumulative
disbursements on loans and grants amounted to UA 20.11
billion compared to UA 18.80 billion at the end of the previous
year. A total of 2,053 loans and grants were fully disbursed for
an amount of UA 15.39 billion, representing 76.49 percent of
cumulative disbursements. Figure 7.3 tracks the evolution of
loan disbursements and repayments over the past five years.

Repayments

Principal loan repayments for the Fund amounted to UA
62.87 million in 2014 compared to UA 56.77 million in 2013,
representing an increase of 10.74 percent over the previous
year. Cumulative repayments as of December 31, 2014 stood
at UA 6.85 billion.

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The Fund, like the Bank, employs stringent risk management
procedures in order to prudently reduce its exposure to risks,
such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risks, that are not
essential to its core business of providing development related

Annual Report 2014assistance to its clients. The details of the risk management
policies and practices employed by the Fund to manage

these risks are provided in Note C to the Financial Statements.

Financial Results

The following are the highlights of the Fund’s financial
performance in 2014.

¢ The Fund reported a deficit of UA 125.35 million in 2014,
compared to a deficit of UA 123.52 million in 2013. The
persistent losses over recent years are principally due
to some structural changes to the Fund, including the
cancellation of loans to certain beneficiaries under the MDRI
initiative (described in Note F to the financial statements) and
the increased grant elements in the recent ADF resource
allocation methodology. Although these changes are not
reported as income in the Fund’s financial statements, their
impact does not adversely affect the commitment capacity
or the financial sustainability of the Fund because the Fund
is expected to be compensated through additional donor
subscriptions, payable over the life of the cancelled loans.

¢ The generally low level of interest rates prevailing globally
continued to have the dual effect of lowering the Fund’s
investment income and increasing the impact of the
accelerated encashment of promissory notes deposited
towards the payment of subscriptions to the Fund.

e The Fund’s share of the total shareable administrative
expenses of the ADB Group increased by UA 22.70 million
from UA 225.87 million in 2013 to UA 248.57 million in 2014
due to increases in operational expenses of the Bank Group
and the additional expenses relating to the return of the Bank
to its Headquarters in Abidjan, Cate d’lvoire. As noted earlier,
the Fund’s share of the total shareable expenses is based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven
primarily by the relative levels of certain operational volume
indicators and relative balance sheet size. The Fund’s share
of these expenses was 67.32 percent for 2014, compared
to 68.69 percent for 2013.

¢ Investment income increased from UA 67.33 million in 2013
to UA 76.35 million in 2014. Loan income also increased,
driven primarily by a higher average outstanding loan balance
in 2014. The discount on the accelerated encashment of
promissory notes amounted to UA 34.33 million in 2014
compared to UA 38.94 million in 2013.

According to the Fund’s non-accrual policy, service charges

on loans made to or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded
from loan income, if principal installments or service charges

Annual Report 2014

African Development Fund Chapter 7

on any such loans are in arrears for six months or more, until
such time that payment is received. As a result of this policy,
UA 2.06 million of non-accrued loan income was excluded
from 2014 income compared to UA 2.07 million in 2013. The
number of borrowers in non-accrual status at December 31,
2014 remained three, which was the same level as at the
end of December 2013.

The Fund continued to cancel qualifying debts under MDR'
as the relevant countries reached HIPC completion point. A
summary of the cumulative loan cancellations under MDRI and
HIPC is presented in Note F to the Special Purpose Financia
Statements of the Fund.

Performance Management and Monitoring

As with the African Development Bank (the Bank) managemen
monitors performance measures and indicators which reflec
the critical success factors in the ADF’s business. To the
extent that the ADF extends grants in addition to lending a’
highly concessional rates, the conventional profitability and
financial ratios are not deemed to be an appropriate means
of determining its effectiveness in delivering developmen
resources to Regional Member Countries. One proxy that the
Fund applies for measuring effective delivery of developmen
resources is the level of disbursements made to RMCs from
one period to another. As already noted previously, during the
year under review a total of UA 1.22 billion was disbursed for
loans and grants as compared to UA 1.70 billion made in 2013.

Annual Report 2014 197Chapter 7 African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014

 

NOTE A — PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members,
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing on
concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of May 27, 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors
of ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected
by State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the
State Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of
the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
to as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its Regional
Member Countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its Regional Member States. The ADB also
participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and
where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB Regional Member Countries, particularly the
lesser-developed countries. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of
the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates, where there are,
are disclosed in the notes that follow.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of
the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund
(the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions
and contributions.

NOTE B — BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources
represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments
and demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply
with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a
summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund’s special purpose financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit
of Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

198 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
came into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating
to the currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of
applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the
SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s
Unit of Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the
IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for
the entry into effect of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at
the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date
of the Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency
Translation Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the
resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from
participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when
the ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in
the replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants
are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of
the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in
accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain
participants is conditional upon the respective participant’s budgetary appropriation process.

Annual Report 2014 199Chapter 7 African Development Fund

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Starting with the ADF-9 replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
to the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are
credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received
are invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the
face value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be
earned on the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is
amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant
over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of
Governors of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF
to provide full and timely compensation for the debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following
effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion-point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPCs); and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least
seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI
with effect from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt
cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year
period of the Initiative. Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service
charges and principal) for each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory
financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article
7 of the Agreement Establishing ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing
arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are
received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed
within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the
Agreement which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in
terms of the UA or its foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that
participant's territory, that participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to
maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and
which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within
that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the
value of the Fund’s holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these
amounts have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ successive Resolutions governing the second through to the thirteenth general
replenishments of the Fund, which stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to these general replenishments, subscribers to
these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling
at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received,

900 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

into UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions (CEAS).

Financial Assets

The Fund's financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s business model. In
accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the
management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

A financial asset is classified at “amortized cost” only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified at “fair value through profit or loss”.

Financial assets at amortized cost include mainly demand obligations and accrued income on loans and receivables and
certain investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Demand obligations are non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes payable on demand deposited for subscription payment.

The Fund also classifies at amortized cost, investments of the proceeds of accelerated encashment of notes. This is consistent
with the business model of the Fund of collecting contractual cash flows. The primary objective of such financial assets is
to recoup the discount granted to State Participants on the accelerated encashment program.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a
time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Income on investments includes interest
earned and unrealized gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Investments

The Fund’s investment securities are classified either as financial assets at amortized cost or as at fair value. Investments classified
as financial assets at amortized cost include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All other investment securities are classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and measured at market value.

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio held at fair value through

profit or loss. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund
commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Annual Report 2014 901Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Country eligibility
is determined by assessing gross national income per capita, creditworthiness and performance. Annual Debt Sustainability
Analysis is used to determine the risk of debt distress of each beneficiary country and set appropriate financing terms.

The following categories of countries are eligible to ADF loans:

© Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing and whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off.

© Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are above
the operational cut-off (blend countries) have access to ADF funds with modified financing terms at par with those of blend
countries.

¢ Category B countries are those deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off with access to a blend of ADB and ADF resources.

Graduating countries are those that are graduating from the category of ADF borrowing countries to the category of ADB
borrowing countries and the graduating policies are determined for each new ADF replenishment.

Disbursed and outstanding loans are reported at amortized cost and not included in Net Development Resources in the
special purpose financial statements as they represent an allocation of development resources. Accordingly, no provision
or possible loan losses is required.

Loan income arising from interest, service and commitment charges is recognized on an accrual basis. The Fund places all
loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments, interest or service charges on any of the loans
‘oO such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue
amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not
yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent
‘0 the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid
interests and charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for
hat period. Interests and charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of
such charges has been received by the Fund.

Partial Risk Guarantee

The Fund provides guaranties, through the Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) program, for credits issued in support of projects
located within a member county that are undertaken by private entities. Under the PRGs program, the Fund provides financial
guaranties for private lenders to a member country in the event that a member country fails to honor its contractual obligations
with respect to private lenders to a project. The PRGs insure private lenders against well-defined political risks related to the
ailure of a government or government-related entity to honor certain specified commitments such as political force majeure,
currency inconvertibility, regulatory risks and various forms of breach of contract.

 

Under the PRGs framework the Fund executes the payment obligations if the borrower defaults and the lender consequently
demanding payment from the Fund. In the event that a guarantee is called, the Fund has the contractual right to require
payment from the member country that has provided the counter guarantee to the Fund.

Guarantee fee income received is deferred and amortized over the life of the guarantee.

Grants

In addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth
replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect
from the ninth replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans,
represent allocations of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development
Resources of the Fund.

902 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

HIPC Debt Initiative

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust
Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries
reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the
beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written
down to their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual
difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as
it falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC
framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by additional contributions to be
made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When MDRI becomes effective
for a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and
effectively take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI are included in
“Net Debt Relief” and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources, with
a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets included in its Net Development Resources is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired
and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events
hat occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

if the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on its receivable or treasury
investments held at amortized cost (described in prior years as held-to-maturity investment), the amount of the loss is
measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment
calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a treasury investment at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount
rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Loans are not included in Net Development Resources and are therefore not subject to impairment.

Fair Value Disclosure

The fair values of quoted financial assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based
on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets, the Fund establishes fair value by using valuation
techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions,

 

Annual Report 2014 903Chapter 7 African Development Fund

discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and
assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in
a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 7: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available, using the bid prices. If
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government
and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally
guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For assetbacked securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time
deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally
guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when
possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Fund also uses valuation
tools based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The
models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial
models used for valuing the Fund’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Events After the Reporting Period

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the date of the Statement of Net Development
Resources and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions
that existed at the date of the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the date of the Statement of Net Development resources are disclosed,
but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect the prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C — RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Fund seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty
risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Fund is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its commitment capacity.
The Fund's overall risk management strategy is to minimize the exposure of its replenishment resources (the Commitment

904 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

Capacity) to the risk of over-commitment and also to protect its Net Development Resources from currency translation losses
that could negatively affect the Fund’s long-term capacity to meet its development needs.

The policies, processes and procedures which the Fund uses to manage its risk profile continually evolve in response to market,
credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Fund’s Board
of Executive Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of
corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends
in the Fund's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Fund manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on
Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority) approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the
Fund's liquid assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing
he Fund's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM
Authority covers the Fund's entire array of ALM activities.

Under the umbrella of the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines
as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The ALCO, chaired by
the Vice President for Finance, is the oversight and control organ of the Fund’s finance and treasury risk management activities.
The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
hat report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial
products and services. In June 2012 the Bank Group also created the Credit Risk Committee (CRC), to ensure effective
implementation of the Fund’s credit policies and oversee all credit risk issues related to loan operations.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Fund's financial and risk management policies and guidelines
are delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the
day-to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

 

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund arising
essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Fund's credit risk arises from two principal sources: (i) sovereign credit risk arising from lending to its qualifying RMCs;
and (ii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions.

Sovereign Credit Risk

The Fund provides concessional loans in order to fund economic and social development of its member countries which
generally have a lower credit quality than ADB borrowers. Although loans are included in the financial statements as resources
already allocated for development and therefore not included in the Net Development Resources, the Fund still manages
sovereign credit risks to ensure equitable allocation of resources to eligible beneficiaries and ensure that expected reflows
from loan repayments are properly monitored and managed. Country eligibility for loans is determined by assessing among
other things, gross national income per capita, credit worthiness and performance. The Fund uses the International Monetary
Fund/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-income Countries, to make performance-based allocation
(PBA) of ADF resources among the many competing needs in the continent and to ensure the funds are directed to areas
they will be used most effectively. The PBA process, which is reviewed regularly, is also used to determine the proportion
of ADF resources that is allocated in the form of grants to each qualifying borrower. On the basis of the debt sustainability
analysis, certain countries are allocated grants-only resources, while others may receive a combination of loan and grant
resources or loan resources only.

906 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, the Fund utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage
its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to
disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction
may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund. Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely
eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential
framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty
credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank Group’s Vice
President for Finance. ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored by the Financial Management Department.

For trading counterparties, the Fund requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

 

Maturity
6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks AVA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA
MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral

originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/
MBS. Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of
acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund uses derivatives in the management of its assets and liabilities. As a rule, the Fund executes an ISDA master
agreement and collateral exchange agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative
counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with
whom the Fund has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a stipulated maximum for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty
credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future
exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

Annual Report 2014 907Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. The Fund’s
principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow
needs for between 50 and 75 percent of the three years’ moving average of expected disbursements.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
the need arises, the Fund divides its investment portfolio into two tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks.
The Fund's core liquidity portfolio, which is fair valued, is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if the
need arises to meet the Fund's short-term liquidity needs. In addition to the trading portfolio, the Fund maintains a second
tranche of liquidity under the broad category of amortized cost portfolio, which is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities
intended to earn contractual cash flows.

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in
the Fund’s Net Assets, including its Net Development Resources (NDR) and outstanding loans, the Fund’s principal currency
risk management objective is to ensure that it is able to provide the disbursement currencies requested by borrowers while
minimizing the exposure of its NDR to adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent possible, the Fund shall maintain the
alignment of the currency composition of its Net Assets with the UA as the primary benchmark of its currency composition.
The Fund may conduct currency exchange transactions for the following two reasons: (1) to align the currency composition
of its Net Assets (loan and investment portfolios) with the UA, (2) for the purpose of providing ADF borrowers with the
disbursement currencies requested.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the potential for loss due to adverse movements in market interest rates. In seeking to earn a stable and
reasonable return on invested liquidity, the Fund's principal interest rate risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of the
Fund's investment returns to changes in market interest rates. To achieve this objective, the Fund’s investments are managed
in two portfolios: (1) an actively managed portfolio (the “Operational” Portfolio); and (2) a passively managed portfolio (the
“Investment” Portfolio).

The Operational Portfolio provides a readily available source of liquidity to cover both expected and unexpected disbursements
as well as any other probable cash outflows. The Operational Portfolio is managed against a 3-month LIBOR reference
benchmark in each currency. Generally, investments in the Operational Portfolio are held for trading and are regularly marked
to market.

The Investment Portfolio consists of funds that are not immediately required for loan disbursements and therefore may be
invested for a longer horizon. Generally, investments in the Investment Portfolio are purchased with the intention to hold them
until their maturity and are not marked to market. The Investment Portfolio comprises two sub-portfolios, (1) an investment
portfolio for income stabilization for the purpose of generating a stable income for the Fund and reducing the Fund's investment
income sensitivity to interest rates. This portfolio is managed against a 10-year uniform repricing profile for each invested
currency, and (2) an investment portfolio for accelerated encashments for the purpose of investing proceeds from accelerated
encashments to recoup the discount granted to State Participants, minimizing or eliminating interest rate risk on accelerated
encashments. This portfolio is managed against a target rate, which is the discount rate agreed with State Participants.

Futures Contracts

The Fund has also entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at
December 31, 2014, the Fund had 277 contracts in Euro, 1,246 contracts in Pound Sterling and 2,111 contracts in US
Dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million of each currency unit, except for 1,246 GBP contracts with a
nominal value of 500,000 for each contract.

NOTE E — DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement,
in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors
has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE F — DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

According to the Fund’s loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing
from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent
per annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per
annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit
approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment
charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement. With effect from the ADF-12
replenishment, loans to blend, gap and graduating countries carry differentiated financing terms of thirty (80) years’ maturity,
grace period of 8 years and interest rate of 1 percent, in addition to the existing standard 0.50 percent commitment fee and
0.75 percent service charge. Under ADF-13, further differentiated lending terms were adopted with the view of preserving the
long-term financial sustainability and capacity of the Fund. The new lending terms require the acceleration of loan repayment
by regular and advanced ADF-only countries, and also to blend, gap and graduating countries; and the granting of financial
incentives for voluntary loan repayment.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to
borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31,
2014, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 6.44 million (2013: UA
33.40 million).

912 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

The Fund also provides Partial Reimbursement Guarantees (PRGs) to private entities for development exposures on projects
located in Regional Member Countries. Such guarantees represent potential risk to the Fund if amounts guaranteed for an
entity are not reimbursed. As at December 31, 2014, guarantees provided by the Fund to private entities on account of its
borrowers amounted to UA 145.75 million (2013: UA 137.50 million).

As at December 31, 2014, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding
of UA 272.59 million (2013: UA 275.79 million) of which UA 110.05 million (2013: UA 103.17 million) was overdue, were in
non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31,
2014, would have been higher by UA 2.06 million (2013: UA 2.07 million). At December 31, 2014, the cumulative charges not
recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted to UA 40.42 million, compared to UA 38.79 million at December 31, 2013.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum
of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

At December 31, 2014, outstanding loans amounted to UA 8,965.21 million (2013: UA 8,182.64 million).

Annual Report 2014 13Chapter 7 African Development Fund

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund’s lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10
percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.5 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments
were allocated as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects
or programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under
the ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project
financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth, eleventh and twelfth general replenishments is
based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments,
technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period,
from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not feasible,
the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening Regional Member Countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the
operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a
repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price
equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following
the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present
value. The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans,
was shown as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million which was the write-down in respect
of the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework is included in the amount stated as
net debt relief in the Statement of Net Development Resources. The outstanding balance and net present value of the loans
owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved
by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the
original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as
they come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is
provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points.
Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31, 2014 amounted to UA 184 million and are shown as
allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the
Development Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for the MDRI,
and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help

38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation

914 Annual Report 2014African Development Fund Chapter 7

is delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows
downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional
contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded
from net development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development
resources. Cancellation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2014, a gross amount of UA 5.53 billion (2013: UA 5.53 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled
under MDRI for 29 (2013: 29) HIPC completion-point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2013: VA 1,225.99
million) in nominal terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71
million (2013: UA 942.71 million). As of December 31, 2014, the present value amounts have been transferred from the
HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC — In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group,
the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC.
Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation
of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-9) to clear the entire
stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the
residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-8 as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears
on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework — The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and
integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically Regional Member Countries of ADB emerging from conflict
or crisis. The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty
reduction and long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict
Countries Facility (PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their
arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance and
help these countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group.
The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF, the
ADB and private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible fragile states
not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group.
Contributions made by the Fund to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary fragile state.
Contributions by the Fund to the Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement of Net
Development Resources.

Annual Report 2014 715Chapter 7 African Development Fund

NOTE G — SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states
acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants
in the form of a special general increase and 12 general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note M.

The Board of Governors, by its resolution F/BG/2014/01 of January 31, 2014, approved the thirteenth general replenishment
of the Fund (ADF-13), following the Deputies agreement for a replenishment level of UA 5.35 billion, of which UA 0.98 billion
represents internally generated resources, for the three-year operational period, 2014 to 2016. ADF-13 came into effect in
March 2014 after the State Participants had deposited with the Fund, enough instruments of subscriptions and the approval
by the Board of Directors for the use of the internally generated resources for operational commitments. At December 31,
2014, subscriptions to ADF-13 amounted to UA 3.36 billion.

The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was admitted to the ADF on May 29, 2014, becoming the Fund’s 27th State Participant.
As per the Board of Governors’ Resolution F/BG/2009/04, Luxembourg’s initial subscription amount was set to UA 14.51
million. This subscription amount was paid in full on May 16, 2014, and included in the Fund’s resources.

At December 31, 2014, cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.68 billion of which
UA 748.05 million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the
contributions paid entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note M.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

NOTE H — OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the
Fund or a member of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of
the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion, are deemed to have become part of
the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions
are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 538.99 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 536.99 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE J — TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to receive other
resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2014, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 4.11 million (2013: UA 3.22 million)
representing the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

NOTE K — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter’s
offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund’s relative share of the number of programs
and projects executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year
amounted to UA 248.57 million (2013: UA 225.87 million).

NOTE L — RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by
the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President
of the Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the
ADB (the Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank
administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by one of its State Participants.

Independent Auditor’s Report on the special purpose financial statements of the
African Development Fund to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

Year ended December 31, 2014

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development Fund (the Fund) prepared in
compliance with the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the Special Purpose
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2014.

These special purpose financial statements have been prepared for the purposes of submitting approved and audited special purpose
financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement establishing the Fund,
and are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with a recognised accounting framework, such as, International Financial
Reporting Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the
Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the special purpose financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with

the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the special purpose financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Annual Report 2014NIGERIA TRUST FUND
Financial Management

NTF Replenishment

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) is a special fund administered
by the Bank. The Fund’s resources primarily consist of
subscriptions by the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The NTF
was established in 1976, for an initial period of thirty (30)
years, when an agreement establishing the NTF was executed
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with
a provision for extension by mutual agreement. After two
annual extensions in 2006 and 2007, the operation of the NTF
was extended for ten years with effect from April 26, 2008,
following a positive evaluation of its performance during the
initial 30 years of operation.

Loan Products

NTF provides financing in the form of loans to the least
developed and Low-Income Regional Member Countries at
concessionary rates in order to enhance economic development
and social progress in Africa. In the past the NTF has provided
concessional financing exclusively to public sector operations.
However, for the extension period to 2018, the Fund’s mandate
has been expanded to cover financial support to private sector
operations as well, including the microfinance subsector.

Investments

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF, all denominated
in US Dollars, amounted to UA 123.71 million at December 31,
2014, compared to UA 120.75 million at the end of 2013.
Investment income for 2014 was UA 0.42 million, representing
a return of 0.35 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA
121.38 million, compared to an income of UA 0.45 million
representing a return of 0.38 percent on an average liquidity
of UA 117.89 million in 2013. The portfolio’s outperformance
against its benchmark in 2014 remains similar to 2013 and
the lower income in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily
attributable to the lower level of interest rates.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31,
2014, increased by UA 29.66 million to UA 308.43 million

Table 7.7 Lending Status, 2010-2014

Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

compared to UA 278.77 million at the end of 2013. During
2014, the new loan approvals amounted to UA 11.49 million
compared with UA 31.17 million in 2013. Table 7.7 below
presents the evolution of loans approved, disbursed and
undisbursed balances from 2010 to 2014.

As at December 31, 2014, there were 37 active loans with an
outstanding amount of UA 44.62 million and 44 fully repaid
loans amounting to UA 124.14 million.

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 0.96 million in 2013 to VA
3.13 million in 2014. As at December 31, 2014, cumulative
disbursements amounted to UA 241.20 million (2013: UA 238.07
million). A total of 69 loans amounting to UA 235.06 million
were fully disbursed as at December 31, 2014, representing
97.45 percent of cumulative disbursements on that date.
Figure 7.4 shows the evolution of loan disbursements and
repayments over the past five years.

Repayments

Principal loan repayments amounted to UA 6.81 million in
2014 compared to UA 6.09 million in 2013, representing an
increase of 11.82 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of December 31, 2014 stood at UA 177.34
million.

Annual Report 2014 993Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The NTF, similar to the Bank, seeks to reduce its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development related assistance, such as liquidity, currency and
interest rate risks. The Fund follows stringent risk management
procedures in managing these risks. Note D to the Financial
Statements of the Fund provides the details of the risk
management policies and practices employed by NTF.

Financial Results

The highlights of the Nigeria Trust Fund's financial performance
in 2014 include the following:

¢ NTF’s income before distributions approved by the Board
of Governors decreased by UA 0.09 million from UA 1.58
million in 2013 to VA 1.49 million in 2014, mainly due to a
decrease in investment income, owing to low interest rates.

294

e Administrative expenses, representing the NTF’s share of
the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group, decreased
by UA 0.03 million from UA 0.40 million in 2013 to UA 0.37
million in 2014. As noted earlier, the NTF’s share of the
total shareable expenses of the ADB Group is based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven by
the relative levels of certain operational volume indicators
and relative balance sheet-size. However, the NTF’s share
of the total administrative expenses is capped at no more
than 20 percent of its gross income in any year.

The NTF’s reserves net of cumulative currency translation
adjustments increased from UA 37.19 million at the end of
2013 to UA 39.69 million on December 31, 2014, a 6.72
percent increase.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014

 

NOTE A — NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development
Bank, headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria.
The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB Regional Member Countries. The Agreement
stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such
sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement
expired on April 26, 2006 and was extended twice for 1-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of
the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of the independent review, the Agreement has been extended
for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

NOTE B — SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under
he historical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Fund are summarized below:

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected
ife of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

The Fund conducts its operations in United States Dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States
Dollars (USD). In accordance with Article VIl, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements
are presented in Units of Account (UA).

 

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.
At December 31, 2014, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.44881 United States dollars (2013: 1.54000 USD).

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in COTA are reported in the statement of changes in
equity. Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains
and losses on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

Annual Report 2014 93)Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

1) Financial Assets

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Fund classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized
cost; and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s
business model. In accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income
through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Amortized Cost

A financial asset is classified as “amortized cost” only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments
that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts receivable. Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the
Fund provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables
are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. Incremental direct
costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are considered insignificant.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

ii) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a

time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

939 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only
if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the
asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset
or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or
held-to-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise
from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best
estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or other investment held at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the
discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Offsetting Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions
on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market
might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are
few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may
not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore
may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily
determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on
current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by
using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s
length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used
by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using
methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the
values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

Annual Report 2014 933Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund
The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 7: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management’s best estimates of the expected cash flows of its loans. The
fair valuation of loans has been determined using a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates in
USD, including impairment percentages when applicable.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current
year net income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group
of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred
after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future
cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments carried
at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement.

934 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

ii) Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured by using valuation techniques. Where
valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however,
areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates.
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

NOTE C — THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

The Fund early adopted in 2013 the revisions to IAS 32 which became effective on January 1, 2014. The application has
no impact on the financial position of the Fund as the amendments merely clarify the offsetting criteria and how these are
to be applied in practice.

IFRS 9: Financial Instruments
The final version of the second part of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was issued on July 24, 2014 and is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The standard introduces a third classification and measurement category
for financial assets, require the expected credit loss impairment model in place of the IAS 39 incurred loss model and some
revisions to hedge accounting.

Although preliminary indications are that Fund will be affected by the new standard, the Fund is still assessing the full impact
of this new pronouncement on its financial position and performance.

No other new or revised financial reporting standard, applicable to the Fund, became effective in 2014.

NOTE D — RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course
of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of
he Fund through the Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (the ALM Authority). The ALM Authority
sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund’s risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as
necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s most senior
management forum on finance and financial risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

The ALCO meets on regular basis to perform its oversight roles. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance
and treasury risk management reports and projections and approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet. ALCO is supported

by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk and financial projections.

n late 2013, a Group Chief Risk Officer position was created reporting directly to the President of the Bank.

 

Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank’s risk management policies and guidelines are delegated
to the relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day
compliance with those policies and guidelines.

Annual Report 2014 935Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund
The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of
risk for the Fund arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending
operations, and counterparty credit risk.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential
losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. Country credit risk is managed
through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness
assessment. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects.

Country Exposure
The Fund’s loans outstanding at December 31, 2014 were to the following countries:

936 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
As at December 31, 2014, all the Fund’s loans were made only to public sector borrowers, and such loans generally carry
full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

International Ratings

 

 

Risk Class Revised Rating Scale S&P — Fitch Moody’s Assessment
1+ A+ and Above Ai and Above
1 A A2 Excellent
‘ ile A- A3
Very Low Risk Oy BBB. Baal
2 BBB Baa2 Strong
2- BBB- Baa3
3+ BB+ Bal

3- BB- Ba3

ot B- B3 Acceptable
e cCC+ Caal Marginal
High Risk 6
6 ccc Caa2 Special Attention
: CCC- Caa3 Substandard
Very Flot Bis 9 cc Ca Doubtful
10 C C Loss

 

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic
performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk
indices are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk
ratings. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies
and other specialized international bodies. The Credit Risk Committee reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to
ensure compliance with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss
provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to
that country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor
will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on
all loans to or guaranteed by that borrower country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

2) Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. Various financial
instruments are used to manage the Fund’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest
its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the
counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Annual Report 2014 937Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, this risk
is minimized by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating
standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties for treasury assets
must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for Finance. For
counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

 

 

Maturity

6 months 1 year 5 years 10 years 15 years 30 years
Government AVA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial
institutions A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA

MBS/ABS Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral originated in

the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS. Also, the maximum
weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the
benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues
to be predominantly in the AA- or higher-rated class:

Credit Risk Profile of the Investment Portfolio

 

 

AAA AA+ to AA- A+ and lower
2014 19% 78% 3%
2013 50% 44% 6%
2012 63% 19% 18%
2011 50% 23% 27%
2010 48% 40% 12%
2009 60% 37% 3%

 

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to
mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement
obligations.

Currency Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

938 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

Interest Rate Risk

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed
interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of 3-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently
the available resources. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is
accordingly not hedged.

At December 31, 2014, the Fund had UA 67.23 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2013: UA 40.69
million). The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:

Annual Report 2014 939Chapter 7 Nigeria Trust Fund

Currency and Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis
The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the
Fund's assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have
an impact of approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the

NOTE G — LOANS

Loans originated prior to September 22, 2008, carry an interest rate of four percent (4%) on the outstanding balance. With
effect from September 22, 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of June 3, 2003 and the
protocol agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated September 22, 2003, the interest rate on loans
was changed from a flat 4 percent per annum to a range of 2 percent to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding
balance and future undisbursed loans. Furthermore, a 0.75 percent commission is payable on undisbursed balances
commencing 120 days after the signature of the loan. Loans approved prior to the extension of the Agreement are granted
for a maximum period of twenty-five years including grace periods of up to five years.

Following the extension of the Agreement in April 2008, the terms of the NTF loans were further modified in line with the
terms of financing in the operational guidelines of the Fund, approved pursuant to the Board of Directors’ resolution ADB/
BD/WP/2008/196 of December 2, 2008 which stipulates that the resources of the Fund will henceforth be deployed in
accordance with the following three options:

Financial terms for the first option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per annum
on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a 20-year
repayment period with a 7-year grace period.

Financial terms for the second option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a

15-year repayment period with a 5-year grace period.

Financial terms for the third option would be the same terms as for the ADB private sector financing, taking into consideration
the risk analysis of the project.

949 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

For all the above-mentioned options, the grace period starts from the date of signing of the financing agreement or at a date
agreed amongst co-financiers, in the case of co-financed projects.

For private sector operations, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum on undisbursed balances will be charged from
120 days after the signing of the loan agreement.

The NTF shall provide financing to suit the needs of its borrowers.

Loan Ceilings

n order to promote broader coverage of the NTF resources, utilization will be subject to a ceiling for each operation. For
both public and private sector operations, a ceiling of US$ 10 million per project will apply. Project proposals of more than
US$ 10 million may be considered if there is strong justification. This will be subject to review as appropriate depending on
he recommendations of the mid-term reviews of the NTF.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At December 31,
2014, all loans disbursed were repayable in United States Dollars.

 

The contractual maturity structure of outstanding loans as at December 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:

According to the Agreement establishing NTF, the Fund shall pay to the Bank the expenses incurred in the management of

b) Indirect costs incurred by the Bank in the management of the Fund.

However, the annual payment for the aforementioned expenses incurred by the Bank shall not exceed 20 percent of the
Fund's gross income during the course of each period. The administrative cost-sharing formula may be reviewed from timeto-time by mutual agreement.

The amount of UA 0.37 million charged for the year ended December 31, 2014 (2013: UA 0.40 million) represents the Fund’s
share of the Bank Group expenses.

NOTE K — RELATED PARTIES

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the
NTF on the basis of the terms of the Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the
offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such
facilities, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula (see Note J). The amount outstanding at December 31, 2014 in
respect of Fund’s share of administrative expenses was UA 0.05 million (2013: UA 0.03 million) and is included in Accounts
Payable on the balance sheet.

NOTE L — SEGMENT REPORTING
The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB Regional Member Countries for development purposes.
The Fund's products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.

Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB Regional Member Countries
and treasury investments.

946 Annual Report 2014Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 7

External revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is detailed as follows:

2014 2013
Interest income and charges on loans with sovereign guarantee 1,447 1,530
Treasury investment income 417 455
Total external revenue 1,864 1,985

 

The Fund’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, East Africa, North Africa, Southern Africa, and West Africa. Treasury investment activities are carried
out mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information on
the basis of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses ADB's offices,
staff, organization, services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own.

Geographical information about income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 is detailed as follows:

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10 percent or more of
the Fund’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014.

NOTE M — APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 25, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank in respect
of the Nigeria Trust Fund

Year ended December 31, 2014

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund) which comprise the balance sheet as
at December 31, 2014 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and
the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes
as set out in notes A to M.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, for the purpose of
submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as required by
Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in
accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to
the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the
Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to
the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error;

Independent Auditor's Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating
the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at December 31,

2014, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Annex V
The African Development Bank Group

African Development Bank (ADB). Resources for this Facility
are generally raised from the capital market for onward lending
on non-concessional terms to the Bank’s regional member
countries (RMCs). The ADB window is also used to support
private sector projects in all RMCs through direct loans, lines
of credit, trade finance facilities, equity and quasi-equity
participations, guarantees to financially sound and viable
private enterprises, and multinational projects that promote
regional integration.

The standard loan product of the ADB has evolved over
time, with terms that are increasingly more responsive to
client needs. The current standard loan product provided
to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients is called the
Enhanced Variable Spread Loan (EVSL). The EVSL gives
borrowers a high degree of flexibility to manage interest rate
risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed clients, the loan product
offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises of a floating base
rate (6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR
for Euro, and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that
is a function of the Bank's cost of funding relative to LIBOR,
EURIBOR, or JIBAR computed every six months, and a
contractual spread that has been set at 60 basis points (bps)
since January 1, 2011. At a borrower’s request, the EVSL
offers a free option to convert the floating base rate into a
ixed component (amortizing swap rate set at borrower’s
request for disbursed loan balances). The repayment period
or sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans (SGLs) is up
0 20 years, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
as for the EVSL and remains floating until maturity date, or a
ixed base rate plus a risk-based credit spread. Non-sovereignguaranteed loans (NSGLs) have repayment periods of up to
15 years including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

n December 2018, the ADB Board of Directors approved the
introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) to a suite of products
available to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers.
The FFL embeds risk management features currently offered
hrough the Bank’s Risk Management Products in SGLs,
hereby providing fully customized flexibility in interest rate
and currency conversion to borrowers. It also has a maturitybased pricing structure that has increased the maximum tenor,
grace period and average maturity (weighted average time
o repay a loan) of SGLs from the previous 20, 5, and 12.75

 

266

years to 25, 8, and 17 years, respectively to allow borrowers
to select loan profiles that match their funding needs and debt
management capacities.

The lending rate on the FFL is also consistent with that of
the EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity-based pricing, loans with average maturity less than
or equal to 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium.
However, loans with average maturity greater than 12.75 years
but less than or equal to 15 years will attract a 10 basis points
(bps) maturity premium, while loans with an average maturity
greater than 15 years attract a 20 bps maturity premium.

The resources from the African Development Fund (ADF)
financing window emanate from contributions and periodic
replenishments by ADF-State Participants, usually on a 3-year
basis. Prior to the current ADF-13 Replenishment, the ADF
was operating under differentiated lending terms for ADFeligible countries classified as blend, gap, and graduating,
versus ADF-only countries. Accordingly, loans extended to
blend, gap, and graduating countries had a maturity period of
30 years, including a grace period of 8 years with an interest
rate of 1 percent per annum. For ADF-only countries, loans
had a maturity period of 50 years, including a grace period
of 10 years, with no interest rate. The standard commitment
fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed amounts and
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances, were still applicable for all ADF loans.

In order to preserve the long-term financial sustainability
and capacity of the ADF facility, the ADF-13 Replenishment
introduced two main accessibility criteria: (i) hardened and
differentiated lending terms; and (ii) two sub-groups of ADF-only
countries: the “regular” or the “advance” group. The financing
terms for regular and advance ADF-only countries, as well as
for blend, gap and graduating countries, were hardened. An
accelerated repayment clause and a voluntary prepayment
framework were also introduced.

Accordingly, new loans extended under ADF-13 to regular ADF
countries have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period
of 10 years, and loans extended to advance ADF countries
have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
The standard commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on
undisbursed amounts and service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum in outstanding balances remain applicable. Loans to
blend, gap, and graduating countries have a maturity of 30
years including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate

Annual Report 2014charge of 1 percent per annum in addition to the standard
commitment and service fees.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) resources are provided entirely
by the Federal Republic of Nigeria under an Agreement
signed with the Bank in 1976 for an initial period of 30 years.
Following its revision in April 2008, the Agreement provides
that resources from the NTF shall be used in accordance with
the terms of the following three options.

¢ First option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 20-year repayment
period, including a grace period of 7 years.

Annual Report 2014

Annexes

© Second option: (a) no interest charges on NTF loans; (b) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (c) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (d) a 15-year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period.

¢ Third option: Same terms as for the ADB private sector
loans, taking into consideration provisions of the guidelines
for the Bank's private sector financing as well as the risk
analysis of the project.

Loans granted prior to the revision of the Agreement carried

interest at rates ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent, with a
commission of 0.75 percent on undisbursed portions.

Dr. Akinwumi Ayodeji Adesina
President of the African Development Bank Group

Following my election as President of the African Development Bank Group and subsequent assumption
of duty on 1 September 2015, | have rolled out my vision to accelerate the implementation of the Bank’s
Ten-Year Strategy during my tenure, building on the achievements of my predecessor, Dr. Donald Kaberuka.
Let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Boards of Governors for giving me the
privilege and honor to serve the Bank Group and Africa. In fulfilment of the mandate entrusted to me,
have the pleasure of presenting the 2015 Bank Group Annual Report.

The Annual Report notes the resilience of Africa’s economic performance in 2015 amid global and regional
headwinds, notably the persistent decline in commodity prices and the El Nino weather conditions in
several African countries. Real GDP growth averaged 3.6 percent in Africa, the second highest after
emerging and developing Asia’s 6.6 percent. Africa was also home to five of the world’s fastest-growing
en economies in 2015. However, there are numerous challenges confronting the continent. Inequality
remains high and poverty, hunger, and malnutrition are deeply entrenched, thus requiring concerted
efforts to accelerate inclusive growth and employment creation, especially among the youth.

To overcome these challenges, | have laid out a five-pronged priority development agenda, which |
call the High 5s, for a scaled-up implementation of the Ten-Year Strategy. These are: To Light Up and
Power Africa, To Feed Africa, To industrialize Africa, To Integrate Africa, and To Improve the Quality of
ife for the People of Africa.| am pleased to report that during the last quarter of 2015, the Bank Group worked with partners to
develop the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which seeks to build transformative partnerships to underpin
the achievement of universal access to energy by 2025. Similarly, the Bank Group convened the Dakar
High-Level Conference, which produced an Action Plan to tackle food insecurity and create an agroindustrialization process towards the transformation of Africa’s agriculture. We have also launched the
“Jobs for Youth in Africa” initiative to increase youth employment, and the “Affirmative Finance Action
for Women in Africa” initiative to support women-owned enterprises. In addition, we will address the
barriers to integration of Africa’s markets by supporting regional value chains and investing in high-quality
regional infrastructure.

Despite the unfavorable global financial environment, the Bank Group enhanced the quality of its
portfolio while striving to maintain a strong financial position. The Bank Group’s AAA credit rating for
senior debt was reaffirmed with a stable outlook. This attests to the robustness of the measures put in
place to ensure sound capital adequacy and prudent financial and risk management. As a result, the
Bank Group was able to maintain the strategic focus on the priority areas of its Ten-Year Strategy. Total
commitments in 2015 increased by 25 percent to reach USD 8.8 billion, from USD 7 billion in 2014.
Almost half of the total approvals were for infrastructure development, a pre-requisite for inclusive growth.

We are pleased to complete the move to our Headquarters in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire, with 1,126 Bank
personnel having returned from Tunis by the end of 2015. We remain indebted to the Government and
people of Tunisia for their warm hospitality during the 11 years we operated from Tunis. | also thank
the Government of Céte d'Ivoire for facilitating the Bank’s return to its Headquarters.

Finally, | wish to pay a special tribute to the shareholders and partners for their unequivocal support
during the year. | also express my appreciation to our Boards of Directors, to Management, and to staff
for their contributions and commitment throughout the year. As we begin consultations for the ADF-14
replenishment cycle, we will count on this support to enable us to carry out the mandate of building
an inclusive and sustainable future for the people of Africa.

xiExecutive Summary

Executive Summary

The African Development Bank Group’s operations, sector
strategies and policy engagements in 2015 were guided by
the twin objectives of achieving inclusive and green growth
as enshrined in its Ten-Year Strategy (TYS). These objectives
are critical in creating better opportunities for the people,
particularly vulnerable groups, mainly children and women,
and in lifting millions out of poverty. In keeping with this
objective therefore, the theme of the 2015 Annual Report is
“Energy and Climate Change: Implications for Inclusive and
Green Growth in Africa”.

The Report is presented in three main parts. Part | examines
Africa’s economic performance and prospects within the
context of global developments, and elaborates on the theme
of the Report. Part Il reviews Bank Group interventions in
the operational priority areas of the TYS. It also discusses
the development effectiveness of Bank Group operations,
examines the corporate management activities of the Bank’s
organizational units, and presents the governance structure
of the Bank Group, paying particular attention to the activities,
oversight functions and strategic responsibilities of the Boards.
Part Ill presents the financial management and financial
statements. It also outlines the management of financial
performance in turbulent times.

Africa Maintained Resilience

Amid Global and Regional Headwinds

Africa’s economic performance has remained resilient amid
global and regional headwinds. Average real Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) grew by 3.6 percent in 2015, higher than the
global average of 3.1 percent, and the Eurozone average of
1.6 percent. In 2015, five African countries were among the
world’s ten fastest-growing countries with real GDP growth
of 7 percent or higher. Despite this high growth, the number
of the poor in Africa has increased and inequalities persist.
Structural transformation in sectors that provide livelinoods to
the majority, such as agriculture and small businesses, remains
a crucial piece of the development puzzle, as it can raise overall
productivity, improve living standards, and reduce poverty.

xii

Macroeconomic Stability. The continent’s macroeconomic
balance has come under pressure due to weakening global
economic conditions and other adverse shocks. In 2015, the
iscal deficit is estimated to have risen to 6.6 percent of GDP
rom 4.8 percent the preceding year. The widening fiscal deficit
mainly reflects a fall in revenues due to a decline in earnings
rom commodity exports, coupled with an increase in capital
expenditure. The evolution in the external current account
position mirrored the trend of the fiscal balance. For Africa
as a whole, the external current account deficit weakened
0 7.3 percent in 2015 from 4.8 percent in the previous year.

However, Africa’s prospects for 2016 and beyond appear
favorable, underpinned by strong domestic consumer demand
and fiscal consolidation measures to contain the commodity
price shock. The downside risks in the medium term include
he continued decline in commodity prices and The El Nifo
weather conditions that are expected to persist in a number
of African countries. On balance, growth in 2016 is therefore
projected to increase modestly to 3.7 percent, and accelerate
urther to 4.5 percent in 2017.

Support from the Bank Group. The Bank Group is ready
© assist Regional Member Countries (RMCs) weather the
headwinds confronting the continent by providing them with
imely countercyclical support to enhance the resilience of
economies. The Bank Group has also stepped up its analytical
capacity to provide economic intelligence, policy advice and
related technical support to strengthen macroeconomic policy
management.

 

Energy and Climate Change Nexus

Energy and climate change. Africa’s ability to deliver
structural transformation for inclusive growth and achieve
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) hinges on access
to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.
Today, over 645 million people in Africa do not have access
to electricity, 700 million have no access to clean cooking
energy, and 600,000 die each year from indoor pollutioncaused by a reliance on biomass for cooking. Energy sector
bottlenecks and power shortages are estimated to cost about
2 to 4 percent of GDP annually, undermining economic growth,
employment creation, and investment.

Africa is capable of achieving universal access to energy services
while reducing the carbon intensity of growth, thus lowering its
contributions to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. About
7.7 percent of the world’s proved conventional oil reserves, 7.6
percent of proven natural gas reserves, and 3.7 percent of
remaining coal reserves are in Africa. The continent has well
over 10 Terawatts (TW) of solar potential, 350 Gigawatts (GW)
of hydroelectric potential, 110 GW of wind potential and an
additional 15 GW of geothermal potential.

The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change committed to
emission reductions consistent with staying well below the 2°C
threshold and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to
1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The intersections between
energy and climate-change policies could limit Africa’s ability
to harness its conventional energy resources, especially oil,
gas and coal. This calls for innovative policies and financing
models that harness synergies and limit trade-offs. The Bank
Group has announced the New Deal on Energy for Africa and
a Transformative Partnership on Energy for Africa, to light up
and power Africa by 2025, while decoupling the continent’s
economic productivity from carbon dioxide emissions.

Bank Group Operations, 2015

Bank Group Approvals and Disbursements. As in the previous
years, and in line with the Bank Group’s TYS, infrastructure
operations, mainly transport and energy, received the bulk of the
resources. In 2015, total approvals of Bank Group operations
amounted to UA 6.33 billion as at end-December 2015, a
25.4 percent increase over 2014 approvals of UA 5.05 billion
in 2014. Total Bank Group approvals for 2015 are made up
of total African Development Bank (ADB) public and private
approvals (UA 4.52 billion), African Development Fund (ADF)
approvals (UA 1.52 billion), Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) approvals
(UA 12.5 million) and Special Funds (UA 288.9 million).

In 2015, Bank Group loan and grant disbursements (excluding
equity participation, guarantees, and Special Funds), amounted
to VA3.03 billion. Since 2012, actual disbursements against
targets have diverged, as indicated by the decline of the
disbursement rate from 98 percent in 2012 to 81.9 percent
in 2015. Disbursement delays have been caused by weak
institutional and management capacity in some RMCs, and

the fragility situations and conflicts, among other factors.
The Bank Group has been making concerted efforts to
address the disbursement delays, including strengthening the
monitoring and reporting of recurring issues, and streamlining
the operational business processes affecting disbursements.

Ten-Year Strategy Priority Sectors

The TYS emphasizes priority sectors comprising infrastructure
(energy, transport, water and sanitation, and communications),
private sector development, regional integration, governance,
and skills and human development.

Energy. The Bank Group’s total approvals for the energy
sector in 2015 amounted to UA 871.6 million, made up of
loan and grant approvals of UA 841 million (96.5 percent)
and other approvals of UA 30.6 million (8.5 percent). The
energy sector approvals represented 28.3 percent of total
Bank Group infrastructure approvals. To mobilize partnership
support and financing to close Africa’s huge energy deficit,
the Bank held a High-Level Consultative Stakeholder Meeting
in September 2015 where the New Deal on Energy for Africa
was articulated. The African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREl),
was also announced at the Climate Change Conference of
Parties (COP21) in December 2015.

Environment and Climate Change. One key area of the Bank
Group’s activities in 2015 was the support towards climatechange adaptation and mitigation issues. The Bank Group
announced that it will triple its financing for climate-change
initiatives to reach USD 5 billion a year by 2020.

Transport. In 2015, Bank Group total approvals for transport
sector operations amounted to UA 1.72 billion, with loans
and grants accounting for UA 1.58 billion (91.9 percent). The
remaining UA 139.5 million (8.1 percent) represented financing
through Special Funds. Approvals for the transport sector
represented the largest share (65.9 percent) of the UA 3.08
billion total Bank Group approvals for all infrastructure operations.

Water and Sanitation. During the year, the Bank Group’s
interventions contributed to the development of the water
supply and sanitation sector in the RMCs, with total operations
of UA 398.7 million approved for sustaining livelihoods in
several countries. The Bank Group continued to host and
support three special and complementary initiatives: the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the
Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP), and the
African Water Facility (AWF).

 

xiiiExecutive Summary

Regional Integration. In 2015, total approvals for regional
(multinational) operations amounted to UA 1.44 billion, a 34
percent increase from the 2014 approvals of UA 1.08 billion. Of
the total regional approvals, the largest share (40.2 percent) was
allocated to transport. This was followed by the finance sector
(25.3 percent) for lines of credit and trade finance, and the
energy sector (23.8 percent), with smaller shares for multisector
operations, agricultural, social, and communications sectors.

Private-Sector Operations. During 2015, energy and other
infrastructure investments benefited significantly from the
Bank's private sector-financing window. Total Bank Group
approvals of private sector-financed operations in 2015
amounted to UA 1.56 billion, a marginal decline of 1.9 percent
from the UA 1.59 billion recorded in 2014. In 2015, of the
total private sector approvals of UA 1.56 billion, finance sector
approvals (lines of credit, trade finance, etc.) accounted for
the largest share (42.9 percent), followed by energy (22.7
percent), with the remainder going to transport operations
(19.5 percent), agriculture (10.2 percent), and other sectors.

Supporting Economic and Governance Reforms. As at
end-December 2015, total approvals for governance-related
operations amounted to UA 788.9 million. Two of the approved
operations include: (i) Niger’s Financial Reforms and Food
Security Support Programme (PAREFSA 1) for UA 20 million;
and (ii) Malis Emergency Governance and Economic Recovery
Support Program (EGERSP) for UA 15 million.

Promoting Skills and Human Development. The sum of
UA 595.9 million was approved to support various human
development and relief operations during 2015. One of the
operations highlighted is a grant of UA 23.9 million approved
for the Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund Project
(PERSIF) for the three worst-affected West African countries
(Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone).

Areas of Ten-Year Strategy Special Emphasis

The TYS also emphasizes support to the special areas of
agriculture and food security, gender mainstreaming, and
addressing fragility and building resilience. Operational
activities in these areas during 2015 are highlighted below.

Agriculture. Bank Group approvals in the agriculture sector
amounted to UA 514.6 million. In line with the TYS, the
Bank Group organized the Dakar High-Level Conference
on Agricultural Transformation in October 2015 for over
600 participants, including 155 high-level Government

xiv

representatives, including Ministers of Agriculture, Finance and

Trade, and Central Bank Governors. The conference endorsed
an 18-point Action Plan for African Agricultural Transformation,
which is guiding the preparation of the continental long-term
strategy for agricultural transformation (2016-25).

Gender. Implementation of the Bank Group’s Gender Strategy,
2014-2018, was accelerated in April 2015 with the establishment
of a network of 85 gender focal points throughout the Bank.
Three capacity-building workshops were held to support the
focal points in September and October 2015. During the
Dakar High-Level Conference on Agricultural Transformation
in Africa in October 2015, the AfDB President announced
the “Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa” targeted
at: (i) women-owned micro-enterprises, particularly those of
rural women; and (ii) women-owned small- and medium-sized
enterprises operating in different economic sectors.

Countries under Fragile Situations. In 2015, the ADF
Board approved UA 365.7 million in support of 16 countries
considered to be in fragile situations. The Board also approved
he Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the Strategy
on Fragility and the Transition Support Facility (TSF). In addition,
he ADF has revised its approach to using the resources of the
TSF meant for critical capacity building interventions.

The Bank Group’s new Operational Strategic Orientation.
The eighth President of the Bank Group, Dr. Akinwumi Ayodeji
Adesina, laid out a new strategic operational agenda for the Bank
Group, outlined in the “High 5s”, aimed at providing a sharp
locus on the Bank Group’s work as it implements the TYS. The
High 5s are to: Light up and Power Africa; Feed Africa; Integrate
Africa; Industrialize Africa; and Improve the Quality of Life for the
People of Africa. These operational priorities are consistent with
he SDGs and therefore essential in transforming the lives of the
people of Africa through rapid, sustained, and inclusive growth.

mplementation of the High 5s will require building on the
oundations of the existing Bank Group sector strategies
and policies, particularly the regional integration policy and
strategy, the private sector development strategy, the human
capital strategy, the financial sector development policy and
strategy, and the energy policy.

 

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness

and Corporate Management

Budget Reforms and Administrative Budget. In 2015, the
Bank’s management of the administrative budget was aimedat achieving strategic prioritization of resources, efficient and
effective delivery of its development programs, aggregate
fiscal discipline, and establishing clear lines of accountability.
In addition, the implementation of budget reforms was an
integral part of a broader institutional reform agenda to improve
coordination, delivery and corporate performance.

Decentralization. During the year, the implementation of the
Decentralization Roadmap Action Plan (2011-2015) included
a review of the pilot Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) in
Eastern and Southern Africa which were established in 2012.
The findings from the review exercise were instrumental in the
Boards’ decision to approve the establishment of a third RRC
for the Northern Africa Region.

Return to the Headquarters (HQ). By end-December 2015,
a total of 1,126 staff had been successfully moved and settled
in Abidjan. The Bank took advantage of its return to Abidjan
to launch several projects for the renovation and rehabilitation
of its HQ facilities in Abidjan.

Development Effectiveness. During the year, the Bank
Group continued to make progress in establishing quality
social and environmental safeguards, enhancing the quality
of its operations, and strengthening its ability to measure
and manage for development results. The 2015 Annual
Development Effectiveness Review was its flagship publication
for highlighting development results. The AfDB also broadened
its results culture by monitoring the quality and level of
confidence in project rating through its readiness reviews (RR),
implementation progress and review reports (IPR), and project
completion reports (PCRs). Data were published quarterly in
the Quality Assurance Dashboard and circulated to senior
management and departments for follow-up action.

The Bank as a Knowledge Broker. The Bank Group’s
Knowledge Program in 2015 was implemented through the
production and dissemination of several knowledge products,
statistical publications, and capacity building activities. The
knowledge products include flagship publications, books,
journals, working papers, data banks, and advisory services
for the benefit of the RMCs.

Policies and Strategies. The implementation of the TYS
entered its third year in 2015, with a focus on policies and
operational strategies that support inclusive and green growth.
In 2015, the Bank Group approved the following five new
policies, strategies, and operational guidelines: (i) Procurement

Policy and Methodology for Bank Group Funded Operations;
(ii) Bank Group Knowledge Management Strategy, 2015-2020;
(iii) African Natural Resources Center Strategy, 2015-2020;
(iv) Strategic Framework and Operational Guidelines for the
Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility; and (v) Regional
Integration Policy and Strategy (RIPOS).

Mid-Term Review of the ADF-13 Replenishment. The
ADF Deputies met in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, in November
2015 for the ADF-13 Mid-Term Review. The lower loan and
grant disbursement rates, and the slow uptake of innovative
financing were of major concern to the ADF Deputies. In
addition the Deputies stressed the importance of improving
gender balance within the institution, and at management
level in particular. On the whole, they agreed that most of the
commitments at the Mid-Term Review had been met under
the ADF-13 replenishment, and that consultations for the
ADF-14 should focus on addressing outstanding elements
in ADF-13 and accelerating the implementation of the TYS.

Independent Evaluation of Bank Group Operations. The
independent evaluation of Bank Group operations delivered
in 2015 provided evidence-based and credible information
to shape the AfDB’s work in several strategic areas, and
contributed to better decision making within the institution.
During the year, three flagship evaluations were carried out:
(i) Independent Evaluation of General Capital Increase VI, and
African Development Fund 12th and 138th Commitments;
(ii) Independent Evaluation of Policy and Strategy Making
and Implementation; and (iii) Independent Evaluation of
Administrative Budget Management of the African Development
Bank. Two thematic evaluations were also delivered in 2015:
(i) Evaluation of AfDB Assistance to SMEs; and (ii) an Evaluation
of the Bank’s Private Equity Investments. In addition, country
evaluations included an impact evaluation on rural water supply
and sanitation in Ethiopia.

 

Deployment of Human Resources. As at end-December
2015, the total AfDB staff strength stood at 1,841 with 1,168
males (63.4 percent) and 673 females (86.6 percent). The total
staff distribution was as follows: 1,215 professional staff, of
which 324 (26.7 percent) are female, and 587 general service
staff, of which 336 (67.2 percent) are female.

XVExecutive Summary

he Boards of Governors and the Boards of Directors. The
50th Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Bank
and the 41st Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the
Fund were held in Abidjan, Cdte d’lvoire, from 25 to 29 May
2015. The Annual Meetings coincided with the celebrations
of the 50th anniversary of the AfDB.

n the exercise of their statutory duties, the Boards of
Governors adopted nine resolutions. Among the highlights
were: (i) the election of Dr. Adesina as the eighth President
of the African Development Bank Group; and (ii) the vote of
Thanks to Dr. Donald Kaberuka, the outgoing President, for
he eminent services rendered to the African Development
Bank Group. In particular, the Governors paid glowing tribute
© Dr. Kaberuka, for his inspiring and visionary leadership in

 

successfully overseeing the major redirection of the Bank
Group's strategy over his ten-year presidency.

Financial Management

Strong Financial Position. In the face of continuing turbulence
in the financial markets in 2015, the Bank maintained a
conservative investment strategy, which helped to limit interest
rate and exchange rate sensitivity, thus reducing negative
impacts of the Bank’s exposure to financial markets. The four
key rating agencies, Standard and Poor's, Fitch, Moody’s
and Japan Credit Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA/Aaa
and AA+/Aa1 ratings of the Bank's senior and subordinated
debts respectively, with a stable outlook. The high ratings
confirm the Bank's efficient management, strong financial
position, membership support, capital adequacy and liquidity.T 1

Africa’s Performance and Prospects in a Period of Global Economic Turbulence

 

Africa’s economic performance has remained resilient amid global and regional headwinds. Average real GDP grew
by 3.6 percent in 2015 compared with 3.7 percent the previous year. Indeed, five of the world’s ten fastest-growing
economies with real GDP growth of 7 percent or higher were in Africa. It should be noted however, that the continent
continues to exhibit significant regional variations in the patterns of growth but medium-term growth prospects appear
favorable, mainly underpinned by strong domestic consumer demand and robust public investment in infrastructure.
The downside risks to the outlook include the continued decline in commodity prices and the El Nifo weather
conditions. In view of this, growth in 2016 is projected to increase slightly to 3.7 percent and accelerate further to
4.5 percent in 2017 as global and regional conditions improve and ongoing policy initiatives take hold. To contain the
adverse effects of the commodity price shocks on growth and macroeconomic stability, countries are encouraged
to implement countercyclical policies and undertake structural reforms in order to create the conditions for growth,
necessary to improve human conditions—an imperative for the agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

1.1. Africa’s Growth Remains Resilient
Africa has endured the global headwinds, but growth has
remained resilient. In 2015, Africa was home to five of the
world’s ten fastest-growing economies. However, economic
activity on the continent still exhibits substantial regional and
country variations, portending differences in the drivers of
growth, state of macroeconomic prudence, and the virility
of policy responses. On average, Eastern African economies
have registered faster growth than their peers.

Africa’s economic growth has held firm amid global and
regional headwinds. This reflects the resilience of its
economies, underpinned by years of steely macroeconomic
policy implementation and public infrastructure investment.
In 2015, real GDP growth in Africa averaged 3.6 percent
compared with 3.7 percent in 2014. This growth outturn was
higher than the global average and that of Latin America and
advanced nations, notably the Eurozone and the United States.
Only East Asia and Emerging Economies together posted
higher growth than Africa, making Africa the second fastestgrowing economy in the world. Table 1.1 below shows Africa’s
growth performance from a regional and global perspective.

In 2015, Céte d’lvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Rwanda were among the ten
fastest-growing countries in the world with real GDP growth

averaging 7 percent and above. This number increased from
four countries (Céte d'Ivoire, DRC, Ethiopia, and Mozambique)
recorded in 2014. Growth in these countries was largely driven
by strong public investment in infrastructure, which is expected
to remain buoyant in the medium term. Furthermore, strong
domestic consumption and expansion in the services sector,
especially retail, finance, and information, communications and
technology, fortified Africa’s resilience. This signifies a gradual
diversification of African economies, which if supported by
a sound policy environment, could become the continent’s
bedrock for sustained growth.

The continent’s growth also reflects developments in Foreign

Direct Investment (FDI) and other external financial flows. The
structure of FDI has changed over the years and is no longer
concentrated in extractive industries. About 48 percent of
total FDI inflows to Africa are now directed to non-resource
sectors, which reflects the emergence of other sectors as
important investment and growth drivers.

Africa’s equity markets recorded net portfolio outflows. In
2014, net inflows amounted to USD 23.1 billion, but this figure
decreased to USD 13.4 billion in 2015, which represents
an outflow of about USD 10 billion during this period. The
decrease was mainly recorded in resource sectors, which
have been impacted by the sharp decline in commodity
prices. This points to the importance of strengthening policyTable 1.1

the destabilizing effects on the economy triggered by volatile
external portfolio flows.

1.1.1 Variations in Regional Economic Growth

Africa’s growth exhibits significant regional and country
variations, reflecting differences in resource endowments,
degrees of fragility, exposures to external shocks, and the
flexibility and strength of the policy responses to those shocks.

Eastern Africa. Growth in Eastern Africa has been consistently
higher than in other regions, despite some specific regional
shocks, including security concerns and periodic variations in
weather conditions. Average growth in the region is estimated
at 6.3 percent in 2015, marginally below the 6.5 percent in
2014. A contraction in output in Burundi and South Sudan,
both of which experienced political instability in 2015, weighed
down the region’s economic performance. However, the full
extent of this contraction was moderated by higher growth
in other countries within this region, notably Ethiopia, Djibouti,
Rwanda, and Tanzania.

Central Africa. Average growth fell sharply to 3.7 percent from
6.1 percent in 2014. The decline in oil prices contributed to the
fall in output growth in Congo from 6 percent to 1.2 percent,
while lower metal prices led to a marginal decline in output
growth of the DRC, whose economy registered 7.7 percent

growth in 2015 compared to 9.2 percent in 2014. Still, this
growth rate was higher than the 7 percent deemed necessary
to significantly improve poverty levels. Thus, translating this
growth into tangible development outcomes is the remaining
challenge for the DRC, and concerted efforts are required to
consolidate the gains achieved so far.

Western Africa. Average growth in the region declined sharply
0 3.3 percent in 2015 from 6 percent the previous year. The
slowdown in growth was mainly due to weaker performance in
he oil sector in Nigeria, the region’s largest economy, and in Niger,
another commodity-dependent country. Although the share of
Ebola-affected countries is smaller in overall GDP in Western
Africa, weak growth performance in Guinea (0.1 percent) and
Liberia (0.4 percent), and severe contraction in Sierra Leone
-21.5 percent), also capped output growth in the region.

Northern Africa. Growth more than doubled in this region
‘0 3.5 percent in 2015 from 1.4 percent in 2014 on the back
of improvements in the political and economic environments,
especially in Egypt. Stronger business confidence in Egypt
led to an expansion of growth to 4.2 percent in 2015 from
2.2 percent in 2014. However, economic recovery in this
region was overshadowed by political instability in Libya,
with attendant adverse effects on oil production and, terrorist
attacks in Tunisia, which led to a contraction of about 15
percent in the tourism sector in the country.Chapter 1

Southern Africa. In 2015, growth slowed to an average of 2.2
percent from 2.8 percent in 2014, making Southern Africa the
slowest growing region on the continent. Without exception,
all countries in the region posted slower growth. In general,
the region has experienced major structural shocks, stemming
largely from an acute shortage of power supply and hostile
weather conditions, which adversely affected agricultural
production and water levels for hydropower generation. This
was compounded by low commodity prices, leading to a
reduction in mining activities and lower foreign exchange
earnings, and to a depreciation in exchange rates. Even for
Mozambique, the region’s fastest-growing economy, growth
slowed down to 6.3 percent in 2015 from 7.2 percent the
previous year. South Africa, the region’s largest economy,
continued to experience lackluster performance due to
subdued demand and low prices of metals, which account
for a sizable share of the country’s exports. This problem was
compounded by challenges in electricity supply, which affected
economic activity in many sectors of the economy. In view
of these constraints, the country’s real GDP growth declined
to 1.3 percent in 2015 from 1.5 percent the preceding year.

1.2 Importance of Commodity
Prices in Driving Growth in Africa

Africa’s growth has largely been ascribed to the commodity
super-cycle. However, estimates indicate that only 21.4 percent
of Africa’s average growth of 4.2 percent over the past decade
could be explained by the rise in commodity prices. Therefore, the
growth impact of the recent fall in commodity prices will, depend
on its intensity and duration, and the strength of internal and
external buffers that countries built up during the boom period.

There is broad consensus in global discourse that the
commodity price super-cycle has played an important role
in the ‘Africa Rising’ narrative. While this may be true for oilexporting countries, the effect of other commodities on growth
may be less pronounced. As the commodity price boom
tapers off, it will be instructive to conduct an assessment of
the effect of commodity prices on Africa’s real GDP growth. An
African Development Bank Group study (forthcoming) shows
that, although commodity prices have played a role in driving
growth, the magnitude has been lower than previously thought.

1.2.1 Evolution of World Commodity Prices
The pace of the decline in prices of key commodities
accelerated in 2015, following a more gradual decline the

previous year. The index of crude oil prices declined by
about 64 percent on average in 2015 while price indices of
metals and agricultural raw materials fell by an average of 26
percent and 15 percent, respectively. Box 1.1 lists commodity
classifications while Figure 1.1 depicts the evolution in selected
commodity price indices.

Note: Non-energy commodities include food and agricultural raw materials
and metalsThe global supply of crude oil is likely to remain high during
most of 2016. Besides higher-than-expected production
from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) producers, falling costs of the US shale-oil industry
also present downside risks to the global oil market. Upside
risks include the delayed implementation of the Iran Nuclear
Agreement. This could stoke a rebound in prices, although
the increase may not be sufficient to offset the impact of the
current excess supply. Consequently, prices could remain
depressed, as Figure 1.1 shows.

The recovery in the price of non-energy commodities is
expected to be equally slow. Downside risks to prices include
slower demand in China. For metal prices, upside risks include
closures of high-cost mines and delays in bringing on-stream
new cost-efficient production capacity. A recovery in global
demand, especially in struggling Europe and slowing China,
could boost prices in non-fuel commodities.

1.2.2 Short-Term Impact

of Changes in Commodity Prices on Growth

The effect of changes in commodity prices on output in Africa
is presented in Figure 1.2, illustrating the evolution of growth
in real GDP plotted against percent change in a composite
index of commodity prices.

Figure 1.2 highlights co-movement between growth in real
GDP and fluctuations in commodity prices. The effect of
commodity price shocks on real GDP growth appears to
be higher during downturns than in boom periods. This is
true even after accounting for other global economic factors.
Estimates by the Bank Group show that in the short run, a 1
percent change in the price index of all commodities translates
into 0.15 percent growth in real GDP.

Furthermore, since commodity prices increased by an
average of 6 percent from 2010 to 2014, this implies that a
0.9 percentage point gain in growth may be attributed to the
commodity boom during this period. This accounts for 21.4
percent of Africa’s average growth of 4.2 percent recorded
during the same period. This figure also correlates with the
McKinsey (2010) findings, that 24 percent of growth in Africa
between 2000 and 2008 was from natural resources.

With such magnitude of the change in commodity prices on
growth, the severity of the fall in commodity prices will depend
on its duration and the strength of internal and external buffers
countries built up during the boom period. In general therefore,

countercyclical policy and adjustment measures may be required
for affected countries in order to cushion the economy from a
decline in domestic revenues generated by falling commodity prices.

1.3 Medium-Term Economic Prospects

Despite continuing challenges to global growth and volume
of trade, growth in Africa is expected to remain favorable
on the back of steady diversification, supported by public
infrastructure investment. Growth performances will also
continue to vary within the different regions of the continent.

Recovery in the global economy is expected to remain weak.
Apart from the slowdown in China and other emerging markets,
the protracted low commodity price environment continues
to raise concerns on global growth in the medium term. The
gradual rise in the US benchmark interest rate and prospects
of further increases could lead to tightening of global financial
conditions, which could result in higher borrowing costs for
African countries. Growth in some emerging economies could
also weaken, amplified by the slowing economy in China and
deep recession in Brazil. Against this background, the global
economy is projected to grow by 3.2 percent in 2016 and
further strengthen to 3.5 percent in 2017.Chapter 1

Despite these factors noted above, growth in Africa is
expected to remain favorable. Real GDP is forecast to increase
to an average of 3.7 percent in 2016 and further expand by
4.5 percent the following year. The continent’s economic
growth is poised to continue to outpace that of advanced
economies, as well as of Latin America and the Caribbean.
Only East Asian economies are likely to expand at a faster
rate. In this regard, Africa is likely to maintain its position as
the second fastest-growing regional economy in the world,
but economic performance will continue to exhibit regional
variations (see Table 1.2).

Consumer spending, especially in retail and other services,
and public investment in infrastructure will remain key drivers
of growth in Africa. Over the past five years, the construction
sector (underpinned by large public infrastructure projects) has
contributed about 3 percentage points to Africa’s growth. The
services sector (driven mainly by expansion in retail, financial,
and information, communications and technology industries)
has contributed about 2 percentage points. In comparison, the
extractive industries (mining, quarrying, oil, and gas) accounted
for about 1 percentage point. This shows that diversification
is taking root in a number of countries, as sources of growth
are not wholly anchored on the extractive industries.

Central Africa. Average growth is projected at 3.9 percent
in 2016 and it is expected to expand further to 5 percent in

2017. The commodity price boom, which had fueled past
growth in the region, is tapering off, and countries in the region
must now search for alternative sources of growth. Public
investment in infrastructure must continue apace to open
up opportunities for private sector participation. Following
successful presidential elections in Central African Republic,
the peace dividend will be an important factor to underpin
growth in the near term.

Eastern Africa. Economic growth is forecast to reach an
average of above 6 percent over the next two years, higher
than in other African regions. This growth forecast is anchored
on strong manufacturing activity, buoyant consumer spending,
higher intra-regional trade and continued investment in public
infrastructure. Regional shocks, including the conflicts in
Burundi and South Sudan, are the main downside risks to
growth in the region. Generally favorable growth prospects in
Rwanda and Ethiopia should continue to prevail even though
the latter is experiencing renewed drought. The Ethiopian
Government has, however, taken measures to avert a food
and humanitarian crisis. Public infrastructure could be the
main lever maintaining growth in 2016 at above 8 percent
and 6 percent in Ethiopia and Rwanda, respectively.

Western Africa. Strengthening political stability in Cote d'Ivoire
and the declaration of the end of the Ebola crisis in Guinea,
Liberia, and Sierra Leone could provide impetus to the region’sChapter 1

 

Access to electricity allows school children extra time to study at home in Egypt.

economic performance. Average growth for the region is
projected to recover to 4.3 percent in 2016, and increase further
to 5.5 percent in 2017. Preserving these gains will therefore be
key, especially in Cdte d'Ivoire where growth in 2016 is projected
at more than 8 percent. Guinea and Liberia are also projected
to grow by 4 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in 2016,
signifying the rapid recovery from the harsh effects of the Ebola
outbreak. This underscores the importance of countercyclical
interventions, which helped limit the impact of the Ebola crisis.
In Nigeria and Ghana, the decline in commodity prices could
further trim growth and constrain fiscal space for expanded
social spending. On the other hand policy reforms are gaining
momentum in Ghana, and the economy is projected to expand
by 5.8 percent in 2016 and by 8.7 percent in 2017. In Nigeria,
the authorities have also instituted wide-ranging measures to
deal with the fiscal gap created by the decline in oil revenues
and, to consolidate recent improvements in non-oil sectors.

However, given the intensity of the oil-price shock, economic
growth in Nigeria is forecast to be lower at 3.8 percent in 2016
before picking up the pace to 5 percent in 2017 as current fiscal
measures initiated by the Government take effect.

Northern Africa. In this region, economic growth is expected
to remain subdued in the medium term. Growth in the region
is projected at 3.3 percent in 2016, increasing to 3.8 percent
the following year. Foreign Direct Investment, especially in
Morocco and Egypt, could be a core driver of this growth.
However, the region remains immersed in post-Arab Spring
fragility. High rates of youth unemployment and security
concerns could be the main challenges to growth and social
cohesion in the region. In particular, the tourism sector could
experience further setbacks due to recent terrorist attacks in
Egypt and Tunisia while the prolonged conflict in Libya also
constitutes a risk to medium term economic recovery.Chapter 1

Southern Africa. Growth will continue to be affected by
broad-based weakness in the region as the effects of the El
Nifo weather conditions permeate different sectors of the
economy, especially those linked to the performance of the
agriculture sector. Furthermore, nearly all countries in the
region are exposed to the commodity price shock, which
has led to steep depreciation of exchange rates in some
countries. Other downside risks include persistent electricity
supply shortages across the region, exacerbated by drought.
n 2016, average growth in Southern Africa is projected to fall
0 1.9 percent but recovery is forecast at 2.8 percent in 2017,
he highest in three years. This recovery is predicated on the
restoration of reliable electricity supply conditions following
he completion of ongoing hydropower investment projects.
Recovery is also dependent on the current fiscal consolidation
measures in a number of countries taking hold. In South Africa,
he region’s largest economy, addressing structural challenges
and restoring investor confidence will be critical stimulating
growth and job creation, especially among the youth.

 

The Bank Group has an important role to play in assisting
countries weather the headwinds buffeting the continent,
especially those emanating from the fall in commodity prices
and structural problems. The experience gained in dealing
with the global financial meltdown and the recent Ebola
crisis demonstrates the Bank Group’s capability to deploy
countercyclical measures in stabilizing internal and external
macroeconomic and social conditions in Regional Member
Countries (RMCs).

1.4 Macroeconomic Conditions:
Performance and Prospects

In the medium term, fiscal and external imbalances will remain
high, largely due to domestic factors and external shocks.
In resource-rich economies, the persistence of the external
current account deficit hinges on the duration of the decline
in commodity prices.

1.4.1 Fiscal and External Account Positions

Generally, African countries have maintained sound fiscal
and monetary policies, which have contributed to broad
macroeconomic stability. However, as noted above, the
unfavorable global economic environment threatens to reverse
these gains as evidenced by a widening of both fiscal and
current account deficits in 2015 (see Table 1.3). The increase
in the fiscal deficit mainly reflects a fall in revenues due to a

10

Africa’s Performance and Prospects in a Period of Global Economic Turbulence

decline in commodity exports, coupled with an increase in
capital expenditure.

For oil-exporting countries, a sharp fall in revenues poses the
greatest risk to the budget. The fiscal deficit for this group
of countries reached 8.1 percent of GDP in 2015 from 5.3
percent in the preceding year, and it is expected to remain
at this elevated level in 2016 as the effects of lower oil prices
continue to be felt. Similarly, the current account deficit for
oil-exporting countries more than doubled to 7.3 percent of
GDP in 2015 from 2.9 percent in 2014. Although the fiscal
deficit for oil-importing countries also widened to 4.4 percent
in 2015 from 4 percent the previous year, this is much lower
than in their oil-exporting peers. For oil-importing countries,
the increase in the deficit was mainly on account of lower
revenues from non-oil commodity exports, especially minerals,
whose prices also declined in 2015 but the impact was less
severe than for oil-exporting countries. In 2015, the passthrough effect of low oil prices helped to limit the loss in export
earnings of other commodities in oil-importing countries. As
a result, the current account deficit narrowed marginally to
7.3 percent in 2015 from 7.9 percent in 2014.

In 2016, the current account deficit for net oil exporters is
forecast to narrow to 6.4 percent, and tighten further to 5.4
percent of GDP in 2017. The improvement in the external
account position is premised on slow recovery in commodity
prices and improved foreign inflows. Similarly, in net oil-importing
countries, the deficit is projected to narrow but will remain
relatively elevated at about 6.4 percent between 2016 and 2017.

1.4.2 Inflation and Exchange Rates

The pressures felt on the fiscal and external account positions
were not strongly reflected on the inflation front, largely due
to contractionary monetary policy. Thus, in 2015, average
inflation for Africa as a whole remained broadly stable at 7.3
percent compared with 7.2 percent recorded in 2014. In oilexporting countries, average inflation rose to 8.8 percent from
8.2 percent in the previous year, mainly on account of exchange
rate depreciations induced by the oil price shock. In oil-importing
countries, the benefits of lower oil prices were reflected in the
easing of average inflation to 5.2 percent in 2015 from 5.6
percent recorded in 2014. However, in some countries that
depend on metal exports, the effect of lower oil prices was
mitigated by the fall in prices of these commodities. This resulted
in heightened inflationary pressures as decline in revenues from
metal exports led to widening of the fiscal deficit and stoked
depreciation in the exchange rates, which fueled inflation.Table 1.3

In the medium term, inflation is expected to remain stable at
7.2 percent both in 2016 and the following year. This stability
will be underpinned by a combination of fiscal consolidation
measures and tight monetary policy, supported by persistently
low oil prices. Although inflationary pressures are likely to ease
for oil exporters, average inflation for this group of countries
will be higher than their importing counterparts as shown in
Table 1.3.

domestic currencies varied considerably across different
countries. In Ghana and Zambia for example, the authorities
intervened in the foreign exchange market to smoothen

short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. The tightening of
monetary policy by central banks in these countries supported
the policy measures undertaken in the foreign exchange
market. In 2016, the authorities in Ghana and Zambia will
continue to monitor developments in the foreign exchange
market and take appropriate stabilizing measures should
further currency depreciations be observed. In Nigeria, the
authorities introduced restrictions in the foreign exchange
market to manage escalating demand amid reduced inflows.
The Nigerian authorities have eased some of the restrictive
measures introduced in 2015. The net effect of these measures
will largely depend on the pace of the recovery in the price of
oil in the year ahead.

1.5 Africa’s Resilient Growth
and Sustainable Development Goals

For shared prosperity, African governments need to make
appropriate policy choices to accelerate structural change and
foster employment creation. In this regard, enhancing resource
mobilization is crucial for sustaining investment in critical growth
enhancing sectors such as energy, and in financing efforts to
tackle poverty and the effects of climate change.

Over the past decade and half, Africa’s economic growth has
been strong and resilient but has also been characterized
by episodes of volatility. The remaining challenge is to
ensure that growth is further strengthened, sustainable,
and less volatile. This will hinge on stimulating structural
transformation and fostering diversification away from the
extractive sector. In this regard, African countries must
make hard choices on the quality of investment by targeting

growth-enhancing infrastructure projects rather than spending
resources on unproductive public consumption. Ramping up
public infrastructure development is essential for creating a
conducive business and investment climate for a productive
and competitive private sector.

Indeed, Africa’s future economic growth will be driven by an
active private sector that has the capacity to create jobs and
be integrated into the global value chains. Current estimates
show that the informal sector absorbs about 30 million of
the young people entering the labor force annually and
that about 85 percent of poverty in Africa emanates from
subsistence agriculture and the informal sector. Thus, efforts
to reduce poverty and foster inclusive growth must aim at
creating conditions for the transitioning of Africa’s small-scale
businesses and subsistence farmers from a state of informality
to productive economic activities that can generate decent
jobs, especially for the youth, and raise incomes.Box 1.2

countries have made clear progress towards improving maternal health. Notably, Cabo Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, and Rwanda reduced the
maternal mortality ratio by more than 75 percent between 1990 and 2013, thereby meeting MDG 5. Overall, Africa lags behind other regions in

in Northern Africa, access to safe drinking water increased to 91 percent in 2015 from 72 percent in 1990.

Although the proportion of people living on less than USD 1.25
a day declined to an estimated 43 percent in 2014") from
56.8 percent in 1990, the absolute number of poor people
increased to 420 million from 284 million over the same
period. This means that the pace of poverty reduction was
not sufficiently high to achieve the Millennium Development
Goal (MDG) 1 of reducing poverty by half by the end of 2015
(see also Box 1.2 for highlights on progress towards achieving
selected MDGs). Moreover, Africa’s high poverty profile is
exacerbated by inequality in income and along non-income
dimensions: gender, sector, and geography.

Part of Africa’s inability to halve poverty and meet most MDG
targets stems from the fact that the prescriptions were not

fully integrated into National Development Plans. Furthermore,
Africa started from a position of disproportionately high level
of poverty relative to other regions. This made the task of
achieving the agreed MDG targets, especially on poverty,
particularly onerous. Tracking progress has also been a major
challenge due to a lack of reliable data recording.

Therefore, the endorsement of the SDGs in 2015 by
Heads of State and Government is an invitation to rethink
traditional development approaches in order to maximize
impact. Crucially, and unlike the MDGs, the SDGs are
broader in scope, giving greater flexibility for adjusting
policy as conditions dictate. They also target underlying
causes of poverty and inequality, and prescribe options on

tackling different socio-economic and climatic problems in
a systematic and broader context.

To achieve the milestones set out in the SDGs agenda, African
governments must therefore identify the right policies, and
sectoral and infrastructural synergies, to accelerate structural
change and enhance productivity for employment creation
and shared prosperity. However, in a financially constrained
environment, the success of attaining these new ambitious
goals will highly depend on enhancing resource mobilization
capacity of African countries for investment in critical sectors
such as energy, and in financing efforts to tackle the effects
of climate change. In this regard, the Addis Ababa agenda
on “Financing for Development” agreed upon in July, 2015
heralded a new impetus for innovative sources of financing
development by galvanizing the international community
to move from ‘billions’ to ‘trillions’. This will be fortified
through effective partnerships and enhanced policy dialogue,

Energy and Climate Change: Implications for Inclusive and Green Growth in Africa

 

Africa is capable of achieving universal access to energy services by 2025 while reducing the carbon intensity
of growth, and cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The continent is endowed with vast renewable and nonrenewable sources of energy, and with limited sunk costs in carbon-intensive energy infrastructures. Yet Africa is
the continent that is most vulnerable to climate change, while having one of the lowest levels of access to energy
in the world. The continent needs energy to grow and to improve the lives of its people. In Africa, 645 million people
have no access to electricity, and 700 million have no access to clean cooking energy. Many people use biomass
for cooking and 600,000 people die from the resultant indoor pollution. Lack of access means energy usage is
insignificant compared with the more developed world. Per capita electricity consumption in Africa averages 181
kWh compared with 13,000 kWh in the United States and 6,500 kWh in Europe. Power cuts and energy bottlenecks
add to the problem. Energy access must therefore be increased significantly if the continent is to meet the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Goal 7 on universal access to affordable, reliable and modern
energy services, and the reduction of CO, emissions. African governments must play an increasingly active role
by allocating much more funding to the energy sector. It is also imperative to have an enabling environment in
which the private sector can operate, either as Independent Power Producers (IPPs) or participants in publicprivate partnerships. To help expand energy access, the Bank is rallying the continent by spearheading a number
of initiatives, especially the New Deal on Energy for Africa that it proposed in September 2015. It is also working
on a process that will speed up structural transformation through increasing access to energy. It has initiated
processes of working with partners on the New Deal on Energy and also created the Transformative Partnership
on Energy for Africa. The goal is to light up and power Africa by 2025. The New Deal on Energy would speed up
access to energy, driving inclusive and green growth, and boosting industrialization. It would promote regional
power pooling, improve agriculture productivity, and spur job and wealth creation. At the same time, it will work
to avoid increasing CO, emissions while increasing energy access.

2.1 Energy and Structural

This chapter presents the theme for the Bank Group’s

2015 Annual Report, entitled Energy and Climate Change:
Implications for Inclusive and Green Growth in Africa. The
chapter reflects on how Africa can accelerate universal access
to energy services and still adapt to climate change and cut
CO, emissions. The first section discusses the importance
of investment in energy infrastructure through its contribution
to inclusive growth in Africa. The second section deals with
energy access challenges and opportunities for expanding
supplies to achieve inclusive and green growth. The third
section focuses on the Bank’s operational and strategic
agenda on climate change and energy. The measures required
to facilitate a larger rollout of modern energy for inclusive and
green growth are discussed in the fourth section. The final
section looks at strategies for fostering sustainable energy
supply.

Transformation for Inclusive Growth
in Africa

Africa is lagging behind in inclusive growth, partly because
of the dualistic nature of its economies, where so much
activity and employment in the informal sector is casual
and poorly paid. For structural transformation to succeed,
the traditional agricultural and informal urban sectors need
significant technological and institutional upgrades. Energy
infrastructure is a key enabler of structural transformation
and inclusive growth.

Structural transformation is an important driver of inclusive
growth. As noted in Chapter 1, poverty reduction in Africa
has been slow compared with the rest of the developingworld and has fallen short of the Millennium Development
Goal of reducing poverty by half by the end of 2015. The
structure of Africa’s economies is the main cause of this
variance. African countries have a dual economic system—a
traditional and subsistence economy, and a modern and
rapidly growing economy, with few linkages between them.
Close to 70 percent of the labor force is employed in the
traditional economy, which includes the agricultural sector
in rural areas, and the informal sector in urban areas. In
some middle-income countries with relatively advanced
and better-organized economic systems, unemployment,
particularly among the youth, is also high and chronic. Both
types of economic models need to start a process of structural
transformation by adopting basic technology and continually
upgrading the technology ladders to reverse these trends.

Energy infrastructure is a key enabler of structural transformation. A key lever to Africa’s ability to deliver structural
transformation for inclusive growth and achieve the SDGs
is universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and
modern energy, both in the home and at the workplace.
Such access can help companies penetrate new markets,
enable farmers to diversify their income sources, and support
agro-processing industries that link agricultural producers
to national, regional and global markets. Consistent and
steady supplies of energy are essential for the processing of
natural resources, such as aluminum, copper, iron and nickel.
However, energy poverty remains a major challenge and a
considerable gap exists between what is available and what
is required to achieve transformation.

2.2 Energy Challenges and
Opportunities for Inclusive and
Green Growth in Africa

The opportunity costs of the lack of access to modern energy are
numerous and include poor agricultural yields and incomes, poor
health and educational outcomes, and missed life and business
opportunities. However, strategies for expanding energy access
should integrate climate-change concerns to generate structural
transformation for green growth. Energy resources are more
than enough to meet Africa’s needs and the continent has
major potential for renewable energy—hyaro, solar, wind, and
geothermal power. Large energy projects have already been
installed in some countries. They include continuing efforts in
Central Africa to add a third dam (Inga Ill) of 4.8 Gigawatts (GW)
and major hydropower investments in Ethiopia.

Chapter 2

2.2.1 Low Access to Modern,

High Quality, and Reliable Energy in Africa
Africa’s primary energy demand and final consumption
remain relatively low. Energy access and security are at a
very low level on the continent. In 2015, Africa’s primary energy
demand stood at 795 million metric tons of oil equivalent
(Mtoe) while total final energy consumption is 577 Mtoe.)
This represents about 6 percent of the share of global primary
energy demand and total final energy consumption of 13,898
Mtoe and 9,352 Mtoe, respectively, which is relatively low.|2)
There is a stark disparity in Africa’s energy use compared to
that of other regions of the world. Energy use per capita is
one-third of the average across the world (2.1 metric tons of
oil equivalent per capita) and only half the level of developing
Asia, the world’s second most energy-poor region.'°) However,
Africa’s total final energy consumption is projected to show
cumulative growth of 68 percent between 2007 and 2035,
rising annually by 1.8 percent, higher than the expected global
average increase of 1.4 percent.)

Bioenergy dominates primary energy demand and final
consumption. The composition of primary energy demand
and final consumption in Africa is driven largely by resource
endowments and the costs of supply and generation capacity.
in Africa, bioenergy is dominant in the energy mix, accounting
‘or about half of total energy use, in contrast to a proportion
of about a tenth at the global level.(°) Four out of five people in
Africa rely on solid biomass for cooking, typically with inefficient
stoves in poorly ventilated spaces.(®) The extensive use of
irewood and charcoal causes deforestation, land degradation
and change of land-use, and adds to greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. One-fifth of global emissions associated with
jand-use changes originate in Africa.”

Fossil fuels dominate modern energy consumption. In
ine with previous trends, fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and
coal accounted for about 50 percent of consumption in 2015,
and dominated modern energy use in Africa.®) Though high,
his is nevertheless better than the global average proportion
of 80 percent.!®)

All sectors are potentially constrained by lack of energy.
in Africa, economic development is at an early stage, and 67
percent of total energy-use occurs in the residential sector
compared with an average of 25 percent in other developing
countries.''°) The transport sector accounts for only 11 percent
of final energy consumption while productive uses (including
industry, agriculture and services) together account for only 21

industry alone accounts for 30 percent globally and 48 percent
in China. Electricity comprises just 10 percent of Africa’s total
final energy consumption, compared with 18 percent globally,
and 22 percent in China and OECD countries.'"?)

Access to electricity in Africa is low and variable. Africa,
which accounts for 16 percent of the world’s population, is
ranked among the lowest in the world in terms of access to
electricity, with 645 million people without access. Nearly
80 percent of people lacking access to electricity across
sub-Saharan Africa are in rural areas.('9) As noted, 700
million people have no access to clean cooking energy. The
electrification disparities between African countries are also
wide (see Map 2.1). In the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Liberia, Malawi, and Sierra Leone, fewer than one in ten people
have access to electricity.4) As noted, per capita power
consumption in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa)
is the lowest among all continents, and is estimated at 181
kWh per annum, compared with 6,500 kWh in Europe and
13,000 kWh in the United States.!"5) On average, electricity
consumption per capita is less than what is needed to power

Electricity generation capacity in Africa is low. Installed

steadily increasing, reaching 194 GW in 2015.7 Estimates
suggest that gas-fired generation capacity is now 38 percent

oil-fired (18 percent), renewables including hydropower (17
percent), and nuclear (1 percent).'"®) Figure 2.1 portrays actual

Power cuts reduce production and slow down growth.
Power shortages cost Africa 12.5 percent in lost production
time, compared with 7 percent in South Asia. The cost to

world. More than 30 African countries experience frequent
power cuts and load shedding. Resultant opportunity costs
amount to as much as 2 to 4 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) annually, and undermine sustainable economic
growth, jobs and investment.'"®) The lack of reliable grid
electricity in many countries often compels companies to
use expensive diesel generators that cost about USD 0.40

doing business in Africa more expensive, with damaging
consequences for economic growth, investment and tax
revenues. (?")

Lack of access to modern energy hampers progressive
social outcomes. Agricultural production and productivity
in Africa are constrained by limited access to modern
energy services. Power is needed for irrigation, agriculture
mechanization (e.g. land preparation, cultivation and
harvesting), post-harvest storage and processing, and
transport facilities. Energy is needed to pump, transport,
treat, and distribute water, particularly in the production of
drinking water through the use of desalination, and water
and waste-water treatment plants. Lack of electricity in over
90 percent of Africa’s primary schools is a factor in children’s
educational under-performance.'?2) This undermines their
educational outcomes and life chances that lead to productive
lives. The health-care sector is also affected because uneven
power supply and power cuts prevent the use of life-saving
equipment and the refrigeration of medications. In the home,
people are forced to use stoves, which are often not just
inefficient but harmful—indoor pollution causes an estimated
600,000 fatalities each year,'2°) half of whom are children under
the age of five years. In many rural areas, where electricity
is either unavailable or unaffordable, efficient cooking stoves
are often the only alternative way to mitigate the dangers (see
example in Box 2.1 of Ghana’s Toyola Energy Limited, which
promotes efficient cooking stoves).

21Chapter 2

Box 2.1
Ghana’s Toyola Energy Promotes Efficient Cooking Stoves

Energy and Climate Change: Implications for Inclusive and Green Growth in Africa

Most urban households in Ghana cook on charcoal, using inefficient, polluting stoves. Toyola Energy was set up in 2006 to supply efficient charcoalburning Coalpot stoves and other energy systems to low-income households in Ghana. The Coalpot stove is made in five different sizes. The domestic
sizes range from 270 to 360 mm top diameter and their cost ranges from GHC 10 to 12 (USD 6.60 to USD 8). The commercial sizes range from 460 to
510 mm top diameter and their cost ranges from GHC 40 to 50 (USD 26 to USD 33). All retail prices are subsidized by carbon finance. Toyola gives up
to two months credit to its direct customers, and to its dealers and sales agents who can pass the credit on to their customers. Seventy-five percent of
customers use credit, 20 percent pay cash, and the rest pay through barter. About one-third of credit customers use a “Toyola money box” to reserve
their savings on charcoal, and use this money to make their credit payments. Charcoal savings have been assessed using kitchen performance tests
with the same households using their original stove and a medium-sized domestic Coalpot. The Coalpot was found to save one-third of charcoal, an
average of 0.5 kg per day. Thus, the stoves currently in use are saving about 26,000 metric tons of charcoal each year, which saves on the use of

wood to make charcoal.

2.2.2 The Climate Change—Energy—Structural
Transformation Nexus

Climate change affects energy systems. Climate and
energy are intrinsically linked, and changes in one are likely
to affect the other. Climate change affects energy resource
endowments, production, infrastructure and transportation.
Droughts or floods can severely affect water inflows, which
can have a knock-on effect on the power generation capacity
of energy production units. When it comes to production, four
major challenges arise: reduced productivity in hydropower,
shortage of cooling water for thermal power plants, reduced
availability of traditional biomass, and reduced yields for
bioenergy projects. Climate concerns will impose a new set
of conditions on the design, operation, and maintenance of
existing and planned infrastructure.

Energy systems affect climate change. On the other side,
an increase in energy usage and output has the potential
to affect climate change, hence the climate change-energy
nexus. The predominant use of non-renewable energy, such
as oil and coal, and traditional wood-based energy, such
as charcoal and biomass, increases CO, emissions that
contribute to climate change. Energy intensity of GDP and
carbon intensity of energy systems continue to drive GHG
emissions globally. GHG emissions from the energy sector
represent roughly two-thirds of all human-created GHG
emissions, and COs emissions from the sector have risen
over the past century to ever higher levels.'**) Effective action
in the energy sector is needed to tackle climate change.

Africa’s action on climate and energy is aligned with
global action. As the most vulnerable continent, Africa

22

pressed for a binding Agreement at the 2015 United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of
Parties (UNFCCC COP21) climate negotiations held in Paris.
The resultant Paris Agreement on climate change committed
to emissions reductions consistent with staying well below the
2°C threshold and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Scientific
evidence suggests that, if global average temperatures
increase beyond 5°C, large areas of sub-Saharan Africa
would not be able to grow crops such as sorghum, millet,
and maize. Longer and more severe droughts could occur in
some areas. In others, productivity levels would be lower as
a result of unpredictable rainfall and/or flooding, induced by
global warming. While Africa must also adapt, global activities
that reduce CO, emissions will be central to the success of
the Paris Agreement.

Address the climate change-energy structural transformation nexus. Africa is ranked as the lowest contributor
to global CO2 emissions compared with other continents
(below 4 percent). However, increased economic activities
have increased its carbon footprint over the past decade. (2°)
This trend is likely to continue as African countries seek
to expand energy supply to sustain increased economic
production and meet the needs of its growing middle class
and wider populations.(2°) To remain on the path to green
growth, Africa will have to address the climate change
energy problem.

reliance on fossil fuels, global agreements on climate change are

by seeking to constrain and penalize fossil fuel combustion.
Over time, and with a careful strategy for guaranteed universal
access to energy, Africa will need to decouple its GDP from
fossil fuels. This is achievable if sustainable ways can be found
to significantly reduce the energy intensity of GDP and the
carbon intensity of energy systems in the continent. For the
first time in at least 40 years outside of an economic crisis,
the global economy grew by around 3 percent in 2014, but
energy-related CO, emissions stayed flat. The drop in energy
intensity of the global economy stemmed from improved energy
efficiency and structural changes in some economies, such
as China.'2° In the same spirit, Africa could initially consider
the pursuit of practical measures to improve energy efficiency
in the industry, building and transport sectors, e.g. retrofitting
buildings, transforming industrial production processes, and
deploying more efficient transport systems. (2°

Reduce the carbon intensity of African energy systems.
Without necessarily compromising its agenda for universal access
to energy, Africa should emulate China’s new proactive role on
climate change. Existing models show that the externality costs
of the path of “grow first and clean up later” are economically,
socially, and environmentally unsustainable. Africa should
therefore look to “smart” growth, which saves it from costly future
environmental externalities.'°") Initially, Africa can use the clean
technologies which are being developed to reduce emissions from
fossil fuels released into the atmosphere, e.g. chemically washing
minerals and impurities in coal-fired electricity generation, and
carbon capture and storage technologies to capture CO; from flue
gases. In due course, Africa can meet most of its future energy
needs from renewable sources, thereby allowing for such actions
as a gradual reduction in the use of the least-efficient coal-fired
power plants and a ban on the construction of new ones.'°2)

Africa needs financial and technological support to deal
with energy and climate-change issues. Given Africa’s
climate vulnerability and relatively clean record on CO,
emissions, the onus is on the international community to
support the continent. Some African countries have already
received support from the Clean Technology Fund, which
provides resources to scale up the demonstration, deployment
and transfer of low-carbon technologies with a significant
potential for long-term savings in GHG. In addition to other
such funds, Africa should receive the funding pledged under
the Paris Agreement. International climate-change regimes
and values should be characterized by equity, and should
provide funding and technology transfer mechanisms that
reach the most vulnerable countries. Accordingly, climate
adaptation must be mainstreamed into Africa’s development
path. The continent will generally need to take advantage
of the synergies between energy infrastructure investments
and climate financing at the global level to push its agenda
for universal access to energy.

24

Africa is capable of achieving universal access to energy
services by 2025, while reducing the carbon intensity of growth
and lowering its contribution to global CO2 emissions. The
continent is endowed with vast renewable and non-renewable
sources of energy, and with limited sunk costs in carbonintensive energy infrastructure. This provides the potential
for cost-effective integration of low-carbon options into the
energy mix. There are well over 10 Terawatts (TW) of solar
potential, 350 GW of hydroelectric potential, 110 GW of wind
potential and an additional 15 GW of geothermal potential.
These are supplemented by coal and gas that offer some of
its cheapest electricity. Primary energy sources are more than
enough to meet Africa’s needs in the long run.

Opportunities exist for Africa to add value to commercial
energy and meet domestic demand. Africa is a net exporter
of commercial energy and produces 7 percent of the world’stotal.(°4) However, the continent is a net importer of refined
petroleum fuels. Potential economic value creation is lost,
given that crude oil refining could generate downstream
economic activity and create jobs. Also, shipping of crude oil
across the world and importing refined fuels wastes energy
and increases CO emissions. Africa can add value by building
refineries to meet domestic demand.

Africa can capitalize on opportunities associated with
climate change. The response to climate change offers the
continent an opportunity to drive the economic transformation
that it needs: climate-resilient transformation includes lowcarbon development that boosts growth and bridges the
energy deficit, while reducing poverty. The Intended Nationally
Determined Contributions (INDCs) have provided African
governments with a vehicle to set out their ambition for the
transition to development. All African countries prioritized
energy in their INDCs as one key sector through which they
can achieve low-carbon and climate-resilient development.
As a result, the continent's responses to climate change
require pragmatic choices of suitable energy mixes that meet
development needs, while still reducing CO, emissions.(°°)

Africa is set to embrace renewable energy for additional
generation capacity. Renewable projects can improve
energy security by reducing the reliance on imported fuels and
diversifying the power mix. The introduction of such projects

can be expedited through decentralization. Renewables can
also provide access to remote and unserved populations.
Hydropower has an important part to play in the deployment
of other renewable energy systems. Climate-change impacts
and other adverse environmental and social factors would
require mitigation. Renewable energy resources are expected
to constitute about 50 percent of new power generation
capacity to be built in sub-Saharan Africa by 2040. The share
of other renewables (excluding bioenergy) in the total energy
mix is expected to increase from less than 2 percent to 9
percent by 2040.'°9)

Examples of best practice exist on the continent. Several
African countries have already embarked on ambitious programs
that integrate climate action with sustainable development,
and are funding them with their own resources. Ethiopia’s
Climate-Resilient Green Economy Strategy aims to achieve
middle-income-country status by 2025, while developing a
green economy where one of the pillars is expanding renewable
electricity generation. This should enable the country to leapfrog
to energy-efficient technologies in transport, industry, and
buildings.'°”) Another example is Rwanda. Its climate-resilient,
green-growth approach combines sustainable, wealth creation
and poverty reduction measures, and includes one of the
world’s most ambitious renewable energy strategies, with a
target of 50 percent of power generated from renewable energy
by 2017, from a base of just 4 percent in 2008.'°°)

 

25Chapter 2

 

Africa is already investing in more energy generation.
These instances of best practice are not isolated. Large energy
projects have already been implemented in many countries to
enhance energy provision.'°*) In Central Africa, there are ongoing
efforts to add a third dam (Inga Ill) of 4.8 GW, under the Grand
Inga continental flagship project—a multi-phase hydropower
station to be built on the Congo River. The targeted generation
potential is approximately 44 GW. Ethiopia has also invested
heavily in large-scale hydropower public investments —the Beles
| (460 MW), Gilgel Gibe Il (420 MW), Gilgel Gibe III (1.87 GW)
and the Grand Renaissance (6 GW) dams. The Lake Turkana
Wind Power Project in Kenya, which will be one of the largest
wind farms in Africa when completed, is constructing a 428m publicly owned transmission line needed to add 300 MW
of power on the Kenyan grid. The Noor | Concentrated Solar
Power plant in the Sahara Desert is the first phase of a large
solar thermal power plant that is intended to generate 160MW
of electricity to benefit more than 1 million people in Morocco.

 

New business models attractive to the private sector are
emerging. As well as the large energy projects, innovation
is taking place through smaller energy projects. Innovative
companies responding to household demand for lighting and

power are driving the renewables revolution from below.'*°) An
example is M-KOPA in Kenya, which has used a combination
of solar and mobile technology to bring affordable solar
technologies to off-grid villages. Solar power is now available
through home systems paid for through a combination of
low deposits and installments rather than the full retail price
of USD 200 in one go. These transactions are supported by
the mobile-phone payment method M-Pesa, an innovative
money-transfer system. In electricity supply, these innovations
combine to replicate how mobile phones usage developed
in Africa, leapfrogging landline installations. People are able
to access off-grid renewable energy immediately instead of
waiting for a grid connection.

2.3 The Bank’s Operational and
Strategic Agenda on Climate Change
and Energy

The Bank plays a catalytic role in financing and leveraging
additional resources, including concessional climate financing
from global funds. It supports both Regional Member Countries
(RMCs) and Regional Economic Communities (RECs), throughprioritizing the development of the regional energy infrastructure.
Under the Climate Change Action Plan, it supports the RMCs
in their quest for climate-change adaptation and mitigation,
and hosts special interventions such as the African Renewable
Energy Initiative. The Bank is rallying the continent, particularly
through the proposed New Deal on Energy for Africa, to
support universal access to energy.

2.3.1 Responding to

the Climate Change Challenge

The Bank supports climate adaptation and mitigation
in Africa. Under the Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP)
(2011-2015), the Bank helped member countries strengthen
their capacity for climate-change adaptation and mitigation.
This involved the mobilization of resources from existing
and proposed sources of climate finance, the private sector,
and market mechanisms. (The Bank's interventions in 2015
are described in Chapter 3, Section 3.2 and Chapter 4,
Section 4.2).

The Bank played a coordinating role around the COP21
processes. The Bank played a significant role in the lead
up to the COP21 negotiations. It co-sponsored the Africa
Pavilion in Paris to amplify Africa’s voice on climate change
from a common standpoint. The Bank also fully supported
the Africa Adaptation, and Loss and Damage Initiative,
launched in Paris.

The Bank’s climate funding will triple to USD 5 billion per
year. The Bank has successfully channeled climate finance
from global facilities. This includes the Scaling-Up Renewable
Energy Program for Low Income Countries (SREP), and the
Clean Technology Fund (CTF). These are programs under the
aegis of Climate Investment Funds (CIF), as well as from the
Global Environmental Facility and the Sustainable Energy Fund
for Africa (SEFA). The Bank has announced a commitment
to triple its climate finance to reach USD 5 billion per year by
2020, in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the SDGs.
Under the second phase of the CCAP (2016-2022), INDCs
by African countries will largely influence the Bank’s climate
change related interventions on the continent.

2.3.2 Support to the Energy Sector

The Bank’s lending to the energy sector exceeded USD 1
billion. These lending interventions are guided by the Bank’s
Energy Sector Policy. AfDB has an active energy portfolio of
over USD 11 billion. Lending to energy sector projects, both
public and private, exceeded USD 1 billion in 2015. Resources

Chapter 2

committed to energy by the Bank have contributed to an
estimated 145 million people gaining access to electricity since
2000. Over three-quarters of the energy portfolio supports
public sector projects. The portfolio is composed largely
of generation projects, as well as distribution projects and
support for regional energy interconnections. Further details
about the Bank’s recent operations in the energy sector are
provided in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.

The Bank hosts special large energy projects. In addition
to these broader initiatives, the Bank hosts the Sustainable
Energy for All (SE4ALL) Africa Hub in partnership with the
African Union Commission, NEPAD and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP). It also hosts the Secretariat
of the African Energy Leaders Group. The Bank Group is
one of the architects of the Programme for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA), and a key financier for the PIDA
Priority Action Plan. It is also actively engaged in the new Africa
Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), and is expected to play
a key implementation role (Box 2.2). The Bank cooperates
with key stakeholders in the energy sector, such as the
World Bank Group, the European Commission, and bilateral
donors including the USA (especially through the Power

Box 2.2
AfDB to Support the African Renewable
Energy Initiative

Africa launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative
(AREI) on the sidelines of the Conference of Parties (COP21)
in December 2015 in Paris. The initiative’s overarching
goals are to help achieve sustainable development,
enhanced well-being and sound economic development
by ensuring universal access to sufficient amounts of clean,
appropriate and affordable energy. The initiative aims to
produce 300 GW of electricity for the continent by 2030.
In addition, the project’s goal is to help African countries
leapfrog current systems towards renewable energy,
particularly those that support low-carbon development
strategies while enhancing economic and energy security.
The initiative is expected to deliver 10 GW of new and
additional renewable energy generation capacity by 2020
and later mobilize potential to generate at least 300 GW.
The AREI complements the Bank's proposed New Deal on
Energy for Africa that has the target of universal access
to energy by 2025.

27Chapter 2

Africa Initiative launched by US President Obama, which have
helped projects expected to generate over 4,300 MW of new,
cleaner electricity), the UK, France, Germany, and multilateral
agencies such as the International Renewable Energy Agency
(IRENA), among others. The Bank works with the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) and
the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency
(SIDA) on the provision of co-guarantees.

The proposed New Deal on Energy for Africa. In addition
to hosting special large energy projects, the Bank and its
partners articulated the New Deal on Energy for Africa.(¢")
The goal of the New Deal on Energy is universal access to
energy in Africa by 2025. At the same time, it aims to decouple
Africa’s economic productivity from CO, emissions in line
with the SDGs. Universal access to energy by 2025 requires
connecting 205 million households and almost doubling grid
generation capacity.'*2) To drive and achieve this goal, the
Bank has worked with governments, the private sector, and
bilateral and multilateral energy sector initiatives to develop and
launch a Transformative Partnership on Energy for Africa—a
platform intended for Public-Private Partnerships for innovative

Box 2.3
What Underpins the New Deal on Energy?

financing in the continent’s energy sector. The New Deal on
Energy is designed to coordinate and build on existing and
emerging initiatives, which are not always fully aligned with each
other, to achieve impact, scale, and speed. The New Deal on
Energy is designed to focus on five interrelated and mutually
reinforcing principles: raising aspirations to solve Africa’s energy
challenges; establishing the Transformative Partnership on
Energy for Africa; mobilizing domestic and international capital
for innovative financing in Africa’s energy sector; supporting
African governments in strengthening energy policy, regulation
and sector governance; and increasing the Bank’s investments
in energy and climate financing (see Box 2.3).

The specific goal of the New Deal on Energy is to add 160
GW of new generation capacity via the grid, deliver 130 million
new grid connections and 75 million off-grid connections
and increase access to clean cooking energy for around
130 million households.\*®) The New Deal on Energy will play
a catalytic role in accelerating structural transformation in
the energy sector for inclusive green growth in Africa. It will
also help unlock the potential for industrialization and wealth
creation, agricultural transformation, regional power pooling to

1. Raising aspirations to solve Africa’s energy challenges. The New Deal on Energy calls on partners to raise aspirations and mobilize the political
will and financial support to solve Africa’s energy challenges. This is a pre-requisite for achieving the SDGs, and for implementing the global climatechange deal reached at the UN Summit (COP21) in Paris in December 2015.

2. Establishing a Transformative Partnership on Energy for Africa. The New Deal on Energy will be implemented through a partnership designed to
provide a platform for coordinated action among partners (private and public) and for innovative financing. The Partnership will unlock Africa’s energy
potential, and eventually foster a transition to low-carbon energy futures. It will help reduce duplication and pool resources to achieve economies

of scale in Africa’s energy investments.

3. Mobilizing domestic and international capital for innovative financing in Africa’s energy sector. To achieve universal access by 2025, innovative
mechanisms are required to mobilize an additional USD 40 to 70 billion annually in domestic and international capital. This is a significant increase
on the USD 22.5 billion invested in the sector in 2014. Achieving this scale of energy financing requires collective action by all stakeholders—public
and private—to create enabling conditions for financial flows, to develop bankable projects, reform utilities, and enhance African countries’ absorptive

capacities.

4. Supporting African countries in strengthening energy policy, regulation and sector governance. The New Deal on Energy will build on, and
further scale up the Bank’s investments in the “soft” infrastructure of national governments and institutions, to enhance energy policies, regulations,
incentive systems, sector reforms, corporate governance, and transparency and accountability in the energy sector.

5. Increasing the African Development Bank’s investments in energy and climate financing. Between 2011 and 2015, AfDB invested some USD
6 billion in the energy sector. Under the New Deal on Energy, the Bank will increase its investments to provide finance and guarantees, co-financing
and syndication. Between 2016 and 2020, the Bank will invest about USD 12 billion and leverage about USD 50 billion in public and private financing
for investments in the energy sector. In addition, it will triple its climate finance to about USD 5 billion per annum, and leverage about USD 20 billion
in private and public sector investments in climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020.

28integrate energy supply in Africa, and job creation, ultimately
improving the quality of life for Africans.

The New Deal on Energy will leverage financing for energy.
The New Deal on Energy must close the finance gap of USD 55
billion a year in sub-Saharan Africa. Potential sources of funding
include domestic tax revenue, official development assistance,
and other sources such as funds recovered from stemming illicit
financial flows out of Africa. Multilateral Development Banks
(MDBs) such as the African Development Bank, the World
Bank and bilateral finance agencies, could also leverage their
balance sheets with greater co-financing arrangements and
the use of partial risk guarantees for public and private sector
investors. By focusing on project development, pipelines of
bankable projects can be developed for financing from the
Africa50 Fund (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2.5 for more details
on the Africa50 Fund).

2.4 Measures to Facilitate
a Rollout of Modern Energy for
Inclusive and Green Growth

The Bank has already embarked on a path that demonstrates
its commitment to rolling out modern energy for inclusive and
green growth. Ways to overcome existing obstacles and thereby
expand energy supplies for inclusive and green growth include:
setting up the right enabling policy environment; equipping utility
companies for success; increasing the number of bankable
energy projects; increasing the funding pool to deliver new
projects; funding “bottom of the pyramid” energy access
programs; accelerating major regional projects and driving
integration; and rolling out waves of country-wide energy
“turnarounds”. What the existing and emerging projects and
programs have lacked, and urgently need, is sufficient, innovative,
and appropriate financing. They also need to be bankable and
supported by appropriate policy and regulatory environments,
pricing incentives and coordination in order to increase the
scale and speed at which energy is provided to the continent.

This section of the Report outlines the measures required to
facilitate a larger rollout of modern energy for inclusive and
green growth through principles espoused in the proposed
New Deal on Energy for Africa in identifying and overcoming
the obstacles to universal access. The New Deal on Energy
has identified seven strategic themes, each of which is
supported by a series of flagship programs that the Bank
intends to launch.\*#) These areas are outlined below.

Chapter 2

e Setting up the right enabling policy environment. A
range of critical interventions for the removal of abstacles
to universl access to energy include the following: advising
and supporting governments on setting up efficient sector
regulation and governance, focusing on cost-reflective tariffs,
building credible counter-parties, and ensuring appropriate
risk allocation. Energy efficiency policies curb inefficient
consumption while safeguarding essential supply. Therefore
adoption of energy efficiency and saving measures is a key
enabler to power sector decarbonization. In some cases, these
policies will need to be complemented by other power sector
reforms to facilitate the transition to low-carbon technology and
maintain system reliability. The required reforms will mostly be
around sector deregulation and price policies to attract private
sector investment in the energy sector. This has successfully
happened in the information and telecommunications sector
with transformational results. In particular, African governments
need to consider a gradual withdrawal of subsidies to lossmaking power utilities and oil-based products such as
kerosene and other fuels, then redirect them to productive
energy investment, social protection and targeted connectivity
for the poor. African governments could bridge the energy
investment gap if they channeled approximately 2-3 percent
of GDP, corresponding to 7.5-10 percent of fiscal revenues.(*)
On the production side, for example, the challenges facing
oil and gas operations in Africa continue to be varied and
numerous e.g. fraud, corruption, theft, limited infrastructure,
protectionist governments, and lack of skilled resources,
among others. Regulatory uncertainty and delays in passing
enabling laws continue to severely inhibit sector development
in many countries around the continent.

e Enabling utility companies for success. Power sector
utilities constitute a major fiscal burden for many countries.
Utilities will need technical assistance to enable restructuring
(privatization and concession) for improvement (loss reduction
and revenue recovery). This would help to streamline the
overly centralized and inefficient energy systems, dominated
by publicly run energy utilities. Additionally, the governance
of power utilities has been identified as being at the heart of
Africa’s energy crisis. Therefore, reform remains essential to
allow them to capitalize on investment and the low-carbon
technological innovation. Two components lie at the heart of
creating more efficient and stable energy markets: unbundling
power generation, transmission and distribution is one, and
privatization is the other. South Africa provides a good example
through its Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer
Procurement Programme launched in 2011 (see Box 2.4).

29Chapter 2

Box 2.4
South Africa’s Renewable Energy Independent
Power Producer Procurement Programme

30

The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer
Procurement Programme is a flagship project of the
Department of Energy launched in August 2011 to
contribute towards the renewable energy power generation
target, and to stimulate the renewable industry in South
Africa. A total of 5,243 MW across the four Renewable
Energy Bid Windows has been procured from 79
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) in less than four
years. This represents an investment of some USD 16
billion in economic infrastructure, which will contribute to
economic growth, job creation and security of electricity
supply. The Department has already announced its intention
to secure 6,300 MW in future renewable energy bid
windows. Bidders are invited on the tariff and identified
socio-economic development objectives. Tariffs have
dropped over the four bidding phases with average solar
photovoltaic tariffs decreasing by 68 percent and those
of wind by 42 percent, in nominal terms.

Sizably increasing the number of bankable energy
projects and increasing the funding pool. One of the
constraints associated with rollouts of modern energy
has been the lack of a critical mass of bankable projects.
Aggregating project development capital, and channeling it
through highly capable private sector organizations involved
in world-class project development, including private sector
financing and legal institutions, will help increase the number
of bankable energy projects. Also, the finance pool needs
to be scaled up to create greater leverage on the financial
markets by buying down certain categories of risk for the
private sector.

Funding “bottom of the pyramid” energy access programs. Increasing funding for the development of on- and
off-grid project organizations will support the acceleration
of the rollout plans. Domestic taxes can only realistically
cover about half the financing gap in sub-Saharan Africa.
The challenge for governments, therefore, is to increase
resource mobilization through other measures, such as
pension funds and other institutional investors, recover and
prevent the loss of finance through illicit financial transfers,
combat tax evasion and avoidance, and ensure cautious

Energy and Climate Change: Implications for Inclusive and Green Growth in Africa

debt financing. These can be sourced from bond markets
(corporate bonds, government infrastructure bonds,
diaspora bonds and external sovereign bonds), sovereign
wealth funds, resource-backed infrastructure financing
and international development finance. Schemes such as
sovereign wealth funds and resource-backed infrastructure
financing are better tailored for resource-exporting countries.

Accelerating major regional projects and driving integration. Accelerating the plans will also be supported by
strategic identification of major regional projects, particularly
those with regional interconnections included in their
mandate, and systematically drive them to completion. Some
of Africa’s huge energy resources require collective action.
For example, the continent’s water resources are mostly
shared, so that damming must be negotiated or financed
regionally. Examples include the Kariba Hydropower Dam
shared by Zambia and Zimbabwe, and the Regional Rusumo
Falls Hydroelectric Project on the border of Rwanda and
Tanzania. Collective action would reverse the blockages in
situations where most regional power pools are hampered
by lack of funding, political instability, and weak cross-border
regulations. A strong case can be made for a continental
approach to energy infrastructure, which is key to integration.
This will require strengthening strategic infrastructure—the
backbone of the pan-African smart grid—through the support
of continental institutions such as the African Development
Bank, the African Union and the UN Economic Commission
for Africa, in public trust. In that way, regional power pools can
be left to handle the feeder and more regional infrastructure.
Continental public goods would thus be insulated from the
day-to-day conflicts between sovereign nations and future
political leaders who may not always act in the interest of
their citizens. PIDA provides a strategic framework for the
development of regional and continental energy infrastructure
in Africa (see Map 2.2).

Rolling out waves of country-wide energy “turnarounds”. A central theme bringing all elements together
is the systematic implementation of full-country turnaround
programs. The Bank plans to coordinate major development
institutions to launch end-to-end energy system
turnarounds, in close collaboration with the Heads of
State, Ministers of Energy and Ministers of Finance. These
programs will include energy system planning, restructuring
of the national regulatory environments, matching donors
to targeted interventions, and bringing in the private sector
to drive the development of capacity and connections.Chapter 2

2.5 Looking Ahead

In looking ahead, the Bank has demonstrated that meeting its
transformation goals is achievable. It is clear that regional and
continental actions with the support of partners are needed
to develop Africa’s largely untapped energy potential if the
goals of the proposed New Deal on Energy for Africa, and
the initiated Transformative Partnership on Energy for Africa
to escalate universal access by 2025, are to be met. A large
gap exists between investment needs and actual outlays in the
power sector, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. In this respect,
the Bank is developing strategies towards fast tracking energy.
An enabling environment for the private sector to operate in,
either as IPPs or participants in Public-Private Partnerships,
is a way forward.

 

32

Energy and Climate Change: Implications for Inclusive and Green Growth in Africa

Africa should vigorously push its agenda for universal access
to energy. The continent should keep its contribution to global
CO, emissions relatively small as demand for energy grows
through: (i) the development of its large hydro resources;
(ii) gradual replacement of coal-based power generation with
fossil fuels with lower carbon emissions, such as natural gas
and nuclear power; and (iii) the development of its significant
geothermal, wind, and solar potential. African governments
need to show leadership by promoting energy investment as
a top priority and creating conditions that are conducive to
private sector investment in the energy sector. Appropriate
policy frameworks, regulations and incentive structures
are required to unlock the huge potential of Africa’s energy
resources and to meet the development needs for modern
energy services. The Bank has already embarked on the
path to unlocking this energy potential to provide universal
access by 2025.

Bank Group Operations

 

This chapter presents an overview of the Bank Group’s performance during 2015 in its lending operations, and further
examines other non-lending areas of interventions. The Bank Group conducts its lending operations for projects and
programs through three windows: the African Development Bank (‘the Bank’, or ‘ADB’), the African Development Fund
(‘the Fund’, or ‘ADF’) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (‘NTF’). In 2015, total approvals of Bank Group operations amounted
to UA 6.33 billion, for 241 operations, as at end-December 2015, an increase of 25.4 percent over the 2014 approvals.

3.1 Overview of
Bank Group Operations

The Bank Group’s operations in 2015 were guided by the
twin objectives of achieving inclusive and green growth as
stipulated in the Ten-Year Strategy (TYS). During the year,
Bank Group operations at end-December 2015 increased
by 25.4 percent over the operations at year-end 2014. This
is significant, compared to the 15.1 percent increase in Bank
Group operations at end-2014, compared to 2013, and a
8.1 percent increase at end-2013 over end-2012. As in the
previous years, infrastructure operations, mainly transport
and energy, received the bulk of Bank Group’s resources.

Overview of Bank Group Operations by Financing Window.
In 2015, total Bank Group operations amounted to UA 6.33 billion,
Figure 3.1 shows the distribution of this amount, compared with
those of the two previous years, by financing window.

For the ADB window, total approvals amounted to UA 4.52
billion, comprising public sector approvals of UA 2.97 billion
(representing 65.7 percent of the total) and private sector
approvals amounting to UA 1.55 billion (84.3 percent of
the total). The total approvals for the ADB window in 2015
increased by 41.1 percent compared to 2014. In terms
of distribution, ADB public sector operations increased
substantially by 78.3 percent in 2015 relative to 2014 while
ADB private sector operations increased by only 0.9 percent
over the same period (see Table 3.1).

The performance of ADB financing in 2015 for both the public

and private windows was equally high relative to the targets for
the year. For the public sector, actual approvals amounted to

UA 2.97 billion—65 percent above the UA 1.80 billion target.
Similarly for the private sector, actual approvals of UA 1.55
billion exceeded the target of UA 1.50 billion by 3.3 percent.

The rise in ADB public sector operations is mainly related to
an increase in borrowing from the sovereign window by ADBeligible countries as well as the accommodation of newly eligible

* Notes:

1. There are three Financing Windows: ADB, ADF and NTF.

2. NTF approvals are not shown as they are negligible, measured in UA
millions, when compared to ADB and ADF scales measured in UA
billions. NTF approvals were: UA 31.2m (2013), UA 11.5m (2014) and
UA 12.5m (2015).

3. For completeness, the Special Funds financing mechanism is included
in Total Bank Group Approvals. Special Funds approvals, also not
shown in the chart, were: UA 253.4m (2013), UA 244.2m (2014), and
UA 288.9m (2015).ADF countries from sub-Saharan Africa for ADB resources. The
revision of the Bank Group’s credit policy enabled ADF-eligible
countries to access ADB resources, and thus contribute to
lowering the risk of concentration of Bank lending mainly
towards countries in Northern Africa. The increase in the level
of activities of the ADB private sector window is linked to the
Bank’s scaling up of its non-sovereign operations, including
through the trade finance facility, the partial credit guarantee
instruments, and the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility.

Table 3.1 shows that ADF approvals stood at UA 1.52 billion,
representing a decrease of 4.9 percent against the 2014
position. This performance was 5.4 percent below the ADF
target of UA 1.6 billion for 2015. The relatively lower level of
approvals in 2015 can be explained by the ADF-13 cycle
financing modalities, which permitted front-loading of the ADF
resource envelope in 2014, the first of the three-year cycle,
with allocations declining gradually in subsequent years.

For the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), two operations were

approved in 2015 amounting to UA 12.5 million: (i) The
allocation of UA 6.5 million loan was for Support for Youth

Table 3.1

Chapter 3

Employability and Integration in Growth Sectors in Togo; and
ii) the UA 6 million loan for the Water Loss Reduction and
Performance Improvement of Drinking Water Systems in Benin.

These approvals were 8.8 percent above the UA 11.5 million

approved in 2014 (see Table 3.1).

Figure 3.1 shows that approvals for Special Funds accounted
or UA 288.9 million and represented 4.6 percent of total Bank
Group approvals. These were for the African Water Facility
(AWF), the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)),
he Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP),
he Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF), the European
Union-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EU-AITF), the Fund for
African Private Sector Assistance (FAPA), the Enhanced Private
Sector for Africa (EPSA), the Middle East and North Africa
MENA) Trust Fund, and the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund
(ZimFund). Others included the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) and the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA),
specifically related to energy and climate-change operations.

 

Table 3.2 on financing instruments shows that total loans and

grants amounted to UA 5.24 billion, representing 82.7 percent

of total approvals. The remaining UA 1.10 billion (17.3 percent)
comprised approvals for Special Funds (discussed above),
ADB private equity participation, ADB public and private sector
guarantees, and approvals for debt relief under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. The private equity
participation of UA 64.3 million went to finance the following
four multinational operations: CEC Africa Investments Limited,
Atlantic Coast Regional Fund, Africlnvest Fund and Alitheia
Identity Fund. Total ADB guarantees of UA 696.9 million
were made up of a public partial credit guarantee (UA 397.8
million) to Cameroon and ADB private guarantees (UA 299.1
million). The private guarantees were provided in support of
five multinational financial intermediaries and a heavy-fuel
oil-power project in Sierra Leone. The UA 47 million for debt
relief was provided to Chad, following the country’s attainment
of the HIPC completion point.

Sector Distribution of Bank Group Operations. In 2015,
Bank Group operations continued to be aligned with the TYS,
which emphasizes infrastructure investment in the key sectors
of transport, energy, water and sanitation, and communications
for the transformation of African economies. Figure 3.2 depicts
the distribution of total Bank Group approvals to various
sectors. The chart shows that, of total Bank Group approvals
of UA 6.33 billion, UA 3.08 billion (48.6 percent) was allocated
to infrastructure projects, with transport (27.2 percent) and
energy (13.8 percent) accounting for the largest share. This
was followed by water and sanitation (6.3 percent) while
allocations to the communications sector accounted for only
1.4 percent. The relatively large allocation to infrastructure

investment demonstrates the importance that the Bank
Group attaches to addressing Africa’s infrastructure deficit
and its commitment to promoting inclusive and sustainable
development.

Figure 3.2 also shows that the finance-sector operations
received an allocation of 21.3 percent of the total Bank Group
approvals. These were mainly in the form of lines of credit
(LOCs), guarantees and trade finance targeted at alleviating
credit constraints faced by businesses on the continent
especially micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises
(MSMEs). The MSMEs account for more than 45 percent of
employment and 33 percent of GDP in Africa. Hence, the
Bank Group’s participation through lines of credit therefore
serves to guarantee MSMEs access to financing from
financial intermediaries. The resources allocated to multisector
operations, including public finance management and other
governance-related operations, represented 12.5 percent
of total Bank Group approvals. These approvals strengthen
governments’ fiscal control, transparency and accountable
use of public resources, modernize the taxation system
and enhance revenue collection, boost domestic resource
mobilization, and facilitate the restoration of public service
delivery.

The chart also shows that the social sector received 9.4
percent of total Bank Group approvals for interventions in
skills development, technological innovation and infrastructure
improvement. Trends based on evidence suggest that Africa’s
structural transformation has been held back by low human

Communication 1.4%

27.2%capital, especially a shortage of appropriate skills. By helping
to ease the skills constraint faced by the private sector, the
Bank Group continues to demonstrate its commitment to
facilitate sector-wide structural transformation in Africa.

In Figure 3.2, the agriculture sector accounted for 8.1 percent
of total Bank Group approvals. This does not take into account
investments in rural infrastructure that indirectly support
agriculture but are included in the share of the infrastructure
sector. However, this share is relatively low and should be
increased to boost rural incomes and improve food security.
Equally, the share of the sectoral allocation to industry is
relatively insignificant at less than 1 percent. This should be
scaled up in order to catalyze the pace of industrialization in
Africa. Accordingly, the Bank Group also needs to support
private sector operations and financial market development
to increase Africa’s share in global value chains.

Bank Group Disbursements. The performance of Bank
Group disbursements has varied over time. In 2015, Bank
Group loan and grant disbursements, excluding equity
participation, guarantees, and Special Funds, amounted to
UA 3.08 billion (Figure 3.3) —a 4.2 percent decrease compared
to 2014. Over the past five years, the actual disbursement
closely matched the target only in 2012. However, between
2012 and 2015, actual disbursements against targets showed
a wider margin, as indicated by the decline of the disbursement
rate from 98 percent in 2012, to 81.9 percent in 2015. The
recent decline in the disbursement rate must be addressed.

Table 3.3 presents Bank Group actual and target loan and
grant disbursements by financing window for 2015. It shows
the disbursement rate for ADF operations at 92.2 percent
compared with 74.9 percent for the ADB window, and only
49.8 percent for the NTF window. The disbursement rate for
all Bank Group interventions was 81.9 percent during the year.

* Total loan and grant disbursements exclude Special Funds, equity
participation, and guarantees.

The relatively low disbursement rate was mainly due to
delays occasioned by a number of factors. Notable among
these were the weak institutional and management capacity
in some Regional Member Countries (RMCs), and delays
in procurement and in meeting disbursement conditions.
Other causes of disbursement delays included fragility
situations, conflicts, political transitions, and, in a few cases,
anti-corruption investigations. In other cases, delays arose
from complex country processes for obtaining parliamentary
ratification for contracting loans. To address the delays in
disbursements, the Bank Group has made concerted efforts,
including strengthening the monitoring and reporting of
recurring issues, and streamlining of operational business
processes to improve disbursements. An inter-departmental
working group was also tasked to update disbursement
profiles and fine-tune the process for setting targets at

regional, country, and sector levels. Accordingly, institutional
disbursement targets have been objectively reviewed and
further cascaded down to country offices and sector divisions.
The purpose is to promote ownership and accountability
across all business segments and ensure that the Bank Group
achieves more robust and realistic disbursement targets.

ADB Approvals by Country. Of the UA 3.76 billion ADB loan
and grant approvals, 68.4 percent was allocated to public
sector operations and the remaining 31.6 percent went to
private sector operations. Figure 3.4 illustrates the distribution
of these approvals by recipient countries. Among these, in
2015, Congo was classified as an ADB country in transition,
and Cameroon, Kenya, and Zambia became blend countries—
eligible for both ADB and ADF resources. Also, following
approval of the Bank Group’s revised credit policy in May
2014, a number of ADF-only RMCs (Senegal, Tanzania, and
Uganda) were able to access the ADB public non-concessional
resources for financing their operations. These countries
used the additional ADB resources to finance their operations
in infrastructure, particularly transport, energy, water and
sanitation (including climate-resilient sanitation programs), and
in agriculture, skills development and entrepreneurship, among

ADF Approvals by Country. From the total ADF loan and
grant approvals of UA 1.12 billion, 43.8 percent was allocated
to multinational operations, while the remaining 56.2 percent
benefited 28 ADF recipients. The distribution of loans and
grants to these 28 RMCs is illustrated in Figure 3.5. Based
on ADF performance-based allocation (PBA) and debtsustainability analysis (DSA) criteria, the figure shows that
some ADF countries (Tanzania, Kenya, Ghana, Madagascar,
etc.) received only concessional loans. Others, including
Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mali, and Cote
d'lvoire, received only grants. The rest, including Burkina
Faso, Malawi, and Eritrea received a combination of loans
and grants. The three blend countries, Cameroon, Kenya,
and Zambia, which are eligible for ADF performance-based
allocations, are not reflected in Figure 3.5 because they did
not use their ADF allocations to finance any projects in 2015.
For example, Zambia had front-loaded its 2015 allocation
earlier in 2014 to partly finance the Kariba Dam Rehabilitation
Project. Similarly, the records show that the two ADB countries
in transition during 2015, Congo and Nigeria, did not use

3.2 Bank Group Operations
by Priority Sectors and Areas of
Special Emphasis

This section reviews Bank Group operations with a focus
on priority sectors and areas of special emphasis in the
TYS. The areas of focus include infrastructure (energy,
transport, water and sanitation, and communication); private
sector development; regional integration; governance and
accountability; and skills and technology. The three areas of
special emphasis under the TYS are gender, agriculture and
food security, and States in fragile situations. States in fragile
situations specifically benefit from budget support operations
to address fragility and other socio-economic challenges in
some of the deprived areas of the continent.

Energy. During the year, the Bank Group continued to play
its leading role in Africa’s energy sector, in partnership with
other African institutions and international partners. This
was facilitated through the Programme for Infrastructure
Development in Africa (PIDA), the African Hub for the
Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) initiative, and the
African Energy Leaders Group. The Bank Group’s focus on
energy highlights the extent of Africa’s energy deficiency—a
considerable impediment to the continent’s development. To
mobilize partnership support and financing to close Africa’s
huge energy deficit, the AfDB held a High-Level Consultative
Stakeholders Meeting in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire in September
2015, where the New Deal on Energy for Africa was presented
and discussed. The ambitious goal of this initiative is to ensure
universal access to energy by all the RMCs by 2025. Details
of the New Deal on Energy are discussed above in Chapter 2.

The proposed African Renewable Energy Initiative (AREI), was
announced at the Climate Change Conference of Parties
(COP21). It received endorsement from African Heads of State
and Government and Ministers of Environment, the G7 (Elmau
Summit), and the G20 (Energy Summit). At the Conference,
the AfDB announced that it would triple its financing to climatechange initiatives by 2020 up to USD 5 billion a year.

Bank Group total approvals for the year in the energy sector
amounted to UA 871.6 million, with UA 841 million (96.5

UA 30.6 million) was financed through equity participation,
guarantees and Special Funds, particularly from the EU-AITF
and SEFA. Energy-sector approvals represent 28.3 percent
of total infrastructure approvals (Figure 3.6). Some of the
ey energy sector projects approved include: (i) the Kenya—

Tanzania Power Interconnection Project (UA 102.8 million);

ii) the Uganda Rural Electricity Access Project (UA 80.2 million);
and (iii) The Gambia River Basin Development Organisation
OMVG) Energy Project (UA 97 million). These projects are
expected to ease the energy requirements in each of these
countries.

The Kenya-Tanzania Power Interconnection Project will

improve the supply, reliability, and affordability of electricity
across the Eastern Africa region. It will allow the linkage of the
Eastern Africa Power Pool to the Southern African Power Pool.
It is also projected to link Egypt and Sudan in Northern Africa
which will help the two countries to replace some of the high
costs of thermal energy production with cheaper and cleaner
hydropower while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

 

The Uganda project is envisaged to improve access to

electricity for rural households, small- and medium-sized
enterprises and public institutions (rural health centers, schools
and local administration offices) in the project area. In a country
where only 8 percent of the rural population has access to
electricity, this project is aimed at contributing to inclusive
growth and poverty reduction, especially among the rural poor.

Box 3.1
Renewable Energy Project for OMVG States

Approved in September 2015, this renewable energy
project seeks to provide the four OMVG member states
with renewable, clean, and affordable energy, while
simultaneously promoting regional integration through the
sharing of energy and improved electricity supply quality.

By increasing electricity supply, the project will expand
household access to more reliable energy, boost business
competitiveness in each of the countries, stimulate
economic growth and create jobs, thereby contributing
to poverty reduction. The interconnection network will
also contribute to the expansion of the power pool system,
creating a regional electricity market that will reduce the
average cost of electricity generated in each of the OMVG
member states. Further, the effects of using hydropower
will curb fossil fuel consumption by a significant margin
and consequently reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
support of the COP21 objectives.

Selected Transport Operations Approved in 2015

The Transport Sector Support Program in Tanzania
comprises interventions mainly in the roads subsector,
but also includes feasibility studies in the railway and air
transport subsectors. The road improvements will provide
access to agricultural products in Tanzania, thereby
spurring growth in productivity. The roads will also serve
as links to neighboring Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and
DRC, and will facilitate cross-border trade, and deepen
regional integration.

The Chinsali-Nakonde Road Projectforms part of the TransAfrica Highway and the North-South Corridor (NSC). The
NSC is a priority corridor, which services eight countries
in the region—Tanzania, DRC, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana,
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and South Africa.

The Tunisia Road Infrastructure Modernization Project
(PMIR) seeks to rehabilitate 719 km of classified roads,
most of which are in the country’s inland governorates. The
project will also upgrade some civil engineering structures
on the classified network to make them more resilient to
the effects of climate change.

The environmentally friendly OMVG Energy Project targets The
Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Senegal. The project is
designed to harness the immense potential for clean energy,
thus fostering affordable energy for the region’s inhabitants
(Box 3.1).

Environment and Climate Change. Climate change
mitigation and adaptation are at the core of the landmark Paris
Agreement reached at the December 2015 Climate Change
Conference (COP21) in which the Bank Group participated
actively. For details on Bank Group’s 2015 activities in this
area and at COP21, see section 2.3.

Transport. In November 2015, the Bank Group organized
the first AfDB Transport Forum: “Sustainable Transport for an
Integrated Africa”. The Forum noted that green and inclusive
transport is critical in stimulating sustainable growth, given that
green transport means cleaner and more efficient vehicles,
less air pollution, less congestion and more green jobs. These
goals are in line with the objectives of the recently concluded
COP21 on Climate Change. At the Transport Forum, the
AfDB also reiterated its commitment to work with the RMCs
in ensuring that transport plays a catalytic role in promoting
Africa’s participation in agribusiness and global manufacturing
value chains, facilitating regional integration, and providing
opportunities for social inclusiveness.

In 2015, Bank Group total approvals for transport sector
operations amounted to VA 1.72 billion, with loans and grants
accounting for UA 1.58 billion (91.9 percent). The remaining UA
139.5 million (8.1 percent) represented Special Funds financing,
specifically from the Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF).
Approvals for the transport sector represented the largest share
(55.9 percent) of the UA 3.08 billion total Bank Group approvals
for all infrastructure operations (see Figure 3.6 above).

In Box 3.2, three approved transport operations are highlighted:
(i) the Tanzania Transport Sector Support Program (UA
248.0 million); (ii) the Chinsali-Nakonde Road Rehabilitation
Project in Zambia (UA 172.8 million); and (iii) the Tunisia Road
Infrastructure Modernization Project (UA 152.9 million).

Water Supply and Sanitation. The importance of water security
for sustainable economic and social development in Africa is
highlighted in the TYS. During 2015, the AfDB continued to
support water supply and sanitation infrastructure services and
institutions that contribute to socio-economic development
and resilience to water-related disasters and climate change inMap 3.1

Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI). This initiative was conceived by the Bank in 2002 and adopted by the RMCs and donors in
2005 as the framework for increased financing to water supply and sanitation (WSS) in rural areas in Africa, with a view to universal access. Indeed, the
launch of the RWSSI saw an increase in the demand for rural WSS funding. In addition to the new approval in 2015 by the RWSSI Trust Fund (TF) for the
Water Sector Reforms and Institutional Capacity Development Program in Sudan (UA 15.6 million), the RWSSI-TF contributed EUR 3 million to support
the implementation of the National Post Ebola Recovery Strategies in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This was in response to building resilience to
Ebola in the countries affected by the epidemic through the sustainable improvement of water and sanitation for the most-vulnerable segments of the

population. The RWSSI-TF is also co-financing

operations in the RMCs. The MDWPP catalyzed the establishment of both the above key initiatives—the

AWF and the RWSS!l—that have resulted in strengthening AfDB and RMC capacity for IWRM. The MDWPP also enabled the AfDB to play a key role in

 

promoting dialogue with regional actors on critical water-sector issues.

In 2015, the MDWPP financed: (i) the editing and publication of the report entitled: “Unlocking Africa’s Transboundary Water Potential” on AfDB’s role
in achieving regional integration through transboundary basin development and management; (ii) a study on the Investment Guarantee Fund for the
Water Sector; and (iii) co-financing the “Sanitation Atlas” project referred to above.

as in previous years, the AfDB continued its administrative and
support roles for the three special and complementary initiatives:
the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the
Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program (MDWPP) and the
African Water Facility (AWF) depicted in Box 3.3.

During the year, the Bank Group took action to tackle the lack
of access to water of acceptable quality in both urban and rural
areas. Its interventions contributed to sustaining livelihoods in
several countries with total operations worth UA 398.7 million,
approved for the development of the water supply and sanitation
sector in the RMCs. Total approvals comprised UA 326.8 million
(82 percent) for loans and grants, with the remaining UA 71.9
million (18 percent) drawn from Special Funds, comprising the
African Water Facility (AWF), the Global Environment Fund (GEF),
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),

46

the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative Trust Fund
(RWSSI-TF), the Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF), and
the Zimbabwe Multi-Donor Trust Fund (ZimFund).

Two of the largest Water Supply and Sanitation operations
approved—one in Tanzania and another in Angola—are
highlighted: (i) the Arusha Sustainable Urban Water and
Sanitation Delivery Project (UA 150.2 million); and (ii) the
Angola Institutional Support for the Sustainability of Urban
Water Supply and Sanitation Service Delivery (UA 89.7 million).
The Arusha project provides safe, reliable and sustainable
water and sanitation services thus contributing to improved
health and social well-being, and raising the living standards
of the beneficiaries. The Angola project aims to improve
water-sector governance, and strengthen institutional capacity
and efficiency in the water- and sanitation-sector institutions
at the central and provincial level.Regional Economic Integration. The Bank Group continues
to foster regional and economic integration on the continent
by increasing the effectiveness of its support to the RMCs,
Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and other regional
organizations, and the private sector. Through policy and
strategic commitment, the Bank Group promotes regional
integration to create larger, more attractive markets, link
landlocked countries to international markets, and support
intra-African trade. These interventions are aimed at realizing
the AfDB’s vision for stability, integration, and prosperity in
its RMCs by growing African economies that are robust,
competitive, diversified and sustainable, and able to participate
fully in global trade and investment.

In November 2015, the Boards of Directors approved the
new Regional Integration Policy and Strategy (RIPOS) for the
period 2014-2023. Its focus is on creating larger and more
attractive markets, linking landlocked countries to international
markets, and supporting intra-African trade to foster the
continent’s development. The RIPoS will operationalize
the TYS, which reaffirms the Bank Group’s commitment to

 

Chapter 3

promote regional integration in Africa, identified as one of the
five core operational areas.

In 2015, total Bank Group approvals for regional (multinational)
operations amounted to UA 1.44 billion, a 34 percent increase
over the 2014 approvals of UA 1.08 billion. The total approvals
in 2015 were made up of loans and grants of UA 1.07
billion (74 percent), with the remaining UA 375.3 million (26
percent) financed by equity participation, guarantees, and
five Special Funds. The Special Funds were made up of the
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the African Water Facility (AWF),
the Fund for African Private Sector Assistance (FAPA), and
the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA).

Of the total multinational (regional) Bank Group approvals
of UA 1.44 billion, the largest share (40.2 percent) was
allocated to transport. This was followed by the finance
sector (25.3 percent), for lines of credit to MSMEs, trade
finance, guarantees, and equity participation; the energy
sector projects (23.8 percent); and with the remaining 10.7

percent allocated in smaller shares to operations in agriculture,
multisector, social, communications, and water supply and
sanitation sectors (Figure 3.7).

Among the regional operations, the largest approved project
was Phase II of the Ketta-Djoum Road Corridor (UA 147.0
million), an important segment of the highway linking the
capitals of Congo (Brazzaville) and Cameroon (Yaoundé).
Apart from helping to boost trade between the two countries,
the project is aimed at consolidating regional integration in
Central Africa by providing highway interconnectivity linking
Cameroon, Congo, DRC, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and
Central African Republic. This project also has a biodiversity
component aimed at raising the awareness of the local
community on protective measures to safeguard classified
forests and parks, and strengthening land management
capacity, thereby fostering green growth.

Two of the largest regional project approvals offering lines of
credit to MSMEs and trade finance were: (i) FirstRand Bank
in Southern Africa (UA 72.5 million), discussed below under
the section on Private Sector Operations, and (ii) Standard
Chartered Bank (SCB) Risk Participation (UA 71.1 million). The
goal of the SCB approval is to increase its risk participation
agreement (RPA) facility from USD 200 million to USD 300
million coinciding with the maturity of the original facility in May
2016. The facility is an unfunded risk-sharing arrangement
that requires the AfDB to disburse funds only when there is
a payment default on a guaranteed trade transaction. The
increase in the facility limit would enable issuing banks on the
continent to receive more trade finance support from SCB.
This is the largest RPA facility the Bank has signed with any
confirming bank under the Bank’s Trade Finance Program.

 

 

The AfDB’s support for regional power pools is in line with
the TYS emphasis on energy (infrastructure) and regional
integration for Africa. A key regional project approval in this
regard was the Kenya-Tanzania Power Interconnection Project
(UA 102.8 million), which is to be connected to the Ethiopia—
Kenya transmission system. This forms part of the Eastern
Africa Electricity Highway with a transfer capacity of 2,000
MW. When completed, it will serve as a major link for power
transfer between the Eastern Africa Power Pool, and countries
in the North such as Sudan and Egypt. The expected power
line’s completion is in early 2017. The project will contribute to:
(i) improved power supply in Kenya and Tanzania and in the
Eastern African region in general; and (ii) reduced operation
costs of energy production by replacing some of the high cost

thermal energy production with cheaper hydropower. This will
also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Private Sector Operations. The establishment of the Africa50
Infrastructure Fund in 2013 and its eventual incorporation
in Morocco in 2014 was a significant stage in the Bank’s
shift towards mobilizing innovative private and public sector
financing for infrastructure development, from both in Africa
and externally. Today, Private investments in the energy
sector in Africa are also benefiting from a rapid growth in
Independent Power Projects, in which over USD 4 billion is
allocated annually by private sector investors across subSaharan Africa. As a result, during 2015, energy and other
infrastructure investments have been beneficiaries of private
sector operations.

Total Bank Group approvals for the private sector in 2015
amounted to UA 1.56 billion—a marginal decline of 1.9 percent
from the UA 1.59 billion private sector-financed operations in
2014. The 2015 approvals were made up of loans and grants,
equity participation and guarantees amounting to UA 1.55
billion, and two Special Funds totaling UA 10.93 million. The
two Special Funds were the GEF and FAPA.

In 2015, of the total private sector approvals of UA 1.56
billion, finance operations accounted for the largest share
of 42.9 percent, followed by energy (22.7 percent), with the
remaining shares going to transport operations (19.5 percent),
agriculture (10.2 percent), and other sectors (see Figure 3.8).Figure 3.8

The large share for finance came in the form of lines of credit
mainly to MSMEs, trade finance, and guarantees to some of
the largest financial intermediaries for on-lending activities to
financially constrained firms that would otherwise not have
had access to financing due to the lack of guarantees.

Three projects supported by private sector funding in the
finance, transport, and energy sectors are highlighted. The
first, in finance, is Banco de Poupanca e Crédito in Angola
(UA 231.5 million), the largest project. A second example, the
Ghana Airports Company Limited Project (UA 85.5 million),
is in transport, and the third is the multinational CEC Africa
Investments Limited (UA 36.2 million) Project, which is an
energy operation. An outline of each of the three selected
projects is provided below.

The Banco de Poupanga e Crédito (BPC) was granted a tenyear (with a two-year grace period) Government-guaranteed
line of credit (LOC) of up to USD 325 million to enable it to
increase its loan portfolio by USD 800 million over the next
five to seven years. The BPC will target mainly mediumsized enterprises and some large corporations involved in
priority sectors including water, agriculture, and industry. To
enhance the effectiveness of its interventions, the AfDB will
also provide advisory services to BPC, especially in setting
up Environmental and Social Management Systems. The
project will contribute to stimulating the diversification and
competitiveness of the Angolan economy, which largely
depends on oil.

Chapter 3

The Ghana Airports Company Limited (GACL) capital
investment program entails the construction of a new modern
terminal at Kotoka International Airport in Accra to increase
its capacity from 2.4 million to 5 million passengers per year,
and the rehabilitation of other airports that it also manages
in Kumasi, Tamale, Ho, and Wa. The project will strengthen
the transport sector in Ghana and in the region as a whole
by increasing the capacity of existing airports and improving
the quality and efficiency of airport operations.

The final private sector example, CEC Africa (CECA), was
established in 2013 as a pan-African company with a mandate
to develop, finance and operate power projects across subSaharan Africa. In 2015, the Board approved CECA's “Blue Flare”
project in Sierra Leone. CECA is strategically placed across the
energy value chain, with investments in distribution, hydropower
and thermal generation, and renewable energy. CECA also
benefited from the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility
to provide support for the high-risk environment in the country.
The Bank's investment will support the growth of local African
utility and offer a platform for additional project development
as well as job creation.

Supporting Governance and Accountability. Overall,
the Bank made notable progress in delivering governance
support in 2015. As at end-December 2015, total approvals
for governance-related operations amounted to UA 788.9
million. Of this amount, UA 689.3 million (87.4 percent)
represented loan and grant approvals, and the remaining
VA 99.6 million (12.6 percent) was from other approvals
made up of UA 47 million for HIPC debt relief at completion
point for Chad, UA 47.6 million from the Private Sector Risk
Participation Agreement Facility (PSF-RPA), and UA 52 million
from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Trust Fund.
Almost three-quarters of the volume of lending for 2015 were
Program-Based Operations (PBOs) against 27 percent for
institutional support projects.

The Governance Strategic Framework and Action Plan 20142018 (GAP Il), approved by the Boards in 2014, serves as
the key programming instrument for governance operations
within the overall framework of the TYS. The GAP II outlines
three main pillars that enable the Bank Group to deliver its
work and improve the quality of governance in Africa. These
include: (i) public sector and economic management: (ii) sector
governance; and (iii) investment and business climate. In
addition, governance interventions have also contributed to
other priority areas of the Bank Group’s TYS, encompassing

49Chapter 3 Bank Group Operations

private sector development, gender mainstreaming, programs
addressing states of fragility, and the bolstering of economic
resilience.

Public Sector and Economic Management (PSEM). Bank Group
interventions for PSEM have been directed at the continued
strengthening of government policies and institutional capacity
to enhance the transparent and accountable use of public
resources, and the ability of citizens to hold governments
accountable. In this regard two key operations were undertaken
in 2015. In Niger, the Bank Group supported the implementation
of the Financial Reforms and Food Security Support Programme
(PAREFSA 1) through a PBO loan worth UA 20 million using the
ADF window. Its objective is to support the creation of conditions
conducive to inclusive growth through enhanced food security.
The Bank Group also approved a total of UA 15 million financing
of Mali’s Emergency Governance and Economic Recovery
Support Program (EGERSP). The financing was drawn from
the Transition Support Facility (TSF). The EGERSP is part of
a coordinated effort by the international community to restore
the Government's authority and support economic recovery to
reverse the deteriorating humanitarian situation resulting from the
various crises over the last three years. These PSEM interventions
reflect the Bank Group’s commitment, responsiveness, and
flexibility in addressing fragility and emergency situations.

Sector Governance. |n continued efforts to improve sector
governance specifically aimed at addressing procurementrelated corruption at the sector level, the Bank Group provided
support towards the strengthening of procurement policies
and the legal frameworks in a number of the RMCs. For
example, a PBO totaling UA 50 million drawn from the ADF
was approved for the Power Sector Reform and Governance
Support Programme in Tanzania. This operation was aimed

Box 3.4
Selected Approved Projects in 2015 for Skills Development

at enhancing the competitiveness of Tanzania’s power sector
that has historically suffered from weak economic and financial
governance.

Investment and Business Climate. Interventions in this
area have focused on strengthening legal and institutional
frameworks through improved investment codes, and
the creation of robust judicial systems for better contract
enforcement and resolution of disputes. The Bank has also
supported the strengthening of policy, legal, and institutional
frameworks for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). Examples
include the technical assistance grants for the Ethiopia
Institutional Support Project for Public-Private Partnerships
(ISP-PPP) for USD 1.6 million, and the Namibia Institutional
Strengthening for Public-Private Partnerships Project (ISPPP)
for USD 2.8 million.

Promoting Skills and Human Development. In 2015, implementation of the AfDB’s Human Capital Strategy (2014-2018)
gathered pace. This strategy provides a framework for the
Bank Group’s vision to harness human resources to support
the competitiveness of African economies. For the review
period, the AfDB approved various innovative operations
aimed at capacity building, including skills development,
promoting entrepreneurship, creating jobs, and promoting
equal opportunities for men and women. As exemplified below
this also included consolidating the gains attained during the
campaign against the Ebola virus disease in 2014, with the
Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund Project (PERSIF).
In total, as at end-December 2015, UA 595.9 million had been
approved for various operations. The bulk of the financing —UA
592.5 million (99.4 percent)—was through loans and grants.
The remaining UA 3.4 million (0.6 percent) was sourced from
the RWSSI Trust Fund and FAPA. Box 3.4 provides a summary

The Kenya Support to Technical Vocational Education and Training Project (UA 41 million) will train middle-level engineering and applied sciences faculties
in 33 Technical Training Institutes (TTIs). The Skills Development and Entrepreneurship Project in Zambia (UA 21.4 million) will contribute to job creation,
the promotion of gender equality and poverty reduction, in particular supporting women and youth through skills development and entrepreneurship.
In Sudan, the Capacity Building for Improved Quality of the Education System (UA 15.3million), aims to enhance skills development among teachers
and education managers and promote the use of technology to enhance the quality of education. The Support Project for Youth Employability and
Integration in Growth Sectors in Togo (UA 14.5 million) will contribute to creating conditions for more inclusive economic growth by boosting youth

employability and promoting entrepreneurship in growth sectors. In Eritrea,

the Support to Skills Development for Employability and Entrepreneurship

Project (UA 13.5 million) aims to improve formal technical/vocational education and training, and to offer basic skills training programs to youths and

adults, with an emphasis on gender equality.

of this genre of interventions within the different operations
undertaken in Eritrea, Kenya, Sudan, Togo, and Zambia.

The single largest operation for job creation was the UA 144.3

million approved for Tunisia’s Regional Development and
Job Creation Support Programme (PADRCE). This seeks
to establish a climate that is conducive to accelerated job
creation and inclusive growth through regional development.
This program is expected to bridge regional disparities as
well as reduce Tunisia’s unemployment, which stands at 13.3
percent, with youth unemployment at an a particularly high
level of 31.2 percent. Specifically, the program’s beneficiaries
will include: (i) the inhabitants of the interior region; (ii) about
58,000 higher-education graduates annually; (iii) women and
youth beneficiaries of microcredit interventions; and (iv) the
235,000 families targeted by social assistance to alleviate the
burden of high unemployment.

Other social sector operations approved in 2015 were aimed
at supporting reconstruction efforts in Central African Republic
(CAR), and the protection of basic services in Malawi. In
CAR, the Support Program for Reconstruction of Grassroots
Communities, Phase 1 (PARCB-1) totaling UA 15 million, was
AfDB's most significant intervention in support of the country’s
transition, following outbreaks of unrest. The program involves
the rehabilitation of vocational training and learning centers
to promote the socio-economic reintegration of communities,
including the half a million unemployed and out-of-school
youth in the project area, as well as facilitate increased access

Chapter 3

 

to social services. In Malawi, the AfDB approved a project of
UA 19 million for the Protection of Basic Services. Among
other objectives, this project is expected to: (i) improve access
to quality health and education services; (ii) increase the
participation of poor households in the Public Works Program;
and (iii) increase transparency in the delivery of basic social
services.

Three countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra

Leone) had suffered from the outbreak of the Ebola virus
disease in 2014, which damaged their economic and social
fabric. In 2015, the ADF Board approved a grant of UA 20.4
million for the Post Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund
Project (PERSIF). PERSIF complements the Bank Group’s
earlier interventions for alleviating the pressure resulting from
he outbreak, and strengthening subsequent responses to
uture epidemics. It is also geared at restoring basic social
services and improving people’s livelihoods.

3.2.1 Ten-Year Strategy: Areas of Special Emphasis
IN addition to the five operational priorities, the TYS also
emphasizes support to the special areas of agriculture and
‘ood security, gender mainstreaming, and States in situations
of fragility. Operational activities in these areas during 2015
are highlighted below.

 

Agriculture. Agriculture employs 65 percent of Africa’s labor
force and accounts for 32 percent of its GDP. It is therefore a
key priority for reducing poverty and hunger, raising household

Feeding Africa: An 18-point Action Plan for African Agricultural Transformation

incomes, spurring GDP growth, and creating jobs. In line
with its emphasis on agriculture as one of the TYS focal
areas, the Bank Group organized the Dakar-High Level
Conference on Agricultural Transformation in October 2015
for over 600 participants, including 155 high-level Government
representatives, ranging from Ministers of Agriculture, Finance,
and Trade, and Central Bank Governors, as well as other policy
makers, business leaders, members of civil society, and other
stakeholders. The conference endorsed an 18-point plan of
action, summed up in “Feeding Africa: An Action Plan for
African Agricultural Transformation: Summaries Work Streams
1-26”. The Action Plan is guiding the preparation of the
continent’s long-term strategy for agricultural transformation
(2016-2025).

The Action Plan called on governments to demonstrate
strong commitment, and to take critical steps towards the
transformation of Africa’s agriculture (Box 3.5).

In October 2015, African leaders met in Dakar, Senegal, at a high-level conference called to kick-start agriculture as an engine of growth by mapping
out an ambitious action plan. The conference outlined a shared vision for African agricultural transformation, based on the following goals:

Eliminating extreme poverty.

Ending hunger and malnutrition.

Turning Africa into a net food exporter.

Moving Africa to the top of global value chains.

The Action Plan is to be implemented with AfDB as the focal point, working closely with co-conveners and development partners: AU, FAO, UNECA, and
the World Bank. Highlights of the 18-point Action Plan, include the following:

e The conference agreed to increase the number of nutrition programs across Africa to end malnutrition and hunger. The synergy needed was created

for effective partnerships to achieve this objective.

e The program will involve establishing a strategic partnership with US President Obama’s Feed the Future Initiative, Grow Africa of the World Economic
Forum, the Big Win Philanthropy, the FAO, Scaling Up Nutrition, the World Food Programme, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Panel
on Agriculture and Food Systems for Nutrition, as well as the private sector in general, to deploy innovative approaches to addressing malnutrition.

e The Bank Group will work with partners to leverage USD 3 billion in financing for women farmers, agribusinesses, and other women-owned
enterprises. This will include the establishment of a USD 300 million facility to de-risk financing to women-owned businesses by commercial banks

and microfinance institutions.

e The Bank Group will also triple its climate financing to USD 5 billion annually by 2020 by working closely with the African Union, the African Ministerial
Conference on the Environment, the United Nations Environmental Programme, and the G7 for the establishment of the Africa Renewable Energy Initiative.
e Under the plan, Central Banks in Africa will set aside Special Funds to allow farmers to access credit at reduced interest rates, and also for long-term

agricultural loans with longer-term maturity.

 

e The Bank Group will scale up skills enhancement for youth in agriculture and establish an African Youth in Agriculture Financing Facility to support

young commercial farmers and other youth in agriculture.

52Other stakeholders who attended the conference included
program and task managers, entrepreneurs, women and youth
leaders of non-governmental agricultural organizations in rural
and urban communities in Africa. Their testimonies revealed
their experiences at the conference, and what they perceived
to be the benefits they expect to derive from it (Box 3.6).

In 2015, Bank Group approvals in the agricultural sector

amounted to UA 514.6 million. Of this, UA 472.2 million
(91.8 percent) was through loan and grant approvals and the

Box 3.6

Chapter 3

remaining UA 42.4 million (8.2 percent) was financed through
Special Funds, specifically the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program (GAFSP), the Global Environment Fund
(GEF), and the Fund for African Private Sector Assistance
(FAPA). One of the largest operations approved was the Green
Morocco Plan Support Programme (PAPMV-2), a public sector
initiative, for UA 94 million. Phase 2 of the Programme aims at
improving sustainable natural resource management through
green governance in the agricultural sector and development
of agricultural sector value chains (see Box 3.7).

Testimonies from Stakeholders at the Dakar Conference on Feeding Africa

On 23 October 2015, delegates attending the Dakar conference on transforming African agriculture expressed enthusiasm about the new commitments
to agribusiness.

“You need high-profile events like these to get things done. It was important for the new President of the AfDB to make this strategic decision at this early
stage on assuming office because it has drawn attention across Africa and encouraged political and technical buy-in” said Ikhide Imumorin, Program
Leader at Cornell University’s College of Agriculture. Imumorin continued: “By bringing in Central Bank Governors, Ministers of Finance and Agriculture,
and regional development banks, this will certainly achieve results.”

During the conference, the AfDB President announced the creation of a USD 300 million financing facility to channel more funds to African women in
agribusiness and provide bank guarantees. Claudius Kurtna, a youth agribusiness entrepreneur from Kenya, who also attended the conference, hailed
the President for emphasizing the role of the youth and women in agriculture. He added: “It was not a youth event on agriculture, but the President
has driven it like one and we are very happy. This has marked the start of a big change in Africa.” Kurtna noted that his organization managed to sign
agreements for business expansion and was looking for further commitments in agribusiness.

Oluwatosin Ariyo, who is currently overseeing an initiative funded by the British Government to improve the status of women in agriculture in rural Nigeria

 

said his organization hoped to “tap into the strong commitments reached at the conference to bolster programs under implementation in Nigeria”.
He continued: “This conference has brought agriculture to the fore. The financial sector will begin to connect the dots that have been missing in the
whole value chain, and the fund created by the AfDB will help to reduce interest rates on agribusiness loans. This will enable more women to benefit.”

Green Morocco Plan Support Programme, Phase 2

In October 2015, the Bank approved a sector budget support loan of UA 94 million to Morocco to finance the second phase of the Green Morocco Plan
Support Programme. This is in line with the Bank Group's TYS. Adopting a participatory, inter-sector approach, this support recognizes agriculture as
an innovative business sector, which complements and creates synergies with other sectors, but also gives value to its stakeholders, especially women
and youth. The program’s specific objective is to improve sustainable natural resource management through green governance in the agricultural sector
and the inclusive development of agricultural sector value chains.

The program includes an insurance scheme for women farmers in cooperatives to promote equality with men over access to this scheme. It also
promotes gender budgeting in the area of agricultural value chains. Land tenure for women is encouraged in the allocation of valuable agricultural
plots to women farmer groups through Public-Private Partnerships, as well as the provision of accessible and affordable financing to rural women.

53Chapter 3 Bank Group Operations

Gender. Following the approval of the Gender Strategy, an
action plan to operationalize it was developed and adopted
in December 2014. The implementation of the strategy was
accelerated in 2015 with the establishment of a network of
85 gender focal points throughout the Bank in April 2015.
The role of the focal points is to ensure that gender equality
and empowerment are: (i) integrated into the Bank Group’s
day-to-day operational business processes; and (ii) that
these are appropriately addressed in the AfDB’s projects,
Country Strategy Papers (CSPs), Regional Integration Strategy
Papers (RISPs) and Project Appraisal Reports (PARs), through
mainstreaming. Three capacity-building training workshops
were held to support the focal points in September and October
2015. The aim of the workshops was to equip focal points
with common skills and tools to enable them to effectively
champion gender mainstreaming in their departments/units.
In all, 62 of the 85 gender focal points appointed received
training. Of these, 27 are based in the field offices. In addition,
the gender focal points have formed an institutional network
for information sharing, joint approaches, and peer support.

This will be further strengthened through a Gender Community
of Practice, scheduled for launch in 2016.

The Coordinating Committee on Gender Equality was
established to address specific needs for better results
measurement and reporting of Bank Group operations. The
Bank Group is the secretariat of the African Finance Ministers
Community of Practice (CoP) on financing for gender results.
The first meeting of the CoP took place at the AfDB’s Annual
Meetings in Abidjan in May 2015. Another initiative supporting
the Gender Strategy involves reform of the AfDB’s approaches
in relation to the Country Gender Profile (CGP). The CGP
seeks to identify gaps and propose revisions for improving the
quality and inclusivity of operations. As part of the CGP, three
separate work streams have been developed, each focusing
on a key operational need or product of the AfDB. The first
is aimed at supporting CSP preparation (e.g. Uganda’s new
Country Gender Profile). The second proposes addressing
sector- and project-specific issues from a gender perspective
(e.g. energy sector in Cate d’lvoire’s Gender Profile). The third

ee

Seaddresses gender and economic issues to promote inclusive
growth (e.g. Rwanda’s Country Gender Profile).

Additionally, the Africa Gender Equality Index was launched
at the Bank Group Annual Meetings in Abidjan in 2015. The
index is a compilation of data from various sources, reflecting
the status of women around Africa along three dimensions
of equality: economic opportunity, social development, and
laws and institutions. Its purpose is to track progress along
these dimensions to determine whether over time there is
improvement or deterioration in the status of women.

At the Dakar High-Level Conference on African Agricultural
Transformation held in October 2015, the President announced
anew initiative called the Affirmative Finance Action for Women
in Africa (AFAWA). This is a proposed USD 300 million facility that
will leverage USD 3 billion to de-risk financing of women-owned
businesses by commercial banks and microfinance institutions.
The objectives of this initiative are in line with the 18-point Action
Plan of the Dakar Conference and the target beneficiaries
are: (i) women-owned micro-enterprises, particularly for rural
women involved in small-scale and commercial agriculture
and along the agriculture value chain; and (ii) women-owned
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in
several sectors of the economy (agribusiness and food industry,
technology and telecommunications, extractive and creative
industries, and energy).

In 2015, work began on the development of a Gender Marker
System to systematize mainstreaming of gender in the AfDB’s
operational business processes. The Gender Marker System
seeks to codify existing practices and identify clear entry points
to strengthen existing provisions. As part of this exercise,
operations that have potential for high gender impact will
receive attention through the adoption of gender action plans
for specific project designs.

Countries in Situations of Fragility. The 16 countries eligible
for Pillar | of the Transition Support Facility (TSF) are the
RMCs considered to be in fragile situations. These countries
are: Burundi, CAR, Comoros, Céte d’lvoire, DRC, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Sierra Leone,
Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, and Zimbabwe. Pillar |
refers to supplemental top-up (additional) resources to ADF
performance-based allocations. Accordingly, the ADF Board
approved UA 365.7 million for these countries to finance their
operations. Pillar Il of the TSF represents funds that are set
aside to support arrears clearance for eligible countries with

Chapter 3

arrears, while Pillar Ill of the TSF constitutes resources set
aside for capacity building and technical assistance.

To strengthen the Fund’s support for all the RMCs eligible for the
TSF resources, the ADF Board had approved a new Strategy
for Addressing Fragility and Building Resilience in Africa (20142019) in June 2014. This was one of the outcomes from the
recommendations of the consultative process conducted by
the High-Level Panel for Addressing Fragility in Africa. In January
2015, the Board approved the Operational Guidelines for the
implementation of the Strategy and the Transition Support
Facility (TSF). Therefore, 2015 marked the first year that the
ADF began implementing a new operational framework in its
engagement with countries in fragile situations. The conceptual
framework of the Operational Guidelines contains several
innovations that shaped the Fund’s engagement with countries
in fragile situations in 2015. This includes the introduction of
a traffic light system for all the RMCs to monitor fragility and
guide the Fund’s engagement in countries, in states of fragility.

The systematic application of the new traffic light system has
changed the AfDB’s business model. Thus, in 2015, all CSPs
and RISPs were informed by fragility assessments using the
traffic light system, and more than 80 percent of operations
approved in 2015 in high-risk countries integrated a fragility
perspective. For instance, in Madagascar, the new Interim
Country Strategy Paper approved in 2014 was prepared,
and all short and medium term projects approved since then,
respond to the priorities of the fragility assessment based on
he traffic light system. The new projects underscore access
‘0 basic social services, private sector participation, youth
employment, food security, and women’s empowerment.

With the approval of the Operational Guidelines, the Fund
has also revised its approach to using Pillar Ill resources of
he TSF, meant for critical capacity-building interventions,
building on lessons learned from the past and the findings
of the Independent Evaluation conducted in 2014. One of
he beneficiaries of the application of the new model was a
echnical assistance project (UA 1. 4 million) in Zimbabwe for
he “Support to the Beef and Leather Value Chain”, which
leverages co-financing from the Fund for African Private
Sector Assistance (FAPA). This project seeks to address
ragility and build resilience in the country, placing emphasis
on value-addition and employment creation.

 

Special Programs to Address Fragility. The AfDB has developed special flagship programs and initiatives focusing on

which seeks to deal with fragility and provide

he four OMVG member states with renewable, clean and affordable energy. At the same time, it aims to

promote regional integration through the sharing of energy and improved electricity supply quality. The second is the multinational road project linking Mali

disasters and fragility. In 2015, the Boards approved three
such special programs, including one in the Horn of Africa,
and two in the ECOWAS region (Box 3.8).

3.3 Bank Group
Operations by Region

This section of the Report presents the regional distribution
of Bank Group resources. In 2015, among the regions, the
largest share of Bank Group operations was undertaken in
the Southern Africa region. The largest approvals were in
infrastructure, despite variations in the sector distribution of
other operational priorities within the regions. The emphasis
on regional integration is also highlighted by the approval of
key projects and programs in energy inter-connections and
inter/intra-regional transport networks.

Bank Group Approvals by Region. As outlined above, the
Bank Group operations cover all 54 RMCs and the five regions.
However, variations exist in terms of the volume of operations
accross the regions. As reflected in Figure 3.9, the regional

distribution of total Bank Group approvals shows that, among
the regions, the largest share of 20.8 percent of approvals was
allocated to Southern Africa. This was followed by Eastern
Africa (18.3 percent), Northern Africa (17.7 percent), Western
Africa (10.8 percent), and Central Africa (9.6 percent). TheTable 3.4

share of multinational operations was the largest overall at
22.8 percent, and is worthy of specific note as it reflects the
significance of projects and programs in the Bank Group’s
regional integration agenda.

Table 3.4 provides a breakdown of operations in 2014 and
2015 for beneficiary countries in each of the five regions. By
comparison with 2014, Northern Africa recorded the highest
increase in total Bank Group approvals followed by Eastern
Africa and Central Africa. Western Africa recorded a decrease
in approved operations in 2015, as explained below.

Central Africa Region. Of the eight countries in Central Africa,
two (Gabon and Equatorial Guinea) are ADB-eligible countries
while Cameroon is a blend country, eligible for both ADB and
ADF resources. Congo was in transition towards ADB eligibility
up to end-2015 when it became an ADB country. The remaining
four countries (CAR, Chad, DRC, and Sao Tomé & Principe)
are ADF-eligible, and borrow mainly from the ADF window. The
four ADF-eligible countries are also classified as countries in
fragile situations, which also makes them eligible for financing
from the Transition Support Facility (TSF). For the Central Africa
region, total Bank Group approvals amounted to UA 606.2
million in 2015, a 63.3 percent increase over the level in 2014.

In terms of sector distribution of the region’s total Bank Group
approvals, the largest share of 65.6 percent was allocated
to the finance sector, followed by 20.1 percent to support
multisector operations, while the remaining 14.3 percent was
allocated in smaller shares to operations in communications,
energy, social, agriculture, and water and sanitation sectors.

The finance sector support included the partial credit guarantee of
UA 397 million provided to Cameroon for currency risk-hedging
to cover the country’s payment related to cross-currency swaps
executed with commercial banks. The partial credit guarantee
was to finance Cameroon's development projects, in particular
its Three-Year Emergency Plan, and certain long-term investment
projects identified in the country’s 2015 budget. For the multisector
operations, one of the larger approvals, worth UA 38 million, was
allocated for an institutional support project in DRC, mainly aimed
at enhancing private sector development through skills transfers
in beneficiary institutions and businesses, especially the youth and
women. Another large operation was the UA 30.9 million allocated
for the Central African Backbone Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) project, also in Cameroon. This project was one
of the two ICT operations that the Bank Group approved in 2015.
It is aimed at extending coverage of the national optical fiber
network in the neighboring countries—Congo, Nigeria, and CAR.Chapter 3 Bank Group Operations

Eastern Africa Region. Among the 13 countries in this region,
Seychelles is the only country eligible to access financing from
the ADB window. Six other countries—Burundi, Comoros,
Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan—are ADF-eligible
and also classified as countries in fragile situations. This means
that they are eligible for TSF financing as well. Kenya qualified
to become a blend country in September 2015, which makes
it eligible for both ADF and ADB financing. Tanzania and
Uganda were assessed as eligible for ADB financing under
the revised Bank Group Credit Policy, and received some
non-concessional ADB resources for financing parts of their
infrastructure projects.

Bank Group total approvals for Eastern Africa amounted to UA
1.16 billion, which was 77.7 percent more than the amount
approved in 2014 (see Table 3.4). Infrastructure financing in
transport, water and sanitation, and energy accounted for the
largest share (66.3 percent) of total Bank Group approvals

Box 3.9
Arusha Sustainable Urban Water and
Sanitation Delivery Project

The objective of the project is to provide safe, reliable,
and sustainable water and sanitation services in Arusha
city, Tanzania, and thereby contribute to better health,
improved social well-being, and higher living standards
for the beneficiaries. The project will improve the existing
infrastructure and enhance the operational, commercial,
and service delivery efficiency of the public utility company,
the Arusha Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority
(AUWSA).

About one million people will benefit over the project's
lifespan. Improved access to water and sanitation
services will complement other social services and boost
socio-economic activities in the city while providing an
environment that is conducive to business. The project
will also provide climate adaptation benefits in relation
to water sources management and should lead to the
reduction of water-borne diseases and associated healthcare costs. Furthermore, the construction phase will offer
job opportunities. The project will provide capacity building
to AUWSA and will support the public utility in adopting the
National Gender Policy and in the provisions addressing
the needs of vulnerable groups.

for the region. An additional 24.8 percent was allocated to
the social sector to support technical and vocational skills
development, employment, drought and other emergency
relief operations. The remaining 8.8 percent was allocated to
the finance sector in the form of locs to MSMEs, agriculture,
and multisector operations.

One of the signature projects for this region was the Arusha
Sustainable Urban Water and Sanitation Delivery Project in
Tanzania (UA 150.2 million). This project was designed to
increase access to safe, reliable and sustainable water and
sanitation services in Arusha. This will also lead to reduction
of water-borne diseases and associated health-care costs
(Box 3.9).

Northern Africa Region. Home to six countries, the Northern
Africa is one of Africa’s most developed region. However, it
still faces numerous socio-economic challenges since the
upheavals that began in Tunisia in December 2010. These
events reverberated in other countries in the region in the
ensuing “Arab Spring”. Although five of the six countries are
ADB-eligible (only Mauritania is an ADF-only country), neither
Libya nor Algeria has borrowed from the Bank in recent years.
To help with the new social problems in the region, Bank Group
otal approvals increased by 186.5 percent to UA 1.12 billion
rom UA 391.4 million in 2014. Multisector operations for public
inance management and governance-related operations had
he largest share (40.6 percent) of the regional Bank Group
otal approvals, followed by infrastructure (84.2 percent),
mainly transport and energy, while social sector operations in
regional development and job creation interventions accounted
or 12.9 percent. Bank Group approvals to agriculture took
a 12.1 percent share while the remaining small share (0.2
percent) went to the finance and industry sectors.

Two large operations were the key highlights of interventions
in Northern Africa. As mentioned above, the operations
include the Regional Development and Job Creation Support
Programme (PADRCE) in Tunisia (UA 144.3 million), and Phase
2 of the Green Morocco Plan Programme (UA 94 million).
The PADRCE programme is expected to bridge regional
disparities as well as reduce the rate of unemployment. The
Green Morocco Plan Support Programme will contribute to
the strengthening of agricultural sector competitiveness for
inclusive and green growth in the country as noted above.
A third project, the Tunisia Natural Gas Transmission and
Distribution Network Development Project, was financed at
VA 38.5 million. This project will enhance climate-changemitigation and adaptation, especially among the SMEs, the
tertiary sector and households in the project area through
increased access to more-affordable and less-polluting fuel
(Box 3.10).

Southern Africa Region. Of the 12 countries in the region,
half are ADB-eligible; five are ADF-only countries, and the other,
Zambia, was classified in 2014 as a blend, eligible for both
ADB and ADF financing. The 12 countries are members of the
regional economic bloc, the Southern African Development
Community (SADC). In 2015, total Bank Group approvals for
the region increased by 8 percent to UA 1.32 billion from the
VA 1.22 billion approvals made in 2014. The largest share of
47.6 percent of total Bank Group approvals for the region was
for the financing of infrastructure operations (energy, transport,
and water and sanitation). This was followed by the finance
sector, with a share of 37.6 percent for operations covering
mainly LOCs and trade finance for the benefit of MSMEs. The
remaining 14.8 percent was allocated to the social, agriculture,
industry, and multisector interventions.

The highlights were the two large LOCs, of which UA 262.3
million was offered to the Development Bank of Namibia (DBN),
and UA 231.5 million was made to Banco de Poupanga e
Crédito (PBC) of Angola, profiled above. The purpose of
the LOC to the DBN was to finance projects in key priority
sectors, including infrastructure, manufacturing, logistics
and tourism. The financing approved to PBC was aimed at
targeting mainly medium-sized enterprises that often face
financing constraints. Some large corporations involved in
the country’s priority sectors, including water, agriculture, and
industry, are also expected to benefit from this financing. The
approval of UA 172.8 million for Zambia’s Chinsali-Nakonde
Road Rehabilitation Project has already been mentioned
above. This road is a segment of the Trans-Africa Highway
and the North-South Corridor (NSC)—a priority transport
route servicing eight countries, and important for promoting
trade in the region.

 

Western Africa Region. As the largest region, with 30 percent
of Africa’s population, the Western Africa region comprises
15 countries and also has the highest number of countries
classified as States in fragile situations, with access to both
ADF and TSF resources. Of the 15 RMCs in this region,
13 are ADF-eligible; the remaining two—Cabo Verde and
Nigeria—were in the transition phase of becoming ADB-eligible
countries up to end-2015 when Cabo Verde became an ADB
country, but Nigeria remains in transition until end-2018, when

it will also become an ADB country. The seven countries in
fragile situations are Céte d’lvoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Togo.

In 2015, total Bank Group approvals for the Western Africa
region amounted to UA 686.6 million, 48.6 percent lower than
in 2014. The year 2014 was exceptional as the approvals
included some large private sector-financed projects (UA
503 million) for Nigeria. In 2015, infrastructure operations
took up 45.6 percent of the regional Bank Group approvals
channeled to transport, energy, and ICT projects. Agriculture
was allocated 28.9 percent of the approvals while 15.9 percent
went to multisector operations. Lines of credit to the finance
sector for MSME, and support to the social sector, accounted
for 7.4 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.

In infrastructure financing, a total of UA 85.5 million was
approved for the Ghana Airports Company Project to improve
the country’s aviation industry and enhance regional integration,
while UA 48.7 million was allocated to the Digital Technology
Park Project in Senegal. This project aims to promote Senegal
as a call-center destination (see Box 3.11). The Budget
Support Program for the energy (infrastructure) sector in
Burkina Faso attracted UA 20 million financing and seeks to
make the supply of electricity and petroleum products more
efficient in the country.

Senegal Digital Technology Park

This Digital Technology Park allocation of UA 48.7 million is the larger of only two ICT project approvals in 2015. The other is the Central Africa Optical

Fiber Backbone Project—Cameroon Component (UA 30.9 million).

The Digital Technology Park, to be set up in the rapidly urbanizing Diamniadio Commune of Senegal, will include a data center, business process
outsourcing facilities, an ICT enterprise incubator, training, research, and audio-visual and content-production centers. The project is expected to
produce 35,000 direct jobs and a further 105,000 indirect jobs by 2025, modernize government ICT services, diversify the economy into tech-enabled
businesses, support academic technology-based research, and simplify provision of ICT services for the people in Senegal. It will also attract inward
investment, providing a focal point for the development of an ICT cluster in Francophone West Africa.

3.4 Leveraging Resources
and Partnerships

This section reviews the resources mobilized through Thematic
and Bilateral Trust Funds which represent other sources for
financing, particularly for pre-investment feasibility studies,
project cycle work, and capacity-building activities. While
the largest share of Thematic Trust Fund approvals was
allocated to infrastructure operations, in 2015 the largest
share of Bilateral Trust Fund approvals went into financing
capacity-building activities.

The bulk of Bank Group financing for low-income RMCs is
largely through the ADF replenishment. For the three-year
ADF-13 cycle (2014-2016), available resources from the
replenishment for allocation to the 40 ADF-eligible RMCs
amount to UA 5.11 billion, with a third (UA 1.7 billion) estimated
to be available in 2015 for financing projects and programs in
ADF-eligible RMCs. In addition, the Bank Group has continued
to leverage other sources of financing, mainly through Special
Funds and Technical Cooperation Trust Funds. These resources
are used mainly for financing pre-investment feasibility studies,
enhanced project cycle work, and capacity-building activities.

In March 2015, the Board of Directors approved the
establishment of the Bill and Melinda Gates Trust Fund to
be hosted by the Bank. This is the first bilateral fund with
a non-sovereign entity, and is aimed at providing a formal
structure to the long-standing collaboration between the two
institutions in order to increase activities in agriculture, water
and sanitation, and health-related areas.

In 2015, the Bank Group managed 40 Trust Funds (TFs) in
different currencies for a cumulative total value of UA 865

themes aligned with the TYS operational priorities, represented
87 percent of total TF resources, and Bilateral Trust Funds
(BTFs) accounted for the remaining 13 percent.

As at end-December 2015, Thematic Trust Fund (TTF)
approvals amounted to UA 17.7 million. Similar to 2014, TTF
approvals in 2015 for infrastructure operations made up the
largest share (92.6 percent). This included the single largest
approval (UA 11.5 million) by ZimFund for the Zimbabwe
Urgent Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project,
Phase 2. The remaining smaller share (7.4 percent) was for
operations in support of climate change, human development,
and capacity building (Figure 3.10).

Approvals by Bilateral Trust Funds stood at UA 11.8 million
as at end-December 2015. The largest share (75.3 percent)
supported capacity-building operations, including UA 3.8
million for a strategic partnership to address fragility in the
RMCs; and VA 1.7 million support to the ADF Policy Innovation
Lab during the ADF-13 Mid-Term Review and the preparations
for the ADF-14 consultation processes. Figure 3.11 shows that
smaller Bilateral Trust Fund shares were allocated to support
infrastructure (18.1 percent), private sector development
(4 percent), and gender (2.6 percent).

3.5 The Bank Group and the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative

The status of the Bank Group’s participation in implementing
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is examined in this
section. The highlight of activities in this domain during the
year was the Bank Group’s approval that Chad had reached
the HIPC completion point. This qualified the country for
irrevocable HIPC debt relief and MDRI debt relief simultaneously.

The Bank Group is a key participant among multilateral
development banks in debt-relief programs within the
framework of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the MDRI.
The objective of these initiatives is to reduce the external debt
burden of eligible countries to a sustainable level in order to
free up resources for poverty reduction and development
projects and programs. Under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative,
eligible countries are relieved of up to 80 percent of their annual
debt servicing obligations to the Bank Group until the debt
relief committed is fully delivered in the final year of the debt

Chapter 3

relief schedule. Under the MDRI, however, countries that have
reached their HIPC completion points receive 100 percent
cancelation of their ADF loans disbursed as at end-2004 and
he debt still outstanding is canceled when the RMCs reach
heir respective HIPC completion points.

In April 2015, Chad became the 30th RMC to reach the HIPC.
completion point, and this was the major development within
he HIPC/MDRI debt-relief initiatives. Of the total amount
of HIPC debt relief provided to Chad, the Bank Group’s
assistance amounted to UA 47 million. This amount will
provide Chad with the much-needed resources and leverage
‘0 address the numerous socio-economic challenges facing
he country. In reaching the completion point, Chad had also
ulfilled the requirements for additional debt relief under the
MDRI from the African Development Fund, the International
Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, and the
European Union.

Three pre-decision point countries— Eritrea, Somalia, and
Sudan—are yet to start the process of qualifying for debt relief
under the HIPC Initiative. Progress towards HIPC decision
points by these countries has been slow. Zimbabwe, on
he other hand, has made some progress, and intensified
its efforts during the year to reach the HIPC decision point.
This was through the assistance of the Bank Group under its
Transition Support Facility to achieve full re-engagement with
he Bank and the broader international financial community.

 

3.6 Looking Ahead: The Bank's
New Strategic Operational Orientation

In looking ahead, the new President, Dr. Akinwumi Ayodeji
Adesina, laid out his agenda for the Bank Group and Africa
as a whole in what is expressed as the High 5s: Light Up and
Power Africa; Feed Africa; Integrate Africa; Industrialize Africa;
and Improve the Quality of Life for the People of Africa. These
strategic operational priorities provide a sharp focus on the
Bank Group’s work as it implements the TYS. The objectives
are also consistent with the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), thereby creating a platform for
transforming the lives of the people of Africa through rapid,
sustainable, and inclusive growth.

Africa has made significant progress in the last decade and

a half, during which per capita incomes increased by nearly
50 percent in many countries. It has now reached a point for

bold actions and determination to harness the full potential of
the continent to end hunger, extreme poverty and malnutrition.
Increasing investment in infrastructure, especially in the power
sector. Leveraging on Africa’s agriculture potential to foster an
agro-industry-led industrialization, and accelerating regional
integration are part of the critical areas that need renewed
commitment and bold visions. In this connection, the High 5
priority areas underpin the TYS and the SDGs.

Figure 3.12 is a schematic illustration representing the linkages
between the High 5s, the TYS and the SDGs. A brief review
is presented below on each of the High 5s.

Light Up and Power Africa. Energy is a strategic sector,
indispensable for modernizing and transforming economies.
Africa is the lowest energy producing and utilizing region in
the world. Yet, it has vast untapped energy potential, which,
if fully exploited, can address its energy needs as well as

62

generate foreign exchange through exports to other regions
of the world. By increasing investment and know-how in the
energy sector, the Bank Group will contribute to unlocking the
continent's energy potential, both conventional and renewable
sources, in order to drive the much-needed industrialization.
The Bank Group will work with various partners to develop a
framework that takes into account the different energy sources,
geographic conditions, regulation and pricing, technologies,
distribution mechanisms, and beneficiary characteristics in
line with its Energy Policy and future Energy Strategy. In this
regard, a number of initiatives were lined up and announced
in 2015. These include the New Deal on Energy for Africa,
the Transformative Partnership on Energy for Africa, and the
Africa Renewable Energy Initiative. All of these initiatives entail
a change in the Bank Group’s approach to the development
of the energy sector, and will be critical for achieving the
ambitious target of providing universal access to energy
by 2025.Feed Africa. Africa has enormous potential for agricultural
production to feed itself and the world, yet it is a region
with one of the largest populations of malnourished and
hungry people. Africa’s food market is projected to increase
to USD 1 trillion in 2030 from USD 313 billion in 2010.
However, poor infrastructure, inadequate mechanization,
limited access to credit, fertilizers, and technologies, as well
as insecure land tenure systems and gender disparities in
land ownership, undermine the attainment of this potential.
The AfDB is uniquely positioned to lead broad-based regional
and international partnerships to transform Africa’s agriculture
and agribusiness. The Bank Group will accelerate support
for agricultural transformation across Africa to increase
productivity, lower food prices, and thus enhance food
security, revive rural areas and, in particular, create productive
jobs. All of this is in line with the recently adopted Dakar
Action Plan for African Agricultural Transformation (October
2015). In rolling out the Action Plan, the Bank Group’s
investments in agriculture are envisaged to quadruple from
a current annual average of USD 612 million to about USD
2.4 billion.

Industrialize Africa. As a primary commodity exporter, Africa
remains at the base of the global value chain. This cannot
continue if Africa is to be primed as a global growth pole.
Harnessing Africa’s commodities for industrialization involves
adding value to soft and hard commodities and developing
forward and backward linkages to the commodity sector.
The Bank Group is well positioned to lead other partners
in the process of industrializing Africa and developing the
African private sector to create wealth from natural assets.
In line with the Bank Group’s Private Sector Strategy, the
AfDB will target improving the capacity of Africa’s producers,
particularly manufacturers and related industries, to compete
with imported products in local markets, linking them to
regional and international markets. It will also support the
development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, special
economic zones, and foster access to social and economic
infrastructure as the basis for industrial growth.

Integrate Africa. Integrating Africa’s economies is key to
achieving competitiveness and broadening and strengthening
the quality of growth. Yet regional integration continues to face
policy, regulatory, institutional, and infrastructure challenges.
Overcoming these challenges requires increasing availability
of quality regional infrastructure services, particularly in
energy, transport, transboundary water and ICT. The Bank
Group’s Regional Integration Policy and Strategy (RIPoS)

Chapter 3

2014-2023, acknowledges the opportunities provided by
regional integration in boosting infrastructure to defragment
Africa’s small markets, increase regional trade, stimulate
industrialization, and enhance the movement of people and
investment flows. The Bank Group will focus on addressing
the barriers separating African countries, creating regional
value chains and leveraging complementarities in order to
tap into the continent's huge market potential. By working
together with the RMCs, the AfDB will build on the lessons
learned by investing in high-quality regional infrastructure.

Improve the Quality of Life for the People of Africa. Despite
sustained positive economic performance in Africa for nearly a
decade and half, many countries still face widespread poverty,
socio-economic inequality and gender disparities. Lack of
economic opportunities for the youth also fuels migration, both
internaly and externaly. Across Africa, the high level of youth
unemployment has become a key driver of fragility and political
instability, thereby pushing Africa’s young people to migrate
mainly to Europe and United States. Decades of research
across developing countries and advanced economies show
that employment is the main pathway out of poverty. Creating
jobs could improve the quality of life by providing incomes to
meet the basic necessities (such as shelter, food, health, and
education), and reducing poverty and inequality.

Accordingly, the Bank Group aims to accelerate the creation
of jobs, particularly for the youth, across the continent. This
will both improve their living conditions and help to stem the
perilous journeys made by some of them particularly across
the Mediterranean to Europe in an attempt to escape poverty
and growing unemployment. The Bank Group proposes to
develop innovative flagship programs within the context of the
Jobs for Youth in Africa Strategy to open up opportunities for
youth employment. Notably, these flagship programs will create
jobs for the youth in key job-rich sectors such as agriculture,
industry, and ICT. For example, industrialization schemes such
as Skills Enhancement Zones will link industrial clusters with
talented young graduates to ensure that skills match the needs
of the labor market. These initiatives are targeting over 50
million young people over a ten-year period and the creation
of 25 million direct jobs, which could inject an additional
USD 30 billion into African economies. The Bank Group will
also continue to invest in programs for improving access to
basic services such as water and sanitation, strengthening
health systems, higher education, science and technology,
while creating economic opportunities for the extreme poor
through effective social-protection mechanisms. The Ebola

crisis was a wakeup call for the continent and the Institution.
The Ebola crisis required a coordinated international response
to be mounted. Other areas that need attention are the public
health-care systems and the challenges of rapid urbanization,
especially urban housing, to ensure a slum-free Africa.

Once finalized and fully operational, these High 5s will
represent a new strategic orientation for the Bank Group in
the implementation of the TYS. However, the High 5s and
the TYS are not mutually exclusive and their implementation
will require building on the foundations of existing sector
strategies and policies, particularly the Regional Integration
Policy and Strategy, Private Sector Development Strategy,
Human Capital Strategy, and Financial Sector Development
Policy and Strategy. It will also be anchored on the Energy
Policy and the future Energy Strategy, underpinned by the
proposed New Deal on Energy for Africa initiative.

3.7. Conclusion

This chapter has presented an overview
of the performance of the Bank Group
during 2015 in its lending operations,
highlighting the key achievements, both
by sector and within the framework
of Africa’s five regions. Considerable
strides have been made, laying a strong
oundation for the ongoing delivery of the
TYS, while also addressing actual and
potential fragility in Africa. It also outlines
he alignment of the High 5s with the TYS.

Among the major achievements of
he year is the 25.4 percent increase
in Bank Group operations in 2015
over the level in 2014. During 2015,
Bank Group operations were aligned
with the TYS, which emphasizes
infrastructure investments, as nearly
half (48.6 percent) of total Bank Group
approvals was allocated to infrastructure
projects, with transport (27.2 percent)
and energy (13.8 percent) accounting
for the largest share. Another major
achievement was the leadership role
played by AfDB in introducing the New
Deal on Energy for Africa initiative to
achieve universal access to energy
by 2025, and announcing the African
Renewable Energy Initiative at the Climate Change Conference
of Parties (COP21) in Paris, France, in December 2015.
The AfDB provided technical assistance to the RMCs and
logistical support for delegates during the COP21 negotiation
processes. Accordingly, the AfDB played a significant role in
contributing to the positive outcome of the COP21 global
agreement, which reflects Africa’s interests on issues of
climate change. The Bank Group also organized a High-Level
Ministerial Conference in Dakar, Senegal, which produced an
18-point Action Plan to tackle food insecurity and create an
agriculture-led industrialization process in Africa.

 

The low disbursement rates constitute a major challenge
to the Bank Group. While in 2012 the actual disbursement
closely matched the target level, from 2012 to 2015 actual
disbursements against targets showed a wider margin, with
the disbursement rate declining from 98 percent in 2012, toChapter 3

81.9 percent in 2015. The Bank Group is addressing this
challenge by strengthening the monitoring and reporting
of disbursement delays, while streamlining its operational
business processes through institutional and management
capacity building to improve the disbursements rates. Also,
among the pre-requisites for rapid industrialization and
regional integration, the Bank Group continues to provide
support to the RMCs through policy advice and dialogue to
promote and encourage diversification into processing and
small manufacturing of primary products and away from sole
reliance on primary commodity exports.

ManagementChapter 4 Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

 

This chapter reports on the institutional reforms, development effectiveness, and the corporate management activities
of the AfDB’s organizational units in 2015. On institutional reforms, it highlights the Bank’s budget reforms and
presents updates on its decentralization, the return to Headquarters, information technology, business continuity, and
the 2013 Institutional fine-tuning exercise. Regarding development effectiveness, the chapter examines Bank Group
activities on climate change and environmental sustainability, enhancing the quality of operations, and managing for
development results. It also presents the summary performance scorecard in 2015 and how the AfDB contributes
to Africa’s development effectiveness, while highlighting the role that the Bank Group played in advocating for
Africa’s development interests in regional and global platforms. Further, on corporate management activities, the
chapter presents a summary of the Bank Group’s policies and strategies approved in 2015, outlines the activities
of the independent evaluation function and those of the different fiduciary and accountability units that provide
intermediate recourse mechanisms, examines the Bank Group’s role as a knowledge broker, while also presenting
its knowledge products. In addition the chapter covers progress made in implementing the ADF-13 replenishment
commitments. An update on the deployment of human resources for the implementation of corporate activities is
also provided towards the end of the chapter.

(CAS) and the Strategic Resources Assessment System execution of Complex work programs, budget
(SRAS). This included the following actions: efficiency and effectiveness are monitored regularly.

68The Cost Accounting System (CAS). The first half of 2015 was
dedicated to familiarization, testing and the further fine-tuning
of the new CAS system introduced in 2014. The second half
of the year focused on the generation and dissemination of
various reports to managers for budgeting the unit costs of
deliverables, efficiency analysis and benchmarking to support
decision-making.

The Activity Time Recording System (ATRS). Greater effort was
made to improve the rate of utilization of the ATRS, which is
the cornerstone for the success of the CAS. Group training
and monthly personalized walk-in sessions were conducted
to assist staff in filling time sheets in the ATRS. These sessions
have contributed to the increase of the proportion of staff
completing their ATRS from an average of 64 percent in 2014
to 73 percent in 2015. The Bank aims to continue with training
and other capacity-building initiatives to reach a target of 80
percent in 2016.

Budget Policies, Processes, and Procedures. Preparation
of the Budget Manual began in 2015 and is expected to
be completed and published by end-2016. The manual will
increase knowledge and understanding of the Bank’s budget
policies, processes, and procedures by budget stakeholders
and focal points, and also facilitate capacity building for
managers, budget staff, and new staff.

The Strategic Resource Assessment Software (SRAS). This
software is meant to assist managers to validate budget
submissions. SRAS is also instrumental in the preparation
of the Program and Budget Document (PBD). Therefore, the
Bank intensified training sessions on SRAS for its management
staff. To achieve full integration of its budget infrastructure,
the Bank has started preparatory work to bridge SRAS, CAS,
and SAP (Systems, Applications and Products)—the Bank’s
current main management software.

Decentralization. In 2015, Bank Group operations were
enhanced as it was the final year of implementing the
Decentralization Roadmap (2011-2015). Implementation
of the Roadmap Action Plan included a review of the pilot
Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) in Eastern and Southern
Africa that were established in 2012. The outcomes of this
review reinforced many of the findings from the 2014 Mid-Term
Review of the Roadmap. The establishment of the RRCs
has become an essential platform for Bank Group support
of its activities in Regional Member Countries (RMCs). The
RRCs have also provided the AfDB with the opportunity to

Chapter 4

be better engaged in regional policy dialogue and regional
portfolio management, as Bank staff now work more closely
with Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and other
regional bodies. The positive findings from the review have
been instrumental in the Boards of Directors’ approval for
the establishment of a third RRC for the Northern Africa
Region, thus marking an endorsement of the full-fledged
operationalization of the RRC model. Going forward, this
decision will assist the AfDB in improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the delivery model.

in consolidating the gains from decentralization, the Bank
Group maintained its presence in 38 RMCs and is working
on enhancing the 2012 delegation of authority to the field.
The revision aims at improving the AfDB’s capacity for timely
support to operations and decision-making by field-based staff.
Strengthened Field Offices (FOs) managed a larger share of
he AfDB operations portfolio, with projects managed locally
increasing from 51 percent in 2014 to 60 percent of the total
active portfolio in 2015. Although operational staff in the field
decreased from 49.6 percent in 2014 to 40.6 percent of the
otal staff in 2015, project supervision led by FOs increased
slightly from 52.5 percent in 2014 to 53 percent in 2015.

Return to Headquarters. The return of the Bank and its staff
‘0 the Headquarters in Abidjan, which began in September
2013, continued throughout 2014 and 2015. By endDecember 2015, a total of 1,126 staff had been successfully
moved and settled in Abidjan. Only 79 staff members were
still in Tunis, awaiting relocation to Abidjan once the necessary
arrangements are completed. The Bank took advantage of
its return to Abidjan to launch several projects to renovate
and rehabilitate its facilities in Abidjan. The rehabilitation of the
Headquarters building included the renovation of fire safety
systems, electrical and thermal installations, modernization
of interior fixtures (partitions, false ceilings, floors, walls, etc.)
and procurement of more ergonomic furniture for enhanced
staff comfort. Other infrastructure renovation projects
being finalized include: (i) the rehabilitation of Cité BAD’s 81
apartments; (ii) the rehabilitation of the President’s villa; and
(ili) the Construction of a new 300-spot parking lot at the
Headquarters building to be completed in 2016. This will
complement the rented 230-spot parking lot adjacent to the
Centre de Commerce International d’Abidjan (CCIA) building.

 

Information Technology. During the year, the Bank continued
the implementation of key priority projects in its Information
Technology Strategy (ITS), with focus on the supervision

69Chapter 4

of the installation and provision of IT infrastructure in the
Headquarters building. Installation of the Bank’s network
connectivity services and a unified wireless network has
been completed for all locations (Tunis, Abidjan, Pretoria,
Nairobi, and all FOs). The use of a unified communication
system has improved the Bank's overall performance and
greatly contributed to sustaining the staff productivity during
the return to Abidjan.

The capacity for videoconferencing improved with 1,000
simultaneous connections, including 500 units installed
at the CCIA and Headquarters buildings. This resulted in
an increase in the number of corporate meetings held via
videoconferencing which rose to 2,895 in 2015, a 20 percent
increase relative to the previous year. Almost all recruitment
interviews for candidates based outside Céte d'Ivoire were held
via videoconferencing. The enhancement of facilities, especially
for meetings and corporate interviews, led to savings of about
UA 18.8 million in 2015 in travel and related expenses.

Business Continuity Management. As part of the Business
Continuity (BC) risk-mitigation plan, a Bank-wide BC review
process was initiated in 2015. This comprised training
workshops and Business Impact Analysis (BIA). The review
process involved managers, Directors and BC coordinators
from all departments at Headquarters (HQ).

Following the strong measures taken by the Bank in 2014
both at its HQ and FOs to prevent the risk of staff and
their families contracting the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), the
Bank took further steps in 2015, principal among them the
establishment of an EVD isolation unit outside the CCIA
building in Abidjan. The Bank also developed and instituted
special guidelines to handle potential cases of contagion in
its community. To support staff, learn how it was coping and
how best to provide help, the Bank sent delegations to the
FOs in Liberia and Sierra Leone where the disease had struck.
The visit enabled specialists and Management to dialogue with
their counterparts, learn lessons for dealing efficiently with
issues arising from the disease, and prepare for the future
should similar situations arise.

Other achievements included delivery of normal BC activities
as planned for in the BC work program for 2015:

(i) | Conducting BC workshop/training sessions in FOs

(Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Mozambique, Tunisia,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia);

70

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

(ii) | Chairing weekly meetings of the Emergency Management
Team to manage crisis situations (terrorist shootings in
Bardo, Tunis); the effect of the political crisis in Burundi
on the Burundi FO, and the evacuation of international
staff family members to safer locations while ensuring
a minimum disruption of activities;

(iii) | Conducting the mandatory yearly Bank-wide BC testing

and exercises at the Bank’s BC site in South Africa,

to reaffirm the Bank’s readiness to cope with major
disruptions and to consolidate the resilience of its
infrastructure and BC risk-mitigation response.

Update on the Fine-Tuning of the Organizational Structure.

The Bank Group’s organizational structure has undergone
some institutional fine-tuning since 2013 when reforms were
instituted to enhance its capacity to implement its Ten-Year
Strategy (TYS). The following is an update on the 2015
activities of the newly created organizational units.

e The Transition Support Department (ORTS) continues to
be an effective focal point for all issues related to Bank
Group operations in States under fragile situations.
The ORTS has been fully staffed and is responsible
for applying the Transition Support Facility (TSF) and
conducting all fragility analyses.

e The Business Development Department (COBD) was
established to proactively build the Bank’s business.
However, its first and primary mandate was to design,
structure, operationalize and raise funds for Africa50 —
the new innovative infrastructure project delivery vehicle.
This primary mandate of COBD expired when Africa50
was incorporated and held its Constitutive General
Assembly meeting on 29 July 2015 at its host location
in Casablanca, Morocco. The COBD still exists, but
its work in business development is limited and is
currently focused on establishing regional PublicPrivate Partnership hubs that would support business
development in the regions. Its full mandate will be
decided in the ongoing reforms in 2016 on the new
Business Delivery Model.

e The Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) consolidated
the Bank’s risk management activities in 2015
through: (i) actively monitoring the loan portfolio and
providing periodic reports on credit risk, to the Board
Committee including the Annual Portfolio Credit Review;(ii) co-leading implementation of the Private Sector
Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF) framework approved
by the Board; (iii) producing an annual Market Risk
Review presented to the Audit and Finance Committee
(AUFI), ensuring internal consistency of the Bank’s asset
and liability management policies and guidelines; and
(iv) providing assessment of the Bank’s Internal Controls
for Financial Reporting (ICFR) and Fiduciary Risks (FR).
In addition, GCRO led the preparation of the Multilateral
Development Bank (MDB) exposure exchange with
the Inter-American Development Bank and the World
Bank, which was approved by their respective Boards
of Directors and jointly signed in 2015.

The African Natural Resources Center (ANRC) delivered
anumber of products in 2015 to build the RMCs’ natural
resource management capacity. First, in collaboration
with the African Legal Support Facility (ALSF) and the
African Development Institute (EADI), guidelines were
provided for governments to improve the capacity
to negotiate mega extractive contracts. A training
manual intended to guide contract negotiations was
also produced. Second, a simplified tool to manage
compliance with European Union regulations to deal
with illegal fishing was introduced. This is expected to
secure revenue and jobs, and to boost trade. Third, the
ANRC provided a policy guide on options to leverage
extractive projects to improve human development.
Further, the ANRC initiated country support programs
in Guinea’s mining sector, as well as in Tanzania’s
and Mozambique’s gas sectors. The programs are
designed to strengthen the capacity of governments
to implement extractive projects. The ANRC strategy
was approved in 2015.

The Financial Sector Development Department (OFSD)
prepared the Financial Sector Development Policy and
Strategy (2014-2019), approved by the Board in 2015.
The OFSD’s mandate is to facilitate Africa’s growth
financing. This mission rests on two pillars: (i) financial
inclusion of the underserved; and (ii) extending Africa’s
financial systems. During the year, OFSD continued
to support on-lending to priority sectors such as
agribusiness and micro-, small-, and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) through lines of credit to financial
institutions and the use of guarantees largely derived
from executed risk participation agreements (RPAs)
under the Bank’s Trade Finance Program.

Chapter 4

e The Delivery and Performance Management Office (COPM)
continued to support Senior Management and Operations
Departments through its flagship reports produced in
2015, namely, the Executive Dashboard and the Portfolio
Flashlight Report. These provide early warning on delivery
slippage or poor performance, and propose corrective
measures. Through such publications, the COPM assisted
in instilling a higher sense of urgency for delivery and
greater transparency on performance. Accordingly, COPM
contributed to the strong Bank Group performance of UA
6.33 billion at end-2015, exceeding the annual target of
UA 4.98 billion by 28.6 percent, and representing a 25.4
percent increase over the 2014 approvals of UA 5.05 billion.

4.2 Development Effectiveness
and Quality Assurance

During the year, the Bank Group continued to make progress
in establishing quality social and environmental safeguards,
enhancing the quality of its operations, and strengthening its
ability to measure and manage for development results. Notably,
the AfDB contributed to the positive outcome of the COP21
global agreement, which reflects Africa’s interests on issues
of climate change, as also addressed elsewhere in this Report.

Climate Change, Environment, and Social Sustainability.
Africa’s economic transformation underpins the vision of
the Bank Group and the RMCs. The focus is to ensure
that growth is socially inclusive and pursued in a manner
that is both economically empowering and environmentally
sustainable. The AfDB acknowledges that achieving this vision
is contingent on implementing environmental, social and
climate-change safeguards. Following the Boards’ approval
of an Integrated Safeguards System (ISS) in 2013, the AfDB
has made considerable progress in streamlining procedures
and guidelines that make the ISS fully operational and effective.
These achievements include the following:

(i) | Both the Environmental and Social Assessment
Procedures (ESAP) and Guidance Materials were
formally endorsed by Management in 2014; the
ESAP is currently publicly available online;

(ii) | Relevant knowledge documentation on key issues of
upgrading and use of country systems and involuntary
resettlement have also been published to strengthen
the capacity of the AfDB operational staff;

71Chapter 4

(iii) The capacity of the RMCs has been enhanced
through regional training programs organized in
Tunis, Nairobi, Dakar, and Pretoria. The programs
drew upon a broad spectrum of experts in these
countries and from elsewhere in Africa.

With the rollout of the ISS, the AfDB continues to ensure that all
its operations are assessed up-front and managed according
to the established environmental and social sustainability
objectives. In the area of climate change, the AfDB continued
to play a key role in championing the African agenda in 2015
as demonstrated by the following outcomes:

(i) | Over 60 climate change-related knowledge products,
comprising books, working papers, briefs, flagship
documents, and newsletters were produced. The
AfDB also provided technical assistance to the
RMCs and logistical support of up to USD 2
million for delegates during the COP21 negotiation
processes. The AfDB has invested a similar amount
per annum over three years, beginning with COP19,
held in Warsaw, Poland, in 2013.

(ii) | Effective and full implementation of the Climate
Safeguards System (CSS) tool, which enables
the AfDB to better manage climate change risks,
vulnerability, and adaptation across all of its
interventions on the continent.

(iii) |The implementation of the AfDB’s Climate Change
Action Plan (CCAP) for 2011-2015, which has led
to the mobilization of about USD 6.5 billion. Based
on Climate Finance Tracking, USD 3.8 billion of
this amount has so far been allocated to mitigation
activities while USD 1.6 billion has been allocated
to adaptation operations.

Training of more than 600 international development
experts in Africa in climate-change-related issues
and support to eight countries to help mainstream
climate-change issues into their Results-Based
Country Strategy Papers (RBCSPs).

Training of more than 150 AfDB staff, officials and
private sector practitioners from the RMCs on
integration of green growth measures in project
development. Ten projects, which were presented
during training sessions, are being provided with

72

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

technical assistance and advisory services to
integrate green growth measures and to secure
funding from climate funds to handle the incremental
costs of green growth measures. Four of these
projects are from the private sector.

Enhancing the Quality of Operations. The Bank Group is
continuously improving the quality-at-entry of strategies and
operations by promoting a strong results culture. The ultimate
objective is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of
AfDB interventions.

As part of broadening the ownership of results in the Bank
Group, the Readiness Review (RR) is in the process of being
ully delegated to the Vice President, Operations for Country &
Regional Programs & Policy (ORVP). Several training sessions for
Country Program Officer (CPO) focal points have been organized
‘oO ensure sufficient capacity to coordinate and undertake the
RRs by the RRCs. The RR methodology was also aligned to
he new Presidential Directive (PD 02/2015) on implementation
and cancelation of Bank Group Sovereign Operations.

With the support of the UK’s Department for International
Development (DflD) Trust Fund, the Bank Group is progressing
steadily with the Task Manager Academy. This initiative provides
a comprehensive training program for all Task Managers in
charge of designing, approving, and supervising operations.
initial modules on concepts, business practices and instruments
have already been designed. Consultations with departments
on the content and rolling-out modalities are currently being
undertaken. In addition, the AfDB is developing an online
Results-Based Logical Framework e-course for projects.

 

The Bank Group is also working on reviewing the preparation
and drafting of Country Strategy Papers (CSP). One of the
main innovations in the new approach is the adoption of the
new results tools for country strategies, which will improve
the AfDB’s strategic alignment and tracking of results in a
comprehensive manner at the country level. These results tools
were discussed in-depth by experts at the MDB meeting on
Country Strategies: Emerging Practices to Enhance Quality
and Results, hosted by the AfDB in Abidjan in June 2015.
The new CSP process is being piloted in Mozambique, and
key lessons learned will inform upon prior to Bank-wide
implementation.

The Bank Group is enhancing its results culture by monitoring
the quality and level of confidence in project rating throughits RR, Implementation Progress and Results report (IPR),
and Project Completion Reports (PCRs). Data are published
quarterly in the Quality Assurance Dashboard and circulated
to Senior Management and departments for follow-up action.

Lastly, the AfDB is continuing to support operations staff in their
endeavor to enhance quality-at-entry of operations through
the Quality Assurance Helpdesk and on-demand requests for
support and training for departments. In view of the success
of these initiatives, the Bank Group is currently in the process
of institutionalizing the quality assurance clinics, which provide
tailor-made support to Task Managers.

Managing for Development Results (MfDR). The AfDB
has significantly strengthened its focus on measuring and
managing for development results. In addition to the 2015
Annual Development Effectiveness Review (ADER), the AfDB
also produced a thematic report on energy and two country
reports on Ethiopia and Sierra Leone.

The ADER series are structured around the AfDB Results
Measurement Framework (RMF), which is a corporate
management tool designed to demonstrate how the Institution’s
operations impact development effectiveness in the RMCs.
The RMF tracks about 100 performance indicators aggregated
into four interconnected criteria: (i) development progress
in Africa (Level 1); (ii) AfDB’s contribution to development in
Africa (Level 2); (iii) operational performance (Level 3); and
(iv) organizational efficiency (Level 4).

The 2015 ADER focused on “Driving Development through
Innovation”. The report showed that Africa’s growth prospects
remain positive, driven by a rapidly growing and urbanizing
population, shifting patterns of trade and investment, and
improvements in economic management. However, to
accelerate the pace of change and improve lives, Africa needs
innovation and new home-grown ideas. The AfDB can play
an important role to catalyze their pace, especially in shifting
agriculture from mere subsistence farming to agribusiness.
It can also foster the right conditions for quality job creation
and business opportunities in manufacturing.

The thematic report on “2014 Development Effectiveness
Review on Energy”, launched in April 2015 and covering the
period 2009-2013, shows that the Bank committed over
USD 13 billion over the past two decades to develop the
energy sector in Africa. These commitments were directed
towards building national generation capacity and developing

Chapter 4

distribution networks, with emphasis on rural electrification.
As noted in Chapter 2, the focus on rural electrification is in
line with the TYS energy infrastructure pillar, aimed at bringing
reliable and affordable power to rural areas, where access
remains particularly limited.

The “Development Effectiveness Review on Ethiopia,
2015” evaluated the AfDB’s contribution to the country’s
development by examining progress in inclusive growth and
poverty reduction, and the challenges encountered in the
process. The report notes that from 2005 to 2013, AfDB
investments have made a substantial contribution towards
expanding Ethiopia’s road infrastructure and improving
access to transport for over 7.5 million people. Further, the
Bank Group’s contribution helped the country to provide
nearly 40,000 people with electricity.

The “Development Effectiveness Review on Sierra Leone,
2015”, provided a review of the country’s progress in managing
the transition from conflict, and of the lessons that the
AfDB learned from delivering support effectively in a fragile
environment. For example, during the Ebola crisis, the AfDB
swiftly mobilized emergency budget support and technical
assistance amounting to USD 60 million for the country’s
emergency relief and reconstruction.

During 2015, the AfDB continued to reinforce the tools,
processes, and systems that underpin its Results Measurement
Framework, including the Results Reporting System (RRS),
developed in 2013. The RRS tracks portfolio performance
by sector, region, and country, providing management with
critical information to improve performance. The framework
was refined in 2015 and will be ready for a full rollout once
the SharePoint infrastructure to integrate the information
technology applications (SAP, Microsoft Exchange, and Oracle,
among others) is complete. Further, in fulfilment of the its
commitment to transparency and accountability in the use of
its resources, the Bank continued to publish monthly data in
the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) registry. To
fully establish a results-oriented culture across the institution,
a training workshop on Results Based Management was
developed and delivered to 25 Bank staff in Abidjan.

As a development institution, the AfDB is committed to
delivering value for money (VfM) and results to its clients, both
public and private. In this respect, it led an initiative with five
of its partner MDBs to improve a collective understanding of
value for money, and commissioned a Concept Paper on VfM.

73Chapter 4

In addition, the AfDB continued to invest in strengthening
national statistical capacity in the RMCs for evidence-based
policy making, within the framework of the Africa Community of
Practice for Managing for Development Results (AfCoP). This
is carried out through: (i) strengthening capacity on managing
for development results in the RMCs and RECs, such as the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
in partnership with the Africa Capacity Building Foundation;
and (ii) its flagship program, the Africa for Results initiative
(AfrikK4R), which aims to strengthen MfDR capacity to build

capable States and at enhancing regional integration through
the use of MfDR.

Progress made at the four levels in the Results Measurement
Framework mentioned above is presented in Tables 4.1
and 4.2 below. The tables use a traffic light system to
determine scores on the progress made at the four levels:

The Bank Group’s Engagement with Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs). The CSO Engagement Framework
(CSO Framework) offers areas to deepen and improve
development results. Under the CSO Framework, the AfDB
interacts continually with numerous CSOs across the continent,
engaging with them through information sharing, consultation,
operational collaboration, and institutional partnerships. As a
result of the CSO Framework, the AfDB has institutionalized
CSO participation at its Annual Meetings. This commitment
provides the forum to discuss specific topics and/or highlight
some key achievements linked to the TYS. At the 2015
Annual Meetings, the Bank Group and the CSOs discussed
and shared experiences on transparency, accountability, and
climate change, and on the broader relationship between them
and the Bank Group. The AfDB has started to develop a Plan
of Action to operationalize the CSO Framework.

In 2015, the Bank Group launched the AfDB-CSO Committee,
which has the mandate to advise and inform the AfDB on

76

how to implement the CSO Framework. The institution
is working towards adopting an AfDB-CSO “Charter” to
re-energize the relationship and renew the compact between
he AfDB and CSOs. The CSO Charter would demonstrate
he Bank Group’s determination to focus more on CSOs and
help them to contribute to AfDB’s operations. To increase
collaboration with CSOs, the AfDB has elaborated a mapping
of CSOs in Africa to provide a broad overview of CSOs on
he continent. The process has led to the establishment of
an AfDB-CSO database that was launched during the 2015
Annual Meetings.

To improve communications with CSOs, a dedicated portal

has been established on the Bank Group’s website. The
Bank Group has also taken measures to increase the number
of CSOs able to access AfDB information and contribute
0 building CSOs’ knowledge and capacity, as well as
consolidating the work of the Bank Group in its role as a
knowledge broker.4.3 Policies and Strategies

Implementation of the Bank Group’s TYS entered its third
year in 2015, with a focus on policies and strategies that
support inclusive growth in Africa, and Africa’s transition
to green growth. Acknowledging the changing global aid
architecture, policies and strategies that enhance the financing
of Africa's development received special attention. During the
year, the Bank Group approved new policies, strategies, and
operational guidelines, as outlined below.

Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group
Funded Operations. The Boards of Directors approved
a new Procurement Policy Framework in October 2015.
The new Framework comprises: (i) Procurement Policy for
Bank Group Funded Operations (Policy); (ii) Methodology
for Implementation of the Procurement Policy of the African
Development Bank (Methodology); (iii) the Operations
Procurement Manual for the African Development Bank
(OPM); and (iv) the Procurement Toolkit (Toolkit). The OPM and
the Toolkit will be uploaded on the Bank’s website as soon
as they become available. The new Procurement Framework
will be implemented in 2016.

The Procurement Framework is designed to support AfDBfinanced operations and enhance procurement systems in the

RMCs to enable them to ob’
on the mutually reinforcing

ain optimal value for money based
principles of economy, efficiency,

Chapter 4

and (ii) strengthening the quality of the AfDB policy dialogue,
advisory services, and involvement in the development
debate. The implementation of the KMS will build on the
AfDB’s established knowledge assets, including its flagship
publications, policy dialogues, capacity-building programs,
and the knowledge management and learning ICT platform.

African Natural Resources Center (ANRC) Strategy. The
ANRC strategy (2015-2020) was approved by the Boards in
July 2015. The strategy proposes two pillars: (i) integrated
natural resource development planning to protect the
environment through sustainable development; and (ii) good
governance of natural resources to support negotiations, local
content and transparency through public participation. With
respect to the value chain, the Center’s program plans to focus
on the raw material stage that includes project development,
but excludes the processing and post-processing stages.
From a governance perspective, the program embodies
the provision of advice on policies, laws, and institutional
frameworks that regulate projects at the raw material stage.

Strategic Framework and Operational Guidelines for the
Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF). In May
2015, the Board approved the Framework and Guidelines for
the PSF. This provides an avenue for the African Development
Fund (ADF) to invest in development results through the private
sector by leveraging the Bank’s Private Sector Operations
(PSO) capability to support private sector projects in ADF
effectiveness, and equity. The key feature of the framework
is the achievement of value for money by borrowers, based

eligible countries. To estab!
a seed contribution of UA

ish the PSF, the ADF provided
165 million under ADF-13. The

 

on a dynamic and differen

iated fit-for-purpose approach to

procurement transactions. This approach includes the full
use of borrower procurement systems for certain contracts,
and customized methods and procedures for more complex
instances.

Bank Group Knowledge Management Strategy. In June
2015, the Boards of Directors approved a Knowledge
Management Strategy (KMS) for 2015-2020. With its ability
to combine knowledge with funding, the AfDB increasingly
complements its financing with Knowledge products and
services, including analytical, advisory, and policy work.
The strategic objective of the KMS is to raise the AfDB’s
development effectiveness by providing and exchanging
innovative knowledge solutions for Africa’s transformation with
African countries. The KMS has two pillars: (i) reflecting the role
of knowledge in enhancing the effectiveness of Bank Group
operations to address Africa’s pressing development needs;

PSF is financially autonomous with a total separation of
its resources from those of the African Development Bank
(ADB) and the ADF. The Bank’s triple-A rating would ensure a
highly catalytic PSF that leverages approximately three times
its capital resources. Accordingly, the UA 165 million seed
capital grant to the Facility will guarantee up to UA 495 million
of PSO in ADF-eligible countries. The Operational Guidelines
Manual for the implementation of the Facility is intended to
guide staff and management in the day-to-day processing
and management of PSF operations. In addition to the PSF
capability, the Board also approved a list of projects to benefit
from the PSF. Furthermore, the administrator of the PSF was
appointed in 2015.

 

Regional Integration Policy and Strategy (RIPoS). In
November 2015, the Boards approved the new Regional
Integration Policy and Strategy (RIPoS) for the period
2014-2023. This will help to operationalize the TYS, which

77Chapter 4

reaffirms the Bank Group’s commitment to promote regional
integration in Africa. To this end, the strategy focuses on two
complementary areas: supporting regional infrastructure
development, and enhancing the continent’s industrialization
and trade. The new policy and the strategy both focus on
creating larger and more-attractive markets, linking landlocked
countries to international markets, and supporting intra-African
trade to foster the continent’s development. The RIPoS will
guide the AfDB’s support to countries and regional institutions
in economic integration by leveraging the institution’s roles as
a financier, catalyst, and knowledge broker. It places increased
emphasis on enhancing trade and industrial development
to create jobs and foster inclusive growth. It also places
greater emphasis on “soft” infrastructure issues such as
trade facilitation, policy reforms, and regional harmonization
of policies and regulations on infrastructure, trade, and
investment.

4.4 Mid-Term Review
of the ADF-13 Replenishment

The ADF Deputies agreed that most of the commitments
at the Mid-Term Review had been met under the ADF-13
replenishment. They stressed the importance of improving
gender balance within the institution, in particular at
management level.

ADF Deputies met in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire, in November
2015 for the ADF-13 Mid-Term Review. They were joined by
Governors and Representatives from Cédte d’lvoire, Ghana,
and Malawi, and observers from other MDBs and International
Financial Institutions.

The Deputies highlighted a number of achievements made
by the Bank at the ADF-13 Mid-Term, starting with the
significant progress in delivering on most of its commitments.
They also noted that the PSF was fully operational and there
is evidence of strong demand. They commended the AfDB
Transition Support Facility’s vigorous response to crises such
as the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone,
as an example of the TSF’s value added in country-specific
situations.

However, the Deputies drew attention to some areas that
needed closer attention. The lower loan disbursement rates
and the slow uptake of innovative financing instruments (partial
credit guarantee and partial risk guarantee) were of major

78

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

concern. Moreover, given the urgent need to offset the effects
of climate change, the Bank Group needed to play a key role
in mobilizing climate financing. They recommended that the
Fund continue supporting the RMCs through policy-based
financing and promoting domestic resource mobilization. The
Deputies welcomed the fact that the Bank Group has made
significant progress in gender advocacy and mainstreaming
in its operations. Nevertheless, they stressed the need to
improve the gender balance within the Institution, particularly
at management level. They also noted that consultations for
ADF-14 should focus on addressing outstanding elements
in ADF-13 and articulating the new areas of emphasis to
accelerate implementation of the TYS.

4.5 Independent Evaluation
of the Bank Group

During 2015, the Independent Development Evaluation of the
Bank Group completed 12 influential evaluations (not including
project-level evaluations). This marked the highest number in
the Bank Group’s 30-year history of independent evaluation.
These evaluations provided evidence-based and credible
information that helped to shape the Bank Group's work in
several strategic areas. The evaluations also helped the AfDB to
demonstrate accountability to its stakeholders and contributed
to better decision-making. In addition, the AfDB stepped up
efforts to foster learning from, and use of these evaluations,
through stronger communications, knowledge management,
outreach, and dissemination—both inside and outside the
institution. Activities. to promote an evaluation culture, boost
the supply of evaluations in the RMCs, and strengthen the
demand for evaluation products were also enhanced.

The Bank Group completed three thematic evaluations,
five Country Strategy and Program evaluations (of
Cameroon, Senegal, Togo, Ethiopia, and Tanzania), three
corporate evaluations, and one cluster evaluation of power
interconnection projects. The thematic evaluations were the
Evaluation of the AfDB’s Assistance to SMEs, the Evaluation
of the Bank’s Private Equity Investments and a report on the
Bank's Utilization of the Public-Private Partnership Mechanism.

The most notable independent evaluation conducted during
2015 was an overall assessment of the Bank’s implementation
of the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and the African
Development Fund 12th and 13th Replenishment (ADF12 and ADF-13) commitments. This evaluation comprisedthree components: (i) Independent Evaluation of General
Capital Increase VI and African Development Fund 12 and
13 Commitments: Overarching Review; (ii) Independent
Evaluation of Policy and Strategy Making and Implementation;
and (iii) Administrative Budget Management of the ADB: An
Independent Evaluation. Highlights of the three commitment
evaluations are provided below:

Independent Evaluation of General Capital Increase VI and
the African Development Fund 12 and 13 Commitments. The
objectives of this evaluation were to draw conclusions and
lessons about: (i) the relevance of the agreed commitments
vis-a-vis the Bank Group’s challenges and priorities;
(ii) the efficiency of the process in reaching agreement
on a coherent and realistic portfolio of commitments;
(iii) delivery of commitments (outputs such as documents
and the establishment of new structures or processes); and
(iv) effectiveness of their implementation.

Overall, the evaluation found that the Bank Group is delivering
on its commitments with respect to preparation of agreed
documents and establishment of agreed structures. However,
about half the commitments are delivered late. Furthermore,
although the AfDB’s reform agenda is on course, the evaluation
could not conclude positively on the AfDB’s ability to resource
these initiatives and ensure effective implementation to achieve
the desired benefits. It recommends that the Bank Group
should focus on designing a thorough and robust planning,
execution and resourcing strategy before embarking upon
new and major reforms.

Independent Evaluation of Policy and Strategy Making and
Implementation. This evaluation assessed the formulation,
management and implementation of the AfDB policies and
strategies—the core regulatory instruments that govern
operational and institutional activities and programs.
The primary purpose of the evaluation was to support
improvement in the preparation and implementation of
Bank Group policies and strategies, which serve as building
blocks for its organizational and development effectiveness.
The evaluation found that there is generally a comprehensive
coverage of issues of relevance to the AfDB and its RMCs in
Bank Group policies and strategies. However, it highlighted
a few concerns, especially the lack of a clear framework
and agreed nomenclature to guide the preparation of these
documents, and the failure to clearly distinguish between the
purpose and content of strategies and policies, and what
should trigger their formulation. The evaluation also found

Chapter 4

that the AfDB lacked an easy-to-navigate repository of active
policies and strategies.

Administrative Budget Management of the African Development Bank: An Independent Evaluation. The objective of this
evaluation exercise was to assess the extent to which the
management of the Bank’s administrative budget provides
efficiency and effectiveness in delivering on its strategic
priorities and areas, to identify areas for further improvements.
The evaluation also assessed the extent to which key actions
recommended by the 2012 review of the budget reform had
been implemented. The evaluation found that budget reform
was relevant and adequately articulated, and integrated with
other components of the Bank’s reforms. However, overall
implementation has been challenging, and the chronology and
sequencing have not always respected either for the timetable
set out in 2007, or the overall logic of the reform. Although
budget tools have been enhanced, more effort is needed
to refine and improve the procedures for implementation.
Furthermore, because behavioral changes required for effective
implementation of the reforms were not adequately addressed,
the reform has had limited effect on Institutional efficiency and
on key processes, notably the planning of budgets and work
programs. Resource allocation and strategic objectives have
been aligned but up-front strategic priority setting and use of
results data should be strengthened.

This evaluation of administrative budget management drew
four key lessons that are also relevant for other institutional
reforms. These are, ensuring: (i) external coherence; (ii) better
sequencing of the reforms; (iii) cultural and behavioral change;
and (iv) sponsorship and reform of the management structure
by Senior Management.

4.6 Procurement and Fiduciary Services

Procurement and Fiduciary Services are provided as direct
assistance to the RMCs through rigorous assessments
and well-designed training and capacity-building activities
in public financial management and procurement. These
services generate positive impacts on other areas of the Bank
Group’s work, such as project implementation and financial
governance.

Sustainable economic development and social progress in the

RMCs can be successfully achieved with better utilization of
the funds disbursed for development projects and programs.

79Chapter 4

Hence, the Bank Group continues to systematically support
capacity building and systems enhancement for proper public
finance management and procurement. In specific cases of
the RMCs in transition, Bank staff work with the authorities
on AfDB-financed projects to put in place adequate mitigation
measures for successful project outcomes.

In 2015, as in previous years, the AfDB’s Procurement and
Fiduciary Services contributed to the design, preparation,
appraisal, supervision, and completion of projects and
programs financed by the Bank Group. An additional area
of focus was the development of a new Procurement Policy
Framework, approved by the Boards of Directors in October
2015. Developed after wide consultations with the relevant
stakeholders, the framework aims to support AfDB-financed
operations and enhance procurement systems in the RMCs.

During 2015, the AfDB’s Financial Management arm continued
to monitor compliance with safeguards related to the prudent
financial management of projects and programs supported by
the Bank. This included the framing and revision of financial
management policies, guidelines, and rules to support the
financial services function in the Bank. The AfDB’s emphasis
on prompt submission of project audit reports resulted in an
improvement in the quality and timeliness of these reports.

A number of fiduciary clinics were conducted in the RMCs,
in collaboration with the Bank Group’s African Development
Institute (EADI), to build capacity for procurement and financial
management. The training emphasized the achievement of
value for money for Bank-funded projects, and fitness-forpurpose arrangements.

4.7 The Bank as a Knowledge Broker

In line with its Knowledge Management Policy, the Bank
Group’s Knowledge Program in 2015 was implemented
through production and dissemination of development
research products, statistical publications, and training and
capacity-building activities. The knowledge products included
flagship publications, books, working papers, data banks,
training and capacity building, and policy advisory services
for the benefit of the RMCs.

4.1.1 Development Research Activities

During the year, the Bank Group’s research activities aimed
at delivering high-quality knowledge products that reflect the

80

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

socio-economic realities in the RMCs. Some of the research
work was demand-driven. Core flagship and thematic
knowledge products to gain deeper understanding of the
continent's development priorities, opportunities, and challenges
were also produced. During the peak of the Ebola crisis, for
instance, a study was conducted highlighting the economic
impact of the disease. The evidence from the study facilitated
internal discussion by Senior Management, and this enhanced
the AfDB’s dialogue and advocacy in the affected countries.
Overall, significant progress was also made in delivering on
the core mandate of development research. Some of the
knowledge products generated during the year included the
following:

(i) Key flagship publications: 2014 Bank Group
Annual Report; 2015 African Development Report;
2015 African Economic Outlook; 2015 Africa
Competitiveness Report, and five editions of the
African Development Review, including a special
issue on Aid and Employment.

(ii) | Other publications: These included 34 economic
briefs; 12 journal articles published in internationally
reputed journals by staff; a book titled “Urbanization
and Socio-economic Development in Africa:
Challenges and Opportunities”; four chapters by staff
in books published; and 20 working papers on issues
relevant to Africa’s socio-economic development.
Two books on the low level of industrialization in
Africa were also published through the “Learning to
Compete (L2C)” project, a collaboration between the
Bank Group’s Development Research Department,
the Brookings Institution, and UNU-WIDER. The
L2C project, which addressed the theme “Why little
industrialization in Africa?”, resulted in the publication
of the two books by Brookings Publishing House
and Oxford University Press.

(iii) Workshops and Conferences: 45 presentations
were made to external stakeholders, including policy
makers in Africa, development partners, investors
interested in Africa’s development prospects, think
tanks, and research centers working on issues
relevant to Africa. Within the Bank, more than 30
research seminars were organized, showcasing
research work by Bank staff across different
organizational units. High-level guest speakers were
also invited to address key issues that were relevantto Africa’s development. Bank researchers and
experts also attended other fora and international
conferences, including the UNU-WIDER Annual
Conference in Helsinki; the African Econometrics
Society Conference in Lusaka, and the African
Economic Conference (AEC) in Kinshasa. These
events brought together researchers, policy
makers, and development practitioners, including
Africans in the Diaspora, to exchange knowledge
and experiences on different aspects of Africa’s
Renaissance. For the first time, the African Economic
Outlook was disseminated in three Nordic countries—
Norway, Finland, and Denmark—at the initiative of
the Authorities in these countries. In general, the
different events held in 2015 also provided Bank
staff with the opportunity to present their ongoing
research work and flagship publications, thereby
furthering the Bank’s information management.

The Bank Group also launched another path-breaking research

initiative on Structural Transformation of African Agriculture
and Rural Spaces (STAARS). This multi-year research project
is being implemented in collaboration with the African
Economic Research Consortium (AERC), Cornell University,
the Partnership for Economic Policy (PEP), and the World
Bank. Further, the Bank Group is finalizing the publication
of findings from a study on “Housing Market Dynamics in
Africa”, jointly undertaken with UN-Habitat. The output from
this study will shape the Bank’s strategy and interventions in
Africa’s housing sector.

 

Anumber of research initiatives focusing on different aspects
of the TYS have been launched or concluded. These
include: (i) an analysis of the electricity markets in Africa;
(ii) the operationalization of inclusive growth and financial
inclusion; (iii) the assessment of the impact of centralized cash
registers on tax evasion, and a randomized experiment on the
impact of detection probability on the behavior of tax payers,
both in Ethiopia; (iv) a study on the impact of communitybased health insurance for the utilization of modern healthcare services by self-employed people in Rwanda; and
(v) revisiting development planning for Africa’s structural
transformation, and leveraging macroeconomic modeling and
debt sustainability analysis for policy dialogue and capacity
building, among others. The studies on Ethiopia and Rwanda
lay the groundwork for the replication of the impact evaluation
(IE) methodologies and the use of the technical expertise
gained in other parts of the continent.

Chapter 4

To strengthen development effectiveness, projects considered
for financing by the Bank are reviewed and assessed from the
perspectives of additionality and development outcomes. In
2015, the Board revised and endorsed the Additionality and
Development Outcomes Assessment (ADOA) Framework for
impact assessments of the Bank’s private sector projects.
A total of 62 ADOA notes were issued for some 40 private
sector operations, representing an achievement of 103 percent
against the 2015 target. This performance reflects the growth
in the number of operations in the active portfolio resulting, in
part, from the increased support to financial intermediaries in
the RMCs. The current ADOA framework was used to review 14
regional operations presented for the 2015 prioritization cycle.

4.1.2 Statistical Knowledge

Products and Activities

Statistical capacity and knowledge work by the Bank Group
has grown in focus and relevance in recent years, with some
MDBs using it to benchmark their own activities.

In September 2015, the Boards approved UA 10 million
for financing the Multinational Statistical Capacity Building
Program for Managing for Development Results (SCB-MfR)
Phase 4.2, covering the period 2015-2016. The program's
aim is to provide technical assistance and financial support
to all the RMCs and regional organizations at the national
and regional level. Its objective is to provide for continued
improvement in the quality, timeliness, and reliability of
statistics to support more effective economic management,
inclusive growth monitoring, better-informed policy making,
and design of programs and projects in the RMCs.

Some of the statistical knowledge products produced and/or
managed by the AfDB in 2015 include the following:

e The Africa Information Highway (AIH). The AIH was
created by the AfDB in 2012 to increase the collection,
management and dissemination of quality statistics on
Africa, in response to calls by various stakeholders to
improve the availability and quality of statistics across
the continent. The AIH has since enhanced data
management and dissemination in Africa significantly
and in 2015 was recognized by the OECD-Paris21
(Partnership in Statistics for Development in the 21st
Century) as one of the most-innovative data initiatives in
the world for informing the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the Board of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) decided that they will rely on

81Chapter 4

82

the AfDB’s AIH for implementing the new enhanced
General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS), which
was approved during the year. The IMF and the AfDB
will jointly implement the e-GDDS in all the RMCs using
the AIH infrastructure. In 2015, Botswana became the
first country in the world to implement the IMF’s e-GDDS.
using the AIH as the core data platform. The IMF also
plans to use the AfDB AIH system as best practice to
be replicated in other regions of the world.

The International Comparison Program for Africa (ICPAfrica). This is part of the global program to generate
Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) statistics to facilitate
cross-country comparison of Gross Domestic Product
and related economic aggregates. Managed by the
AfDB, Africa’s program is the largest component of this
global initiative. The PPP statistics were used in 2015
for poverty measurement in the context of the MDGs
and the SDGs.

The Action Plan to Improve Food and Agricultural Statistics in Africa (2011-2015). This program seeks to improve
availability and quality of core data and indicators to inform
agricultural policies in the RMCs. The Africa Action Plan,
designed by the AfDB, the UN Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA), the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), and the African Union Commission (AUC), is part
of the Global Strategy for Improving Agricultural and
Rural Statistics that was endorsed in February 2010
by the United Nations Statistical Commission. In July
2013, the Boards of Directors approved the AfDB’s
participation in the program as lead agency for the Action
Plan, which is partly funded by the EU, the DflD, and
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Since 2011, a
total of 48 RMCs have benefited from the initiative and
are being assisted in developing Strategic Plans for
Agriculture and Rural Statistics (SPARS), intended to
help mobilize and harness resources to generate the
statistics necessary to inform national development
policies. One of the components of this program is the
farm registration system, which has been rolled out in
four RMCs. This system is expected to improve farm
productivity, including the selection of suitable crops for
given types of soil and rainfall patterns.

Estimating the Investment Needs for the Power Sector
in Africa. In 2015, the AfDB continued to manage the
energy sector diagnostic studies program that, among

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

other issues, aims at estimating the investment needs
for Africa’s power sector. In 2010, the Bank took over
leadership of this program from the World Bank and
has developed the Africa Infrastructure Knowledge
Program, based on the Africa Infrastructure Country
Diagnostic (AICD) methodology—a framework used
to maintain a database of infrastructure indicators. In
the energy sector, the purpose of the approach is to
update previous data assessments on performance,
and institutional and fiscal spending, while supporting
the AICD’s view of providing a more-inclusive energy
dialogue. The results from individual runs will be made
accessible through the AfDB’s AIH.

4.7.3 Training, Other Knowledge Management
and Capacity Development Activities

In 2015, a review of the Bank Group’s training, capacitybuilding, and knowledge-sharing activities was undertaken
with a view to improving the ability of the RMCs to respond
to development challenges and strengthen their capacity for
policy dialogue on key development issues, while enhancing
the development effectiveness of Bank-funded operations.
Some of the activities undertaken during the year and the
related achievements are outlined below.

2015 Annual Meetings. The Permanent Committee
for Annual Meetings (PECAM) organized the statutory
Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors under the
theme: “Africa and the New Global Landscape”. PECAM
also organized five “High-Level Events” on topical issues
(such as climate change, Our Bank at 50), and an
additional 30 “Knowledge Events” that provided a forum
for policy makers and thought leaders to interact and
exchange experiences on key development opportunities
and challenges on the continent.

Seminars and Workshops. Under the Joint Partnership
for Africa (JPA) program, seven seminars on various
aspects of macroeconomic forecasting and modeling
were conducted jointly by EADI and the IMF. These
seminars provided a forum for participants to exchange
country experiences and challenges in different areas of
macroeconomic policy management. EADI also partnered
with the Bank's other functional units for work on different
capacity-building activities, including 19 fiduciary clinic
workshops. Two seminars focusing on Procurement,
Financial Management and Disbursements were held,
with the aim of building capacity for the definition ofrobust and focused country programs through wellarticulated Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). Four other
workshops were also organized in the RMCs on a variety
of issues, including infrastructure, governance, fragility,
and project performance. In addition, EADI organized
three sessions on SME policies during a special training
workshop held in Seoul, Korea. This was designed to
promote SMEs and develop capacity in the RMCs.

Special Projects. The AfDB approved UA 5 million
financing to the African Economic Research Consortium
(AERC). The funds will be used for graduate training,
enhancing the quality of research, increasing the
capacity of academic institutions under the AERC’s
training program, and enhancing communication and
dissemination of its research activities. Support to the
AERC represents a viable partnership between the
AfDB and an external stakeholder involved in capacity
development and generation of knowledge-based
regional public goods. A PCR was also finalized following
a project review of the Bank’s support to the African
Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF). Among the lessons
learned from the PCR is that the ADB member countries
are showing increased interest in hands-on, countryspecific training and technical support. In addition, there
is continuous demand for effective macroeconomic,
financial governance and accountability, and debtmanagement capacity in the RMCs. Accordingly, ACBF
will continue to respond to the needs and priorities of
African countries in these areas.

The Bank Group continued to provide support to its e-Institute.
The e-Institute is an online knowledge portal developed within
the Bank and comprises a Learning and Course-Management
System. It provides a continent-wide distance and e-learning
platform geared towards building a culture of continuous
learning and helping to sustain knowledge exchange networks
among course participants.

4.8 Intermediate Recourse
Mechanisms and Administrative Tribunal

The intermediate recourse mechanism units of the AfDB
continued to perform their roles as agencies of corporate
restraint and responsibility in resolving conflicts and disputes, and
improving working relations among staff and management. This

helped to enhance the effectiveness of Bank Group operations.

Chapter 4

Audit. To ensure a systematic and disciplined approach to the
evaluation and improvement of risk management, control and
governance processes of Bank Group activities, the Office of
he Auditor General (OAGL) developed a Long-Term Coverage
Plan (LTCP) 2015-2019. This aims at rationalizing allocation of
audit resources by concentrating them on the high business
risk and medium business risk areas of the Bank.

During the year, the OAGL conducted audits of 17 high-, ten
medium-, and six low-risk activities. The high-risk areas include
he Board, the Presidency, the Finance, and the Corporate
Services Complexes. Areas deemed to be of medium risk include
he Treasury, Financial Control, Financial Risk Management, and
he Information, Communication, and Technology Services. All
he other areas are classified in the low-risk category.

 

The OAGL also undertook six sovereign country portfoliorelated assignments in the RMCs. These country portfolio
audits are aimed at allowing the Bank to form an overall
opinion as to the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of
controls for Bank-financed projects. The Office also conducted
risk assessments in five FOs.

Staff Integrity and Ethics. In 2015, the Staff Integrity and
Ethics Office attended to all cases of allegations on staff
conduct reported, within three months at most. In all cases,
Management’s response and action was swift, sending a
powerful message within the AfDB of zero tolerance for any
unethical acts or misconduct. The investigations are now
guided by an Internal Investigation Manual and a computerized
Case Management System. This has contributed to enhanced
management and monitoring of staff investigations. In addition,
anew reporting mechanism, the “speak up helpline number”,
accessible at no cost from all telephone operators in Céte
d’lvoire, has been established to help Bank staff and interested
entities to report alleged misconduct. An awareness campaign
on misconduct for all FOs was also launched in the last quarter
of 2015, with completion expected in 2016.

The Staff Integrity and Ethics Office also undertook a Bankwide Staff Survey, and a proposed new Code of Ethics
was submitted to management for consideration. The
proposed new Code takes into account all the changes
and developments that have occurred in the Bank since the
existing Code of Ethics was adopted in 1999.

Ombudsman. During 2015, the Office of the Ombudsman
received a number of grievance reports ranging from abuse

83Chapter 4

of authority to concerns with career development. As at end
December 2015, the Office had
which 28 percent were brough
of complaint. Of the 64 cases
related to career development

handled a total of 64 cases of

it to closure within four weeks
, 21 cases (33 percent) were
and job security.

Upon the return to Headquarters, the Office held various
coaching and empowerment sessions on issues of

confidentiality in order to facili

ate the settling in of staff. As

part of the Outreach and Needs-based Mission, the Office
undertook a field mission to the Senegal Field Office (SNFO)
to attend to anumber of staff grievances. Most of the issues
raised were resolved and settlements made.

Integrity and Anti-Corruption (
its integrity and preventive stra’

IACD). The Bank strengthened
egy in 2015 while building on

the lessons learned through its investigations in 2014. In

collaboration with Interpol and

the Commonwealth Africa

Anti-Corruption Centre, the Bank organized Asset Recovery

training for participants from

en National Anti-Corruption

Agencies from the East African Association of Anti-Corruption
Authorities (EAAACA) and the Southern African Forum Against

Corruption (SAFAC). Further,

he Bank engaged CSOs in

 

Western Africa and joined the United Nations Office on Drugs

and Crime to train civil society

and government agencies in

Africa on the United Nations Convention Against Corruption

(UNCAC).

The Bank continues to receive complaints through its
confidential hotlines and referrals from various Bank
departments. As at end-December 2015, 66 cases were
received and 38 of these went into the investigations process
following initial reviews for credibility, verifiability, and materiality.

Investigations during 2015 led to the closure of 19 cases, and
four reports of “Findings of Sanctionable Practices” on entities
found to have engaged in these were submitted for the Sanction

Commissioner’s determinatio

n. Three entities concluded

Negotiated Settlement Agreements with the Bank to resolve
allegations of sanctionable practices in Bank-financed projects.
These settlements resulted in debarments for the entities and

the imposition of fines totaling

over USD 13.6 million, which

will be used exclusively to finance integrity and anti-corruption
programs and activities in the RMCs. Four debarred companies
are undergoing implementation of an integrity compliance
program. The program guarantees that companies strengthen
their integrity systems to ensure clean business practices before

they can bid for AfDB-financed

84

projects.

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

The Sanctions Appeals Board (SAB). The SAB is the
appeals body of the Bank Group’s new sanctions system. It
is mandated to sanction companies that have committed acts
of corruption, fraud and/or collusion during procurement under
Bank-financed projects and programs, following a decision
of the Sanctions Commissioner (SANO) and investigation by
the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department (IACD).

The first two Appeal Cases were filed for consideration
with the SAB in August 2015. Furthermore, the Secretariat
established fruitful collaboration and built strong network
relationships with counterparts in other MDBs, resulting in
valuable experience sharing. These were organized through
quarterly conference calls and annual meetings held at the
Headquarters of each institution on a rotational basis. In that
context, SAB was invited in May 2015 by the Inter-American
Development Bank (IADB) to present and discuss the Bank
Group’s newly established Sanctions Systems. The SAB
Officials also participated in a panel discussion covering the
issue of MDBs’ sanctions systems during the 33rd Cambridge
International Symposium on Economic Crime, organized in
Cambridge (UK) in September 2015, as well as in the Annual
Meeting of MDBs in October 2015 in Geneva.

Compliance Review and Mediation (CRM). The CRM Unit
administers the Bank Group’s Independent Review Mechanism
(IRM), which receives complaints from people who are, or are
likely to be, adversely affected by AfDB-financed projects.
The IRM registered three new complaints in 2015 while the
monitoring of five was ongoing. Several lessons emerged
from the handling of these complaints. First, there is a need
for comprehensive environmental and social-impact studies to
align the Bank's operations with its vision for inclusive growth,
particularly when projects are developed in highly dense urban
areas and occupied by vulnerable and poor people. Second,
it is necessary to streamline compensation processes through
applying the AfDB policies in concurrence with respective
national laws, careful consideration of resettlement options,
and community engagement and consultation.

In 2015 also marked the conclusion of the second review of
the IRM that led to the adoption by the Boards of a revised IRM
Resolution together with Operating Rules and Procedures. The
Rules are now characterized by: (i) simplified requirements for
accessing the IRM; (ii) removal of the earlier limitation on the IRM
in handling complaints related to private sector projects; and
(ili) expansion of the IRM mandate to include an advisory function
in addition to its problem-solving and compliance-review mandate.Administrative Tribunal. As an autonomous body, the Bank’s
Administrative Tribunal’s decisions are binding, final and
without appeal. The Tribunal continued to perform its function
of settling disputes related to the AfDB staff. The Tribunal
comprises six judges, three of whom are needed to form a
quorum to hear a case. The Statute of the Tribunal provides
for the independence of the Judges. In June 2015, the 25th
Judicial Session of the Tribunal took place in Abidjan. During
the Session, one Application filed in 2014 was heard and
concluded. A total of six new Applications on disputes are
pending for the next Judicial Session in April 2016.

The Secretariat of the Administrative Tribunal conducted its
outreach and training programs in Uganda and Tanzania
in March 2015, in collaboration with partners in the Staff
Council (SCO) and the Staff Appeals Committee (APCU).
The second part of the same program was conducted
in the Angola, Rwanda, and Malawi Field Offices during
October and November 2015. The program was organized to
dialogue, share, enlighten, and inform participants about the
AfDB’s recourse mechanisms, including its internal rules and
regulations, as well as formal and informal avenues for resolving
disputes among staff, and between staff and management.
The reciprocal duties, obligations, and responsibilities of staff
towards the Bank were also covered. Ethical issues and Bank
policies on whistle-blowing, harassment, corruption, and
conduct befitting staff status as international civil servants,
were discussed and appropriate feedback obtained.

4.9 Deployment of Human Resources

The Human Resources Action Plan is the business plan for
the management of the Bank’s human resources, focused on
establishing an attractive culture of professional satisfaction
and personal advancement. Aspects of the Action Plan were
implemented during 2015.

The AfDB Human Resources Action Plan (HRAP) was launched
in 2013 and covers the human resources element of the
Bank Group's TYS. The HRAP was to be implemented in
two phases, with Phase 1 starting from 2013 to end of 2014,
and Phase 2 from 2015 to end-2017. In February 2015, a
retreat was held to review the scope of the HRAP and its five
focus areas referred to as the HRAP strategic levers, namely
Lever 1: Strategic Staff Planning and Workforce Structure;
Lever 2: Selection, Onboarding, and Staff Retention; Lever
8: Talent Management, Learning, and Development; Lever

Chapter 4

4: Performance Management; and Lever 5: Reward and
Recognition. During 2015, aspects of Levers 2, 3 and 4 of
the HRAP were implemented and are outlined below.

Lever 2: Selection, Onboarding and Staff Retention. The
implementation of this lever of the HRAP involved the
recruitment for the 2015 Young Professionals (YP) Program
which, for the first time, was undertaken through an in-house
pilot Assessment Center. Selected staff from various Complexes
were trained at the Center on competency-based interview and
assessment skills. They were taken through a facilitated session
for the selection of successful candidates who would be placed
in a pipeline for selection by the Complexes that requested
new YPs. The pilot Assessment Center was rolled out in the
third quarter of 2015 and will continue to be strengthened
and improved, based on feedback received. Increased efforts
were made to recruit a more diverse YP workforce, encourage
female applicants and ensure their retention.

Lever 3: Talent Management and Learning and Development.

The HRAP Lever 3 implementation took the form of enhanced
staff learning through the placement of more products on
the AfDB electronic portal, the Knowledge and Learning
Management Services (KLMS). The KLMS portal was
upgraded with more learning menus and offerings made
available to all staff, no matter their location, with real-time
access to all learning and training opportunities. To facilitate this
process, the Bank set up collaborative arrangements with two
external partners: (i) the Korean Development Institute Masters
Studies program; and (ii) the YP Post-Graduate Certification
Program with Bradford University. In addition, several in-house
tailor-made training courses were offered to upgrade the
skills of staff from various departments, namely, African
Development Institute (EADI), Procurement and Fiduciary
Services Department (ORPF), Private Sector Department
(OPSD), Results and Quality Assurance Department (ORQR),
and Transition Support Department (ORTS).

Lever 4: Performance Management. In the context of Lever 4,
implementation of the HRAP included a second relatively
lighter Staff Survey conducted in April 2015, following the one
undertaken in 2013. The results of this new survey indicated
a slight decrease in “staff engagement” with the 2015 staff
engagement index at 64 percent compared to the 2013
survey of staff engagement at 66 percent. To address this
challenge and motivate staff members to ensure that they are
fully engaged, three town hall meetings were held, including
two with the new President. The aim was for him to share with

 

85Chapter 4

staff and Management the 2015 Staff Survey results. These
town hall meetings also served as fora to continue to inform
staff on the progress of the return to Headquarters, and share
insights on the rationale for the proposed vision of the new
High 5 priorities within the context of the TYS.

Staffing Ratio by Country and Gender. As at end-December
2015, the total AfDB staffing stood at 1,841 with 1,168 males
(63.4 percent) and 673 females (36.6 percent), compared
with a total staff of 1,932 at end-December 2014. The total
staff at end-December 2015 is distributed as follows: 1,215
professional staff, of which 324 (26.7 percent) female, and
587 general service staff, of which 336 (57.2 percent) female.

86

Institutional Reforms, Effectiveness, and Corporate Management

The breakdown also shows that, of the 587 general service
staff, 395 were at Headquarters, of which 252 (63.8 percent)
were female. There were 192 general service staff in the FOs,
of which 84 (43.8 percent) were female.

In relation to the institutional key performance indicators (KPIs),
female managerial staff (including three at Executive Level
(EL) totaled 39, representing 29.3 percent of 133 managerial
staff, against a target of 30 percent. Also, of the 720 total
professional staff, female staff numbered 220, representing
30.6 percent of the total and above the 30 percent target.

Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities of the Boards

 

Shareholder representation and oversight is ensured through the Boards of Governors and the Boards of Directors.
This chapter highlights how the oversight functions of the Boards were discharged in 2015, including key decisions
made and strategic directions provided to the Bank Group. All the activities reported in the previous chapters were
undertaken by Management under the guidance of the Boards.

5.1 The Roles and Highlights
of Major Activities of the
Boards of Governors

The highest decision-making organs of the ADB (the Bank) and
the ADF (the Fund) are the respective Boards of Governors.
Each member country is represented on these Boards by
a Governor, usually a Minister of Finance or Planning, or a
Central Bank Governor, or a duly designated Alternate. This
section outlines their roles and major activities in 2015.

5.1.1 The 2015 Annual Meetings

As mandated by the respective constitutive instruments, the
Boards of Governors of the Bank and the Fund meet once
every year at the Annual Meetings. During these meetings,
they engage in dialogue with Bank Group Management on
the financial health and performance of operations undertaken
by the Bank Group. The Boards of Governors also approve
major policies and adopt resolutions on other key decisions
and conclusions of the Annual Meetings. The Governors
execute their mandate with the support of the following
five subsidiary organs: (i) the Bureau; (ii) the Joint Steering
Committee; (iii) the Steering Committee on the Election of
the President of the Bank; (iv) the Standing Committee on
the Conditions of Service of Elected Officers; and (v) the
Governors’ Consultative Committee.

The 50th Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the
African Development Bank and the 41st Annual Meeting of
the African Development Fund were held in Abidjan, Céte
d'Ivoire, from 25 to 29 May 2015. A number of events and
activities were organized during this period, under the theme
“Africa and the New Global Landscape”. They included
the Governors’ Dialogue and two high-level events on the

92

sub-themes of “Climate Change: The Last Mile to Paris”, and
“Financing Africa’s Transformation: From Billions to Trillions”.
The Annual Meetings were held in conjunction with the African
Development Bank’s marking of its 50th Anniversary.

The Governors’ Dialogue presented an opportunity for the
Governors to discuss with Bank Group Management the
Bank’s experience in implementing the Ten-Year Strategy
(TYS), the return to the Headquarters in Abidjan, and other
major developments on the continent. The Governors noted
with satisfaction that the African Development Bank Group
had exceeded its lending targets for 2014, in spite of the
challenges associated with the return to Headquarters. This
was a clear demonstration of the Institution’s resilience. They
commended the Boards of Directors, Management, and
staff for this accomplishment. They also applauded the Bank
Group’s quick response to the Ebola crisis in parts of Western
Africa, in particular the rapid mobilization of emergency funding
to support treatment and stop the spread of the disease. The
Governors acknowledged the joint efforts of the international
community in the region. They also underlined the importance
of continuing coordinated support to contain the disease. They
stressed the importance of mitigating its direct and long-term
economic impacts, and of strengthening health systems
and building capacity for interventions in case of future or
similar outbreaks. The Governors recommended a continued
focus on poverty reduction, inclusive, and sustainable growth,
internal and external human capital development, increased
cooperation with regional Development Finance Institutions
(DFI), and support for the commercialization of the agriculture
sector. The Governors noted that a continued emphasis on
the infrastructure sector by the Bank Group, especially energy,
would help address the crippling energy crises in several
African countries.Further, in line with the Financing for Development agenda,
the Governors called for increased innovation to crowd in
private finance, as well as greater support for efforts aimed
at improving domestic resource mobilization and curbing illicit
financial flows. They urged the AfDB to continue investing in
programs and projects that promote climate resilience and lowcarbon development in Africa, and to channel climate-change
financing resources to the RMCs. In this regard, the Governors
commended the AfDB for supporting the active participation
of African negotiators and other stakeholders in the design of
the New Climate Change Agreement adopted for COP21. The
Governors expressed strong support for AfDB’s participation in
the proposed innovative sovereign exposure exchange among
selected Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), and urged
a speedy conclusion of the transaction. Agreements on the
implementation of the exposure exchange were concluded in
December 2015 and signed by all the MDBs involved.

n exercising their statutory duties, the Boards of Governors
adopted resolutions pertaining to the following: (i) Updated
Revised Procedure for the Designation of the Members of
he Bureau and the Joint Steering Committee of the Board of
Governors; (ii) By-Election of Executive Directors of the African
Development Bank; (iii) Updated Rules for the Designation
of Members of the Standing Committee of the Boards of
Governors on the Conditions of Service of Elected Officers;
iv) The Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for
the Financial Year ended 31 December 2014; (v) Allocation and
Distribution of Allocable Income of the African Development
Bank for the Financial Year-Ended 31 December 2014;
(vi) Distribution of Part of the Income of the Nigeria Trust Fund
for the Financial Year-Ended 31 December 2014; (vii) Annual
Report and Audited Special Purpose Financial Statements for
the Financial Year-Ended 31 December 2014; (viii) Election of
the President of the African Development Bank; and (ix) Vote
of Thanks to the outgoing Bank Group President, Dr. Donald
aberuka, for his eminent services to the Bank Group.

 

The Governors paid glowing tribute to Dr. Kaberuka for his
inspiring and visionary leadership in successfully overseeing
the major redirection of the Bank Group’s strategy over his
ten-year tenure. In particular, the Governors commended the
various accomplishments in the intervening period, including:
(i) the successful mobilization of USD 25 billion in the preceding
three replenishments of resources of the African Development
Fund and the historical tripling of the Bank’s Capital Stock;
(ii) the establishment of the Africa Growing Together Fund and
Africa50 initiatives; (iii) the scaling up of the Bank’s private

Chapter 5

sector operations from USD 200 million to USD 2 billion per
annum; (iv) the renewed focus on the economic integration of
the continent’s physical infrastructure; (v) the enhancement of
the Bank Group's role in helping countries in fragile situations
achieve political stability and, additionally, sustained and
inclusive economic development; (vi) the maintenance of
the Bank's “triple A” rating, despite the global financial crisis;
(vil) the maintenance of a strong field presence by operating
in 38 countries, where 50 percent of the AfDB’s portfolio was
managed; and (viii) the promotion of inclusion, notably through
the appointment of a Special Envoy on Gender to champion
the Bank’s agenda on gender equality within the Institution
and through the mainstreaming of gender in its projects and
programs in the RMCs.

5.1.2 Election of a New Bank Group President
The highlight of the 2015 Annual Meetings was the election
of Dr. Akinwumi Ayodeji Adesina by the Board of Governors
as the eighth President of the Bank Group.

Dr. Adesina, a Nigerian national, assumed office on
1 September 2015 after taking the oath of office administered
by the AfDB Governor and Minister of Finance for Zambia, the
Hon. Alexander Chikwanda, in his capacity as Chairperson
of the Board of Governors.

n his inaugural speech, the new Bank Group President
presented his five-point vision, the High 5s, to drive the
implementation of the Bank’s TYS: Light Up and Power Africa,
Feed Africa, Integrate Africa, Industrialize Africa, and Improve
he Quality of Life for the People of Africa.

 

5.1.3. The Bank’s 50th Anniversary Celebrations
Under the patronage of His Excellency Alassane Dramane
Quattara, President of Céte d’lvoire, the Bank’s host country,
two major events were held on the sidelines of the 2015
Annual Meetings to mark its 50th anniversary. These meetings
deliberated on the topics “A Single Market for Africa in our
Lifetime” and “Our Bank at 50”.

The Governors commended the Bank’s founders for their
foresight, and the past and present Boards of Directors and
staff for their immense contributions to the growth and maturity
of the Institution. They acknowledged the Bank Group’s status as
Africa’s premier development financial institution. They expressed
confidence in the Bank Group's ability to maintain its leading role
in addressing Africa’s developmental issues in the post-2015
era, its transformative agenda and growing financing activities.

93Chapter 5

5.2 Roles of the Boards of Directors
and Highlights of their Major Activities

The day-to-day decision-making organs of the Bank Group
are the resident Boards of Directors of the Bank and the Fund,
which act on delegated authority from the respective Boards
of Governors. This section provides an overview of the roles
and highlights of the major activities undertaken in 2015.

5.2.1 Working Modalities and Supporting
Committees of the Boards of Directors

In 2015, the work of the Boards of Directors was supported by
seven standing committees: (i) the Committee on Administrative
Affairs and Human Resource Policy Issues (CAHR); (ii) the
Audit and Finance Committee (AUF); (iii) the Committee on
Operations and Development Effectiveness (CODE); (iv) the
Committee on Administrative Matters Concerning the Board
of Directors (AMBD); (v) the Committee of the Whole on the
Budget (CWHOLE); (vi) the Committee for the Enforcement of
the Code of Conduct for Executive Directors (Ethics Committee);
and (vii) the Committee for the Preparation of the Bank Group
Annual Report (ANRE). In addition, the Ad Hoc Working Group
on the Return to the Headquarters continued to operate.

5.2.2 Work Program of the Boards of Directors
The year 2015 was a particularly busy and productive period
for the Boards of Directors. Executive Directors participated
in 152 formal and informal meetings, seminars, and briefings.
They approved a total of UA 6.28 billion in loans, grants, equity
investments, guarantees, technical assistance, and Special
Funds. Total Bank Group approvals, including other Special
Funds, and technical assistance that are approved by Senior
Management, amounted to UA 6.33 billion. To support and
strengthen their strategic responsibilities, the Boards took
other actions which fall under the following broad categories:
(i) enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the Boards;
(ii) ensuring business continuity and response to urgent and
unexpected events; (ii) overseeing the budget and institutional
reforms and effectiveness; (iv) approving strategies and policies
to enhance operations; (v) assuring the developmental thrust
of country strategy papers; (vi) overseeing the implementation
of the TYS; (vii) undertaking Board field engagements; and
(viii) supporting the Boards of Governors.

5.2.3 Enhancing the Effectiveness and

Efficiency of the Boards

In 2015, the Boards approved the reforms presented below relating to anumber of its instruments, procedures and processes.

94

Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities of the Boards

Revisions to the terms of reference (TORs) of the
Standing Committees of the Board. The Board approved
comprehensive revisions to the TORs of its Standing
Committees to: (i) better align the committees to the structure
and operations of the Bank, which had significantly evolved
and expanded since the TORs were last reviewed in 1992;
(ii) clarify the role of the committees as purely advisory organs
whose conclusions and recommendations were ultimately to be
submitted to the Board for decision-making, where necessary;
and (iii) streamline the modus operandi of each committee.

Streamlining of procedures and processes for operations
approval. Following extensive deliberations, the Boards adopted
reforms to simplify the processes and procedures for approval
of Bank Group operations by the Boards of Directors (see Box
5.1 below). A review would be conducted by Management after
12 months to take stock of the lessons learned and, if necessary,
effect improvements. The reforms became necessary in order
to: (i) better manage the significant increase in the work program
of the Boards; (ii) strengthen rigor in the review processes;
(iii) increase efficiency by ensuring that more of the Boards’
meeting time is devoted to consideration of strategic issues of
policy, planning, monitoring and results; and (iv) harmonize Bank
practices and procedures with those of other MDBs.

5.2.4 Business Continuity and

Response to Unexpected Events

Return to Headquarters. Through its Working Group on the
Return to Headquarters, the Board continued to oversee the
implementation of the roadmap for the effective return of the
Bank's operations to its statutory Headquarters in Abidjan,
Céte d’lvoire. The Board provided guidance on measures
to safeguard the interests of staff and sustain morale. It also
provided guidance on the adoption of realistic yet robust
schedules, for the timely delivery of renovation works to
avoid cost overruns. Furthermore, the Board oversaw the
preparation and submission of a report on the implementation
of the roadmap for the return to Headquarters as at April
2015. The final report will be submitted to Governors in 2016.

Sustaining the Bank’s Response to the Impact of the Ebola
Outbreak. In 2015, the Boards supported the Bank Group’s
efforts and its development partners in dealing with the effects
of the Ebola crisis in some parts of Western Africa. The Boards
approved several programs, including budget support and
emergency and technical assistance to strengthen the health
systems of the affected countries, particularly Guinea, Liberia,
Sierra Leone and the neighboring countries.Box 5.1
Provisions for Further Simplification of the
Board Approval Process

A. Revised Lapse-of-Time Basis (LOTB) approval is based
on the size of operations. This procedure is applicable
to operations below or equal to a threshold amount of
UA 30 million, including Multinational Operations and
Private Sector Operations. With respect to Policy-Based
Operations, the threshold amount is UA 10 million.

B. Approvals Based on Pre-Determined Criteria (PDC)
other than size. This procedure takes into consideration
pre-determined criteria, specifically risk, complexity, and
innovativeness, instead of the size of operations. In this
case, non-risky, simple, or non-innovative operations,
though submitted for consideration at a Board meeting,
will not be discussed, regardless of the size.

C. Approval through Agenda Setting. The agenda of Board
meetings will be used to complement the LOTB and
PDC approval processes. In this case, items will be
listed on the agenda as follows:

i) for consideration and discussion;

ii) for consideration but not for discussion
(PDC operations);

ili) for information.

5.2.5 Budget, Institutional Reforms

and Effectiveness

Budget Framework 2016-2018 and Three-Year Rolling
Work Program. The Board considered the Budget Framework
2016-2018, together with a Three-Year Rolling Work Program,
and approved the administrative budget for 2016. However,
the Board felt that it was incumbent upon Management
to maintain the financial sustainability of Bank Group
operations, especially through the rationalization of costs
and the growth of the revenue base. The Board called for
an expeditious finalization and implementation of the Bank
Group’s new business-delivery model under preparation, and
the improvement of services and work processes. It also
emphasized the need to: (i) improve institutional effectiveness,
including strengthening the field offices for greater delivery
on the ground; (ii) focus on States in fragile situations; and
(iii) pay attention to staff welfare.

Chapter 5

Second Review of the Independent Review Mechanism
(IRM). The Board considered the second review and accepted
the recommendations for the improvement of the IRM. These
include: (i) the need for Board oversight, for which CODE
was designated as the appropriate committee; and (ii) the
expansion of the mandate of the Compliance Review and
Mediation Unit (CRMU) and the IRM to include the provision
of advisory services to the Bank Group.

Mid-Term Review of ADF-13. The Board oversaw the
Independent Development Evaluation unit (IDEV)'s comprehensive
evaluation of the extent to which the Bank Group had met its
commitments under GCI VI, ADF-12 and ADF-13. The results
provided the basis for the ADF-13 Mid-Term Review meeting
held in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, from 11 to 18 November 2015.
ADF Deputies were satisfied with the progress made towards
meeting the commitments under ADF-13. They supported the
Bank's heightened focus on the High 5s. The Deputies agreed
that consultations on the fourteenth replenishment of ADF
(ADF-14) could commence in March 2016.

 

Africa50. The AfDB established Africa50 as an investment
platform for the promotion and financing of infrastructure
projects mainly on energy, transport, water and sanitation,
and information technology. It was designed to be a profitable
investment that pays dividends to its shareholders. Africa50
was incorporated at the Constitutive General Meeting on
29 July 2015 in Casablanca, Morocco, by 20 African countries
and the AfDB. A key decision taken at that meeting was the
appointment of members of the Boards of Directors of the
Project Finance and Project Development vehicles of Africa50.

 

As at end-December, 2015, the subscribed capital of Africa50
from 21 African countries and the AfDB had reached USD 860
million, including USD 100 million from the AfDB. Arrangements
were being finalized for the mobilization of about USD 1 billion
additional subscriptions from international financial organizations,
pension funds, insurance and reinsurance companies, as well
as sovereign wealth funds. In 2015, when it became operational,
Africa50 entered its active staff recruitment phase, including the
recruitment of a Chief Executive Officer and senior staff. The
exercise was to be concluded in early 2016. The project pipeline
preparation began in 2015, as did the fundraising in member
countries. Additional preparations included plans to raise funds
from African Central Banks. Discussions were started with the
regional Central Banks, namely, Banque Centrale des Etats de
Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO), Banque des Etats de I’Afrique
Centrale (BEAC), and Bank Al Maghreb of Morocco.

95Chapter 5

The development prospects of the organization are
promising. Africa50 has established strategic partnerships
with project developers in the conventional and renewable
energy sector, as well as the transport sector, which gives
it strategic relationships in the development of high impact
projects. In addition, Africa50 has established partnerships
with other international financial institutions such as the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank,
Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD), and the ChinaAfrica Development (CAD) Fund. Through its shareholding
and strategic position, Africa50 is ideally placed to play an
important role in infrastructure development financing in Africa.

5.2.6 Strategies and Policies to

Enhance Operations

Bank Group Knowledge Management Strategy, 2015-2020.
As noted in Chapter 4, the Board approved this Strategy in 2015.
Board Members expressed satisfaction with the selective nature
of the Strategy, the particular emphasis on the Bank Group’s
comparative advantages and the framework for assessment of
results. They also stressed the need for a centralized IT platform
to ensure information sharing, both internally and externally.

African Natural Resources Center (ANRC) Strategy, 20152020. In approving this strategy, described in greater detail
in Chapter 4, Board Members stressed the importance of
endowing the ANRC with the requisite financial and human
resources to make it a Center of Excellence and the first port of
call for policy advice on issues relating to the natural resources
sector. The Board further suggested the importance of rigorous
monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy’s implementation
by Management.

Strategic Framework and Operational Guidelines for the
Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF). In 2015,
the Board also approved the PSF, an innovative facility, designed
to facilitate private sector development in Africa. The facility is
a timely and welcome initiative intended for maximum impact,
and the Board therefore recommended speedy implementation.

Procurement Policy and Methodology for Bank Group
Funded Operations. The Board approved this framework
document and particularly hailed the introduction of the “valuefor-money” concept. The Board encouraged the Bank to use
borrower procurement systems where these processes are
deemed sufficiently robust. It also called for urgent measures
to finalize the implementation of the Operations Procurement
Manual and other auxiliary tool-kits.

96

Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities of the Boards

Programs in Support of Implementation of the Governance
Strategic Framework and Action Plan (GAP Il), 20142018. In 2015, the Board approved several programs to
further the objectives of this strategy, intended to strengthen
governance and accountability on the continent. These include
the Investment Climate and Forest Governance Support
Project (PACIGOF) which aims to strengthen the capacity of
private sector support institutions, promote private initiatives
and improve forestry sector governance in Congo. The Board
called for close collaboration with the authorities in the country
in the implementation of this project in order to eliminate illicit
practices and corruption in the forestry sector. The Board also
welcomed the Emergency Economic and Financial Reform
Support Programme (PUAREF), which seeks to contribute to
the creation of a favorable environment for the safe and efficient
management of the budget in Guinea-Bissau. Executive
Directors identified country leadership as a key to the success
of the operation. The Power Sector Reform Governance
Support Program (PSRGSP) for Tanzania was also approved.
The PSRGSP underscores the importance the Bank places
on reforms to improve public finance management and
strengthening of institutional frameworks. In welcoming this
operation, the Executive Directors stressed the importance of
better management of parastatals and public utility agencies
to foster economic development, efficiency and social equity.

Programs to Support Implementation of the Financial
Sector Development Policy and Strategy, 2014-2019.
The Board approved several programs that align with the
objectives of this Policy and Strategy, especially those that
foster financial inclusion by increasing access to financial
services, deepening and expanding the African financial
markets, and preserving the stability of the African financial
system. The most notable program was an equity investment
in Alitheia Identity Fund, based in Mauritius. The Fund aims to
raise USD 100 million for equity investments in high-growth
established small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
targeting those led and/or managed by women in ten African
countries (Botswana, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia,
Nigeria, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe).
The Fund will contribute to inclusive growth on the continent
by promoting women’s access to risk capital and enhancing
the capacity of women fund managers in Africa.

5.2.1 Developmental Thrust of

Country Strategy Papers

Country Strategy Papers (CSPs). In 2015, the Board
approved several CSPs and emphasized the importanceof the alignment of CSPs with the Ten-Year Strategy. The
Board also asked for CSPs to be tailored to each country’s
specific circumstances, to be focused on regional integration
where necessary, to emphasize strong policy dialogue, and
to address economic diversification and inclusion. The Board
recommended that CSPs need to be underpinned by strong
fragility analyses. For instance, in considering the CSP for
Guinea-Bissau (2015-2019), the Board called for better donor
coordination and close monitoring of Bank interventions.
Regarding the 2015-2020 Joint CSP and Country Portfolio
Performance Review (CPPR) for Cameroon, the Board
stressed the need for greater attention to green growth as well
as policy dialogue to elicit greater government commitment
towards debt sustainability. In the case of the CSP (20152019) for Botswana, the Board underlined the importance of
Bank support for the country’s efforts to diversify its economy
from dependence on diamond mining to the promotion of
infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships, regulatory
reforms, capacity building, and the use of renewable energy.

5.2.8 Implementing Aspects of the

Ten-Year Strategy

Enhancing Development Impacts in Private sector Interventions. The Boards continued their support for the Bank
Group’s operations aimed at fostering the growth of the private
sector, particularly the SMEs. To get a better perspective on
the role of the private sector, they called for the determination
of the development impact of projects supported by lines
of credit. In line with this, the Boards approved a number of
lines of credit for disbursement to financial intermediaries and
on-lending to SMEs. Since SMEs are seen as Africa’s engine
of growth and job creation, the Boards emphasized the need
to study the impact of these interventions on job creation,
economic transformation and the potential risks to market
distortion. Accordingly, the Boards called on Management
to include such indicators in future proposals.

Renewed Focus on Agriculture and Food Security. In 2015,
the Boards approved a number of projects in support of AfDB’s
endeavor to place agricultural development and food security
at the top of its transformative agenda, including the following:
(i) the Sao Tomé & Principe Infrastructure Rehabilitation for
Food Security Support Project (PRIASA II), which aimed
to modernize production systems, improve processing
and storage conditions as well as value chains, and create
employment for women and youth; (ii) the Green Morocco Plan
Support Programme (PAPMV-2), which was designed to foster
economic diversification, improve livelihoods and sustainable

Chapter 5

natural resource management in the country; (iii) the Drought
Resilience and Sustainable Livelihoods Program in the Horn
of Africa (DRSLP Ill), which is intended to strengthen the
resilience of communities to drought and climate change,
improve the means of subsistence and promote regional
integration in the region; and (iv) the BAGRE Growth Pole
Support Project (PAPCB), which will support Burkina Faso’s
growth strategy, in particular the development of value chains
as part of the vision to modernize agriculture, economic
growth, and food security.

Enhancing Skills Development, Entrepreneurship,
Employability and Inclusion. In furtherance of the Bank
Group’s Human Capital Strategy (2014-2018), the Boards
approved several programs targeting capacity building
for skills development, entrepreneurship and employment.
These include the second phase of a program for Support to
Technical Vocational Education and Training for Relevant Skills
Development (TVET) for Kenya. The TVET aims to increase
access and equity, improve the quality and relevance of
technical vocational education and training, and equip young
people with the relevant skills to compete in the labor market.
The Boards commended the continuity demonstrated by
this project, but stressed the need for a thorough evaluation
of the first phase and the application of lessons learned
to similar projects in other countries. They also underlined
the importance of financial sustainability to ensure that the
program continued long after the Bank’s exit. Similarly, the
Boards welcomed the Support to Skills Development for
Employability and Entrepreneurship in Eritrea. The objective
of this project is to assist the Eritrean Government to fulfill
its commitment to improving equitable access to quality
and relevant technical education and vocational training in
the country.

The Boards also welcomed the Building Capacity for Inclusive
Service Delivery project in Sudan. This project aims to build
capacity and develop human capital to improve employability
and extend access and coverage of safety nets and health
services to the poor, particularly women and the youth. The
Boards affirmed the Bank Group’s continued engagement
in Sudan despite the difficult operating environment. They
emphasized the need for the evaluation of project risks and
the Bank Group’s capacity to manage them.

5.2.9 Field Missions
Boards’ Consultative Missions. Within the framework of
annual consultations, members of the Boards undertook

97Chapter 5

Oversight Functions and Strategic Responsibilities of the Boards

 

missions to Congo, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The country
selection for these visits was informed by the theme chosen by
the Boards for the missions: “Natural Resources Management
and Governance, Finance Sector Management, and Private
Sector Development”.

The visits were undertaken to assess the progress of Bank Group
financed projects and to engage governments, development
partners, the business community, and civil society actors on
the relevance and effectiveness of the Bank’s strategy and
presence, and the ways that the Bank could help the three

countries meet their economic and developmental challenges.

98

Recommendations made following the missions included:
(i) developing skills for more-effective policy dialogue with
governments and civil society; (ii) strengthening coordination
with other development partners; (iii) supporting the creation of
strong national institutions; (iv) building capacity in economic
governance; (v) developing the infrastructure necessary for
social, spatial and economic inclusion; (vi) exploring ways
to expedite country ratification processes for Bank Group
projects, and ways for supporting other governments to meet
their obligations on counterpart-funding in a timely fashion; and
(vil) reforming the Bank’s procurement and other processes
to address the slow implementation of projects.Part Ill~~  S@eeeeee io §..

African Development FundAFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

 

Management's Report Regarding the Effectiveness of
Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting Date: 30 March 2016

The Management of the African Development Bank Group is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall integrity of the
published financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust Fund (The Bank
Group). The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, while those of the African
Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

The financial statements have been audited by the independent audit firm KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all financial records
and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Boards. Management believes that
all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ reports accompany
he audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity with
he basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies
identified. Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by Management and internal audit and
are revised as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance
with respect to financial statements’ preparation and presentation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change
over time.

The Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other
hings, in their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group’s accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of
internal controls. AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection
of external auditors and makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in turn makes a recommendation for
he approval of the Board of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with Management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or
auditing significance. The external auditors and the internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls
over financial reporting and any other matter that may require AUFI's attention.

The Bank’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on criteria established in “Internal Control - Integrated
Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the results of
his assessment, Management asserts that the Bank Group maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained
in the financial statements as of 31 December 2015. Management is not aware of any material control weakness that could affect the
reliability of the 2015 financial statements.

 

 

IN addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2015, the external auditors of the Bank Group
conducted an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the Bank Group's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December
2015 and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Group regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

Year ended 31 December 2015

Scope

We have examined the internal control over financial reporting of the African Development Bank (ADB), the African
Development Fund (ADF) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (together the “Bank Group”) as of 31 December 2015,
based on criteria established in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”(2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the Bank Group is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control. Management has asserted the
effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of 31 December 2015.

Independent Auditor’s responsibilities
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on
our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000,
issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and
perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal
control was maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control,

105African Development Bank Group

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting

based on the assessed risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

An entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes,
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. An entity’s system of internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the entity’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of 31 December 2015, based on criteria established in “Internal Control —- Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the
Nigeria Trust Fund as of and for the year ended 31 December 2015, in accordance with the International Standards
on Auditing, and we have expressed unqualified opinions on those financial statements.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Capital Subscription

The capital stock of the Bank is composed of paid-up and
callable capital. The paid-up capital is the amount of capital
payable over a period determined by the Board of Governors’
resolution approving the relevant General Capital Increase.
The Bank’s callable capital is subject to payment as and when
required by the Bank to meet its obligations on borrowing
of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or
guarantees chargeable to such resources. This acts as
protection for holders of bonds and guarantees issued by
the Bank in the unlikely event that it is not able to meet its
financial obligations. There has never been a call on the callable
capital of the Bank. A member country’s payment of the first
installment triggers the issuance of the shares corresponding
to the entire callable capital portion, and shares representing
the paid-up portion of subscriptions are issued only as and
when the Bank receives the actual payments for such shares.

Following the Board of Governors’ approval of a 200 percent
increase of the Bank’s capital base in 2010, the authorized
capital of the African Development Bank was increased to
UA 67.69 billion with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares
with a par value of UA 10,000 each. Six percent of the shares
created under this Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), (UA
2.62 billion), are paid-up, while 94 percent (UA 41.12 billion)
are callable. In accordance with the resolution governing this
capital increase, the GCI-VI shares were allocated to regional
and non-regional members in such proportions that, when fully
subscribed, the regional group holds 60 percent of the total
capital stock and the non-regional group 40 percent.

The paid-up portion of the GCI-VI subscription is payable in eight
equal annual installments for non-regional member as well as

Table 6.1
Bank Authorized and Subscribed Capital, 2011-2015
(UA millions)

Chapter 6

regional member countries eligible to borrow from ADB, and
twelve equal annual installments for Regional Member Countries
eligible to borrow only from ADF. Some member countries have
elected to pay their subscription in fewer installments, opting
for an advance payment scheme, and will receive a discount
on their GCI-VI subscription payment accordingly.

Prior to the GCI-VI and by resolution B/BG/2008/07 and B/
BG/2009/05, the Board of Governors authorized two special
capital increases to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank. On
29 October 2013, the Republic of Turkey was formally admitted
as the 78th member country of the Bank (the 25th Non-Regional
Member Country) after completing the formalities specified
in the Agreement establishing the Bank and in the General
Rules Governing the admission of Non-Regional Countries to
membership of the Bank. On 29 May 2014, the Grand Duchy
of Luxembourg became the 79th member country of the
Bank — the 26th Non-Regional Member Country.

On 31 May 2012, by its Resolution B/BG/012/04, the Board
of Governors approved a special capital increase to permit
the membership of South Sudan. In April 2015, South Sudan
completed its membership process and became the 80th
member country of the Bank and the 54th Regional Member
Country.

As at 31 December 2015, the paid-up capital of the Bank
amounted to UA 4.99 billion, with a paid-in capital (i.e. the
portion of paid-up capital that has been actually paid) level of
VA 3.73 billion, compared with UA 4.96 billion and UA 3.44
billion of paid-up and paid-in capital, respectively, at the end
of 2014. The Bank’s callable capital at 31 December 2015
stood at UA 60.60 billion including UA 21.65 billion from nonborrowing member countries rated A- and higher, compared
with UA 60.27 billion and UA 21.57 billion, respectively, as
at the end of the previous year. The evolution of the Bank’s
capital over the past five years is shown in Table 6.1 below.

Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Report.

Bank Rating

The Bank monitors and manages its key financial strength metrics
in a stringent manner and is rated by four major international
rating agencies. The Bank continues to attract high ratings from
all these agencies. For 2015, the rating agencies, Standard &
Poor's, Moody's, Fitch Ratings and the Japan Credit Rating
Agency have once again reaffirmed their AAA and AA+ rating
of the African Development Bank’s senior and subordinated
debts respectively, with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects and
confirms the Bank's strong liquidity and capital position, strong
membership support, its preferred creditor status, sound capital
adequacy and prudent financial management and policies.

 

Borrowings

The Bank raises resources from the capital markets mainly
© provide cost-effective resources to finance development
projects and programs in regional member countries. The
op-notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank enables it to
issue securities at attractive interest rates.

The 2015 borrowing program was approved for a maximum of
UA 4,507 million, made up of two components: up to UA 4,302
million to be raised in the capital markets, and an envelope of UA
205 million under the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance (EPSA)
facility. At year-end 2015, a total amount of UA 3,030.5 million
was raised, representing 67.2 percent of the 2015 borrowing
program with a weighted average maturity of 6.1 years.

Targeted efforts were made to canvass new investors, new
currencies and new markets throughout the year. As a
consistent and regular issuer of global benchmark transactions,
he Bank successfully priced two global benchmarks in 2015
ior USD 1 billion each, with a 5 and 2-year maturity, and also
apped its benchmark transaction maturing in October 2018
wice, for a total amount of USD 325 million, taking the new
outstanding of the line to USD 1,325 million. The year also
saw the Bank return to the green bond market with a new

 

108

green bond maturing in December, 2018. It also continued to
build its curve in Australian dollars with a new AUD 300 million
transaction due February 2020 and three long-dated taps of
existing lines for a total value of AUD 75 million.

The Bank has also been active with various private placements,
African currency-linked notes and uridashi transactions into
Japan. Euro Commercial Paper borrowings complete the
range of markets utilized during the year.

As at 31 December 2015, the Bank’s outstanding borrowing
portfolio stood at UA 16.45 billion compared to UA 14.38
billion in 2014.

The 2016 borrowing program was approved for a maximum
amount of up to UA 6,192 million to be raised from debt
markets plus an additional envelope of USD 300 million (UA
214 million equivalent) under the Enhanced Private Sector
Assistance (EPSA) facility.

G

The Bank is committed to supporting climate-smart and low
carbon investments on the continent that produce visible
and sustainable outcomes. It is in this context that the Bank
launched its green bond program in 2013, targeting socially
responsible investors (SRI) across the globe who want to
make a difference with their investments by helping to finance
climate change solutions in Africa.

onds

 

Taking advantage of the global focus on the United Nation’s 21st
Conference on Climate Change (COP21) held in Paris, France
in December 2015, the Bank issued a new USD 500 million
3-year green bond transaction, highlighting its firm commitment
© leveraging climate finance to support African countries in
heir transition towards green growth. This represented the
Bank’s return to the USD green bond market, following two
successful Swedish Krona transactions executed in 2014, and
a USD 500 million 3-year green bond issued in October 2013.
The transaction was oversubscribed and benefited from the
strong interest from 32 different investors, 70 percent of which
integrate environmental considerations in their investment
strategy. Proceeds of the Bank’s green bonds support the
inancing of low carbon and climate resilient projects. The total
amount of ADB green bonds outstanding at the end of 2015
(including past private placement/uridashi issuance) stands at
USD 1,329 million (UA 959 million). Full details of the Bank’s
eligible projects benefiting from green bond proceeds can be

In addition to its green bond program, the Bank is also active
in issuing bonds linked to various social themes. Demand from
Japanese retail investors in 2015 has been focused around the
theme of food security with the Bank successfully printing a
new food security-linked uridashi bond in Australian Dollars and
raising UA 56 million in the process. The Bank has also issued
an infrastructure-themed note to institutional investors in Japan
for UA 14 million. The proceeds of these themed bonds are
included in the ordinary capital resources of the Bank and under
the terms of the bonds, an amount equal to the net proceeds of
the sales are directed on a ‘best-efforts’ basis towards lending
to projects related to the relevant theme, subject to and in
accordance with the Bank’s lending standards and guidelines.

Table 6.2 above provides a snapshot of the Bank’s activity in
the sectors financed.

The ADB offers an attractive and diversified menu of financial
product options that allows borrowers to tailor their financing
requirements to their circumstances. The Bank’s financial
products comprise loans (including those denominated in
local currency, and syndicated loans), lines of credit (including
for trade finance), agency lines, guarantees, equity and
quasi-equity, trade finance, and risk management products.
In addition to the aforementioned financial products, the Bank
provides technical assistance to its clients through grant funds.
Each of these products is briefly discussed below.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on non-concessional terms.
The Bank's standard loans are categorized either as SovereignGuaranteed Loans (SGLs) or Non-Sovereign Guaranteed Loans
(NSGLs). SGLs are loans made to regional member countries
(RMCs) or public sector enterprises from the RMCs supported

by the full faith and credit of the RMC in whose territory the
borrower is domiciled. Multinational institutions are eligible for
SGLs if they are guaranteed by an RMC or by the RMCs in
whose territory or territories the projects will be executed.

NSGLs are loans made either to public sector enterprises,
without the requirement of a sovereign guarantee or to private
sector enterprises.

The Bank's standard loan product has evolved over time, with
erms that are increasingly more responsive to client needs.
The current standard loan product offered to sovereign and
sovereign-guaranteed clients is the Enhanced Variable Spread
Loan (EVSL) which gives borrowers some degree of flexibility to
manage their interest rate risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed
clients the loan product offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises a floating base rate
6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for Euro
and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that is a function
of the Bank’s cost of funding relative to LIBOR, EURIBOR or
JIBAR, computed every six months, and a contractual spread,
hat was set at 60 basis points (ops) with effect from 1 January
2011. At a borrower's request, the EVSL offers a free option to
convert the floating base rate into a fixed base rate (amortizing
interest rate swap rate set at borrower's request for disbursed
and outstanding loan balances). The repayment period for
sovereign and sovereign guaranteed loans is up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

 

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
(6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR for
Euro and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR) which remains floating
until maturity date or a fixed base rate plus a risk-based
credit spread. NSGLs have a repayment period of 15 years
including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

109Chapter 6 African Development Bank

In December 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved
the introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) product to
the suite of products available to sovereign and sovereignguaranteed borrowers. The FFL embeds risk management
features currently offered through the Bank's risk management
products in SGLs, thereby providing full customization flexibility
in interest rate and currency conversion to borrowers. With this
product, FFL borrowers will be able to, at any time after loan
signature, (i) convert the lending currency for disbursed and/
or undisbursed loan balances into another Bank-approved
lending currency, (ii) convert the base interest rate (fix, unfix
and re-fix the base rate) for disbursed and outstanding loan
balances and, (iii) establish interest rate caps or collars for
disbursed and outstanding loan balances. It also introduces a
maturity-based pricing structure due to the lengthening of the
maximum tenor, grace period and average loan maturity (i.e.,
the weighted average time to repay a loan which considers,
both, repayment dates and amounts in order to provide a
better estimation of how quickly a loan is repaid) of SGLs from
the current 20 years (tenor), 5 years (grace period) and 12.75
years (average maturity) to 25 years, 8 years and 17 years,
respectively to allow borrowers to select loan profiles that
match their funding needs and debt management capacities.

The lending rate of the FFL product is consistent with that of
the EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity-based pricing, loans with maturity less than or equal
to 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium. However,
loans with average loan maturity greater than 12.75 years but
less than or equal to 15 years will attract a 10 bps maturity
premium, while loans with an average maturity greater than
15 years will attract a 20 bps maturity premium.

Since the approval of the FFL, the Bank has conducted
extensive testing to ensure that the loan administration systems
are properly equipped to handle all the new, innovative features
of the loan product. The FFL will thus fully replace the EVSL
and be available as the Bank’s only standard loan product
offered to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers in
respect of all loans signed on or after 3 March 2016.

Other loan structures offered by the Bank include parallel
and A/B loan syndications, and local currency loans. The
Bank can provide local currency loans in the following RMC
currencies: Egyptian pounds, Franc CFA (XOF and XAF),
Ghanaian cedis, Kenyan shillings, Nigerian naira, Tanzanian
shillings, Ugandan shillings and Zambian kwacha. Lending
in these currencies is only offered if the Bank is able to fund

110

efficiently in the relevant local currency market. These local
currency loans are offered under the FSL pricing framework
with a cost-pass-through principle for the loans to ensure
that the overall cost of funds is fully covered.

 

    

fF ¢
The development of a dynamic small and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs) sector in the continent is an important
objective of the Bank, as is the development of private financial
institutions (PFls). To this end the Bank offers lines of credit for
loans to PFls for on-lending to SMEs. The terms of the lines
of credit specify the conditions under which Bank funds will
be provided to the PFI for on-lending. The credit risks of the
sub-loans are borne by the PFls.

eait

A

y Lines

 

The Bank makes resources available for SMEs under agency
arrangements with local financial intermediaries. The selection
of individual projects for Bank support is largely delegated to
he intermediaries, which draw on Bank resources to make
loan or equity investments for the Bank’s account in projects
meeting pre-agreed criteria. As part of an agency agreement,
inancial intermediaries are required to commit their own funds
in each investment in parallel with the Bank and to supervise
he investee companies. The financial intermediary acts only
in an agency capacity for the Bank when investing the latter’s
unds and assumes no risk in this regard. The credit risk of
he borrower is borne by the Bank.

 

Through the guarantee product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible borrowers to obtain
inancing from third party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees also enable borrowers to obtain financing in their
own local currency where the Bank is not able to provide
such financing directly from its own resources. The Bank’s
guarantees can generally be classified into two categories:
Partial Credit Guarantees (PCGs) and Partial Risk Guarantees
(PRGs). PCGs cover a portion of scheduled repayments of
private loans or bonds against all risks. PRGs cover private
lenders against the risk of a government, or a government
owned agency, failing to perform its obligations vis-a-vis a
private project.

 

 

 

\/ ent P, tS

The Bank currently offers Risk Management Products (RMPs)
to its borrowers only in respect of obligations outstanding to
the Bank or new Bank loans to enable them to hedge theirexposure to market risks including interest rate, currency
exchange and commodity price risks, thus allowing them to
optimize their debt management strategies. RMPs offered
by the Bank include interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
commodity swaps and interest rate caps and collars. These
products are available to borrowers at any time during the
life of the loan.

 

In addition to its participation in ADE the Banik takes equity
positions in qualifying business enterprises in its RMCs as part
of its strategic development financing mandate. The Bank’s
ability to provide risk capital through equity and quasi-equity is
a key element of its resource mobilization role. The use by the
Bank of equity and quasi-equity participation as instruments
of investment has the objectives of promoting the efficient
use of resources, promoting African participation, playing
a Catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders to
financially viable projects as well as promoting new activities and
investment ideas. The Bank may invest in equities either directly
or indirectly, through appropriate funds and other investment
vehicles. Additionally, it may choose to invest via quasi-equity
instruments including redeemable preference shares, preferred
stock, subordinated loans or convertible loans.

In : February 2013, the Board approved a Trade Finance
Program (TFP) of up to USD 1 billion for a four-year initial phase,
to address the shortage of trade finance for Regional Member
Countries (RMCs) and to address the structural gap between
the demand for trade finance and the market supply through
provision of liquidity and risk mitigation solutions to financial
institutions actively involved in trade finance in Africa. One of
the significant institutional developments since the approval
of the TFP was the establishment of the Financial Sector
Development Department (OFSD) in the last quarter of 2014,
and subsequently, the President created a full-fledged Trade
Finance Division within OFSD, charged with the responsibility
of driving the Bank’s engagement in trade finance in Africa in
amore sustained and systematic way.

The TFP provides to eligible clients, funded and unfunded
products including: (a) Risk Participation Agreements (RPAs),
(b) Trade Finance Lines of Credit (TFLOCs), and (c) Soft
Commodity Finance Facilities (SCFFs). In addition to these, the
TFP makes selective use of equity and technical assistance
instruments to enhance the risk-bearing and operational
capacities of local financial institutions (Fls).

Chapter 6

 

Risk Participa ion ent

The Risk Participation Agreement (RPA) is both a funded
and a non-funded trade finance product that enables the
Bank to share risk with a select group of international and
regional confirming banks, who provide documentary credit
confirmation services to African issuing banks, with the objective
of supporting and expanding trade in Africa. Under this product
the Bank shares trade finance credit risk (generally no more
than 50 percent of a trade transaction exposure) on a portfolio
of eligible issuing bank trade transactions of partner confirming
banks. RPAs operate on a portfolio basis and do not require
the Bank to sign direct agreements with the local issuing banks.

    

Tre aaqe
The Trade Finance Line at Credit (TFLOC) is similar to the
conventional line of credit offered by the Bank to local financial
institutions except that the TFLOC will be used to finance exclusively
trade-related transactions in the RMCs. Trade transactions
financed by TFLOC include, among others, pre-shijpment and
post-shipment financing, capital expenditure, letters of credit
discounting, factoring/forfaiting, import and export trade finance.

 

Finance Line

Since most trade transactions have maturities of less than
one year, the intermediary financial institutions are permitted

to utilize the line of credit as a revolving credit facility to trade
finance clients until the final maturity of the TFLOC itself, which
in any case will not exceed 3.5 years. The facility is available
to local banks engaged in trade finance

in Africa.

 

The Soft Commodity Finance Facility (SCFF) is a funded trade
finance product that is used to support mainly the import and
export of agricultural commodities and inputs across the RMCs.
This includes, for instance, the provision of pre-export financing
to commodity aggregators for the purchase and export of soft
commodities. Commodity finance is usually structured and
has credit protection in such forms as pledges of underlying
commodity, assignment of proceeds, letters of credit, and private
or state guarantees. SCFF is provided directly to entities such
as commodity aggregators, which are not necessarily financial
institutions. These entities could include state-owned commodity
boards or agricultural cooperatives that meet the eligibility criteria
for Bank private sector borrowing. Intermediaries such as
commodity traders would not be direct counterparties of the Bank.

 

  

The financial parformanas of the program in 2015 was above
budget in all measures, and demand for trade interventions

111Chapter 6 African Development Bank

from the RMCs remains strong. Going forward, in order
to consolidate the TFP into the Bank’s operations as a
core activity rather than as a program with a sunset clause,
management has proposed the following changes aimed at
increasing both the size and product suite:

a) — Utilise the current TFP limit of USD 1 billion for guarantee
products only. The funded trade finance instruments would
be treated like the Bank’s other lending instruments in
terms of allocation of funds for non-sovereign operations.

b) — Introduce the following new products to meet the ever
evolving clients’ needs: (i) direct guarantees that provide
100 percent risk cover for single transactions; (ii) supply
and value chain financing; and (iii) risk distribution
agreements (RDAs) to create more headroom by
catalysing other sources of financing and increasing
the capacity of the Bank to support more trade.

 

the Clé $
In addition to the products described above, the Bank may
occasionally offer technical assistance through grant funds
to supplement its financial products for both the public and
private sector windows. The Bank's technical assistance is
primarily focused on increasing the development outcomes of
its operations by raising the effectiveness of project preparation
which is vital in ensuring the best developmental and povertyreducing outcomes for projects that receive Bank financing. In
addition, technical assistance may aim to foster and sustain
efforts in creating enabling business environments in order to
promote private sector investment and growth.

 

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The Bank’s development operations are undertaken within a risk
management framework which includes: (i) a clearly defined
risk appetite statement for lending credit risk, (ii) a capital
adequacy and exposure management policy (iii) credit policy;
(iv) risk management governance framework; (v) credit risk
management guidelines; and (vi) an end-to-end credit process.

The Bank seeks to minimize its exposure to risks that are
not essential to its core business of providing development
finance and related assistance. Accordingly, the Bank’s
risk management policies, guidelines and practices are
designed to reduce exposure to interest rate, currency,
liquidity, counterparty, legal and other operational risks, while
maximizing the Bank’s capacity to assume credit risks to
public and private sector clients, within approved risk limits.

112

Over the past few years the Bank has considerably enhanced
its risk management framework and end-to-end credit
processes to ensure that its risk management functions remain
robust. Some of the specific measures taken have included:
(i) creation of the office of Group Chief Risk Officer, reporting
directly to the President of the Bank; (ii) strengthening of the
Credit Risk Committee; (iii) enhancement of the credit risk
assessment skills of Bank staff through training and hiring of
experienced and competent credit officers; (iv) implementation
of robust and optimized credit risk assessment models;
(v) strengthening of the credit risk infrastructure by improving
quality at entry; (vi) continuous efforts to fully implement the
operational risk management framework which was recently
approved by the Board; and (vii) implementation of best-ofbreed solutions in the form of an integrated and workflowdriven software platform that allows all stakeholders involved
in the credit risk assessment process to streamline their work
in order to enhance efficiency. The Bank has, additionally,
strengthened the monitoring of the current portfolio and
continued to proactively undertake portfolio restructuring
measures including cancellation of long-standing “signed
but not disbursed” loans to free up capital for new lending.

The Bank continues to serve all its member countries, including
those under stress. To support such continued engagement,
the Bank maintains capital buffers to provide some flexibility in
continuing its countercyclical financing role, while covering any
potential unexpected losses. Close collaboration with sister
institutions (the World Bank and IMF) has helped to improve the
coordination of current and future interventions in those countries.
Above all, the Bank has continued to explore measures to
increase portfolio diversification, an important step in its efforts
to mitigate concentration risks within its current portfolio. The
Bank also improved its collateral management framework to
ensure that an adequate collateral value is maintained.

During the year, the Bank entered into Exposure Exchange
Agreements (EEAs) with other Multilateral Development Banks
(MDBs) with the objective of managing the risks in its loan
portfolio to optimize its balance sheet, reduce sovereignconcentration risk and increase lending headroom. The EEA
involves a simultaneous exchange of equivalent credit risk on
defined reference portfolios of sovereign exposures, subject
to each participating MDB retaining a minimum of 50 percent
of the total exposure to each country that is part of the EEA.
Under the EEA, the MDB that originates the sovereign loans
and buys protection continues to be the lender of record. An
exposure exchange does not affect the application of thenormal sovereign sanctions policies by the buyer of protection.

The EEA has final maturities in 2030 with linear annual reduction
of the notional amounts starting from 2025. As at 31 December
2015, the total notional amount of credit protection purchased
or sold on the relevant underlying single reference entities is
USD 4.47 billion (UA 3.22 billion). The participating MDBs have
paid no credit protection fee (i.e. guarantee premium) as the
amount of exposure exchanged—purchased and sold—is
notionally the same at inception.

The Bank continues to be well capitalized. The stress testing
of its capital adequacy shows that it can adequately withstand
anumber of extreme shock scenarios. The risks to the Bank’s
balance sheet are actively monitored on a risk dashboard
developed in 2012.

The policies and practices employed by the Bank to manage
these risks are described in detail in Note D to the Financial
Statements.

Financial Reporting

Corporate governance within the Bank is supported by
appropriate financial and management reporting. The
Executive Board of Directors makes strategic decisions and
monitors the Bank’s progress towards achievement of set
goals. While senior management manages the Bank’s dayto-day operations and activities, the Board provides oversight,
advice and counsel on issues as wide-ranging as long-term
strategy, budgets, human resources, benefits management,
and new product development.

Based on the COSO internal control framework, senior
management has put in place a robust and functioning
mechanism to be able to certify the effectiveness of the
Bank’s internal controls over external financial reporting. This
annual certification statement is signed by the President and
Vice President, Finance, as well as the Financial Controller. A
separate attestation is also provided by the Bank’s external
auditors. The Bank has a comprehensive system of reporting
to the Board of Directors and its committees which includes
periodic reporting by the Office of the Auditor General to the
Audit and Finance (AUFI) Committee of the Board of Directors.

External Auditors

The Bank’s external auditors are appointed by the Board of
Governors, on the recommendation of the Board of Directors,
for a five-year term. Under Bank rules, no firm of auditors can
serve for more than two consecutive five-year terms.

Chapter 6

The external audit function is statutory and is regulated by
he International Standards on Auditing (ISA), issued by the
international Federation of Accountants (IFAC) through the
ternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The
external auditors perform an annual audit to enable them to
express an opinion on whether the financial statements of
he Bank present fairly the financial position and the results of
he operations of the Bank. They also examine whether the
statements have been presented in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, as described above,
he external auditors also carry out a comprehensive review
and provide opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal
controls over financial reporting. This attestation is provided by
he external auditors as a report separate from the audit opinion.
At the conclusion of their annual audit, the external auditors
prepare a management letter for Senior Management and the
Board of Directors, which is reviewed in detail and discussed
with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board. The
management letter sets out the external auditors’ observations
and recommendations for improvement on internal controls and
other matters, and it includes management's responses and
actions for implementation of the auditors’ recommendations.

 

The performance and independence of the external auditors is
subject to periodic review by the AUFI Committee of the Board.
There are key provisions in the Bank’s policy regarding the
independence of the external auditors including a requirement
or the mandatory rotation of the Engagement Partner, in cases
where the term of the audit firm is renewed for a second and
inal five-year period. The incumbent external auditors are
prohibited from providing non-audit related services, subject
‘0 certain exceptions if it is judged to be in the interest of the
Bank and if such services do not compromise the external
auditors’ independence. In any case, the provision of such
services requires the specific approval by the Audit and
Finance Committee.

 

Anti

Corruption Regime within the Bank

The Bank has a robust regime for discouraging corruption.
The prohibited practices under the Bank’s anti-corruption
regime include not only bribery but also receiving bribes, fraud,
coercive practices and collusion.

The Bank has three main anti-corruption legal instruments
— its Procurement Rules, the Guidelines for Preventing and
Combating Corruption and Fraud in Bank’s Operations, and
he International Financial Institutions’ Uniform Framework
or Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption. Each

 

113Chapter 6 African Development Bank

of these instruments defines the prohibited practices and
prescribes mechanisms for implementing anti-corruption
measures. The Procurement Rules prohibit the use of Bank
funds to finance corruption and the financing by the Bank
of contracts corruptly procured. The Guidelines prescribe
preventive measures to be taken throughout the lending cycle.
The Uniform Framework also prescribes preventive measures
and investigation procedures.

The Bank’s anti-corruption implementation mechanisms
include the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department which
has an investigative and a preventive role, a Whistleblower
and Complaints Handling mechanism including a hotline
administered by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department,
and protection for whistleblowers.

The Bank has implemented the International Financial
Institutions’ cross-debarment agreement by which it will apply
the sanctions of the other institutions and have its sanctions
applied by these institutions. A key step in this process has
been the appointment of a Sanctions Commissioner, an
Alternate Sanctions Commissioner and the members of the
Sanctions Appeals Board.

Finally, the Bank is collaborating with the OECD in an ongoing
initiative to support business integrity and anti-bribery efforts
in its regional member countries.

  

ormance ent and M

In managing its operations the Bank uses quantified performance
measures and indicators that reflect the critical success factors
in its business. These are monitored on a continuous basis
and results achieved are used to assess progress attained
against stated objectives and to inform required action in
order to improve future performance. Management uses a
wide array of measures both at the corporate and business
unit level to monitor and manage performance. Some of the
key financial measures and indicators used by management
are discussed in Table 6.3, together with their relevance to
the operations of the Bank.

The highlights of the Bank’s financial performance in 2015
include the following:

e Net interest margin (NIM) decreased in 2015 largely due to
a 10.71 percent decline in interest income on investments
from UA 169.87 million in 2014 to UA 151.68 million in
2015. Interest income from loans increased by 2.51 percent
to UA 338.51 million. The treasury portfolio continued to
perform well above its set benchmarks. Overall, net interest
income decreased by 6.06 percent during the year, while
the gross earning assets increased by 6.8 percent.

114e In 2015, the Bank earned income before allocation and
distributions approved by the Board of Governors of UA
93.16 million compared to UA 151.69 million in 2014. This
decrease is primarily due to an increase in impairment on
loans and the impact of the fair valuation of borrowings
and derivatives which are typically volatile. Adjusted for the
effects of the fair valuation of borrowings and derivatives,
income before allocation and distributions amounted to
UA 142.68 million for 2015 compared to UA 181.52 million
in 2014.

e Total Bank Group administrative expenses decreased to
UA 323.3 million in 2015 from UA 372.1 million in 2014,
primarily due to lower expenses related to the Bank’s return
‘0 its Headquarters. Total manpower expenses (excluding
actuarial valuation effects of benefit plans) decreased by
UA 33.07 million (12.58 percent) from UA 262.94 million in
2014 to UA 229.87 million in 2015. The Bank's share of the
otal Bank Group’s administrative expenses amounted to
UA 122 million for 2015 compared to UA 123.16 million in
he previous year. Bank Group administrative expenses are
shared between the Bank, the ADF, and the NTF, based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula driven primarily by
he relative levels of certain operational volume indicators
and relative balance sheet size.

 

e The Bank continues to maintain a strong capital position.
Despite the ongoing challenges in its operating environment,
he Bank continues to generate sufficient levels of income

other development initiatives in Africa. The Bank’s reserves,
plus accumulated loan loss provisions on outstanding loan
principal and charges, stood at UA 3.35 billion at the end
of 2015 compared to UA 3.19 billion at the end of 2014.

 

 

by the Board of Governors

In 2015, the Board of Governors approved distributions from
the 2014 income to various development initiatives in Africa
amounting to UA 124 million. The beneficiaries of these
distributions are listed under Note N to the financial statements.
In accordance with the Bank’s accounting policies, such
distributions are reported as expenses in the year they are
approved by the Board of Governors. The Boards of Directors
have also agreed to recommend to the Board of Governors,
at its Annual Meeting in May 2016, distributions totaling UA 95
million from the 2015 income to various development initiatives
in the RMCs. If approved by the Board of Governors, such

Chapter 6

distributions, and any others that may be approved by the
Board of Governors during 2016, will be reported as expenses
in the 2016 financial statements.

 

A

Co of Administrative Expenses
In order to maximize the resources available for development
financing and technical assistance activities in its member
countries, the Bank has an ongoing responsibility and
commitment to ensure maximum efficiency in the management
of its administrative and capital expenditures. Accordingly, the
Bank continues to focus on a high level of budgetary discipline,
effective cost controls and proactive cost-recovery programs in
the management of its administrative and capital expenses. For
the year ended 31 December 2015, the Bank Group’s general
administrative expenses, excluding the expenses related to the
return of its operations to its Headquarters in Abidjan, charges
for depreciation and amortization, were UA 294.83 million,
compared to UA 321.46 million in 2014. For 2016, the Bank
Group’s administrative expenditure is budgeted at UA 358.49
million. Management will continue to explore and implement
effective and transparent cost management strategies in order
to ensure that cost outcomes are effectively tracked against
the Bank's long-term strategic objectives.

Inves ;
The Bank maintained a robust investment strategy in 2015,
consistent with a frequently changing global financial market
environment which has been characterized by low interest
rates. The Bank continues to adopt a prudent investment
strategy, prioritizing capital preservation and liquidity over
attempting to generate higher income by taking on additional
risks. As such, the Bank continues to target high-quality
liquid assets with short maturities with a focus on secured
investments where possible. As a result, the credit quality
and liquidity profile of the Bank’s investments remains very
strong. Despite the backdrop of higher volatility in the global
financial markets in 2015, the overall impact on returns
remained limited.

The Bank's cash and treasury investments (net of repurchase
agreements) as of 31 December 2015 totaled UA 9.61 billion,
compared to UA 7.35 billion at the end of 2014. Investment
income for 2015 amounted to UA 122.21 million or a return
of 1.36 percent on an average liquidity of UA 8.97 billion,
compared to an income of UA 132.41 million, or a return
of 1.62 percent, on an average liquidity of UA 8.17 billion in
2014. Overall, the portfolios at fair value outperformed their
average benchmarks in the key currencies during the year.

115Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The reduced return in 2015 compared to 2014 was a result
of amore challenging investment environment.

The ADB's liquid assets are tranched into 3 portfolios, namely,
operational portfolio, prudential portfolio, and equity-backed
portfolio, each with a different benchmark that reflects the cash
flow and risk profile of its assets and funding sources. These
benchmarks are 1-month LIBID for the operational portfolio,
and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR, resetting on 1 February
and 1 August for the prudential portfolio. The operational and
prudential portfolios are held for trading. The equity-backed
portfolio, which is held at amortized cost, is managed against
a repricing profile benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank's net
assets repricing uniformly over a period of 10 years.

The Bank makes loans to its regional member countries and
public sector enterprises guaranteed by the government.
Loans are also extended to private sector enterprises without
government guarantee.

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
31 December 2015 amounted to UA 34.47 billion. This is
UA 2.28 billion higher than the balance at 31 December 2014
when the cumulative loans signed stood at UA 32.24 billion.
Table 6.4 presents the evolution of loans approved, disbursed

116of its financial results to changes in these domains. The diligent
monitoring of their impacts on the volume of the Bank’s
lending and the timing of repayment of its loans in 2016 and
beyond, is critical if it is to ensure that it continues to effectively
deliver on its development mandate. The Bank’s Ten-Year
Strategy, approved in 2013, continues to shape the Bank’s
interventions and operations over the planning horizon to
2022. The strategic focus on the five key operational priorities,
including infrastructure development, regional integration,
private sector development, governance and accountability,
and skills and technology provides the Bank with a unifying
framework under the High 5s for the effective delivery of its
operational activities in the coming year and beyond.

As at end 2015, the Bank’s move back to its statutory
headquarters in Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire was virtually complete,
restoring the much-needed stability and the resultant efficiency
in the Bank’s operational environment in the short term. In the
long term, the completion of the move is expected to result in
the stabilization of the level of administrative expenses which
spiked somewhat at the peak of the move, particularly, in
2014 and 2015. A positive consequence of this is that the
achievement of the target cost/income ratio of 30 percent
will be possible in the medium term.

ng Investment Perfor

   

The Bank’s borrowing and investment activities in 2015
were undertaken in a challenging environment of significant
volatility in the global financial markets. The first half of 2015
was dominated by events in Greece as the newly elected
government sought to renegotiate the country’s bailout terms
with its creditors. After months of protracted negotiation,
following the near-collapse of the Greek financial system, and
their exit from the Eurozone becoming a distinct possibility,
the government accepted a further bailout under stringent
terms. Market fears of a Greek default and concerns over
the future of the Eurozone created substantial stress across
financial markets. This led to the widening of credit spreads
of European sovereigns and supranational institutions, the
latter representing the largest creditors to Greece following
its debt restructuring in 2012.

 

In the second half of the year, as concerns over Greece abated,
volatility was triggered by weak economic data in China that
was amplified by expected monetary tightening in the United
States, rapidly declining oil prices, and the high private sector
indebtedness in a number of emerging market economies. In

particular, the perceived fragility of China’s economy had major
implications for the global financial markets, triggering falls in
global equity and commodity markets as well as emerging
market currencies. In response, and in light of persistently low
inflation, global central banks continued to employ extremely
accommodative monetary policies, cutting interest rates
to historically low (and in some cases negative) levels. A
notable exception was the US Federal Reserve, which began
tightening monetary policy, increasing rates in December for
the first time since 2008.

118

The lower interest-rate environment reduced the returns on the
Bank’s treasury investment portfolios. However, in the case
of ADB's liquidity portfolios, the lower investment income was
subsequently offset by reductions in borrowing costs. Given
the volatile global market, the Bank maintained a conservative
investment strategy, prioritizing capital preservation and liquidity.
Accordingly, the Bank targeted high quality liquid assets with shorter
maturities, with a focus on secured investments where possible.
As a result, the credit quality and liquidity profile of the Bank’s
investment remains very strong, whilst volatility of returns is limited.~~  S@eeeeee io §..

127Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2015

Note A — Operations and affiliated organizations

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic
and social progress of its regional member states. The Bank’s headquarters is located in Abidjan, Cdte d’lvoire. The Bank
finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically in cooperation with other national or
international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in the selection, study and
preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance. The Bank
also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic
and social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African
Development Fund (ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund
(NTF), which is a special fund administered by the Bank. The ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets
and liabilities. There is no recourse to the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was
established to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, to
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing
on concessional terms for such purposes.

In accordance with Article 57 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank, its property, other assets, income and
its operations and transactions shall be exempt from all taxation and customs duties. The Bank is also exempt from any
obligation to pay, withhold or collect any tax or duty.

Note B — Summary of significant accounting policies
The Bank's individual financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies applied by the Bank in the preparation of the financial statements are summarized below.
Revenue Recognition

Interest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected
ife of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

 

Dividends are recognized in income statement when the Bank’s right to receive the dividends is established in accordance
with IAS 18 — Revenue.

128Chapter 6

  

ional and Presentation Currencies

The Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised,
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies
of all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective 1 January 2005, as it was concluded that the UA most
faithfully represented the aggregation of economic effects of events, conditions and the underlying transactions of the Bank
conducted in different currencies. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented. The value of
the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Func

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into
UA at 31 December 2015 and 2014 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at
historical rates. Translation differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded
in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is
reported in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the
difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When
currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has
ever withdrawn its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the
membership reflects the fact that the members are African and non-African countries, committed to the purpose of the Bank
to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its Regional Member Countries individually
and jointly. Accordingly, as of 31 December 2015, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to
member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member’s shares.

The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be
a member, hereafter referred to as “the termination date”. The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares
purchased against the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable
for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted
before the termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses
may not have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be
required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares would have been reduced had the
losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former member remains liable
on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been required to
respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares
was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example,
paying a former member would have adverse consequences for the Bank’s financial position, the Bank could defer payment
until the risk had passed, and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may
be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board
of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made until six months after the termination date.

129Chapter 6 African Development Bank

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and
then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such
distribution is subject to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share
of each member country.

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides
benefit payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension
benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as accrual rate, age,
contribution years of service and average remuneration. An actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is
determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average
remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments.
Actuarial gains and losses as well as the differences between expected and real returns on assets are recognized immediately
in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. When benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the
resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit
or loss. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents
the present value of the Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits
to eligible former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement
to the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee contributing to the Plan up to retirement
age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from
plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions
by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in the income statement. The MBP Board, an independent
body created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the
contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members. Actuarial gains and losses as well as the difference between expected
and real return on assets are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. The medical
plan liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value
of the Bank’s post-employment medical benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets.

Further details and analysis of the Bank’s employee benefits are included in Note R - Employee Benefits.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual
rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank manages its financial assets in line with the applicable business model and, accordingly,
classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost; financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss (FVTPL); and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOC)). In line with
the Bank’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the management of net
interest margin or for liquidity management. The Bank’s investments in the equity of enterprises, whether in the private or
public sector is for the promotion of economic development of its member countries and not for trading to realize fair value
changes. Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.

130Chapter 6

 

A financial asset is classified as at ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets two criteria: the objective of the Bank’s
business model is to hold the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any
derivatives embedded in debt investment are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are
solely payment of principal and interest on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include some loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain
debt investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Receivables comprise demand obligations,
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other amounts receivable. Loans and receivables
meeting the two criteria above are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. The
amortization of loan origination fee is included in income from loans.

Loans that have a conversion option that could potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely
payments of principal and interest are measured at FVTPL as required by IFRS 9. The fair value is determined using
the expected cash flows model with inputs including interest rates and the borrower’s credit spread estimated based
on the Bank's internal rating methodology for non-sovereign loans.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets
with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured
at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

       

at Fair \ Value fit ore Loss (F VY ‘TP
Debt instruments that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This
category includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes as well as certain loans for
which either of the criteria for recognition at amortized cost is not met. Gains and losses on these financial assets are
reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets

at fair value through profit or loss.

In addition, debt instruments that meet amortized cost criteria can be designated and measured at FVTPL. A debt
instrument may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces
a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognizing the
gains and losses on them on different bases.

 

through Other sive Income (FVTOCI)
On initial aceuriiien, the Bank can n make an ome seal (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate
investments in equity instruments not held for trading as financial assets measured at FVTOCI.

   

Equity investments are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, they are measured at fair
value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. The cumulative
gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the investments and no impairments are recognized
in the profit or loss. Dividends earned from such investments are recognized in profit and loss unless the dividends
clearly represent a repayment of part of the cost of the investment.

131Chapter 6 African Development Bank

iv) Financial Guarantee Contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder
for an incurred loss because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a
specified debt instrument. The Bank issues such financial guarantees - which are not managed on a fair value basis
- to its clients including banks, financial institutions and other parties. IFRS 9 require written financial guarantees that
are managed on a fair value basis to be designated at fair value through profit or loss. However, financial guarantees
that are not managed on a fair value basis are initially recognized in the financial statements at fair value. Subsequent
to initial recognition, these financial guarantees are measured at the higher of the amount initially recognized less
cumulative amortization, and to the extent a payment under the guarantee has become probable, the present value of
the expected payment. Any change in the liability relating to probable expected payments resulting from guarantees
is recorded in the income statement as an expense or a recovery, in line with IAS 37.

Recognition and Derecognition of Financial Assets

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which
the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial
assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs. Financial
assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Bank
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements, Securities Lent Under Securities Lending Agreements
and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements and Payable for Cash Collateral Received

Securities purchased under resale agreements, securities lent under securities lending agreements, and securities sold under
repurchase agreements are recorded at market rates. The Bank receives securities purchased under resale agreements,
monitors the fair value of the securities and, if necessary, closes out transactions and enters into new repriced transactions.
The securities transferred to counterparties under the repurchase and security lending arrangements and the securities
transferred to the Bank under the resale agreements do not meet the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale. Therefore,
securities transferred under repurchase agreements and security lending arrangements are retained as assets on the Bank
balance sheet, and securities received under resale agreements are not recorded on the Bank’s balance sheet. In cases
where the Bank enters into a “reverse repo” — that is, purchases an asset and simultaneously enters into an agreement
to resell the same at a fixed price on a future date — a receivable from reverse repurchase agreement is recognized in the
statement of financial position and the underlying asset is not recognized in the financial statements.

Cash and Cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that
are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to
maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

2) Financial Liabilities

i) Borrowin gs
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity
management purposes. The Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities
at fixed or variable interest rates. The Bank’s borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in
meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure
to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding.

132Chapter 6

In addition to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity
management purposes only. Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance
sheet at amortized cost with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses
are recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is
determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing activities may create exposure to market risk, most notably
interest rate and currency risks.

The Bank uses derivatives and other risk management approaches to mitigate such risks. Details of the Bank’s risk
management policies and practices are contained in Note D to these financial statements. Certain of the Bank’s
borrowings obtained prior to 1990, from the governments of certain member countries of the Bank, are interest-free
loans. In accordance with the exemption provided in the provisions of IAS 20 — Accounting for Government Grants
and Disclosure of Government Assistance, such borrowings are carried at the amounts at which they are repayable
on their due dates.
ii) Fi ! Liabilities at Fair Value through I ork
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit
or loss at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank applies fair value designation primarily to
borrowings that have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation
of the borrowing at fair value through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce accounting mismatches that
otherwise would have arisen if the borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related
swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

     

In accordance with IFRS 9, fair value changes for financial liabilities that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss,
that is attributable to changes in the Bank’s “own credit” risk is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in fair
value attributable to the Bank’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.

iii) Ot ‘h er Li C
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized
cost. The amounts include certain borrowings, accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

 

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or canceled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and
hedging purposes. These instruments are mainly cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings
are used to modify the interest rate or currency characteristics of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is
established on the date the debt is issued and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component
of these derivatives is reported as part of borrowing expenses.

The Bank classifies all derivatives at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. When the
criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt is also carried at fair value with changes in
fair value recognized in the income statement.

The Bank assesses its hybrid financial assets (i.e. the combined financial asset host and embedded derivative) in its entirety
to determine their classification. A hybrid financial asset is measured at amortized cost if the combined cash flows represent
solely principal and interest on the outstanding principal; otherwise it is measured at fair value. As at 31 December 2015,
the Bank had hybrid financial assets that were measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9.

133Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics were not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract was not carried
at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract
and measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Adjustm

nt (C “VAI

 

and Debit Valu
Valuation adjustment for counterparty risk (CVA/DVA) is recognized on daiivative fRaNCIAl instruments to reflect the impact
on fair value of counterparty credit risk and the Bank’s own credit quality. This adjustment takes into account the existing
compensating agreements for each of the counterparties. The CVA is determined on the basis of the expected positive
exposure of the Bank vis-a-vis the counterparty, the probability of default of the counterparty, recovery rates, and the amount
of loss in case of a default, on a counterparty basis. The DVA is calculated in a symmetric way on the basis of the expected
negative exposure. These calculations are recognized on the life of the potential exposure, and concentrates on the use of
observable and relevant market data.

Derivative Credit Valua

   

Hedge Accounting

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge the interest rate risk exposure
associated with its fixed rate loans. Under fair value hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument
and the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the income statement.

At inception of the hedge, the Bank documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item,
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the
inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Bank documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in
offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Hedge accounting is discontinued when
the Bank’s risk management objective for the hedging relationship has changed, when the hedging instrument expires or is
sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The cumulative fair value adjustment to
the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.

Impairment of Financial Assets

\mort tized C —ost

 

\ssets Carried at
The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group
of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually
assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective
assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if,
and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition
of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial
asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

If the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have
not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the
estimated impairment representing present value losses arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the non-collectability, in
whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

134Chapter 6

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized

in the income statement. If a loan or investment carried at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for
measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are
accrued on all loans including those in arrears. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease,
the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.

  

Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a current legally enforceable right to
off-set the recognized amount. A current legally enforceable right exists if the right is not contingent on a future event and
is enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and
all counterparties and there is an intention on the part of the Bank to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously. The Bank discloses all recognized financial instruments that are set off and those subject to an
enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement, irrespective of whether they are offset. Information relating

to financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangement is provided in Note D.

Fair Value Disclosure

In liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions
onan arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a market
might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or there are
few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market quotations may
not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers and therefore
may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are not necessarily
determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive markets.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities that are traded in
active markets are based on quoted market prices or dealer price quotations. For all other financial instruments the Bank
measures fair values using other valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.

The objective of the valuation techniques applied by the Bank is to arrive at a reliable fair value measurement.

Other valuation techniques include net present value, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, comparison
to similar instruments for which market observable prices exists and other valuation models commonly used by market
participants. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk free and benchmark interest rates, credit
spreads and other premiums used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign currency exchange rates
and expected price volatilities and correlations.

The Bank uses widely recognized valuation models for measuring the fair value of common and more simple financial
instruments, like interest rate and currency swaps that use only observable market data and require little management judgment
and estimation. Availability of observable market prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgment and
estimation and also reduces the uncertainty associated with the measurement of fair value. Observable market prices and
inputs available vary depending on the products and markets and are subject to changes based on specific events and
general conditions in the financial markets.

135Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Where the Bank measures portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of net exposures, it applies
judgment in determining appropriate portfolio level adjustments such as bid-ask spread. Such judgments are derived from
observable bid-ask spreads for similar instruments and adjusted for factors specific to the portfolio.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the measurement of fair value:
Level 17: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data. Included in this category are instruments valued using: quoted market prices in
active markets for similar instruments, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered less
than active, or other valuation techniques where all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which significant input is not based on observable market data and the unobservable
inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. Instruments that are valued based on quoted market prices for
similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between
the instruments are included in this category.

The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the
basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance
of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs
that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. A valuation
input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling
external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in measuring the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices
are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank’s borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques
based on discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank's credit
spread. Credit spreads are obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties
for the Bank’s new public bond issues. The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and
valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such
as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation models are subject to internal and periodic
external reviews. When a determination is made that the market for an existing borrowing is inactive or illiquid, appropriate
adjustments are made to the relevant observable market data to arrive at the Bank’s best measure of the price at which the
Bank could have sold the borrowing at the balance sheet date.

For borrowings on which the Bank has elected fair value option, the portion of fair value changes on the valuation of borrowings
relating to the credit risk of the Bank is reported in Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IFRS 9.

Equity Investments: The Bank holds direct equity in various enterprises and private funds which may be listed or unlisted.

All equity investments held by the Bank are measured at fair value in line with IFRS 9. Where, as in the case of private funds,
the underlying assets are periodically valued by fund managers or independent valuation experts using market practices,

136Chapter 6

Management has concluded that these valuations are representative of fair value. Where such valuations are unavailable,
the percentage of the Bank’s ownership of the net asset value of such funds is deemed to approximate the fair value of the
Bank’s equity participation. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises is based on the latest available quoted bid
prices. For equity investments in unlisted entities the fair value is assessed using appropriate methods, which maximize the
use of relevant observable inputs for example, discounted cash flows.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when
possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation
tools based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The
models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial
models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its sovereign loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for these loans. The
Bank’s loan assets, except for those at fair value, are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost. The fair value of loans
carried at amortized cost are reported in these financial statements for disclosure purposes only and represents Management's
best measures of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. The fair valuation of loans has been measured
using a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates in the relevant currency including impairment,
when applicable, and credit spreads for non-sovereign loans. In arriving at its best estimate Management makes certain
assumptions about the unobservable inputs to the model, the significant ones of which are the expected cash flows and
the discount rate. These are regularly assessed for reasonableness and impact on the fair value of loans. An increase in the
level of forecast cash flows in subsequent periods would lead to an increase in the fair value and an increase in the discount
rate used to discount the forecast cash flows would lead to a decrease in the fair value of loans. Changes in fair value of
loans carried at fair value through profit and loss are reported in the income statement. The estimated fair value of loans is
disclosed in Note |.

Valuation Processes Applied by the Bank
The fair value measurements of all qualifying treasury investments, borrowings, loans and equity investments are reported to
and reviewed by the Assets & Liabilities Management Committee (ALCO) in line with the Bank’s financial reporting policies.

Where third-party information from brokers or pricing experts are used to measure fair value, documents are independently
assessed and the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusions.

The assessment and documentation involves ensuring that (i) the broker or pricing service provider is duly approved for use in

pricing the relevant type of financial instrument, (ii) the fair value arrived at reasonably represents actual market transactions,
(iii) where prices for similar instruments have been adopted, that the same have been, where necessary, adjusted to reflect
the characteristics of the instrument subject to measurement and where a number of quotes for the same financial instrument
have been obtained, fair value has been properly determined using those quotes.

Day One Profit and Loss

The fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is based on fair value as defined under IFRS 13. A gain or loss may
only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison
with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based
on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss
may not be recognized when using a fair value which is not defined under IFRS 13. The Bank only recognizes gains or
losses after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants
would consider in setting a price.

137Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The Bank holds financial instruments, some maturing after more than ten years, where fair value is not based on quoted
prices in an active market at the measurement date. Such financial instruments are initially recognized at the transaction
price, although the value obtained from the relevant market participants may differ. The difference between the transaction
price and the fair value measurement that is not evidenced by a quoted price in an active market or by a valuation technique
that uses only observable market data, commonly referred to as “day one profit and loss”, is either: (a) amortized over the
life of the transaction; or () deferred until the instrument's fair value can be measured using market observable inputs or is
realized through settlement. The financial instrument is subsequently measured at fair value, adjusted for the deferred day
one profit and loss. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognized immediately in the income statement without immediate
reversal of deferred day one profits and losses.

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures”, the ADF and any other entity in which the Bank has significant
influence are considered associates of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence,
but not control, over the entity’s financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and the ADF is
described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased
or decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's
share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognized in the investor’s income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to
the capital of the ADF occurred between 1974 and 1990. At 31 December 2015, such subscriptions cumulatively represented
less than 1 percent of the economic interest in the capital of the ADF.

Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in 1972,
IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Furthermore, in accordance
with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity
method are limited to the investment’s original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly
attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or are recognized
as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will
flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income
statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference
between cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

e

Buildings: 15-20 years

e Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years

e Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
e Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to
amortization are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable
amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the
higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to disposal and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as
the difference between proceeds and the asset’s carrying amount and are included in the income statement in the period
of disposal.

138Chapter 6

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. An intangible asset
is recognized only when its cost can be measured reliably and it is probable that the expected future economic benefits
attributable to it will flow to the Bank. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method to write
down the cost of intangible assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives of 3-5 years.

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in certain member countries.
Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made under
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received
and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term. When an operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the
lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Allocations and Distributions of Income Approved by the Board of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving
allocations from income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of
earnings from prior years which are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions
of distribution for specified uses have been met. Distributions of income for development purposes are reported as expenses
on the Income Statement in the year of approval. Distributions of income for development purposes may be funded from
amounts previously transferred to surplus account or from the current year’s income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income, balance of amounts
allocated to surplus after deducting distributions approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year’s net income,
and expenses recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, Management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank’s accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories.
Such decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Fair Value through Profit and Loss — In designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank
has determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Amortized Cost and Embedded Derivatives — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 9 on classifying financial assets and
those with embedded derivatives in their entirety as at amortized cost or fair value through profit or loss. In making this
judgment, the Bank considers whether the cash flows of the financial asset are solely payment of principal and interest on
the principal outstanding and classifies the qualifying asset accordingly without separating the derivative.

139Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Consolidation — The Bank follows the guidance of IFRS 10 in ascertaining if there are any entities that it controls, and that
may require consolidation.

 

a) ) t Estimates

The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Financial Assets Measured at Amortized Cost — At each financial statements reporting date, the
Bank reviews its financial assets measured at amortized cost for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective
evidence of impairment exists for individual assets. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting
expected future cash flows using the asset's original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the asset’s net
carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired assets requires significant judgment.
If the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed asset, that asset is
included in a group of assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence
of impairment for a group of assets may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the
payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in
the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and
objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology
and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any
differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured
by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are
validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models
are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation
models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations
require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value
of financial instruments. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, considering factors specific to the asset or liability. The determination of what constitutes ‘observable’ requires
significant judgment by the Bank.

 

Post-employment Benefits — The present value of retirement benefit obligations is sensitive to the actuarial and financial
assumptions used, including the discount rate. At the end of each year, the Bank determines the appropriate discount rate
and other variables to be used to determine the present value of estimated future pension obligations. The discount rate is
based on market yields at the end of the year of high-quality corporate bonds in the currencies comprising the Bank’s UA,
and the estimates for the other variables are based on the bank best judgment.

Events After the Reporting Period
The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the balance sheet date and the date when the
financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date, but do not result in an adjustment of the
financial staternents themselves, are disclosed.

Reclassification and Restatement

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

140Chapter 6

Note € — The effect of new and revised international financial
reporting standards

Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Issued but not yet effective

At the date of issue of these financial statements, various International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the IASB
were not yet effective for application and had not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The new standards
which are expected to be relevant to the Bank are discussed briefly below:

IFRS 15: Revenues from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014 and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. It specifies
how and when entities should recognize revenue from contracts with customers as well as the required disclosures in the
financial statements. The standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with
customers.

The Bank has determined that the standard is not applicable to its operations as its contracts with customers are accounted
for under IFRS 9.

IFRS 9: Financial Instruments

The Bank has already adopted phase 1 of the IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2011. Phase 2, which is the final version of
IFRS 9 was issued on 24 July 2014 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The revisions
in the final phase of this standard introduce a third classification and measurement category for financial assets, namely,
fair value through OCI, some revisions to hedge accounting and replacement of the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with the
expected credit loss impairment model. The final standard also includes the guidance for financial liabilities, as previously
issued to the effect that there is no subsequent recycling of realized gains or losses on “own credit” from OCI to profit and loss.

Although preliminary indications are that the Bank will be affected by the new standard, the Bank is still assessing the full
impact of this new pronouncement on its financial position and performance.

Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012 - 2014 Cycle
In September 2014, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 Cycle. This comprises amendments that
result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or measurement purposes as well as terminology or editorial
amendments related to a variety of individual IFRS standards. These changes are effective for reporting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.

The Bank is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements

In December 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, as part of an initiative to improve presentation and disclosure
in financial reports, to further encourage reporting entities to apply professional judgement in determining what information
to disclose in their financial statements and in determining where and in what order information is presented in the financial
disclosures. The Amendments have a mandatory effective date of 1 January 2016, with earlier adoption permitted.

The Bank expects that the adoption of these amendments will not have material impact on its Financial Statements.

IFRS 16: Leases

On 1 January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, “Leases”, which replaces the current guidance on lease accounting
in IAS 17. IFRS 16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier application
permitted. The new standard requires far-reaching changes in accounting by lessees in particular. Under IAS 17, lessees

144Chapter 6 African Development Bank

were required to make a distinction between a finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet).
IFRS 16 now requires lessees to recognize a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for
virtually all lease contracts. The IASB has included an optional exemption for certain short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets; however, this exemption can only be applied by lessees.

Preliminary indications are that the new standard will affect the Bank. However, the full impact on the financial position and
performance is still being assessed.

IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows (Amendments)

On 29 January 2016, the IASB published some revisions to IAS 7, “Statement of Cash Flows”, aimed at improving the
effectiveness of disclosures in financial reports. These amendments, which are effective from 1 January 2017, require entities
to provide information about changes in their financing liabilities. The amendments are a response to users’ demand for
information that helps them better understand and evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entity’s financing activities,
including changes from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses).

Although the Bank is yet to assess the potential impact of adopting this standard, its application is not expected to have
an impact on the financial position of the Bank as the new requirements merely involve additional disclosures rather than a
change in measurement basis.

Based on the foregoing no new or revised financial reporting standard, applicable to the Bank, became effective in 2015.

Note D — Risk management policies and procedures

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty
risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

Risk Governance and Risk Appetite

The highest level of risk management oversight in the Bank is assured by the Board of Executive Directors, which is chaired by
the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. In addition to approving
all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews trends in the Bank’s risk profiles and performance to
ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

Three management level committees perform monitoring and oversight roles: the Asset and Liability Management Committee
(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM). The ALCO is the oversight and control
organ of the Bank’s finance and treasury risk management activities. It is the Bank’s most senior management forum on
finance and treasury risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance. The Credit Risk Committee
(CRC) ensures effective implementation of the Bank’s credit policies and oversees all credit risk issues related to sovereign
and non-sovereign operations, prior to their submission to OPSCOM. OPSCOM is chaired by the First Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer and reviews all operational activities before they are submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.

The ALCO, CRC and OPSCOM meet on a regular basis to perform their respective oversight roles. Among other functions,
the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and treasury risk management reports and financial projections and approves
proposed strategies to manage the Bank’s balance sheet. The Credit Risk Committee is responsible for end-to-end credit risk
governance, credit assessments, portfolio monitoring and rating change approval amongst other responsibilities. ALCO and
CRC are supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including country risk, non-sovereign
credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

142Chapter 6

In late 2013, a Group Chief Risk Officer position was created reporting directly to the President of the Bank. Day-to-day
operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines are delegated
to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department and the office of the Group Chief Risk Officer are
responsible for monitoring the day to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity.
This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank’s capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent
risk profile consistent with the highest credit rating. The Bank allocates its risk capital between non-core risks (10 percent),
with sovereign and non-sovereign operations sharing equally the remaining balance (45 percent each).

Policy Framework

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market,
credit, product, and other developments. The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its risks are governed by the
Bank’s Capital Adequacy Policy, the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority), the General Authority
on the Bank's Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority) and the Bank’s Credit Risk Management Guidelines.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
the Bank's financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for
managing the Bank’s interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational
risk. The ALM Authority covers the Bank’s entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment
of liquid resources, including the interest rate and currency risk management aspects of the Bank’s lending and equity
investment operations.

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services
for its borrowers and separate guidelines prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for
the Bank’s sovereign and non-sovereign loan, guarantee and equity investment portfolios.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more
detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee

(ALCO), the Credit Risk Committee (CRC) and the Operations Committee (OPSCOM).

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the different sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

 

Cree
Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
for financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Bank arising
essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

 

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk in its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign
credit risk in its portfolio of non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk in its portfolio of treasury
investments and derivative transactions used for asset and liability management purposes. These risks are managed within
an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in more detail in the sections
that follow.

143Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk before collateral received or other credit enhancements for 2015 and 2014 is
as follows:

Equity participations 751,306 645,288
Other debt securities 46,423 94,111

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from
the borrowing member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, the Bank is exposed to country risk which includes
potential losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages
country credit risk through its policies related to the quality at entry of project proposals, exposure management, including
individual country exposures and overall creditworthiness of the concerned country. These include the assessment of the
country’s risk profile as determined by its macroeconomic performance, debt sustainability, socio-political conditions and
the conduciveness of its business environment.

(1) The outcome of the referendum conducted in South Sudan in January 2011 supported the creation of an independent state of South Sudan. After the split of the state of Sudan
into two separate nations became effective in July 2011, the number and amounts of loans shown against Sudan in this statement would be split between the emerging states, on a
basis agreed upon following the ongoing negotiations between Sudan and South Sudan. At the end of December 2015, no decision has been taken by the states of Sudan and South
Sudan regarding the terms and conditions of such exchange.

 

 

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

The Bank is also exposed to some of its borrowers on account of trade finance and repayment guarantees for an amount

As part of ongoing efforts to reduce sovereign concentration risk and increase lending headroom, the African Development
Bank in 2015 entered into Exposure Exchange Agreements (EEAs) with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and
the World Bank, both AAA-rated entities.

145Chapter 6 African Development Bank

An EEA involves a simultaneous exchange of equivalent credit risk on defined reference portfolios of sovereign exposures,
subject to each participating Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) retaining a minimum of 50 percent of the total exposure
to each country that is part of the EEA.

Under the EEA, the MDB that originates the sovereign loans and buys protection continues to be the lender of record. An
exposure exchange in no way affects the application of the normal sovereign sanctions policies by the buyer of protection.

Purchased or sold credit protection pays out only upon the occurrence of certain credit events with respect to any sovereign
borrower in the reference portfolio. Following a default, the seller pays compensation to the buyer for part of the unpaid
interest, based on the EEA amount for the country in default at the interest rate stipulated in the agreement, currently set at
USD six-month LIBOR plus 0.75 percent. The seller is only required to make principal payments to the buyer when the EEA
buyer writes off or restructures part, or all, of the loans in the reference portfolio. Any principal payment made reduces the
EEA amount and the coverage of the EEA for the country for which the write-off/restructuring occurs. Experience shows that
MDBs hardly ever write off arrears as the said arrears always ultimately get settled. Interest payments and principal, where
applicable, are made on a semi-annual basis and cannot exceed contractual payments related to the loans that are in default.

When the default event is resolved, payments made under an exposure exchange are returned to the seller of protection.

The EEAs have final maturities in 2030 with linear annual reduction of the notional amounts starting from 2025. As at
31 December 2015, the total notional amount of credit protection purchased or sold on the relevant underlying single
reference entities is USD 4.47 billion (UA 3.22 billion). The participating MDBs have paid no credit protection fee (i.e. guarantee
premium) as the amount of exposure exchanged - purchased and sold - are notionally the same at inception. The table
below presents the countries and notional amounts of credit protection contracted under the EEA.

The Bank accounts for exposures arising from EEAs and similar transactions as financial guarantee contracts, in accordance
with IFRS 9 and IAS 37, as described in Note B.

As of 31 December 2015, no default events have occurred on any exposures covered under these Exposure Exchanges
and the Bank continues to expect full recovery of its sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed exposures.

The counterparty credit exposure that can arise from the purchase or sale of protection, under the exposure exchange, is
managed and mitigated by the Bank through its robust risk management mechanisms and frameworks.

146The Bank en

ers into credit enhancement facilities for the primary purpose of promoting private sector operations (PSOs) in
ries by inviting other entities to participate in the risks of such PSOs.

The foundation of the Bank’s credit risk management is a systematic credit risk assessment framework, through underlying

models and

heir associated risk factors that have been optimized to ensure more predictive power of the rating parameters

and to better align with widely-used rating scales and ensure consistency with best practices. The credit risk assessment is

measured us
between ob!

ing a uniform internal 22-grade master scale, optimized to provide: (i) increased granularity; (ii) better differentiation
igors; (iii) smoother grade distribution to alleviate the current grade concentration; and finally (iv) to create a

common framework when communicating credit risks to risks takers. The level of granularity helps in measuring probabilities
of default in order to better differentiate between obligors.

The credit ra’

ings at the sovereign level are derived from a risk assessment of five risk indices that include macroeconomic

performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment and the Bank’s portfolio performance. These
five risk indices are combined to derive a composite country risk index for both sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. The

country risk
other special

ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from different international rating agencies and
ized international organizations. The CRC reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure that they

 

reflect the expected risk profiles of the countries. The CRC also assesses whether the countries are in compliance with their
country exposure limits and approves changes in loss provisioning, if required.

The following table presents the Bank’s internal measurement scales compared with the international rating scales:

The weighted average risk rating of the Bank’s sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed portfolio was 2.63 at the end of
December 2015, compared to 2.60 as of 31 December 2014. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s

five risk classes is shown in the table below:

2012 73% 15% 1% 10% 1%
2011 70% 15% 1% 13% 1%

It is the Bank’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit
becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be
presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared.
Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until
all overdue amounts have been paid. These countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of
0.5 percent on the commitment fees charged on qualifying undisbursed loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of its preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on
non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties in servicing their debts to the Bank on a
timely basis. As previously described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment on its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate
with the assessment of the incurred loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential Expected Losses (EL) and Unexpected Losses (UL) related to credit, the Bank maintains a prudent risk
capital cushion for credit risks. The Bank’s capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for
public sector and private sector credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments), as well as for contingent liabilities
(guarantees and client risk management products) in each risk class. Risk capital requirements are generally higher for private
sector operations which have a higher probability of default and loss-given default than public sector operations. At the
end of December 2015, the Bank’s public sector loan portfolio used up to 31 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital based
on the Bank's capital adequacy framework. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital net of exchange
adjustments, plus accumulated reserves adjusted by gain on financial assets at fair value through Other Comprehensive
Income and unrealized loss/gain on fair-valued borrowings arising from "own credit". Callable capital is not included in the
computation of risk capital.

 

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers and to enclave projects, it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees.
The Bank may also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a

sovereign guarantee.

 

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses several models to assess the risk of every
project at entry. The models are tailored to the specific characteristics and nature of the transactions. The result of the credit
risk assessment is measured using a uniform internal 22-grade master scale as described above.

Non-sovereign transactions are grouped into the following three main categories: a) project finance; b) financial institutions;
and c) private equity funds. Internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of pre-determined critical factors.

148Chapter 6

 

\ pD
a) Fre

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the borrower’s financial strength. This assesses:

Primarily, i) the capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; ii) the company’s operating
performance and profitability; and iii) the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: i) the outlook of the industry in which the project
company operates; ii) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; iii) the strength of the project
company’s management with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; and iv) the quality of the
information on which the analysis is based.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

    

The assessment of financial institutions follows the uniform rating system commonly referred to as the CAMELS model: i) Capital
adequacy — analyses of the composition, adequacy and quality of the institution’s capital; ii) Asset quality, operating policies
and procedures and risk management framework; iii) Management quality and decision-making framework; iv) Earnings and
market position — an evaluation of the quality and level of profitability; v) Liquidity and funding adequacy — an assessment
focusing on the entity’s ability to access debt market; and vi) Sensitivity to market risk - an assessment of the impact of
interest rate changes and exchange rate fluctuations.

 

ity Funds

The assessment of Private Equity Funds takes into consideration the analysis of the following qualitative and quantitative factors:

e Financial strength and historic fund performance;
e Investment strategy and risk management;

e Industry structure;

e Management and corporate governance; and

e Information quality.

All new non-sovereign projects require an initial credit rating and undergo a rigorous project approval process. The NonSovereign Working Group of the CRC reviews the non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may
recommend changes for approval by CRC if justified by evolving country and project conditions.

Since 2009, the Bank has been increasing its non-sovereign loan and equity exposures. The weighted-average risk rating
was 4.0 at the end of 2015 compared to 3.73 at the end of 2014. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the

Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

149Chapter 6 African Development Bank

In compliance with IFRS, the Bank does not make general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing nonsovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the
credit impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2015, the cumulative impairment provision to cover the incurred
loss on impaired loan principal in the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 118.36 million compared to UA 55.39 million in 2014.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector entities, either directly or through
investment funds.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a risk
capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks derived from the Bank’s Economic Capital Approach (IRB). At the end of
December 2015, the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately 24 percent of the Bank’s total
on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This level is still below the limit of 45 percent determined by the Bank for total nonsovereign operations. Out of the Bank’s non-sovereign portfolio, equity participations required as risk capital approximately
10 percent of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources. This is still below the statutory limit of 15 percent
established by the Board of Governors for equity participations.

    

Credit Exposure Limits

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the maintenance of an adequately diversified portfolio at any given
point in time. The Bank manages credit risk at the global country exposure limit (combined sovereign-guaranteed and nonsovereign portfolios) by ensuring that in aggregate, the total exposure to any country does not exceed 15 percent of the
Bank's total risk capital. This threshold and other determinants of country limit allocation are clearly spelt out in the Bank’s

capital adequacy framework.

In the revised capital adequacy and exposure management approved by the Board in May 2011, the 15 percent (of the
Bank's total risk capital) global country concentration limit is meant to allow for adequate portfolio diversification.

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by regularly monitoring the exposure limit with regard
to the specific industry/sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of
collateral (security and/or guarantees) from project sponsors to partially mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.
3) Counterparty Credit k
In the normal course of business, and beyond its development related exposures, the Bank utilizes various financial
instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates,
and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying
degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Bank. Given the nature
of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk; however, the Bank minimizes this
risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards,
counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

 

Counterparties must meet the Bank’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for
Finance. For local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate
availability of investment opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies.
The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored for compliance with established criteria.

150Chapter 6

For trading counterparties, the Bank requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

MBS/ABS originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS.

Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition
shall not exceed 5 years.

The Bank may also invest in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3 and enters into collateralized
securities repurchase agreements.

The Bank uses derivatives in the management of its borrowing portfolio and for asset and liability management purposes.
As a rule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to
undertaking any transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating
agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Lower rated
counterparties may be used exceptionally for local currency transactions. These counterparties require the approval of ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

Daily collateral exchanges enable the Bank to maintain net exposures to acceptable levels. The Bank’s derivative exposures
and their credit rating profiles are shown in the tables below:

In addition to the minimum rating requirements for derivative counterparties, the Bank operates within a framework of
exposure limits to different counterparties based on their credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 12 percent of
the Bank’s total risk capital (equity and reserves) for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are
aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology
and monitored regularly against the Bank’s credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

The credit exposure of the investment and related derivative portfolio continues to be dominated by highly rated counterparties
as shown in the table below. The proportion of exposure to AAA-rated entities decreased from the previous year as a result

of the downgrade of some agencies.

152Chapter 6

The Bank’s exposure to the stressed Eurozone economies remains very limited at approximately UA 0.36 million or less than
0.1 percent of the portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative
risk capital cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of December 2015, the
Bank’s counterparty credit portfolio including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital 2 percent of
the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. Liquidity
risk arises when there is a maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. The Bank’s principal liquidity risk management
objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling 1-year horizon
without additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank
maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year
period. The PML is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2)
1-year projected net loan disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of
committed guarantees; and 4) undisbursed equity investments.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s
core liquidity portfolio (operational portfolio) is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated if required to
meet the Bank’s short-term liquidity needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are
included in the computation of the size of the operational tranche of liquidity. In addition to the core liquidity portfolio, the
Bank maintains a second tranche of liquidity (the prudential portfolio) that is also invested in relatively liquid securities to cover
its expected medium-term operational cash flow needs. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank’s equity
resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities intended to collect contractual cash flows with the objective of
stabilizing the Bank's net income. In determining its level of liquidity for compliance with the PML, the Bank includes cash,
deposits and securities in all the treasury investments, with appropriate hair-cuts based on asset class and credit rating.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in
its risk-bearing capacity, the Bank’s principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation
risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the
currency composition of the SDR (UA). The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency
exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is
achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which
they were borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to
service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are reported in Units of Account (equivalent
to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates
fluctuate. The Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account
by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the
Unit of Account). In keeping with the Bank’s currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out to
realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a misalignment or when there is a revision to the SDR currency
composition.

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The

distribution of the currencies of the Bank’s recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses
in Euros, US Dollars and CFA Franc.

157Chapter 6 African Development Bank

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible,
the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four
currencies, namely the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is
determined and reviewed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) every five years and the last revision became effective on
1 January 2011 based on the value of exports of goods and services and international reserves. The SDR rate represents
the sum of specific amounts of the four basket currencies valued in US dollars, on the basis of the exchange rates quoted
at noon each day in the London market.

Currency risks arise with the uncertainty about the potential future movement of the exchange rates between these currencies
on the one hand, and between the exchange rates of the SDR currencies and the other non-SDR currencies (mainly African
currencies) used by the Bank on the other hand. In this regard, the Bank carries out an annual sensitivity analysis of the
translation results of its net assets with regard to the movement of the different exchange rates. The analysis consists of a
set of scenarios where the exchange rates between the US dollar and the other SDR and African currencies are stretched
out by large margins (10 percent appreciation/depreciation).

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank’s net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the
exchange rate of the currencies in the SDR basket as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively. The sensitivity analysis
shown assumes a separate 10 percent appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar.
Due to a moderate change in the African currency holdings, the table also includes the effect of a 10 percent appreciation/
depreciation of each African currency against the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy
of the Bank shows a minimal change in net assets as a result of currency mismatches.

The Bank's interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of the following two elements:

1. the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings
funding such assets; and

2. the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity resources to changes in interest rates.

The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin that is not
overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt

Two thirds of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest
margin on assets funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the
corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate” loans. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average
cost of a dedicated pool of the Bank’s borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings
to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds
pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's pool-based loans has traditionally helped to
minimize the interest rate sensitivity of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining demand for this
product in favor of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (marketbased loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the
interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank’s underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank
may also provide borrowers with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of
its market-based loan products. Although it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market
risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio
tranche. The portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different
business purposes and underlying funding. The core part of the investment portfolio is held to comply with the Bank’s liquidity
policy and uses a six-month Libor floating rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected
operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month Libor floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all
new borrowings into floating rate in one of the Bank’s active currencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where
the Bank issues structured debt, the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the
desired six-month Libor-based floating rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one
alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk by: (i) limiting the
amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within one year to 25 percent of the outstanding debt portfolio, and
(ii) trying to match the average maturity of loans priced with a fixed spread with borrowing with similar lifetime.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the income earned from funding a significant
portion of the Bank’s assets with equity resources. These assets are mostly made up of fixed rate loans and investments
with a lifetime of 10 years. Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity resources (the SDR) affect
the net interest margin earned on assets funded by equity. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower
lending and investment rates, which in the long term reduce the nominal earnings on the Bank’s equity resources.

   

The Bank manages the interest rate profile of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the
sensitivity of the net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the
repricing profile of the assets funded by the Bank’s equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing
profile benchmark. The Bank's repricing profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10 percent of the Bank’s
assets is funded by equity and repriced in each year. Using this benchmark, the Bank's net interest margin on assets funded
by equity tends to track a 10-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates.

162Chapter 6

At the end of 2014 and 2015, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual
buckets.

Net nterest M agin oens y
A parallel upward shift in the SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum gain in income statement of UA 5.81
million and UA 5.96 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively.

 

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial
statements at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100
bps of each of the currencies in the investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of 31 December 2015
and 2014, respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity
analysis in 2015 and 2014 for assets and liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield
curve of +/- 10 bps.

ion to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans
committed before 1997 on which the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty. In practice the level of prepayments
on such loans has generally been within acceptable levels. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects
itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates.
Since 2006, total annual prepayments on loans particularly those committed prior to 1997 have been declining over the
years. Prepayments in 2015 amounted to UA 24.94 million compared to prepayments of UA 50.59 million realized in 2014,
none of which related to loans committed prior to 1997.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is exposed to operational risks arising from its systems and processes.

Operational risks include the risks of losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and/or systems,
and from external events which could have a negative financial or adverse reputational impact. Operational risk is present
in virtually all the Bank’s transactions and includes losses attributable to failures of internal processes in credit and market
operations.

The office of the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) of the Bank is responsible for implementing the Integrated Internal Control
Framework (IICF) which consists of two phases. Phase one relates to the implementation of Internal Control over Financial
Reporting (ICFR) based on the COSO Framework as a means of regularly evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of
the Bank's internal controls in all significant business processes with financial statement impact. As part of this process,
Management's attestation on the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting is published in the Bank’s Annual Report.

Phase two of the IICF entails the implementation of Operational Risk Management Framework which is intended to address

risks inherent in other business processes not covered by ICFR. The Operational Risk Management Framework (ORM) was
approved by the Board of Directors in March 2012 as the first step in addressing risks related to business processes and

163Chapter 6 African Development Bank

the implementation process is ongoing. Full implementation of ORM will ensure a structured and well-coordinated approach
to risk identification and assessment, risk mitigation and control as well as risk reporting across the Bank. It will also provide
the basis for applying advanced measurement approach in measuring operational risk capital. Currently, the Bank’s Capital
Adequacy and Exposure Management Framework provides for an operational risk capital charge of 15 percent of the average
operating income for the preceding 3 years, in line with Basel Il recommendations for operational risk.

It is the primary responsibility of the management of each business unit to implement adequate controls in their respective
business processes based on the prevailing institutional standards. Management is required to sign attestation of compliance
annually.

Compliance with institutional standards is verified through periodic reviews undertaken by the Office of the Auditor General
of the Bank. The results of internal audit reviews are discussed with the Management of the relevant business unit(s), with
summaries submitted to Senior Management of the Bank and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.

The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plan which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and
protect the interests of all the key stakeholders of the Bank Group, namely, the member countries (borrowing and nonborrowing), bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and their families, in the event of any disturbance in
its office locations. Three key organs in the Bank ensure the oversight and implementation of the plan: (i) the Executive
Crisis Committee, chaired by the President of the Bank, which makes the key decisions based on recommendations from
the Operations Crisis Committee (OCC); (ii) the OCC, chaired by the Corporate Vice President, that closely monitors all
developments affecting the Bank and advises on measures necessary to mitigate the relevant risks; and (iii) the business
continuity Unit (BCPU) that follows up on the implementation of decisions made and is also responsible for periodic tests
of the overall business continuity preparedness of the Bank and staff.

Other elements of the Bank’s operational risk management practices include compliance with the Code of conduct and staff
rules, the work of the Integrity and Anti-Corruption Department (IACD) and the existence of a Whistleblower Protection Policy.

The Bank’s policy is to recognize transfers out of level 3 as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused
he transfer.

nvestments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are therefore classified within Level 1,
include active listed equities, exchange-traded derivatives, US government treasury bills and certain non-US sovereign
obligations. The Bank does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments.

Financial instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active but are valued based on quoted market prices,
dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources supported by observable inputs are classified within Level 2.These include
investment-grade corporate bonds and certain non-US sovereign obligations, listed equities, over-the-counter derivatives
and a convertible loan. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets and/or are subject to
ransfer restrictions, valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on
available market information.

nvestments classified within Level 3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they trade infrequently or do not trade at all.
nstruments in Level 3 include loans to regional member countries, private equity and corporate debt securities including
some structured asset and mortgage-backed instruments. As observable prices are not available for these securities, the
Bank has used valuation techniques to derive the fair value. However as noted earlier, the fair values for loans and some
securities are derived merely for disclosure purposes rather than for reporting on the balance sheet.

 

The primary products classified at Level 3 are as follows:

Due to the lack of liquidity in the market and the prolonged period of time under which many securities have not traded, obtaining
external prices is not a strong enough measure to determine whether an asset has an observable price or not. Therefore, once
external pricing has been verified, an assessment is made whether each security is traded with significant liquidity based on its
credit rating and sector. If a security is of low credit rating and/or is traded in a less liquid sector, it will be classified as Level 3.
Where third party pricing is not available, the valuation of the security will be estimated from market standard cash flow models
with input parameter assumptions which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable
securities with similar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings. These securities are also classified as Level 3.

166Chapter 6

The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows
or net asset value (NAV). The fair value of the Bank’s equity participations is estimated as the Bank’s percentage ownership
of the net asset value of the investments.

Trading derivatives are classified at Level 3 if there are parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products
where the performance is linked to more than one underlying. Examples are derivative transactions and derivatives attached
to local currency transactions. These unobservable correlation parameters could only be implied from the market, through
methods such as historical analysis and comparison to historical levels or benchmark data.

Reconciliation of fair value balances measured using valuation techniques with no significant input from observable market
data (level 3 hierarchy) at 31 December 2015 and 2014 is as follows:

Significant Unobservable Inputs
Although the Bank believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions
could lead to different fair value results.

The valuation techniques applied with significant unobservable inputs are described briefly below:

Comparable Pricing

Comparable pricing refers to the method where valuation is done by calculating an implied yield from the price of a similar
comparable observable instrument. The comparable instrument for a private equity investment is a comparable listed company.
The comparable instrument in case of bonds is a similar comparable but observable bond. This may involve adjusting the
yield to derive a value for the unobservable instrument.

Yield
Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cash-flows in a discounted cash-flow model.

Correlation

Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. Credit correlation
generally refers to the factor that describes the relationship between the probability of individual entities to default on
obligations and the joint probability of multiple entities to default on obligations. Similarly, equity correlation is the correlation
between two equity instruments. An interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates. FX correlation
represents the correlation between two different exchange rates.

Liquidity Discount
A liquidity discount is primarily applied to unlisted firms to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded. An increase
in liquidity discount in isolation will result in unfavourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm.

Volatility

Volatility represents an estimate of how much a particular instrument, parameter or Index will change in value over time.
Volatilities are generally implied from the observed option prices. For certain instruments, volatility may change with strike
and maturity profile of the option.

Credit Spreads
Credit spreads represent the additional yield that a market participant would demand for accepting an exposure to the credit
risk of an instrument. A change in the assumptions could lead to different fair value results.

Sensitivity Analysis of Valuations of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities Using Unobservable Inputs
For fair value measurements in level 3, changing one or more of the assumptions used would have the following effects:

Investments
The fair value of level 3 investments is sensitive to sources of pricing used. The fair value variance arising from using other
sources of prices amounted to UA 0.01 million or 0.01 percent. (2014: UA 0.01 million or 0.002 percent)

Borrowings and Derivatives

The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100 bps of each of the currencies in the level
8 borrowings and derivative portfolios as of 31 December 2015 and 2014. However, due to the low level of interest rates
across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis in 2015 and 2014 for liabilities denominated in Japanese Yen
reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 10 bps:

Note F — Treasury investments

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government, agency, supranational, bank and
corporate obligations, time deposits, mortgage and asset-backed securities, funded risk participation program, secured
lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, cross-currency
swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government, agency and supranational obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the
Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed
by governments of member countries or other official entities with the same rating criteria. For maturities beyond 15 years
and up to 30 years, a AAA rating is required. For mortgage and asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in
securities with a AAA credit rating. For bank and corporate obligations with final maturity longer than 6 months and less
than 5 years, the Bank may only invest with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA-. AAA rating is required
for debt obligations beyond 5 years and up to 10 years. The purchases of currency or interest rate options are permitted
only if the life of the option contract does not exceed 1 year. Such transactions are only executed with counterparties with
credit ratings of AA- or above. All derivative transactions, including options, cross-currency and interest rate swaps including
asset swap transactions, are only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with which the Bank
has entered into Master Derivative Agreements and a Collateral Support Agreement with minimum credit ratings of A-/A3
at the time of the transaction.

 

As at 31 December 2015, the Bank had received collateral with fair value of UA 633 million in connection with swap
agreements. Of this amount, a total of UA 543 million was in the form of cash and has been recorded on the balance sheet
with a corresponding liability included in “Other accounts payable”. The balance of UA 90 million was in the form of liquid
financial assets and is kept in custody by the Bank.

The Bank has entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert fixed rate income on loans in certain currencies into
variable rate income.

The Bank has entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at
31 December 2015, the Bank had futures with a notional value of Euro 4,956 million and USD 5,992 million. The carrying
value of Euro futures and US dollars futures were UA 3.2 million and UA 9.2 million respectively.

> xchange Transac is to eage

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the
principal currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP, CFA Franc and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed
forward exchange transactions to economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at 31 December 2015, there were no
open positions with respect to forward exchange transactions.

 

Accounting

The Bank applies fair value hedge accounting to interest rate swaps contracted to hedge its interest rate risk exposure
associated to fixed rate loans. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments are recognized in profit or
loss. The hedged item is adjusted to reflect changes in its fair value in respect of the risk being hedged with the gain or loss
attributable to the hedged risk being recognized in profit or loss.

The fair value of the loan swaps designated and effective as hedging instruments as at 31 December 2015 was a liability of
UA 111.80 million. The fair value gain on these loan swaps for the year ended 31 December 2015 was UA 31.13 million. The
fair value loss on the hedged loans attributable to the hedged risk was UA 31.67 million. Therefore, the hedge ineffectiveness
recognized in profit or loss was a loss of UA 0.54 million.

Hedge accounting treatment for swaps at the designation date requires the amortization of the difference between the
net carrying amount of loans and their fair value from inception. For 2015, the amortization of fair value adjustment on the
hedged risk amounted to UA 4.87 million.

173Chapter 6 African Development Bank

Note H — Non-negotiable instruments on account of capital

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the
capital increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following
two options for making their payments:

1. Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in
local currency; or

2. — Five (6) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments
commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating
to the Fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) | Regional Members - 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely
convertible currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, noninterest-bearing notes of equal value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely
in convertible currency in five (6) equal annual installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription
payment date.

2) Non-Regional Members - five (6) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are
freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in the payment arrangements between regional and
non-regional members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal
and consecutive annual installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The
second to the eighth installments shall be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

Under the Sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI), approved in accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2010/08 of 27 May 2010 each member eligible to receive financing exclusively from the African Development Fund
only shall pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in twelve (12) equal and consecutive annual installments; while
Middle Income Countries, Blend countries and Non-Regional Member Countries shall pay for the paid-up portion of their
respective subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual installments.

Payments for shares under GCI-VI are to be made in freely convertible currencies in cash or promissory notes’ encashable
on or before the due date for payment.

Note | — Loans and guarantees

 

Loans
The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain
other non-sovereign-guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed
by the Bank or in other freely convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of
these currencies shall be equal to the amount disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period
of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose
of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended for sale. Furthermore, Management does not believe
there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the terms applicable are described below:

Loan Portfolio: The Bank's loan portfolio is currently made up of three primary types of loans based on the financial
terms: fixed rate, floating rate and variable rate loans. Fixed rate and variable rate loans have both multicurrency and
single currency terms — that is, offered in multicurrency or in a single currency. While floating rate loans only bear single
currency terms.

Other Loans: The Bank also offers parallel co-financing and A/B loan syndications. Through syndications the Bank
is able to mobilize co-financing by transferring some or all of the risks associated with its loans and guarantees to
other financing partners. Thus, syndications decrease and diversify the risk profile of the Bank’s financing portfolio.
Syndications may be on a funded or unfunded basis and may be arranged on an individual, portfolio, or any other
basis consistent with industry practices.

The Bank also offers its RMCs local currency loans if the Bank is able to fund efficiently in the local currency market. The
local currency loans are offered under the fixed spread loan pricing framework with a “cost-pass-through” principle to ensure

that the overall cost of funds is compensated.

Net loans 12,868,547 12,977,286 12,496,518 12,555,923

The Bank is exposed to a loan that is measured at FVTPL due to the existence of a conversion option in the loan that could
potentially change the future cash flows to no longer represent solely payments of principal and interest as required by
IFRS 9. Accordingly, the fair value of this loan, and similar loans, is determined using the expected cash flows model with
inputs including interest rates and the borrower's credit spread estimated based on the Bank’s internal rating methodology
for non-sovereign loans.

loans granted to such entities by third parties. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed
for an entity are not made. Trade finance and repayment guarantees provided by the Bank outstanding at 31 December
2015 amounted to UA 444.43 million (2014: UA 164.11 million).

Other than the guarantees above given to other entities, the Bank in 2015 entered into guarantee contracts covering certain
of its loans whereby it gives as well as receives compensation in case there is a default in any of the specified loans. Based
on the structure, such guarantees are referred to as Exposure Exchange Agreements and are primarily risk management
tools. The details are in Note in D. As at 31 December 2015, the nominal amounts of these contracts was USD 4.47 billion
(UA 3.22 billion).

Similarly, the Bank has credit ennancement facilities that it benefits from for some of its loans. As at 31 December 2015, loans
amounting to UA 56.50 million had been approved. The credit enhancement cover for such loans becomes effective in 2016.

ADI

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social
development of African countries, to promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the African
countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were
provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the
Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of
Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

179Chapter 6 African Development Bank

The ADF has a 14-member Board of Directors, made up of 7 members selected by the African Development Bank and
7 members selected by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of
representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays
a share of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated
annually on the basis of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the
number of programs and projects executed during the period. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative
expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended 31 December 2015 amounted to UA 200.93 million (2014: UA 248.57 million),
representing 63.14 percent (2014: 67.32 percent) of the shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The
accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises 50 percent of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF
also provides that in the event of termination of the ADF’s operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata
to its participants in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any
outstanding claims against the participants. At 31 December 2015, the Bank’s pro-rata or economic share in ADF was
0.48 percent (2014: 0.51 percent).

 

Notwithstanding the exercise of 50 percent voting power in the Fund by the Bank, the conditions for control under IFRS
10 Consolidated Financial Statements are not met since the Bank does not have absolute voting interest to control ADF,
no rights to variable returns from its relationship with ADF and has an economic interest of less than 1 percent in the Fund.
Consequently, the Fund cannot be consolidated in the Bank’s Financial Statements.

As aresult of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in Note V-2, the net asset value of
ADF which is the basis for determining the value of the Bank’s investment in the Fund declined, resulting in impairment loss
on the Bank’s investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand
obligations plus disbursed and outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC
completion points and, are therefore due for MDRI loan cancelation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Par ations
The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector
companies that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank’s objective in
such equity investments is to promote the economic development of its Regional Member Countries and, in particular, the
development of their private sectors. The Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources,
promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of
domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which also have significant economic merit.

 

Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Directors, the Bank’s equity participation shall not exceed 25 percent of the equity
capital of the entity in which it invests. The Bank does not seek a controlling interest in the companies in which it invests, but
closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’ Resolution
B/BG/2009/10 of 13 May 2009, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed 15 percent of the aggregate
amount of the Bank's paid-in capital and reserves and surplus (risk capital) included in its ordinary capital resources.

 

Under IFRS 9 equity investments must be measured at fair value through profit or loss. However, where the equity investment
is not held for trading, an entity has the option to take fair value changes into other comprehensive income (OCI), with no
recycling of the change in fair value to profit or loss if the investment is subsequently derecognized. As the Bank’s equity
investments are currently held for strategic purposes of enhancing development in Regional Member Countries rather than
for trading, the Bank has opted to designate all its equity investments as at fair value through other comprehensive income.

The land on which the HQ building stands was originally granted for the unlimited use by the Bank, but with ownership
retained by the Government of Céte d'lvoire. However, in 2013, the Government of Céte d’lvoire agreed to transfer the title
to the land to the Bank and the relevant processes to perfect the transfer of title to the Bank are underway.

Note M — Borrowings

As at 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Bank's borrowings were as follows:

 

(UA millions)
2015 2014
Borrowings at fair value 15,851.25 13,481.63
Borrowings at amortized cost 598.01 894.32
Total 16,449.26 14,375.95

The Bank’s borrowings as at 31 December 2015 included subordinated borrowings in the amount of UA 223.09 million
(2014: UA 489.33 million).

The capital adequacy framework approved by the Board of Directors adopted the use of a single debt to usable capital ratio
to monitor the Bank’s leverage. The ratio caps the Bank's total outstanding debt at 100 percent of usable capital. Usable
capital comprises the equity of the Bank and the callable capital of its non-borrowing members rated A- or better. The Bank’s
usable capital at 31 December 2015 was UA 28.13 billion.

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-saving opportunities
and to lower its funding costs.

Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions that allow redemption at the option of the holder at specified
dates prior to maturity. Such borrowings are reflected in the tables on the maturity structure of borrowings using the put
dates, rather than the contractual maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such borrowings may remain
outstanding beyond their earliest indicated redemption dates.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from
borrowings are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange
of the two currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which
transform a floating rate payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2015 was UA 15,851.25 million
(2014: UA 13,481.63 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity
at 31 December 2015 was UA 15,848.51 million (2014: UA 13,452.87 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings
is equivalent to the notional amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a loss of UA 38.81 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended
31 December 2015 (2014: net loss of UA 36.73 million). The fair value movement attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit
risk included in the other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2015 was a gain of UA 73.06 million
(2014: loss of UA 32.14 million).

Fair value movements attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash
flows for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank’s credit spread on the relevant liquid
markets for ADB quoted bonds versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period. The Bank’s credit spread
was not applied for fair value changes on callable borrowings with less than one year call date.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2015, the cumulative unrealized fair value
losses to date were UA 770.29 million (2014: losses of UA 828.27 million).

Note N — Equity

Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS).
The Bank is not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase
and the Six General Capital Increases (GCI) made so far. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the
Board of Governors of the Bank on 29 May 1998 and became effective on 30 September 1999 upon ratification by member
states and entry into force of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the
authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000
per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six
percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to the regional and non-regional

187Chapter 6 African Development Bank

members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock of the Bank and
non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the
GCI-V, the authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Prior to the sixth General Capital Increase (GCI-VI) and by its resolutions B/BG/2008/07 and B/BG/2009/05, the Board
of Governors authorized two capital increases bringing the Authorized Capital of the Bank from UA 21,870 million to
UA 22,120 million to allow the Republic of Turkey and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to become members of the Bank.
The membership of these two countries became effective upon completion of the formalities specified in the Agreement
establishing the Bank and in the General Rules Governing Admission of Non-Regional Countries to Membership of the Bank.
Consequently, on 29 October 2013 and 29 May 2014, the Republic Turkey and The Grand Duchy Luxembourg respectively
were formally admitted as the 78th and 79th member countries of the Bank.

In 2009, the Board of Directors endorsed a proposal made by Canada and Republic of Korea offering to subscribe, temporarily,
to additional non-voting callable capital of the Bank in the amounts of UA 1.63 billion and UA 0.19 billion, respectively. This
proposal was adopted by the Board of Governors on 22 February 2010. Accordingly, the authorized capital stock of the
Bank increased from UA 22,120 million to UA 23,947 million by the creation of additional 182,710 non-voting shares. These
non-voting callable shares were to be absorbed by the subscriptions of Canada and the Republic of Korea to GCI-VI when
they become effective.

The GCI-VI was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on 27 May 2010. GCI-VI increased the authorized capital
stock of the Bank from UA 23,947 million to UA 67,687 million with the creation of 4,374,000 new shares. The new shares
created are to be allocated to the regional and non-regional groups in such proportions that, when fully subscribed, the
regional group shall hold 60 percent of the total capital stock of the Bank, and the non-regional group 40 percent. The
new shares and the previous ones described above shall be divided into paid-up and callable shares in the proportion of
6 percent paid-up shares and 94 percent callable shares.

Upon conclusion of the GCI VI capital increase and following the Board of Governors’ resolutions, the temporary non-voting
callable shares of Canada and Korea described above were effectively retired in 2011 and 2012, respectively thereby reducing
the authorized capital of the Bank for each of these periods by 163,296 and 19,414.

Following its Resolution B/BG/2012/04 of 31 May 2012, the Board of Governors authorized a Special Capital Increase of the
authorized share capital of the Bank to allow for: (i) subscription by a new regional member country (the Republic of South
Sudan) of the minimum number of shares required for it to become a member; and (ii) the resulting subscription by nonregional members of the number of shares necessary to comply with the 60/40 ratio requirement between the shareholding
of regional and non-regional members. Accordingly, the Board of Governors, decided to increase the authorized capital of
the Bank by the creation of 111,469 new shares, out of which 66,881 shall be available for subscription by the Republic of
South Sudan, and 44,588, shall be available for subscription by non-regional members. In 2014, by Resolution B/BG/201 4/02,
the Board of Governors revised down to 33,895 shares the initial subscription of South Sudan’s, in line with its IMF quota.
The additional shares are subject to the same terms and conditions as the shares authorized in the GCI-VI. On 30 April 2015,
having completed the membership process to join the African Development Bank, South Sudan was admitted as member.

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 1,492.54 million at 31 December 2015 was an amount of UA 38.83 million
representing the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 38.83
million callable, and UA 4.86 million paid-up shares) have been held by the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the
Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states
of the former Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling
certain conditions including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of
31 December 1992. In the event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the
pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be
reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules.
The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore, pending the response
from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to
interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of
the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state’s
Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia.
The Bank accepted the offer.

The subscription position including the distribution of voting rights at 31 December 2015 reflects the differences in the timing of subscription payments by member countries during
the allowed subscription payment period for GCI-VI. After the shares have been fully subscribed, the regional and non-regional groups are expected to hold 60% and 40% voting
rights, respectively.

 

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member
countries were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, and subsequent capital increases payments by regional
and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. This rate represented the
value of the US dollar to the SDR immediately before the introduction of the basket method of valuing the SDR on 1 July
1974 (1974 SDR). As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies to UA when
received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

Note Q — Administrative expenses

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred for the operations of the Bank and those incurred on behalf of
the ADF and the NTF. The ADF and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on
an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational
expenses and relative balance sheet size for non-operational expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall
not exceed 20 percent of the NTF’s gross income.

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

Net 121,999 123,157

Share of ADB manpower expenses amount - UA 96.78 million (2014: UA 101.44 million).

 

Included in general administrative expenses is an amount of UA 7.80 million (2014: UA 11.68 million) incurred under operating
lease agreements for offices in Cdte d’lvoire and in certain member countries, where the Bank has offices.

At the balance sheet date, the Bank had outstanding commitments under operating leases which fall due as follows:

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to five (5) years and rentals are fixed for an average of one
(1) year. Leases may be extended for periods that are not longer than the original term of the leases.

Note R — Employee benefits

 

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of 30 May
1989 became effective on 31 December 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed
by the Bank on a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank’s employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon
completion of 6 months service without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees.
In November 2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the
calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank’s residual responsibility and rights as the
SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5

195Chapter 6 African Development Bank

percent for each year of service. Also, new members from the Field Offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007. Accordingly
the associated past service costs associated with these changes were reported in the financial statements of respective years.

In 2008, the early retirement provisions and the death benefits to spouses were modified, resulting in a net negative prior
service cost of UA 8.12 million, which was immediately recognized. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate
of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has
been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on
the results of annual actuarial valuations.

In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the mandatory staff retirement age in the Bank from 60 to 62
years effective 1 January 2012. Participants of the Plan as of 11 May 2011 were given up to 31 December 2012 to make
the election on either to retire at 60 years with no penalty for early retirement or accept the extension and retire at age 62.
The option to retire at age 60 is not available to staff joining the Bank from 1 January 2012, the date of effectiveness of the
change. Most of the existing participants opted for the revised retirement age. The impact of the change on the actuarial
valuation of SRP was a curtailment of UA 10.90 million and was reported in the financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2011.

During 2015, the Board of Directors approved changes to enhance financial sustainability of the Plan. These changes primarily
included review of the commutation of pension as well as benefits applicable for death in retirement.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance
with the provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes
other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or for the satisfaction of the
SRP’s liabilities. At 31 December 2015, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these
were invested in indexed funds, with the following objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns
of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated
future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond
Index as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Post-Employment Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of
17 July 2002 and became effective on 1 January 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees
contribute a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but
may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

Contribution rates by staff members and retirees are based on marital status and number of eligible children. An MBP board,
composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management
and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a trust account. In accordance
with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are eligible as beneficiaries for making
claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependents.

On 1 January 2015, the Board of Directors approved a new set contribution rates to the MBP for the Bank, active staff

and retirees. The new set of rates are with effect from 1 September 2015 and aim at enhancing the long term financial
sustainability of the Plan.

196Chapter 6

The SRP mortality assumptions are based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes 2008 (SAPSO8) tables, specifically
referenced from the experience of United Kingdom self-administered pension schemes. Similarly, the MBP mortality
assumptions are also based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes (SAPS) tables, specifically referenced from the
experience of United Kingdom occupational schemes. These SAPS tables assume normal health participants, and have
been updated using Continuous Mortality Investigations (CMI) 2009 projections to factor in future longevity improvements.

198Chapter 6

The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AA
corporate bonds.

The medical cost inflation assumption is the rate of increase in the cost of providing medical benefits. This is influenced by a
wide variety of factors, such as economic trends, medical developments, and patient utilization. For the purposes of these

calculations, the medical cost inflation rate was assumed at 5 percent per annum.

The Bank’s obligation and costs for post-retirement medical benefits are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding medical
cost inflation.

The average duration of SRP and MBP is 15.9 years and 25 years, respectively.

Note § — Related parties

The following related parties have been identified:

The Bank makes or guarantees loans to some of its members who are also its shareholders, and borrows funds from the
capital markets in the territories of some of its shareholders. As a multilateral development institution with membership
comprising 54 African states and 26 non-African states (the “regional members” and “non-regional members”, respectively),
subscriptions to the capital of the Bank are made by all its members. All the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board
of Governors, which consists of the Governors appointed by each member of the Bank, who exercise the voting power of
he appointing member country. Member country subscriptions and voting powers are disclosed in Note N. The Board of
Directors, which is composed of twenty (20) Directors elected by the member countries, is responsible for the conduct of
he general operations of the Bank, and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the Board of Governors.
The Bank also makes or guarantees loans to certain of the agencies of its Regional Member Countries and to public and
private enterprises operating within such countries. Such loans are approved by the Board of Directors.

n addition to its ordinary resources, the Bank administers the resources of other entities under special arrangements. In
his regard, the Bank administers the resources of the ADF. Furthermore, the Bank administers various special funds and
rust funds, which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social

progress of its Regional Member Countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the NTF as well as certain multilateral
and bilateral donor funds created in the form of grants.

The ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of the
ADF is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors of which 7 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises
50 percent of the voting power in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry
out its functions, the ADF utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses

he Bank based on an agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year.

 

The Bank’s investment in the ADF is included in Equity Participations and disclosed in Note J. In addition to the amount
reported as equity participation, the Bank periodically makes allocations from its income to the Fund, to further its objectives.

200Chapter 6

Net income allocations by the Bank to ADF are reported as Other Resources in the Fund's financial statements. Net income
allocation to the Fund in 2015 amounted to UA 51 million (2014: UA 42 million)

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors
conducts the general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in this regard, the Bank consults
with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for
which it reimburses to the Bank its share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses
reimbursed to the Bank by both the ADF and NTF is disclosed in Note Q.

Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other
entities are generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction
operations and technical assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such
grant funds at 31 December 2015 and 2014 are disclosed in Note V-5.

The Bank charges fees for managing some of these funds. Management fees received by the Bank for the year ended
31 December 2015 amounted to UA 1.70 million (2014: UA 2.12 million).

The Bank also administers the SRP and MBP. The activities of the SRP and MBP are disclosed in Note R.

with the Bank’s rules and regulations. At 31 December 2015, outstanding balances on loans and advances to management
staff amounted to UA 5.83 million (2014: UA 6.48 million).

Note T — Segment reporting

The Bank is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social progress of its regional
member states. The Bank’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner
across borrowers.

Based on the evaluation of the Bank’s operations, management has determined that ADB has only one reportable segment
since the Bank does not manage its operations by allocating resources based on a determination of the contribution to net

income from individual borrowers.

The products and services from which the Bank derives its revenue are mainly loans, treasury and equity investments.

The Bank’s development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,

namely: Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Western Africa. Activities involving more than
one single country from the continent of Africa are described as multinational activities. Treasury investment activities are
carried out mainly outside the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting information

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF),
the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its
reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on 26 June 2002 approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under
the arrears clearance plan, contributions received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance
of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due
were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present value of the new loans was equal to the
present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the weighted
average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the
following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the
magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC
created extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and
d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting
measures are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the
debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision
point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that
date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

 

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears
clearance plan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors
may from time to time make to the special account, representing the Bank’s contribution to the arrears clearance plan.
The amount of such net income allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically
occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank. Consequently, income recognized on the consolidated DRC
loans in current earnings is transferred out of reserves to the special account only after the formal approval of such
ransfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

 

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance/Transition States Facility

The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their
efforts towards re-engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help
hese countries reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing
heir loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate
acility with allocations from the ADB’s net income, and contributions from the ADF and other private donors.

Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving
debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group.
n this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of 25 May 2004 established the PostConflict Countries Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million
rom the 2003 net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of 18 May 2005,
approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s
contribution to the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2006/04 of 17 May 2006, the Board of Governors also approved
he third and final installment of the Bank’s allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. In March 2008, the
Board of Directors approved the establishment of the Fragile States Facility (FSF) to take over the activities of the PCCF
and in addition provide broader and integrated framework for assistance to eligible states. The purposes of the FSF
are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty-reduction and long-term
economic growth of the eligible countries. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF/FSF are not used to
clear the debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary countries.iii)

Chapter 6

Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs.
Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected
loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net
present value of the loans or their nominal values, as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives.

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present
value or their carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value
discount rates applied and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected
ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was
achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier
than under the original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt relief
is delivered through annual debt service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service
obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision
and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon.

As at end December 2015, the implementation of the HIPC initiative shows that out of the 33 eligible countries, 30
RMCs have reached their completion points while Chad is still in interim period. Three countries, Somalia, Sudan and
Eritrea (pre-point decision) are yet to reach the decision point.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

At the Gleneagles Summit on 8 July 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of
their claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to
help 38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt
cancelation would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their
gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have
committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service
charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on 1 September 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of
disbursed and outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease
as of that date in the ADF’s net assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank’s
investment in the Fund. Subsequent write-down of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their
HIPC completion point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI loan cancelation. The reduction in the net asset value
of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have not reached their HIPC completion points
at the end of the year.

Note V — 3: Special funds

Under Article 8 of the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of
special funds.

At 31 December 2015 and 2014, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of
the Bank:

i) |The NTF was established under an agreement signed on 26 February 1976 (the Agreement) between the African
Development Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a
period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to
the Government of Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. At the expiry of the initial 30-year period on 25 April 2006, the Bank
and the Federal Republic of Nigeria agreed to 2 interim extensions (each for 12 months) to allow for further consultations
and an independent evaluation of the NTF.

Following the positive result of the independent evaluation, the NTF Agreement was renewed for a period of ten years
starting from 26 April 2008. The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25
million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank
on 14 July 1976, and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on 1 February 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first
installment of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on 7 October 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million
(US$ 10.87 million) was received on 4 May 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million)
was made on 13 September 1985.

During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria authorized the withdrawal of
an amount of US$13 million (UA 8.41 million) from reserves to settle its commitment on the arrears clearance of debt owed

by Liberia under the internationally coordinated arrears clearance mechanism for Post Conflict Countries.

During the year ended 31 December 2015, following a request by the Government of Nigeria, on 13 May 2015, a withdrawal
of US$ 10 million (UA 7.14 million) was made from the resources of the Fund and paid to the Government of Nigeria.

ii) | The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’
Resolution 20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently
expanded in 1991 to include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives
in specified fields are likely to facilitate the Bank’s objective of meeting the needs of Regional Member Countries in those
fields. The resources of this Fund consist of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

Note V — 4: Trust funds

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration
of the Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in
Africa. These funds, held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted
for in specific currencies, which are translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of 31 October 1970,
whereby Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to
reward staff members who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

ii) | The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th
Meeting of Heads of State and Governments of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African
Unity (OAU) held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 12 to 15 November 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the
objective of giving assistance to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body,
in accordance with Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we
consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as
at 31 December 2015, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.

THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of the African Development Fund (the ADF
or the Fund) primarily consist of subscriptions by the Bank,
subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, as well
as other resources received by the Fund. The cumulative
subscriptions to the ADF amounted to UA 26.71 billion at
31 December 2015.

Subsequent to the initial subscriptions, additional resources
have been provided to the ADF in the form of periodic
general replenishments, typically done every three years. The
thirteenth (ADF-13) replenishment was adopted by the Board
of Governors on 31 January 2014, and became effective on
31 March 2014 with the total resource envelope amounting
to UA 5.35 billion, comprising donor subscriptions of UA
3.80 billion, supplementary contributions of UA 0.06 billion,
Advanced Commitment Capacity or internally generated
resources of UA 0.98 billion, and a technical gap of UA 0.51
billion. The replenishment covers the 2014-2016 operational
period. As of 31 December 2015, State Participants had
subscribed a total amount of UA 3.80 billion, representing
99 percent of the ADF-13 pledged amount.

Commitments under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), donor
countries agree to compensate ADF for the cancellation of
its loans to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) that
have reached, or will reach the completion point under the
enhanced HIPC initiative. The MDRI became effective on
1 September 2006, and covers the period, 2006-2054. To
preserve the financial integrity and the financing capacity
of the Fund, the terms of the MDRI require donors to
fully compensate the Fund for debts canceled under the
MDRI. Donors have also agreed that periodic adjustments
would be made under the initiative to reflect changes in
the actual and estimated costs to the Fund resulting from
debt forgiveness.

    

As of 31 December 2015, the Fund had received from donors
aggregate commitments of UA 4.69 billion, representing 82

214

percent of the MDRI cost of UA 5.69 billion for the period,
2006-2054.

Financial Products

The ADF is the concessional financing window of the Bank
Group that provides low-income regional member countries
with concessional loans as well as grants for projects and
programs, risk guarantees and support through technical
assistance for studies and capacity building.

Loans

Prior to the ADF-13 replenishment, the ADF was operating
under differentiated lending terms for ADF-eligible countries
classified as blend, gap and graduating versus ADF-only
countries. Accordingly, loans extended to blend, gap and
graduating countries had a maturity period of 30 years,
including an 8-year grace period with an interest rate of 1
percent per annum. For ADF-only countries, their loans had
a maturity period of 50 years, including a grace period of 10
years, with no interest rate. The standard commitment fee of
0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed amounts and service
charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding balances,
were still applicable for all ADF loans.

With the view to preserving the long-term financial sustainability
and capacity of the ADF, the ADF-13 replenishment introduced
(i) hardened and differentiated lending terms, and (ii) two subgroups of ADF-only countries: the “regular” or the “advance”
group. The financing terms for regular and advance ADF-only
countries, as well as for blend, gap and graduating countries,
were hardened. An accelerated repayment clause and a
voluntary prepayment framework were also introduced.

Accordingly, new loans extended under ADF-13 to regular ADF
countries have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period
of 10 years; and loans extended to advance ADF countries
have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
The standard commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on
undisbursed amounts and service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum in outstanding balances remain applicable. Loans to
blend, gap and graduating countries have a maturity of 30
years including a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate
charge of 1 percent per annum in addition to the standard
commitment and service fees.

Guarantees
As ameans of stimulating additional private sector investments
in Low-Income Countries (LICs), the ADF Partial RiskGuarantee (ADF-PRG) instrument was introduced as part of
ADF-12 to leverage resources from the private sector and other
co-financiers for ADF countries, including fragile states. The
ADF-PRG protects private lenders against well-defined political
risks related to the failure of a government or a governmentrelated entity to honor certain specified commitments and
incentivize governments to undertake policy and fiscal reforms
necessary to mitigate performance-related risks.

Starting with the ADF-13 replenishment, the Partial Credit
Guarantee (PCG) has been added to the suite of ADF
instruments. The ADF-PCG is an instrument designed to
address the challenges faced by well-performing ADF-only
countries and State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), in their
quest to mobilize both domestic and external commercial
financing for developmental purposes. The product will serve
to partially guarantee debt-service obligations of LICs and
well-performing SOEs in LICs. The ADF PCG is available only
to; (1) ADF countries with low risk of debt distress (green light
countries) and adequate debt management capacity; and
(2) SOEs in ADF countries with low risk and moderate risk of
debt distress (green and yellow light countries, respectively),
subject to meeting certain defined eligibility criteria. Similar
to the ADF-PRG, the ADF-PCG will enable well-performing
LICs and SOEs to catalyze larger volumes of development
financing at more attractive terms.

ADF cash and treasury investments amounted to UA 3.27
billion at 31 December 2015, compared to UA 3.38 billion at
the end of 2014. Investment income for the year amounted
to UA 60.97 million, representing a return of 1.64 percent,
on an average liquidity level of UA 3.72 billion, compared
with an income of UA 76.35 million, representing a return
of 2.31 percent on an average liquidity of UA 3.31 billion in
2014. The lower income and return in 2015 was due to a
small increase in the fair value of derivatives put in place in

2014 to hedge the discount granted to donors, who chose
to accelerate the encashment of their subscription to ADF-13,
and to the smaller size of the higher yielding held-at-amortized
cost portfolios.

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net of cancellations, at
31 December 2015, amounted to UA 28.26 billion, compared
to UA 26.67 billion at the end of 2014. Table 6.6 presents
loans approved, disbursed and undisbursed balances from
2011 to 2015.

Total outstanding loans, as at 31 December 2015, was
UA 9.80 billion, UA 0.83 billion higher than the UA 8.97 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2014.

At the end of 2015, there was a total of 1,169 active loans
and grants, and a total of 725 loans amounting to UA 5.76
billion had been fully repaid or canceled through MDRI.

Visoursements

Loans and grants disbursed by the Fund increased by
14.75 percent to stand at UA 1.40 billion in 2015 from UA
1.22 billion in 2014. As at 31 December 2015, cumulative
disbursements on loans and grants amounted to UA 21.51
billion compared to UA 20.11 billion at the end of the
previous year. A total of 2,144 loans and grants were fully
disbursed for an amount of UA 16.72 billion, representing
77.73 percent of cumulative disbursements. Figure 6.3 tracks
the evolution of loan disbursements and repayments over
the past five years.

Ke nents
In 2015, principal loan repayments for the Fund amounted to UA
66.34 million compared to UA 62.87 million in 2014, representing
an increase of 5.52 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of 31 December 2015, stood at UA 7.13 billion.

Risk Management Policies and Processes

As in the case of the Bank, the Fund employs stringent risk
management procedures in order to prudently reduce its
exposure to risks, such as liquidity, currency and interest rate
risks, that are not essential to its core business of providing
development-related assistance to its clients. The details of
the risk management policies and practices employed by the
Fund to manage these risks are provided in Note C to the
Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL RESULTS

The following are the highlights of the Fund’s financial
performance in 2015:

e The Fund reported a reduced deficit of UA 83.25 million
in 2015, compared to a deficit of UA 125.35 million in
2014. The persistent reported losses over recent years is
principally due to certain structural changes to the Fund,
including the cancellation of loans to certain beneficiaries
under the MDRI initiative (described in Note F to the financial
statements) and the increased grant elements in the recent
ADF resource allocation. Although these changes are not
reported as income in the Fund's financial statements, their
impact does not adversely affect the commitment capacity
or the financial sustainability of the Fund because the Fund
is expected to be compensated through additional donor
subscriptions, payable over the life of the canceled loans.

216

e The generally low level of interest rates prevailing globally
continued to have the dual effect of lowering the Fund’s
investment income and increasing the impact of the
accelerated encashment of promissory notes deposited
towards the payment of subscriptions to the Fund.

e The Fund’s share of the total shareable administrative
expenses of the ADB Group decreased by UA 47.64
million from UA 248.57 million in 2014 to UA 200.93 million
in 2015, due to the general decrease in the operational
expenses of the Bank Group and the lower expenses
relating to the return of the Bank to its Headquarters in
Abidjan, Céte d’lvoire. As noted earlier, the Fund’s share
of administrative expenses is based on a predetermined
cost-sharing formula, which is driven by the relative levels
of certain operational volume indicators and relative balance
sheet size. The Fund’s share of these expenses was 63.14
percent for 2015, compared to 67.32 percent for 2014.

e

Investment income decreased from UA 76.35 million in
2014 to UA 60.97 million in 2015. Loan income increased
from UA 80.66 million in 2014 to UA 90.32 million in 2015,
driven primarily by a higher average outstanding loan
balance in 2015. Discount on the accelerated encashment
of promissory notes amounted to UA 27.21 million in 2015
compared to UA 34.33 million in 2014.

According to the Fund’s non-accrual policy, service charges
on loans made to or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded
from loan income, if principal installments or service charges
on any such loans are in arrears for six months or more, until
such time that payment is received. As a result of this policy,
UA 2.05 million of non-accrued loan income was excluded
from 2015 income compared to UA 2.06 million in 2014. The
number of borrowers in non-accrual status at 31 December
2015 remained three; which was the same level as at the
end of December 2014.

The Fund continued to cancel qualifying debts under MDRI
as the relevant countries reached HIPC completion point.
No new countries reached completion point during 2015. A
summary of the cumulative loan cancellations under MDRI
and HIPC is presented in Note F to the Special Purpose
Financial Statements.

Performance Ma nagement and Monitoring
As with the African Development Bank (the Bank) management
monitors performance measures and indicators which reflectthe critical success factors in the ADF’s business. To the
extent that the ADF extends grants in addition to lending at
highly concessional rates, the conventional profitability and
financial ratios are not deemed to be an appropriate means
of determining its effectiveness in delivering development
resources to regional member countries. One proxy that the
Fund applies for measuring effective delivery of development
resources is the level of disbursements made to the RMCs from
one period to another. As already noted previously, during the
year under review a total of UA 1.40 billion was disbursed for
loans and grants as compared to UA 1.22 billion made in 2014.

Notes to the special purpose financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2015

Note A — Purpose, organization and resources

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members,
promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank’s members, and to provide financing
on concessional terms for such purposes.

By its resolution F/BG/2010/03 of 27 May 2010, the Board of Governors increased the membership of the Board of Directors
of ADF from twelve (12) to fourteen (14), made up of seven (7) members selected by the Bank and seven (7) members selected
by State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the
State Participants and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (60 %) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President
of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred
© as the Bank Group. The principal purpose of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its Regional
Member Countries. The ADB finances development projects and programs in its regional member states. The ADB also
participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the development of its member countries and
where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement between the Bank and the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB Regional Member Countries, particularly the
lesser-developed countries. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of
he ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates, where there
are, are disclosed in the notes that follow.

Resources
The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other
resources received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of
he Fund consisted of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund
(the Agreement). Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions
and contributions.

 

 

Note B — Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose
Financial Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are
not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources
represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments
and demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply
with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals,
a summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

224Chapter 6

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund’s special purpose financial statements are as follows:

 

KA C4 D
Mone s of the >

 

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit
of Account as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

On 1 April 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
came into effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating
to the currencies of IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of
applying the provisions of the Articles of the IMF. The Fund’s Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the
SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on 16 November 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s
Unit of Account to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the
IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on 22 June 1993, adopted 1 January 1993 as the date for
the entry into effect of the Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank’s UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at
the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of
the Statement of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency
Translation Adjustment. Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the
resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at 31 December 2015 and 2014 are as follows:

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from
participants upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when

225Chapter 6 African Development Fund

he ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in
he replenishment resolution. The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants
are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of
he Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in
accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when they become due from certain
participants is conditional upon the respective participant’s budgetary appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand
notes. The notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

Starting with the ADF-9 replenishment, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent
‘o the net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are
credited with the full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received
are invested and the income generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the
ace value of the subscriptions and the cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be
earned on the cash received from State Participants who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is
amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant
over and above the initial cash advanced.

 

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of 18 May 2006 and 31 August 2006 respectively, the Board of
Governors of the Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF
to provide full and timely compensation for the debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following
effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent
(70%) of the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPCs); and

 

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least
seventy five percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-10 period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the
MDRI with effect from 1 September 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt
cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management’s proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year
period of the Initiative. Donors will contribute additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service
charges and principal) for each replenishment period, by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory
financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article
7 of the Agreement Establishing ADF. The contributions received from State Participants under the compensatory financing
arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment period in which such resources are
received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions are separately disclosed
within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the
Agreement which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in
terms of the UA or its foreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that
participant’s territory, that participant shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to

226Chapter 6

maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and
which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value
within that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase
in the value of the Fund’s holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that
these amounts have not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ successive Resolutions governing the second through to the thirteenth general
replenishments of the Fund, which stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to these general replenishments, subscribers
to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities
ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when
received, into UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).

Financial Assets

The Fund's financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at amortized cost and financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s business model. In
accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income through the
management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of its financial
assets at initial recognition.

d cost

  

A financial asset is classified at ’amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified at 'fair value through profit or loss’.

Financial assets at amortized cost include mainly demand obligations and accrued income on loans and receivables and
certain investments that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Demand obligations are non-negotiable,
non-interest-bearing notes payable on demand deposited for subscription payment.

The Fund also classifies at amortized cost, investments of the proceeds of accelerated encashment of notes. This is consistent
with the business model of the Fund of collecting contractual cash flows. The primary objective of such financial assets is
to recoup the discount granted to State Participants on the accelerated encashment program.

 

Wy E | A ceote at Fa}
ii) Financial Assets at Fair

 

 

f alue through | or Loss (FVTPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets

at fair value through profit or loss.

 

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a
time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

227Chapter 6 African Development Fund

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers. Income on investments includes interest
earned and unrealized gains and losses on financial assets at FVTPL.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified either as financial assets at amortized cost or as at fair value. Investments classified
as financial assets at amortized cost include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
All other investment securities are classified as investments at fair value through profit or loss and measured at market value.

Income on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the portfolio held at fair value through
profit or loss. Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the
Fund commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Loans

The Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Country eligibility
is determined by assessing gross national income per capita, creditworthiness and performance. Annual Debt Sustainability
Analysis is used to determine the risk of debt distress of each beneficiary country and set appropriate financing terms.

The following categories of countries are eligible to ADF loans:

e Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing and whose income levels are
below the operational cut-off.

e Category A countries that are not deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are
above the operational cut-off (blend countries) have access to ADF funds with modified financing terms at par with those
of blend countries.

e Category B countries are those deemed creditworthy for non-concessional financing but whose income levels are below
the operational cut-off with access to a blend of ADB and ADF resources.

Graduating countries are those that are graduating from the category of ADF borrowing countries to the category of ADB
borrowing countries and the graduating policies are determined for each new ADF replenishment.

Disbursed and outstanding loans are reported at amortized cost and not included in Net Development Resources in the
special purpose financial statements as they represent an allocation of development resources. Accordingly, no provision
for possible loan losses is required.

Loan income arising from interest, service and commitment charges is recognized on an accrual basis. The Fund places all
loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments, interest or service charges on any of the loans
to such member country are overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue
amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not
yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent
to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid
interests and charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted from income on loans for
that period. Interests and charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of
such charges has been received by the Fund.

228Chapter 6

Partial Risk Guarantee

The Fund provides guarantees, through the Partial Risk Guarantees (PRGs) program, for credits issued in support of projects
located within a member county that are undertaken by private entities. Under the PRGs program, the Fund provides
financial guarantees for private lenders to a member country in the event that a member country fails to honor its contractual
obligations with respect to private lenders to a project. The PRGs insure private lenders against well-defined political risks
related to the failure of a government or government related entity to honor certain specified commitments such as political
force majeure, currency inconvertibility, regulatory risks and various forms of breach of contract.

Under the PRGs framework the Fund executes the payment obligations if the borrower defaults and the lender consequently
demands payment from the Fund. In the event that a guarantee is called, the Fund has the contractual right to require
payment from the member country that has provided the counter guarantee to the Fund.

Guarantee fee income received is deferred and amortized over the life of the guarantee.

Partial Credit Guarantee
The Fund also provides further credit instrument in the form of Partial Credit Guarantee (PCGs) — a risk mitigation instrument
designed to better leverage resources by crowding in private capital.

The PCGs product serves to partially guarantee debt service obligations and will help to: (i) extend debt maturities; (ii) improve
access to capital markets for public sector investment projects, especially in infrastructure; (iii) reduce effective borrowing
costs; (iv) support mobilization of long-term resources from international and domestic capital markets; and (v) support
sovereign mobilization of commercial financing for policy or sectoral reforms.

Guarantee fee income received under the PCGs is deferred and amortized over the life of the guarantee.

Grants

n addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth
replenishment of the resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect
from the ninth replenishment, grants may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans,
represent allocations of development resources and are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development
Resources of the Fund.

HIPC Debt Initiative

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily
indebted poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt
burdens. Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust
Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries
reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

 

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the
beneficiary country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written
down to their estimated net present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual
difference between the cash received and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as
it falls due with funds received from the Trust Fund.

229Chapter 6 African Development Fund

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are canceled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC
framework. The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans canceled under MDRI by additional contributions to be
made by donors over the previously scheduled repayment periods of the canceled loans. When MDRI becomes effective
for a country, certain amounts previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and
effectively take on the character of grants made by the Fund. Accordingly, loans canceled under the MDRI are included in
“Net Debt Relief’ and reported in the Statement of Net Development Resources as allocation of development resources,
with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets included in its Net Development Resources is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired
and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events
hat occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the
estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

ff the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on its receivable or
reasury investments held at amortized cost (described in prior years as held to maturity investment), the amount of the loss
is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment
calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a treasury investment at amortized cost has a variable interest rate, the discount
rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Loans are not included in Net Development Resources and are therefore not subject to impairment.

Fair Value Disclosure

The fair values of quoted financial assets in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are
based on current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets, the Fund establishes fair value by using
valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s
length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used
by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using
methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the
values actually realizable in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

230Chapter 6

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available, using the bid prices. If
quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. Government
and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally
guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For assetbacked securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time
deposits, certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally
guaranteed by banks and other financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when
possible or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Fund also uses valuation
tools based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The
models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial
models used for valuing the Fund's financial instruments are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Events After the Reporting Period

The financial statements are adjusted to reflect events that occurred between the date of the Statement of Net Development
Resources and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue, provided they give evidence of conditions
that existed at the date of the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Events that are indicative of conditions that arose after the date of the Statement of Net Development resources are disclosed,
but do not result in an adjustment of the financial statements themselves.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect the prior year’s reported result.

Note € — Risk management policies and procedures

In carrying out its development mandate, the Fund seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from
its lending and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty
risk, and operational risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Fund is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its commitment capacity.
The Fund's overall risk management strategy is to minimize the exposure of its replenishment resources (the Commitment
Capacity) to the risk of over-commitment and also to protect its Net Development Resources from currency translation
losses that could negatively affect the Fund’s long-term capacity to meet its development needs.

The policies, processes and procedures which the Fund uses to manage its risk profile continually evolve in response to

market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Fund’s
Board of Executive Directors, which is chaired by the President. The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards

231Chapter 6 African Development Fund

of corporate governance. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Board of Directors regularly reviews
trends in the Fund's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Fund manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on
Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority) approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage
the Fund’s liquid assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for
managing the Fund's interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational
risk. The ALM Authority covers the Fund’s entire array of ALM activities.

Under the umbrella of the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational
guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). The
ALCO, chaired by the Vice President for Finance, is the oversight and control organ of the Fund’s finance and treasury risk
management activities.

The ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. The ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
hat report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial
products and services. In June 2012 the Bank Group also created the Credit Risk Committee (CRC), to ensure effective
implementation of the Fund’s credit policies and oversee all credit risk issues related to loan operations.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Fund’s financial and risk management policies and guidelines
are delegated to the appropriate business units. The Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the
day-to-day compliance with those policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk arises from the inability or unwillingness of counterparties to discharge their financial obligations. It is the potential
inancial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund arising
essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Fund's credit risk arises from two principal sources: (i) sovereign credit risk arising from lending to its qualifying RMCs
and (ii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions.

Sovereign Credit Risk

The Fund provides concessional loans in order to fund economic and social development of its member countries which
generally have a lower credit quality than ADB borrowers. Although loans are included in the financial statements as resources
already allocated for development and therefore not included in the Net Development Resources, the Fund still manages
sovereign credit risks to ensure equitable allocation of resources to eligible beneficiaries and ensure that expected reflows
rom loan repayments are properly monitored and managed. Country eligibility for loans is determined by assessing among
other things, gross national income per capita, credit worthiness and performance. The Fund uses the International Monetary
Fund/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-Income Countries, to make performance-based allocation
(PBA) of ADF resources among the many competing needs in the continent and to ensure the funds are directed to areas
hey will be used most effectively. The PBA process, which is reviewed regularly, is also used to determine the proportion
of ADF resources that is allocated in the form of grants to each qualifying borrower. On the basis of the debt sustainability
analysis, certain countries are allocated grants-only resources, while others may receive a combination of loan and grant
resources or loan resources only.

233Chapter 6 African Development Fund

In the normal course of business, the Fund utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage
its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to
disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction
may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund. Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely
eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes this risk by executing transactions within a prudential
framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty
credit risk mitigation measures.

Counterparties must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank Group’s Vice
President for Finance. The ALCO approves counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings
are closely monitored by the Financial Management Department.

For trading counterparties, the Fund requires a minimum short-term credit rating of A-2/P-2/F-2 for trades settled under
delivery vs. payment (DVP) terms and a minimum long-term credit rating of A/A2 for non-DVP-based transactions.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks A/VA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions AVA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA
Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral

MBS/ABS originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS.

Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition
shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund uses derivatives in the management of its assets and liabilities. As a rule, the Fund executes an ISDA master
agreement and collateral exchange agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions. Derivative
counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A-/A3 for counterparties with
whom the Fund has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. These counterparties require the approval of the ALCO.
Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a stipulated maximum for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty
credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future
exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

234Chapter 6

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. The Fund’s
principal liquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow
needs for between 50 and 75 percent of the three years’ moving average of expected disbursements.

To strike a balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash if
the need arises, the Fund divides its investment portfolio into two tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks.
The Fund's core liquidity portfolio, which is fair valued, is invested in highly liquid securities that can be readily liquidated
if the need arises to meet the Fund's short-term liquidity needs. In addition to the trading portfolio, the Fund maintains a
second tranche of liquidity under the broad category of amortized cost portfolio, which is held in a portfolio of fixed income
securities intended to earn contractual cash flows.

Currency Exchange Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in
the Fund’s Net Assets, including its Net Development Resources (NDR) and outstanding loans, the Fund’s principal currency
risk management objective is to ensure that it is able to provide the disbursement currencies requested by borrowers while
minimizing the exposure of its net development resources to adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent possible, the
Fund shall maintain the alignment of the currency composition of its Net Assets with the UA as the primary benchmark of
its currency composition. The Fund may conduct currency exchange transactions for the following two reasons: (1) to align
the currency composition of its Net Assets (loan and investment portfolios) with the UA, (2) for the purpose of providing ADF
borrowers with the disbursement currencies requested.

nterest Rate Risk

nterest rate risk is the potential for loss due to adverse movements in market interest rates. In seeking to earn a stable and
reasonable return on invested liquidity, the Fund’s principal interest rate risk management is to reduce the sensitivity of the
Fund’s investment returns to changes in market interest rates. To achieve this objective, the Fund’s investments are managed
in two portfolios: (1) an actively managed portfolio (the “Operational” Portfolio); and (2) a passively managed portfolio (the
“Investment” Portfolio).

The Operational Portfolio provides a readily available source of liquidity to cover both expected and unexpected disbursements
as well as any other probable cash outflows. The Operational Portfolio is managed against a 3-month LIBOR reference
benchmark in each currency. Generally, investments in the Operational Portfolio are held for trading and are regularly marked
‘o market.

The Investment Portfolio consists of funds that are not immediately required for loan disbursements and therefore may be
invested for a longer horizon. Generally, investments in the Investment Portfolio are purchased with the intention to hold
hem until their maturity and are not marked to market. The Investment Portfolio comprises two sub-portfolios, (1) an
investment portfolio for income stabilization for the purpose of generating a stable income for the Fund and reducing the
Fund’s investment income sensitivity to interest rates. This portfolio is managed against a ten-year uniform repricing profile for
each invested currency, and (2) an investment portfolio for accelerated encashments for the purpose of investing proceeds
from accelerated encashments to recoup the discount granted to State Participants, minimizing or eliminating interest rate
risk on accelerated encashments. This portfolio is managed against a target rate, which is the discount rate agreed with
State Participants.

Futures Contracts

The Fund has also entered into futures contracts to hedge fixed interest rate bonds against interest rate variations. As at
31 December 2015, the Fund had 2,505 contracts in Euro, 2,941 contracts in Pound sterling and 3,056 contracts in US
dollars. The nominal value of each contract is one million of each currency unit, except for 2,941 GBP contracts with a
nominal value of 500,000 for each contract.

Note E — Demand obligations

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement,
in the form of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors
has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

Note F — Development activities
According to the Fund’s loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing
from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent
per annum and from years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per
annum on the principal amount disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of
credit approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such
commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement. With effect
from the ADF-12 replenishment, loans to blend, gap and graduating countries carry differentiated financing terms of thirty
(30) years’ maturity, grace period of 8 years and interest rate of 1 percent, in addition to the existing standard 0.50 percent
commitment fee and 0.75 percent service charge. Under ADF-18, further differentiated lending terms were adopted with
the view of preserving the long-term financial sustainability and capacity of the Fund. The new lending terms require the
acceleration of loan repayment by regular and advanced ADF-only countries, and also to blend, gap and graduating countries;
and the granting of financial incentives for voluntary loan repayment.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a
period of 10 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to
borrowers or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at 31 December
2015, outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 12.91 million (2014: UA
6.44 million).

The Fund also provides innovative financial instruments in the form of Partial Reimbursement Guarantees (PRGs) and, Partial
Credit Guarantee (PCG) for the purpose of better leveraging resources by crowding in ADB and commercial sources of
financing.

The PRGs’ product provides guarantees to private entities for development exposures on projects located in Regional Member
Countries. Such guarantees represent potential risk to the Fund if amounts guaranteed for an entity are not reimbursed. As
at 31 December 2015, guarantees provided by the Fund to private entities on account of its borrowers amounted to UA
145.75 million (2014: UA 145.75 million).

239Chapter 6 African Development Fund

The PCGs’ product serves to partially guarantee the debt service obligations of Regional Member Countries, which include
extension of debt maturities, the improvement of access to domestic and foreign capital markets, and the reduction of
borrowing costs. As at 31 December 2015, no PCGs have been provided.

In 2014,the Fund allocated a grant of UA 165 million for the establishment of the Private Sector Enhancement Facility (the PSF)
to encourage increased development financing in the ADF countries. The PSF provides credit enhancement guarantees to
the ADB on certain eligible loans to the private sector in ADF countries. The PSF is operationally and financially autonomous
from the Fund and its statutory framework explicitly precludes it from having recourse to the Fund for any losses that it
may incur. As at 31 December 2015, credit enhancement approvals of UA 56.50 million had been made.

As at 31 December 2015, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding
of UA 273.79 million (2014: UA 272.59 million), of which UA 118.64 million (2014: UA 110.05 million) was overdue, were in
non-accrual status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended 31 December
2015, would have been higher by UA 2.05 million (2014: UA 2.06 million). At 31 December 2015, the cumulative charges not
recognized on the non-accrual loans amounted to UA 42.64 million, compared to UA 40.42 million at 31 December 2014.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum
of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

At 31 December 2015, outstanding loans amounted to UA 9,802.67 million (2014: UA 8,965.21 million).

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10
percent under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.5 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments
were allocated as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects
or programs in specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under
the ninth replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project
financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share of grants under the tenth, eleventh and twelfth general replenishments is
based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh, eighth and ninth general replenishments,
technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace
period, from the date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not
feasible, the grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) | where the loan is granted for strengthening Regional Member Countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the
operations of existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with
a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price
equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following
the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present
value. The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans,
was shown as an allocation of development resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million, which was the write-down in respect
of the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework, is included in the amount stated as
net debt relief in the Statement of Net Development Resources. The outstanding balance and net present value of the loans
owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

241Chapter 6 African Development Fund

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved
by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the
original framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered
through annual debt service reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as
they come due until the total net present value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is
provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points.
Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at 31 December 2015 amounted to UA 184 million and are shown as
allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Multilateral D Relief Initiative
At the Gleneagles Summit on 8 July 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF,
the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the
Development Committee Communiqué of 25 September 2005, the donor community expressed its support for the MDRI,
and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help
38 countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation
is delivered by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows
downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional
contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on 1 September 2006. Since disbursed and outstanding loans are already excluded
from net development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund’s balance of net development
resources. Cancellation of ADF debts are effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At 31 December 2015, a gross amount of UA 5.68 billion (2014: UA 5.53 billion) of outstanding loans had been canceled
under MDRI for 30 (2014: 29) HIPC completion-point countries. Of this amount, UA 1,225.99 million (2014: UA 1,225.99
million) in nominal terms were converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 942.71
million (2014: UA 942.71 million). As of 31 December 2015, the present value amounts have been transferred from the
HIPC Trust Fund to ADF.

A summary of debt relief granted under HIPC and MDRI as at 31 December 2015 and 2014 follows:

Upon implementation of MDRI

 

Arrears Clearance Mechanism for DRC — In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group,
the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on 26 June 2002, approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC.

242Chapter 6

Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies) authorized an allocation
of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-9) to clear the entire
stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the
residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-8 as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears
on charges to the ADB.

Fragile States Facility Framework — The Fragile States Facility (FSF) was established in March 2008 to provide a broader and
integrated framework for assistance to eligible states, typically Regional Member Countries of ADB emerging from conflict
or crisis. The purposes of FSF are to consolidate peace, stabilize economies and lay the foundation for sustainable poverty
reduction and long-term economic growth. The FSF assumes the arrears clearance activities of the now defunct Post Conflict
Countries Facility (PCCF), which was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their
arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities, in order to reactivate development assistance
and help these countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank
Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the
ADF, the ADB and private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine eligible fragile
states not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the country to clear its arrears to the Bank
Group. Contributions made by the Fund to the facility cannot be used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary
fragile states. Contributions by the Fund to the Facility are included in “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the
Statement of Net Development Resources.

Note G — Subscriptions and contributions

The Fund’s initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states
acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants
in the form of a special general increase and twelve general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions and Voting Power in Note M.

The Board of Governors, by its resolution F/BG/2014/01 of 31 January 2014, approved the thirteenth general replenishment
of the Fund (ADF-13), following the Deputies agreement for a replenishment level of UA 5.35 billion, of which UA 0.98 billion
represents internally generated resources, for the three-year operational period, 2014 to 2016. ADF-13 came into effect in
March 2014 after the State Participants had deposited with the Fund, enough instruments of subscriptions and the approval
by the Board of Directors for the use of the internally generated resources for operational commitments. At 31 December
2015, subscriptions to ADF-13 amounted to UA 3.82 billion.

The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was admitted to the ADF on 29 May 2014, becoming the Fund’s 27th State Participant.
As per the Board of Governors’ Resolution F/BG/2009/04, Luxembourg’s initial subscription amount was set to UA 14.51
million. This subscription amount was paid in full on 16 May 2014, and included in the Fund’s resources.

At 31 December 2015, cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 5.68 billion of which
UA 849.25 million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the

contributions paid entitle the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note M.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative
Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

243Chapter 6 African Development Fund

Note H — Other resources

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the
Fund or a member of the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of
the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion, are deemed to have become part of
the permanent patrimony of the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions
are reported as part of other resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 589.99 million, representing contributions by the Bank of UA 587.99 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2 million towards the Fund’s activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

Note | — Reserves

Reserves as at 31 December 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

(UA thousands)
2015 2014
Reserves at 1 January (257,267) (131,915)
Deficit for the year (83,249) (125,352)
Balance at 31 December (340,516) (257,267)

 

Note J — Trust funds

The Fund has available resources entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund to receive other
resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At 31 December 2015, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 5.10 million (2014: UA 4.11 million)
representing the balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.

Note K — Administrative expenses

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter’s
Offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs
and projects executed during the year by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year
amounted to UA 200.93 million (2014: UA 248.57 million).

Note L — Related parties
The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 14-member Board of Directors, of which 7 members are selected by

the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF’s voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President

244Chapter 6

of the Fund. In accordance with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the
ADB (the Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank
administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund also administers trust funds entrusted to it by one of its State Participants.

of the Agreement establishing the Fund, and are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with a recognised
accounting framework, such as, International Financial Reporting Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26(v), 35(1) and
35(3) of the Agreement establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Fund’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other
purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply
with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the special purpose
financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special
purpose financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
presentation of the special purpose financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness
of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement
presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with the accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B to the
special purpose financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.

248Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

THE NIGERIA TRUST FUND

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

NTF Replenishment

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) is a special fund administered
by the Bank. The Fund’s resources primarily consist of
subscriptions by the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The NTF
was established in 1976, for an initial period of thirty (30)
years, when an agreement establishing the NTF was executed
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria, with
a provision for extension by mutual agreement. After two
annual extensions in 2006 and 2007, the operation of the NTF
was extended for ten years with effect from 26 April 2008,
following a positive evaluation of its performance during the
initial 30 years of operation.

Loan Products

NTF provides financing in the form of loans to the least
developed and low-income regional member countries at
concessionary rates in order to enhance economic development
and social progress in Africa. In the past the NTF has provided
concessional financing exclusively to public sector operations.
However, for the extension period to 2018, the Fund’s mandate
has been expanded to cover financial support to private sector
operations as well, including the microfinance subsector.

Investments

The cash and treasury investments of the NTF, all denominated
in US Dollars, armounted to UA 120.27 million at 31 December
2015, compared to UA 123.71 million at the end of 2014.
Investment income for 2015 was UA 0.37 million, representing a
return of 0.29 percent, on an average liquidity level of UA 126.93
million, compared to an income of UA 0.42 million, representing
a return of 0.35 percent on an average liquidity of UA 121.38
million in 2014. The portfolio marginally underperformed its
benchmark in 2015 as the volatility in the global financial
markets created a challenging investment context.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at 31 December
2015, increased by UA 12.03 million to UA 320.46 million
compared to UA 308.43 million at the end of 2014. During 2015,
the new loan approvals amounted to UA 12.50 million compared
with UA 11.49 million in 2014. Table 6.7, below, presents the
evolution of loans approved, loans disbursed and the undisbursed
balances from 2011 to 2015. From the table, the level of loan
approvals continues to show an upward trend since 201 1.

As at 31 December 2015, there were 34 active loans with an
outstanding amount of UA 48.90 million and 49 fully repaid
loans amounting to UA 160.23 million.

Disbe rts

Disbursements increased from UA 3.13 million in 2014 to
UA 7.47 million in 2015. As at 31 December 2015, cumulative
disbursements amounted to UA 248.67 million (2014:
UA 241.20). A total of 70 loans amounting to UA 238.89 million
was fully disbursed as at 31 December 2015, representing
96.07 percent of cumulative disbursements on that date.
Figure 6.4 shows the evolution of loan disbursements and
repayments over the past five years.

 

Repayments

Principal loan repayments amounted to UA 5.09 million in
2015 compared to UA 6.81 million in 2014, representing a
decrease of 25.26 percent over the previous year. Cumulative
repayments as of December 2015 stood at UA 190.66 million
compared to UA 177.34 million at the end of 2014.

 

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The NTF, like the Bank, seeks to reduce its exposure to
risks that are not essential to its core business of providing
development-related assistance, such as liquidity, currency
and interest rate risks. The Fund follows stringent risk
management procedures in managing these risks. Note D
to the Financial Statements of the Fund provides the details of
the risk management policies and practices employed by NTF.

250FINANCIAL RESULTS

The highlights of the Nigeria Trust Fund’s financial performance
in 2015 include the following:

NTF’s income before distributions approved by the Board
of Governors decreased by UA 0.10 million from UA 1.49
million in 2014 to UA 1.39 million in 2015, mainly due to a
decrease in investment income owing to low interest rates.

Administrative expenses representing the NTF’s share of
the total shareable expenses of the ADB Group, decreased
by UA 0.01 million from UA 0.37 million in 2015 to UA 0.36
million in 2014. As noted earlier, the NTF’s share of the
total shareable expenses of the ADB Group is based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven by
the relative levels of certain operational volume indicators
and relative balance sheet-size. However, the NTF’s share
of the total administrative expenses is capped at no more
than 20 percent of its gross income in any year.

The NTF’s reserves net of cumulative currency translation
adjustments increased from UA 39.69 million at the end of
2014 to UA 41.29 million on 31 December 2015, a 4.03
percent increase.

259Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2015

Note A — Nature of operations

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on 26 February 1976 (the Agreement)
between the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development
Bank, headquartered in Abidjan, Cote d’lvoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria.
The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB Regional Member Countries. The Agreement
stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such
sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement
expired on 26 April 2006 and was extended twice for one-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent
review of the operation of the Fund. Following the successful completion of the independent review, the Agreement has
been extended for a period of ten years starting from 26 April 2008.

Note B — Summary of significant accounting policies

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under
he historical cost convention except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Fund are summarized below:
Revenue Recognition

Interest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and
held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected
ife of the financial asset to the asset’s net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued for unutilized loan facilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments measured at fair value
hrough profit or loss.

 

Functional and Presentation Currencies
The Fund conducts its operations in United States Dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the United States
Dollars (USD). In accordance with Article VIl, section 7.3, of the Agreement establishing the Fund, the financial statements

are presented in Units of Account (UA).

 

The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (bb) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.
At 31 December 2015, 1 UA was equivalent to 1.38573 United States dollars (2014: 1.44881 USD).

 

Currency Translat
Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
are translated from USD to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves
under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in

260Chapter 6

equity. Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains
and losses on conversion of currencies into UA are included in the determination of net income.

ci 4
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

In accordance with IFRS 9, the Fund classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at amortized
cost; and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These classifications are determined based on the Fund’s
business model. In accordance with the Fund’s business model, financial assets are held either for the stabilization of income
through the management of net interest margin or for liquidity management. Management determines the classification of
its financial assets at initial recognition.

   

j ial Assets at Amortized Cost

A financial asset is classified as ‘amortized cost’ only if the asset meets the objective of the Fund’s business model to hold
the asset to collect the contractual cash flows; and the contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. The nature of any derivatives embedded in financial
assets are considered in determining whether the cash flows of the investment are solely payment of principal and interest
on the principal outstanding and are not accounted for separately.

D Fi

If either of the two criteria above is not met, the financial asset is classified as at fair value through profit or loss.

Financial assets at amortized cost include loans and receivables on amounts advanced to borrowers and certain investments
that meet the criteria of financial assets at amortized cost. Loans and receivables comprise demand obligations, accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts receivable. Loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the
Fund provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables
are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

Loan origination fees are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment of yield. Incremental direct
costs associated with originating loans are expensed as incurred as such amounts are considered insignificant.

Investments classified as financial assets at amortized cost include investments that are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities. These investments are carried and subsequently measured at amortized
cost using the effective interest method.

  

i) Fi | Assets at Fair Value throug TPL)

Financial assets that do not meet the amortized cost criteria as described above are measured at FVTPL. This category
includes all treasury assets held for resale to realize short-term fair value changes. Gains and losses on these financial assets
are reported in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss.

| /
rLoss (F

    

|

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments
that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a
time to maturity upon acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the Fund commits to purchase
or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

261Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Fund has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

2) Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are
derecognized upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets

The Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial
assets is impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only
if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the
asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset
or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or
held-to-maturity investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the
asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not
been incurred), discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise
rom delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best
estimate of the effect of such delays.

The impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account
and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or other investment held at amortized cost has a variable interest rate,
he discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

nterest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable
right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the
lability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

n liquid or active markets, the most reliable indicators of fair value are quoted market prices. A financial instrument is
regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry
group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions
on an arm’s length basis. If the above criteria are not met, the market is regarded as being inactive. Indications that a
market might be inactive include when there is a wide bid-offer spread or significant increase in the bid-offer spread or
there are few or no recent transactions observed in the market. When markets become illiquid or less active, market
quotations may not represent the prices at which orderly transactions would take place between willing buyers and sellers
and therefore may require adjustment in the valuation process. Consequently, in an inactive market, price quotations are
not necessarily determinative of fair values. Considerable judgment is required to distinguish between active and inactive
markets.

 

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices, while those of liabilities are based on
current asking prices. For financial instruments with inactive markets or unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by
using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These include the use of recent arm’s
length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used

262Chapter 6

by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using
methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the
values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The following three hierarchical levels are used for the determination of fair value:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging).

Level 2: Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or other valuation techniques for which all significant
inputs are based on observable market data.

Level 3: Valuation techniques for which any significant input is not based on observable market data.
The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in measuring the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market
prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans
reported in these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the expected cash flows of its loans. The
fair valuation of loans has been determined using a discounted cash flow model based on year-end market lending rates in
USD, including impairment percentages when applicable.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current
year net income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

n the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent
iabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based
on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
he circumstances.

The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines
that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group
of financial assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment.

 

Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not
included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment
losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred

263Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future
cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s
carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been
incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized
in the income statement.

ii) Fair Values of Financial Instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is measured by using valuation techniques. Where
valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to measure fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by
qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs
reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however,
areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates.
Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform to the presentation in the current year. These
reclassifications did not affect prior year’s reported result.

Note € — The effect of new and revised international financial
reporting standards

Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Issued but not yet effective

At the date of issue of these financial statements, various International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the IASB
were not yet effective for application and had not been applied in preparing these financial statements. The new standards
which are expected to be relevant to the Fund are discussed briefly below:

IFRS 15: Revenues from Contracts with Customers

IFRS 15 was issued in May 2014, and applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. It specifies how
and when entities should recognize revenue from contracts with customers as well as the required disclosures in the financial
statements. The standard provides a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.

The Fund has determined that the standard is not applicable to its operations as its contracts with customers are accounted
for under IFRS 9.

IFRS 9: Financial Instruments

The Fund has already adopted phase 1 of the IFRS 9 with effect from 1 January 2011. Phase 2, which is the final version of
IFRS 9 was issued on 24 July 2014, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The revisions
in the final phase of this standard introduce a third classification and measurement category for financial assets, namely,
fair value through OCI, some revisions to hedge accounting and replacement of the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with the
expected credit loss impairment model. The final standard also includes the guidance for financial liabilities, as previously
issued to the effect that there is no subsequent recycling of realized gains or losses on “own credit” from OC! to profit and loss.

264Chapter 6

Although preliminary indications are that the Fund will be affected by the new standard, the Fund is still assessing the full
impact of this new pronouncement on its financial position and performance.

Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012 - 2014 Cycle
In September 2014, the IASB issued Annual Improvements to IFRS 2012-2014 Cycle. This comprises amendments that
result in accounting changes for presentation, recognition or measurement purposes as well as terminology or editorial
amendments related to a variety of individual IFRS standards. These changes are effective for reporting periods beginning
on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted.

The Fund is currently assessing the impact of the amendments on its financial statements.

Amendments to IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements

In December 2014, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1, as part of an initiative to improve presentation and disclosure
in financial reports, to further encourage reporting entities to apply professional judgement in determining what information
to disclose in their financial statements and in determining where and in what order information is presented in the financial
disclosures. The Amendments have a mandatory effective date of 1 January 2016, with earlier adoption permitted.

The Fund expects that the adoption of these amendments will not have material impact on its Financial Statements.

IFRS 16: Leases

On 13 January 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, “Leases”, which replaces the current guidance on lease accounting
in IAS 17. IFRS 16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier application
permitted. The new standard requires far-reaching changes in accounting by lessees in particular. Under IAS 17, lessees
were required to make a distinction between a finance lease (on balance sheet) and an operating lease (off balance sheet).
IFRS 16 now requires lessees to recognize a lease liability reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right-of-use asset’ for
virtually all lease contracts. The IASB has included an optional exemption for certain short-term leases and leases of lowvalue assets; however, this exemption can only be applied by lessees.

Preliminary indications are that the new standard will affect the Fund. However, the full impact on the financial position and
performance is still being assessed.

IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows (Amendments)

On 29 January 2016, the IASB published some revisions to IAS 7, “Statement of Cash Flows”, aimed at improving the
effectiveness of disclosures in financial reports. These amendments, which are effective from 1 January 2017, require entities
to provide information about changes in their financing liabilities. The amendments are a response to users’ demand for
information that helps them better understand and evaluate changes in liabilities arising from an entity's financing activities,
including changes from cash flows and non-cash changes (such as foreign exchange gains or losses).

Although the Fund is yet to assess the potential impact of adopting this standard, its application is not expected to have
an impact on the financial position of the Fund as the new requirements merely involve additional disclosures rather than a

change in measurement basis.

Based on the foregoing no new or revised financial reporting standard, applicable to the Fund, became effective in 2015.

265Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Note D — Risk management policies and procedures

As described in Note A, the Bank manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. In the course
of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management policies designed to protect the resources of the
Fund through the Bank’s General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (“the ALM Authority”). The ALM Authority sets
out the guiding principles for managing the Fund’s risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty
credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines
as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank’s
most senior management forum on finance and financial risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for
Finance of the Bank.

The ALCO meet on regular basis to perform its oversight roles. Among its functions, the ALCO reviews regular and ad-hoc
inance and treasury risk management reports and projections and approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet. ALCO
is supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues including interest rate risk, currency risk and
inancial projections.

n late 2013, a Group Chief Risk Officer position was created reporting directly to the President of the Bank.
Day-to-day operational responsibilities for implementing the Bank’s risk management policies and guidelines are delegated

© the relevant business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day
compliance with those policies and guidelines.

 

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of
risk for the Fund arising from its lending and treasury operations essentially and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending
operations, and counterparty credit risk.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
borrowing member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential
losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. Country credit risk is managed
through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness
assessment. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects.

267Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

As at 31 December 2015, all the Fund’s loans were made only to public sector borrowers, and such loans generally carry
full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macro-economic
performance, debt sustainability, socio-political factors, business environment, and portfolio performance. These five risk indices
are combined to derive a composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These
country risk ratings are validated against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized
international bodies. The Credit Risk Committee reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with
country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to
that country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor
will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on
all loans to or guaranteed by that borrower country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

 

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. Various financial
instruments are used to manage the Fund’s exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest
its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the
counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation to the Fund.

268Chapter 6

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, this risk
is minimized by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating
standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties for treasury assets
must meet the Fund’s minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank’s Vice President for Finance. For
counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating requirements, approval by the ALCO is required.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

Government A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Government agencies and supranationals AVA2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Banks A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa
Corporations including non-bank financial institutions A/A2 AA-/Aa3 AAA/Aaa

AAA
Maximum legal maturity of 50 years for ABS/MBS with the underlying collateral

MBS/ABS originated in the UK and 40-year maximum legal maturity for all other eligible ABS/MBS.

Also, the maximum weighted average life for all ABS/MBS at the time of acquisition
shall not exceed 5 years.

The Fund invests in money market mutual funds with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the
counterparty credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Fund’s total liquidity for any single counterparty.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the
benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues
to be predominantly in the AA- or higher-rated class:

2012 63% 19% 18%
2011 50% 23% 27%
2010 48% 40% 12%

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In
order to mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its
disbursement obligations.

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency
risk by holding all of its investments and loans in US dollars, the currency in which the Fund’s resources are denominated.

269Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have
fixed interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of 3-month LIBOR in order to manage prudently
the available resources. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund’s equity resources, and is

accordingly not hedged.

At December 2015, the Fund had UA 71.79 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2014: UA 67.23
million). The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2 to 4 percent per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at 31 December 2015 and 2014 were as follows:

270Chapter 6

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the
Fund’s assets are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have
an impact of approximately 40 percent on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading portfolio. The table below shows the

Note G — Loans

Loans originated prior to 22 September 20038, carry an interest rate of 4 percent on the outstanding balance. With effect
from 22 September 2003, pursuant to the Board of Governors’ resolution B/BG/2003/11 of 3 June 2003 and the protocol
agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, dated 22 September 2003, the interest rate on loans was
changed from a flat 4 percent per annum to a range of 2 percent to 4 percent (inclusive) per annum on the outstanding
balance and future undisbursed loans. Furthermore, a 0.75 percent commission is payable on undisbursed balances
commencing 120 days after the signature of the loan. Loans approved prior to the extension of the Agreement are granted
for a maximum period of twenty-five years including grace periods of up to five years.

Following the extension of the Agreement in April 2008, the terms of the NTF loans were further modified in line with the
erms of financing in the operational guidelines of the Fund, approved pursuant to the Board of Directors’ resolution ADB/
BD/ WP/2008/196 of 2 December 2008 which stipulates that the resources of the Fund will henceforth be deployed in
accordance with the following three options:

Financial terms for the first option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a
20-year repayment period with a 7-year grace period.

Financial terms for the second option include: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum on outstanding balances; (iii) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a
15-year repayment period with a 5-year grace period.

Financial terms for the third option would be the same terms as for the ADB private sector financing, taking into consideration
he risk analysis of the project.

For all the above-mentioned options, the grace period starts from the date of signing of the financing agreement or at a date
agreed amongst co-financiers, in the case of co-financed projects.

For private sector operations, a commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum on undisbursed balances will be charged from
120 days after the signing of the loan agreement.

 

The NTF shall provide financing to suit the needs of its borrowers.

273Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

In order to promote broader coverage of the NTF resources, utilization will be subject to a ceiling for each operation. For
both public and private sector operations, a ceiling of USD 10 million per project will apply. Project proposals of more than
USD 10 million may be considered if there is strong justification. This will be subject to review as appropriate depending on
the recommendations of the mid-term reviews of the NTF.

The Fund's loan regulations require that loans be expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed. At 31 December
2015, all loans disbursed were repayable in United States dollars.

The contractual maturity structure of outstanding loans as at 31 December 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

Equity is composed of Fund capital and reserves (retained earnings and cumulative currency translation adjustments). These
are further detailed as follows:

The initial capital of the Fund was Naira 50 million which was payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in
freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to USD 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on 14 July
1976, and the second installment, equivalent to USD 39.61 million, was received on 1 February 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 million. The first
installment of Naira 35 million, equivalent to USD 52.29 million, was received on 7 October 1981. The second installment
of Naira 8 million, equivalent to USD 10.87 million, was received on 4 May 1984. The third installment of Naira 7 million,
equivalent to USD 7.38 million, was received on 13 September 1985.

275Chapter 6 Nigeria Trust Fund

Note L — Segment reporting

The objective of the Fund is to provide loan funds to the poorer ADB regional member countries for development purposes.
The Fund’s products and services are similar and are structured and distributed in a fairly uniform manner across borrowers.
Management has concluded that the Fund has only one reportable segment in accordance with IFRS 8.

The main products and services from which the Fund derives its revenue are mainly loans to ADB regional member countries
and treasury investments.

External revenue for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 is detailed as follows:

 

(UA thousands)
2015 2014
Interest income and charges on loans with sovereign guarantee 1,457 1,447
Treasury investment income 365 A417
Total external revenue 1,822 1,864

The Fund's development activities are divided into five sub-regions of the continent of Africa for internal management purposes,
namely: Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Western Africa. Treasury investment activities
are carried out mainly outside of the continent of Africa, and are therefore not included in the table below. In presenting
information on the basis of the above geographical areas, revenue is based on the location of customers. The Fund uses
ADB's offices, staff, organization, services and facilities and therefore has no fixed assets of its own.

Geographical information about income from loans for the year ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 is detailed as follows:

 

 

 

(UA thousands)

2014
Income from Loans S 311 143 332 661 - 1,447

There were no revenues deriving from transactions with a single external customer that amounted to 10 percent or more of
the Fund's revenues for the year ended 31 December 2015.

Note M — Approval of financial statements

On 30 March 2016, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of

Governors. The financial statements are expected to be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development
Bank at its annual meeting in May 2016.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

Year ended 31 December 2015

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund) which comprise the
balance sheet as at 31 December 2015 and the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, the
statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out in notes A to M.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, for
the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors of the African
Development Bank, as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund. This report is made solely
to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the
Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we
do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making
accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit
in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we
consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as
at 31 December 2015, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards.

300Annex V
The African Development Bank Group

The African Development Bank (ADB). Resources for this
facility are generally raised from the capital market for onward
lending on non-concessional terms to the Bank’s Regional
Member Countries (RMCs). The ADB window is also used
to support private sector projects in all the RMCs through
direct loans, lines of credit, trade finance facilities, equity and
quasi-equity participations, guarantees to financially sound
and viable private enterprises, and multinational projects that
promote regional integration.

The standard loan product of the ADB has evolved over
time, with terms that are increasingly more responsive to
client needs. The current standard loan product provided
to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed clients is called the
Enhanced Variable Spread Loan (EVSL). The EVSL gives
borrowers a high degree of flexibility to manage interest-rate
risks. For non-sovereign-guaranteed clients, the loan product
offered is the Fixed Spread Loan (FSL).

The lending rate on the EVSL comprises of a floating base
rate (6-month LIBOR for USD and YEN, 6-month EURIBOR
for euro, and 3-month JIBAR for ZAR), a funding margin that
is a function of the Bank’s cost of funding relative to LIBOR,
EURIBOR, or JIBAR computed every six months, and a
contractual spread that has been set at 60 basis points (bps)
since 1 January 2011. At a borrower's request, the EVSL
offers a free option to convert the floating base rate into a
fixed component (amortizing swap rate set at borrower's
request for disbursed loan balances). The repayment period
for sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed loans (SGLs) is up
to 20 years, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

The lending rate on the FSL comprises a floating base rate
as for the EVSL and remains floating until maturity date, or a
fixed base rate plus a risk-based credit spread. Non-sovereignguaranteed loans (NSGLs) have repayment periods of up
to 15 years including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.

In December 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved
the introduction of the Fully Flexible Loan (FFL) to a suite of
products available to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed
borrowers. The FFL embeds risk management features

Annexes

currently offered through the Bank’s Risk Management
Products in SGLs, thereby providing fully customized flexibility
in interest rate and currency conversion to borrowers. It also
has a maturity-based pricing structure that has increased the
maximum tenor, grace period, and average maturity (weighted
average time to repay a loan) of SGLs from the previous 20,
5, and 12.75 years to 25, 8, and 17 years, respectively to
allow borrowers to select loan profiles that match their funding
needs and debt-management capacities.

The lending rate on the FFL is also consistent with that of
the EVSL plus a maturity premium, where applicable. With
maturity-based pricing, loans with average maturity less than
or equal to 12.75 years will not attract a maturity premium.
However, loans with average maturity greater than 12.75 years
but less than or equal to 15 years will attract a 10 bps maturity
premium, while loans with an average maturity greater than
15 years attract a 20 bps maturity premium.

 

The resources from the African Development Fund (ADF)
financing window emanate from contributions and periodic
replenishments by ADF-State Participants, usually on a 3-year
basis. Prior to the current ADF-13 replenishment, the ADF was
operating under differentiated lending terms for ADF-eligible
countries classified as blend, gap, and graduating, versus
ADF-only countries. Accordingly, loans extended to blend,
gap, and graduating countries had a maturity period of 30
years, including a grace period of 8 years with an interest
rate of 1 percent per annum. For ADF-only countries, loans
had a maturity period of 50 years, including a grace period
of 10 years, with no interest rate. The standard commitment
fee of 0.50 percent per annum on undisbursed amounts and
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances were still applicable for all ADF loans.

In order to preserve the long-term financial sustainability
and capacity of the ADF facility, the ADF-13 replenishment
introduced two main accessibility criteria: (i) hardened and
differentiated lending terms, and (ii) two sub-groups of ADFonly countries: the “regular” or the “advance” group. The
financing terms for regular and advance ADF-only countries,
as well as for blend, gap, and graduating countries, wereAnnexes

Annex V — Continued
The African Development Bank Group

hardened. An accelerated repayment clause and a voluntary
prepayment framework were also introduced.

Accordingly, new loans extended under ADF-13 to regular ADF
countries have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period
of 10 years, and loans extended to advance ADF countries
have a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
The standard commitment fee of 0.50 percent per annum on
undisbursed amounts and service charge of 0.75 percent per
annum in outstanding balances remain applicable. Loans to
blend, gap, and graduating countries have a maturity of 30
years including a 5-year grace period, and an interest-rate
charge of 1 percent per annum in addition to the standard
commitment and service fees.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) resources are provided entirely
by the Federal Republic of Nigeria under an Agreement
signed with the Bank in 1976 for an initial period of 30 years.
Following its revision in April 2008, the Agreement provides
that resources from the NTF shall be used in accordance with
the terms of the following three options.

302

e First option: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (ili) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a 20-year repayment
period, including a grace period of 7 years.

Second option: (i) no interest charges on NTF loans; (ii) a
service charge of 0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances; (ili) a commitment fee of 0.5 percent per annum
on undisbursed commitments; and (iv) a 15-year repayment
period including a 5-year grace period.

e

e

Third option: Same terms as for the ADB private sector
loans, taking into consideration provisions of the Guidelines
for the Bank’s private sector financing as well as the risk
analysis of the project.

Loans granted prior to the revision of the Agreement carried
interest at rates ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent, with a
commission of 0.75 percent on undisbursed portions.~~  S@eeeeee io §..

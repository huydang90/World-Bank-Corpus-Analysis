The African Development Bank Group is a regional multilateral development finance institution dedicated to reducing poverty in
its regional member countries by promoting their sustainable economic and social development.
It achieves this objective by mobilizing external and domestic resources to promote investment in its RMCs and by providing
them with technical assistance as well as policy advice.

The African Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development bank
whose shareholders are 53 African countries
(regional member countries—RMCs) and 24
non-African countries from the Americas,
Asia, and Europe (non-regional member
countries—non-RMCs). It was established
in 1964, with its headquarters in Abidjan,
Céte d'Ivoire, and officially began operations
in 1967. However, due to political instability
in Céte d'Ivoire, the Governors’ Consultative
Committee (GCC), at a meeting in February
2003 in Accra, Ghana, decided to move the
Bank to its current temporary location in
Tunis, Tunisia. The Bank has been operating from this Temporary Relocation Agency
since February 2003.

The Bank Group's primary objective is
to promote sustainable economic growth
to reduce poverty in Africa. It achieves
this objective by financing a broad range
of development projects and programs
through (i) public sector loans (including
policy-based loans), private sector loans,
and equity investments; (ii) technical assistance for institutional support projects and
programs; (iii) public and private capital
investment; (iv) assistance in coordinating RMC development policies and plans;
and (v) grants of up to US$500,000 in
emergency support. The Bank prioritizes
national and multinational projects and
programs that promote regional economic
cooperation and integration.

Annual Report 2005

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement) designates the Board of Governors—which
comprises one representative from each
member country—as the institution's
highest policy-making organ. The Board of
Governors issues general directives on Bank
operations and approves amendments to
the Agreement, the admission of new members, and increases to the Bank's capital. The
ADB Board of Governors elects an 18-member Board of Directors to which it delegates
its powers, with the exception of those
expressly reserved to it in the Agreement.
Twelve Directors are elected from RMCs
and six from non-RMCs for a three-year
term, renewable for one term. The Board of
Directors oversees all Bank operations.

The Boards of Governors elect the President
of the Bank Group for a five-year term,
renewable for one term. The President, who
must be from a RMC, chairs the Boards
of Directors, appoints Vice-Presidents—in
consultation with the Boards, and manages the Bank's daily operations.

 

The ADB provides loans to its clients on
non-concessional terms. In October 1997,
it introduced three new loan products to
meet the needs of its clients: a single currency variable rate loan, a single currency
floating rate loan, and a single currency
fixed rate loan. The interest rate for the single currency variable rate loan is based on
the quarter's average cost of all outstand
ing Bank borrowings specifically allocated
to fund these loans. The interest rate for
the floating rate loan is based on the six
month LIBOR in the basket of currencies
offered by the Bank. The rate for fixed-rate
loans is based on the Bank's cost of borrowing to fund them. The repayment terms
for Bank loans are as follows:

e Repayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
five years for public sector loans;

e Repayment period of up to fourteen
years, including a grace period not
exceeding four years for publicly guaranteed lines of credit; and

e Repayment period of five to 15 years,
including a grace period of one to
three years for private sector loans.

The African Development Fund

The ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973
and became operational in 1974. Its main
objective is to reduce poverty in RMCs by
providing low-income RMCs with concessional loans and grants for projects and
programs, and with technical assistance for
studies and capacity-building activities.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Fund (ADF) designates the
Board of Governors as the Fund's high-est policy-making organ. The Board of
Governors meets at least once a year.
The ADF Board of Directors includes six
Executive Directors from non-RMCs—
nominated by their constituencies—and
six Executive Directors representing the
ADB; it oversees the general operations of
the Fund.

The Fund's resources consist of contributions and periodic replenishments by
participants, usually on a three-year basis.
For ADF-X, which covers the 2005-2007
period, ADF Deputies agreed on a replenishment level of UA 3.7 billion.

No interest is charged on ADF loans; however, the loans carry a service charge of
0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50

percent per annum on undisbursed commitments. Project loans have a 50-year
repayment period, including a 10-year
grace period. Lines of credit have a 20-year
repayment period with a five-year grace
period.

The Nigeria Trust Fund

he NTF is a special ADB fund created in
1976 by agreement between the Bank
Group and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. Its objective is to assist
the development efforts of low-income
RMCs whose economic and social condiions and prospects require concessional
inancing. The NTF became operational
in April 1976 following approval of the
Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust
Fund by the Board of Governors. Its initial

 

capital of US$80 million was replenished in
1981 with US$71 million.

In April 2003, the ADB Board of Governors
considered and approved a number of
proposals aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the NTF. These proposals
included (i) adjusting the interest rate
for NTF loans from 4 percent to a 2-4
percent range, to increase concessionality;
(ii) allocating 10 percent of NTF annual
net income as contribution to the HIPC
Trust Fund; (iii) appropriating NTF corpus
resources to finance activities under the
Technical Cooperation Agreement with
the Bank Group to support programs
benefiting its RMCs; and (iv) introducing
more flexibility in the investment of NTF
resources, pending their use in financing
projects.

Message From the President of the African Development Bank Group

and Chairman of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of African Development Bank Group

The year 2005 was a momentous one for
the Bank and for Africa. | was honored to be
elected the 7th President of the Bank Group
to succeed Omar Kabbaj, who left the Bank
after 10 years of meritorious service. | salute
our Governors and our staff for ensuring a
smooth transition.

The year 2005 was also the “Year of Africa”,
during which the international community launched several initiatives to support
Africa's development. It marked the beginning of the utilization of the resources mobilized under ADF-X Replenishment, a total of
UA 3.7 billion (about US$ 5.4 billion) for the
ADF-X period (2005-2007). In July 2005,
the G8 Summit at Gleneagles agreed to
provide 100 percent irrevocable debt stock
cancellation for 39 countries, 33 of which
are in Africa. Key initiatives were also taken
with respect to ODA, trade, infrastructure,
and governance. With a view to ensuring
follow-up, the African Ministers of Finance

 

Annual Report 2005

convened in November 2005 in Tunis to
analyze the implications of these initiatives
and to build support for them.

During the year, the Bank deepened its
partnership with the African Union, NEPAD,
and the ECA, and also held several high
level consultations with a number of key
partners to strengthen collaboration at the
country level.

During 2005 as well, the Bank continued
to strengthen its professional staff—in
line with its strategic orientations—and
to accelerate its decentralization strategy
to establish a network of 25 field offices.
Indeed, all the existing nine Regional and
Country offices were operational in 2005,
and four additional offices were opened in
Madagascar, Mali, Rwanda, and Morocco.

 

On the resource mobilization front, the
Bank Group mobilized external resources
amounting to UA 3.19 billion through
cofinancing operations, thereby raising the
total amount of resources mobilized in
2005 to UA 5.48 billion. It prepared four
key policy documents to guide its activities: (i) ADF-X Financing Policy Guidelines;
(ii) ADF-X Country Resource Allocations
for 2005; (iii) The Enhanced Performancebased Allocation Framework for ADF-X; and
(iv) the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.

The Bank Group continued to participate in
the enhanced HIPC Initiative. At end-2005,
24 of the 33 RMCs classified as HIPCs
were benefiting from debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative. By December
2005, a total of US$ 2.26 billion had been
mobilized to finance interim and completion point debt relief for these eligible
countries and a total of US$ 1.68 billion
had been delivered.

The total amount of loans and grants,
including HIPC debt relief, approved during
the year was UA 2.29 billion, compared with
UA 2.79 billion in 2004. Of this amount,
UA 868.7 million (37.9 percent of total
approvals) was from the ADB window (with
UA 180.1 million for the private sector);
UA 1.42 billion (62 percent total approvals) from the ADF; and UA 3.2 million (0.1
percent of total approvals) from the NTF. The
slight decline in overall Bank Group approvals was due to the significant reduction
in HIPC debt relief. This notwithstanding,
grant approvals increased significantly to UA
420.3 million, a 94 percent increase over
2004 levels, in line with ADF-X guidelines,
while lending approvals rose to UA 1.32 bilion, a 16.9 percent rise over 2004 levels.

am pleased to report that the increase in
Bank operations in 2005 was accompanied
y further steps to increase the quality of
Bank operations and to enhance development effectiveness. The Bank's efforts in
his regard were underpinned by four basic
principles: (i) ensuring country ownership; (ii)
achieving greater selectivity; (iii) participa‘ory approaches; and (iv) working closely
with development partners. | note, in paricular, the adoption of the Annotated Format
of the Results-Based Country Strategy Paper
(RBCSP) and the Bank Group Action Plan on
Harmonization, Alignment and Managing
or Results (HA&MFR), which focuses on
maintaining the core tasks of the internal
review process, launching the first quality-atentry assessment, preparing the quality-ofsupervision assessment, and implementing
the managing for results agenda. These will
further improve the effectiveness of Bank
operations.

 

In 2005, the Bank launched and consolidated a number of initiatives, including theHarmonization, Alignment and Managing
for Results Initiative; the Africa Infrastructure
Consortium; the African Water Facility; the
Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa;
the Middle Income Countries Initiative; and
the FINESSE Program. The Bank also continued to allocate a significant proportion of
its resources to the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Initiative; and to deepen its support for NEPAD.

On the financial front, the Bank Group
continued to strengthen its financial position. The combined net income for the Bank
Group was UA 251.8 million in 2005, compared with UA 151.1 million in 2004. The
overall financial standing of the Bank continued to strengthen, with the four main
financial rating agencies reaffirming their
AAA and AA+ rating of the Bank's senior
and subordinate debt, respectively, with
a stable outlook. This reflects the Bank's
strong membership support, its preferred
creditor status, sound capital adequacy,
and prudent financial management and
policies.

 

Overall, despite the rise in oil prices and
the severe drought in parts of the continent, the activities of the Bank Group in
2005 took place against a backdrop of
buoyant economic performance, driven
essentially by oil and commodities. As
well, despite the sustained increases in
oil prices in 2005, Africa's average inflation rate remained in the single digits and
other macroeconomic indicators registered positive trends.

While the improvement in the growth performance of the African economy in 2005
is fairly impressive, it falls short of the
7-8 percent real GDP growth rate required
for achieving many of the MDGs. Thus, it
is urgent that African countries scale up
investments and growth in the context of
macroeconomic stability, improved governance and institutions, human capital development, regional integration, and peace
and stability.

The Bank Group has a major role to play in
this historic effort to boost and sustain the

 

continent's shared economic growth. This
in turn requires that the Bank put in place
a strategy to enhance its development
effectiveness.

To this end, the Task Force put in place
in November 2005 has delivered its recommendations to improve our operational

Executive Summary

The year 2005 ushered in a new era for the African Development Bank Group (the Bank Group, the Bank). Indeed, the
year was marked by the departure of Omar Kabbaj, the 6th President of the Bank Group, after 10 years of service, and the
arrival of Donald Kaberuka, the 7th President. This changing of the guard, coupled with the institutional reform process
launched in November 2005, set the stage for far-reaching changes in Bank Group operations, which should enhance the
institution's effectiveness in pursuing its mission within the current economic environment in Africa.

Africa's economic performance
temained buoyant despite the slowdown in economic growth

Africa's Economic Performance

in 2005

Overall, Africa's economic performance
remained buoyant despite the slowdown
in economic growth caused by relatively
weak demand for imports in industrialized
countries, deterioration in the terms of trade
of some oil-importing countries, poor crop
harvests due to locust invasions in the Sahel
region, and droughts in the eastern and
southern regions of the continent.

e slowdown translated into a marginal
decline in the real gross domestic product
(GDP) growth rate (which fell from 5.3
percent in 2004 to 4.9 percent in 2005)
and in the real per capita GDP growth rate
(from 3.0 percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent in
2005). However, the 4.9 percent average
growth in real GDP masks considerable
variations across countries, as there was a
modest increase in the number of countries
(both oil-exporting and oil-importing) that
recorded higher growth rates in 2005—the
third consecutive year in which Africa's real
GDP growth rate exceeded 4.0 percent. Still,
this growth falls short of the 7-8 percent
required by many countries, in particular,
sub-Saharan African countries to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals by 2015.

 

Annual Report 2005

Some African countries, in particular non-oil
exporters, experienced a worsening of their
erms of trade due to high oil prices, however, overall average terms of trade growth
or the continent accelerated to 13.0 percent in 2005, from 3.9 percent in 2004.
his favorable terms of trade development
is partially attributable to the higher world
prices of some non-oil commodities, which
elped offset the terms of trade impact of
oil price increases in oil-importing counties. This development also helped improve
Africa's external position in 2005.

Bank Group Operations

he Bank's new strategic orientations and
priorities continued to guide its operaions and promoting sustainable economic
growth to reduce poverty in RMCs remained
its overarching objective. To achieve this
objective, the Bank continued to mobilize
external and domestic resources for investment in RMCs and to provide technical
assistance and policy advice to RMCs.

 

Policy Approvals

During the year, the Boards of Directors
approved a number of policies and guidelines aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of Bank Group operations. In total,
20 country strategy papers (CSPs) were
issued—most of them for the 2005-2009
timeframe; and 29 policy and programrelated documents, one country dialogue
paper, four HIPC approval documents,

and 17 emergency support cases were
approved.

Operational Activities

The Bank continued to finance development projects and programs—many of
them in collaboration with other multinational institutions or bilateral donors—to
promote sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction. To this end, the Boards
approved loans, grants, public guarantees
for sovereign loans, equity participation,
and HIPC debt relief amounting to UA 2.29
billion for 102 operations in 34 countries.
In approving funds for projects and programs, the Boards also took into account
regional economic cooperation and integration activities, in line with the Bank’s
Action Plan for Infrastructure Development
in RMCs and with its commitment to
promote regional infrastructure under the
NEPAD initiative.

The share of ADB window operations in
2005 was UA 868.7 million (37.9 percent
of total Bank Group approvals), down
44.8 percent from UA 1.52 billion in
2004, but still 16.5 percent above the UA
745.8 million approved in 2003. The private sector window's share rose from UA
164.4 million in 2004 to UA 180.1 million
in 2005, but remained lower than its peak
of UA 205.8 million reached in 2003. The
ADB Special Relief Fund (SRF) allocated
emergency support grants totaling UA 5.7million to 16 countries affected by natural
disasters in 2005, much higher than the
UA 2.8 million approved in 2004. Total
ADF window approvals rose from UA 1.26
billion in 2004 to UA 1.42 billion in 2005,
representing 62 percent of all Bank Group
approvals. Grant approvals also increased
substantially to UA 420.3 million in 2005,
compared with UA 216.7 million in 2004
and UA 174.5 million in 2003. The share
of grants in relation to total approvals
increased from 7.8 percent in 2004 to 18.3
percent in 2005. In contrast, Nigeria Trust
Fund (NTF) operations declined significantly,

— 2004 2005

from UA 22.5 million in 2003 to UA 9.3 million in 2004 and UA 3.2 million in 2005.

Overall, the main financing instrument
during 2005 was project lending, which
accounted for 45.6 percent of total
approvals; this was followed by HIPC debt
relief, 22.2 percent; policy-based lending,
12.0 percent; and grants, 18.3 percent.
Guarantees and equity financing accounted for the remaining 1.8 percent.

Nine sub-Saharan and three North African
RMCs participated in the program.

As its contribution to the activities of
the Joint Africa Institute (JAI), the Bank
Group prepared and implemented five
key courses in 2005, each attended by an
average of 30 participants from RMCs. As
well, in collaboration with its development
partners, the Bank Group organized
several training activities to strengthen
the effectiveness of its operational support
to RMCs. It also continued to support the
activities of the African Capacity Building
Foundation by providing financial support
and participating in the deliberations of its
Executive Board and Board of Governors.

Operational and Development
Effectiveness

During the year, the Bank Group launched
its quality-at-entry assessment (QEA) and
quality-of-supervision assessment (QSA)
programs, signaling the importance it
attaches to quality assurance (QA). It
also prepared frameworks for conducting
QEA/QSA and QA workshops, taking

into account lessons learned from the
experiences of partner institutions. These
quality assessments will complement the
Bank's internal review processes and should
help strengthen portfolio performance and
enhance the development effectiveness of
operations.

Executive Summary

Finally, to help the Bank build on its
achievements, reposition itself to better
fulfill its mandate and meet its strategic
objectives, the President set up a Task
Force on Institutional Reforms (TFIR) in
November 2005. The TFIR was tasked
with finding ways to improve the Bank’s
efficiency and development effectiveness.

Mobilization of Financial Resources
To achieve its strategic objectives, the
Bank continued to mobilize external and
domestic resources for investment in
RMCs. Key activities in this regard included
the preparation of four documents: (i)
ADF-X Financing Policy Guidelines, (ii)
ADF-X Country Resource Allocations for
2005, (iii) The Enhanced Performancebased Allocation Framework for ADF-X,
and (iv) the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI). These documents present the
policies and guidelines which govern the
Bank's resource mobilization activities.

Corporate Management

At December 31, 2005, the Bank's total
regular staff complement was 1,020
(excluding 52 elected officers and staff
attached to the Boards), compared with

The Bank focused on planning and implementing efficiency improvements in benefits administration through process and
information technology changes, slated
to continue in 2006. The improvements
are aimed at achieving cost reductions,
increasing employee productivity, and
improving insights for better strategic
lanning. In addition, in 2005 the Boards
of Directors approved management's proposal for a salary increase to take effect in
january 2006. This adjustment will ensure
hat the Bank's salary structure remains
internationally competitive to attract and
retain high-caliber staff.

he Bank strengthened management and
administration of its Medical Plan during
he year; staff members and their dependents can now use the healthcare system
and the network of direct billing providers

implementing its Staff Retirement Plan
(SRP) reforms adopted in November
2004. It adopted a new investment
olicy for its SRP fund and rebalanced its
ortfolio. In addition, it completed negoiations with the external fund manager
and signed a new investment management agreement. Benefits of the new
agreement include reduced management
ees and a flat fee for the currency-hedging program, which became effective on
anuary 1, 2005. The implementation of
he new guidelines became effective on
September 1, 2005.

Strategic Planning and Budgeting
During 2005, the main strategic planning

 

Annual Report 2005

and budgeting activities undertaken by
the Bank included preparing the Strategic
Plan (2003-2007) implementation
progress report, the 2006 Administrative
and Capital Budgets, and the 2005 Annual
Report of the Bank Group; consulting
with development partners on a Common
Performance Assessment Framework
for MDBs (COMPAS); implementing the
Management for Development Results
(MfDR) and the Results Agenda, and coordinating the Bank's participation in the
enhanced HIPC initiative. Other related
activities included enhanced development
and management of cooperation and
strategic partnership arrangements with
key multilateral, bilateral, and regional
agencies; in-depth analysis of the impact
of the proposed Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) on the ADF; implementation of a pilot corporate Balanced
Scorecard—which is now available to all
potential users, including senior management and Executive Directors.

Information Technology Management
and Communications

During the year, the Bank pursued major
improvements under its Information
Technology and Telecommunications
Modernization Program. Key activities
included capitalizing on the substantial
investment in information technology facilities undertaken in recent years, upgrading satellite communications systems to
provide online access to HQ systems and
video-conferencing capabilities in the network of field offices, and upgrading the
Bank's knowledge management capabilities.

Financial Management

The Bank's General Authority on Asset
and Liability Management (ALM) was
revised in 2005 to consolidate standalone policy documents on market risks
and to bring related policies up to date
with recent market and_ institutional
developments. The revised framework

document is expected to strengthen
Board oversight by facilitating an integrated approach to ALM throughout
the Bank. Following the approval of the
revised ALM Authority, ALM guidelines
for the ADB and the NTF were updated,
in line with the Authority.

The Bank continued to adjust its credit
risk management activities to the growing emphasis on non-sovereign projects
in the Bank's lending operations. It
submitted credit opinions on new commercial projects with innovative structuring features to the Board. The Bank
also continued to focus on improving project quality-at-entry through the
development and implementation of the
Showcase Projects Initiative—aimed
at providing staff with the necessary
tools to perform state-of-the-art project
appraisals—including pertinent risk and
stakeholder analysis. It sought to focus
it's treasury risk management function on strengthening straight-through
processing of treasury transactions and
building decision support tools for performance analysis, risk analysis, and
control of treasury activities.

Internal Audit

In compliance with International Standards
for the Professional Practice of Internal
Auditing, the Bank, through its Internal
Audit Department (AUDT), continued to
provide independent and objective assurance, including advisory and consulting
services, on various Bank Group activities. Operational audits focused on forming an overall opinion on the adequacy
of the control system instituted by the
Bank, borrowers, executing agencies,
and project implementation units, including field verification of projects. In this
regard, during 2005, AUDT undertook
11 audits in selected RMCs as well as 12
assignments and 2 specially requested
audits for the Corporate Management
and Finance Complexes. In view of theBank's strategic orientation of opening
new field offices and endowing them with
increased authority, AUDT sought to provide reasonable assurance that adequate
control mechanisms would be established
and would function effectively as expected. In this light, AUDT audited two field
offices in 2005. During the year, the
Internal Audit Department was renamed
the Office of the Auditor General, effective November 2005.

Budgets for the Year 2006

In December 2005, the Boards approved
an administrative expenses budget of
UA 179.0 million, a capital expenditure
budget of UA 7.5 million, and a contingency budget of UA 1.8 million for 2006.
The ADF Board approved an indicative
administrative budget of UA 132.4 million

for the Fund for the financial year ending
December 31, 2006. The 2006 Budget was
based on a number of decisions taken by
the Boards of Governors and Directors, in
line with the new strategic orientations
and priorities of the Bank. It focused on
strengthening the operational program,
enhancing portfolio management, and
accelerating the decentralization agenda,
as stipulated in SRFID.

Conclusion

During the year, the Bank consolidated its internal organization and lending activities to take into account new
operational modalities. It mobilized funds
through successful conclusion of the ADFX Replenishment for 2005-2007 and
active participation in the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. Total approvals from the ADF

window increased from UA 1.26 billion
in 2004 to UA 1.42 billion in 2005.
Grant approvals increased by 94 percent,
compared with 2004 levels; the trend
was similar in project lending, which
increased by over 14 percent in the same
period. Approvals from the ADB window
increased marginally, while HIPC debt
relief operations decreased significantly.

In summary, 2005 was marked by the
election of a new president and the establishment of the Task Force on Institutional
Reform (TFIR). The TFIR is expected to complete its assignment by March 31, 2006.

and corporate activities of the institution. This Chapter reviews the activities, decisions,
and resolutions of the Boards during 2005.

Boards of Governors

The 2005 Annual Meetings of the Boards of
Governors of the African Development Bank
Group were held in Abuja, Nigeria, on May
18 and 19, 2004. During their meetings,
the Boards of Governors approved the Bank
Group Annual Report and audited financial
statements for the financial year ended
December 31, 2004, and held elections for
a new president for the Bank Group. As in
previous years, the meetings were preceded
by the Annual Meetings Symposium.

The Annual Meetings Symposium

The joint African Development Bank/
Economic Commission for Africa (ADB/ECA)
Symposium was held on May 17, 2005,
at the Sheraton Hotel in Abuja, Nigeria,
on the theme “Capacity Development for
Achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) in Africa". The Symposium
was chaired by the Honorable Trevor A.
Manuel, Governor for South Africa. It
was attended by more than 500 participants, comprising Bank Group Governors
and their delegations, representatives of
international finance institutions, civil society leaders, the private sector, and other
development practitioners (see Box 1.1).

The 2005 Annual Meetings

The 40th Annual Meeting of the African
Development Bank and the 31st Annual
Meeting of the African Development Fund
were jointly held in Abuja, Nigeria, on
May 18 and 19, 2005. The meetings

were presided over by the Honorable
Ngozi Okonjo-lweala, Governor for
Nigeria and Chairperson of the Boards of
Governors. The formal opening ceremony
of the Meetings was held at the Abuja
International Conference Center on May
18, 2005, under the chairmanship of His
Excellency Olusegun Obasanjo, President
of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Some
1,810 participants, comprising Governors,
Alternate Governors, Executive Directors,
delegates, Bank Group staff, observers, and
local participants, attended the Meetings.

In her welcome address, the Honorable
Mrs. Okonjo-lweala thanked the ADB for
according Nigeria the privilege and honor
of hosting the 2005 Annual Meetings for
the third time. She stressed Nigeria's commitment to, and unique relationship with,

the ADB, exemplified by the establishment
of the NTF for the benefit of the most vulnerable countries in Africa. She briefly outlined
Nigeria's ongoing socio-economic reforms
and efforts, aimed at meeting future challenges such as rebuilding good governance
as well as capacity building, and retention.
At the continental level, she stressed the
need for Africa to identify its own problems
and to develop strategies to address them.
She noted that Africa was unlikely to grow
out of poverty if it failed to take into account
the regional dimensions of poverty reduction
and the MDGs. In conclusion, she called on
all African countries, as well as on the Bank
and its development partners to seize the
opportunity offered by the emergence of
new leadership across Africa to strengthen
the Bank and chart a new road for Africa's
socio-economic development. She wished all

Box 1.1: The Joint ADB/ECA Annual Meetings Symposium

His Excellency Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, formally opened the Symposium. In his opening remarks, he described the
MDGs as laudable goals that every responsible government ought to pursue and emphasized the need to mobilize resources, including for capacity building, to
achieve the Goals. Drawing on Nigeria's experience with its homegrown development strategy—the National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(NEEDS)—he observed that the types of capacities developed by a country largely depended on the country’s ownership of its development agenda, and that
building new human capacities was much easier than retraining and retaining existing resources. In this regard, he also noted that, to achieve some of the MDGs,
particularly universal basic education, Nigeria was expanding access to basic education to children from all social classes, improving and rebuilding/rehabilitating
its higher education system, while striving to retain its existing capacities and also attract back talent from the Diaspora.

In his welcome address, the President of the Bank Group, Omar Kabbaj, focused on the capacity constraints faced by African countries in achieving the MDGs and
on the need to address them. He attributed the limited progress of African countries (particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa) towards the MDGs to factors such as
domestic conflicts and civil wars, inadequate economic policies, governance problems, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the lack of resources to finance investments in
key sectors. Mr. Kabbaj concluded his address by underscoring the role and efforts of the ADB in supporting the development efforts of African countries.

In his address, the out-going Executive Secretary of the ECA, Mr. K.Y. Amoako, observed that the Symposium had provided another valuable opportunity for fruitful
dialogue that could inform Africa's quest for actions needed to achieve the MDGs. He identified several reasons for the slow progress of African countries towards
the MDGs: internal conflict, poor governance, poor economic policies, a heavy debt burden, unfair terms of trade, the devastating impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
and lack of human capital and institutional capacity. Mr. Amoako concluded his remarks by calling for the development of a well-funded action plan to directly
address Africa's huge capacity deficits.

The keynote address of the Symposium was delivered by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Rodrigo de Rato, who focused on the
role of the IMF in Africa and on capacity building as an integral part of the IMF's work in Africa. He outlined the key challenges facing the IMF in developing
capacities in Africa and highlighted the IMF's long experience in the areas of policy advice, financial assistance, and capacity building. Mr. De Rato underscored
the IMF's belief that capable and effective institutions are prerequisites for economic and social development, effective public policy making, and true domestic
ownership of economic policies.

The plenary session of the Symposium was chaired by the Honorable Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Minister of Finance and Governor for Nigeria. In her opening remarks,
she described capacity development and capacity gaps in African countries as critical constraints on the achievement of the MDGs and called on all development

stakeholders to include capacity development in their agendas.

Following the keynote address and the plenary session, the Symposium broke up into four panels to examine related themes and ways to facilitate the formulation
and implementation of capacity building strategies for achieving the MDGs. The deliberations reached the following conclusions:

© Building government capacities is critical for achieving all the eight MDGs.
© Countries must develop their legislative, judiciary, and executive capacities.

Leadership and governance remain central to a functioning state and to the attainment of the MDGs; however, they must be underpinned by honesty, legitimacy, respect for citizens, and individual freedom.

The development of capacities to attain sectoral MDGs must reach beyond the goals themselves. Africans must claim ownership and leadership of capacity
building initiatives to enhance, harmonize, and advance partnership towards comprehensive and effective capacity building for Africa, by Africans.

Launching of Bank Group Publications
The 2005 African Economic Outlook was launched during the Symposium. Now in its fifth year, this collaborative work, jointly published by the Bank Group and
the OECD Development Center, presents surveys and analyses of the recent socioeconomic performance of selected African economies and provides information on

socioeconomic progress and short- to medium-term prospects, on a country-by-country basis. The 2004-2005 issue published a detailed review of socioeconomic
trends in 29 countries and a thematic analysis on “Financing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Africa”.

Annual Report 2005participants success in their deliberations.
In his statement, Omar Kabbaj, the outgoing President of the Bank Group,
thanked His Excellency President Obasanjo
and the Government and people of
Nigeria for hosting the Bank Group's
2005 Annual Meetings. He expressed
gratitude to President Obasanjo for his
personal support and for the key role
Nigeria had played in the development
of the Bank.

On the economic front, Mr. Kabbaj
described 2004 as an exceptional year
for Africa because of its overall performance and favorable developments such
as the restoration of peace and the abating of conflicts in several countries. He
underscored, that despite these gains, the
entire continent was still facing challenges
in creating a more favorable environment
for private sector development, improving
infrastructure under the New Partnership
for Africa's Development (NEPAD), promoting higher economic growth rates
necessary to achieve the MDGs, and
combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In
view of these challenges, he called on
Africa's development partners to significantly scale up their official development
assistance (ODA), provide deeper and
larger debt relief, and improve market
access for African exports.

On Bank Group operations and activities in
2004, Mr. Kabbaj highlighted four important initiatives launched by the Bank: the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI), the Post-Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF), a new policy to govern support
for middle-income countries, and the
Bank Group's Private Sector Development
Strategy. He also described the Action
Plan and the Accelerated Decentralization
Program adopted by the Bank to improve
the quality of its operations and expand its
presence in its RMCs, as well as the Bank
Group's full engagement in the harmonization and alignment agenda.

On financial operations, Mr. Kabbaj reported
hat the Bank Group's financial approvals in
2004 were close to US$4.4 billion. Of this
amount, US$2.4 billion was committed by
he ADB, while the balance, US$2.0 billion,
was committed by the ADF and the NTF. In
addition, the Bank had mobilized US$3.0
billion through its co-financing operations,
ringing the total amount of resources
generated for its RMCs to US$7.4 billion.
With respect to ADF-X Replenishment, the
out-going President noted with pleasure
hat, during 2004, the Bank mobilized
new concessionary resources, through ADF
State Participants, amounting to about
US$5.4 billion for the 2005-2007 ADF-X
eriod, a 43-percent increase over ADF-IX
resources.

 

Mr. Kabbaj also informed the assembly
hat his second term would end in a
ew months and thanked all Governors
and government representatives present
‘or having had the opportunity to work
with them. He also expressed the hope
that propitious conditions would soon be
restored in Céte d'Ivoire for the Bank to
return to its headquarters. In conclusion,
he thanked the Government of Tunisia for
facilitating the temporary relocation of the
Bank to Tunis.

 

In his opening statement, His Excellency
President Olusegun Obasanjo welcomed
the delegates to Nigeria and expressed
the hope that they would have fruitful discussions and a memorable stay in Abuja.
He gave a brief historical perspective of
Africa's evolution to date and called for
the formulation of appropriate policies to
address the development challenges facing the continent, particularly in the areas
of intra-African trade, capacity building,
service delivery, and infrastructure. On
behalf of the African Union and of the
Heads of State Implementation Committee
of NEPAD, he thanked Mr. Kabbaj for a job
well done and wished him success in his
future endeavors.

he required double majority from member
states. A new date (July 21-22, 2005),
was set for an extraordinary meeting of
he Boards of Governors at the Temporary
Relocation Agency in Tunis, purposely to
elect a new President for the Bank.

During the meeting held in Tunis on July
21, 2005, Donald Kaberuka, who served as
Rwanda’s Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning from 1997 to 2005, was elected
he new President of the Bank, with an
overall majority of 78.8 percent, for a 5-year
erm, effective September 1, 2005. Since the
establishment of the Bank, Mr. Kaberuka is
he first President of the Bank Group ever
elected with such a majority.

 

The Inauguration of the
President-Elect of the Bank Group
The swearing-in ceremony and inauguration of the president-elect of the Bank
Group took place on Thursday, September
1, 2005, at the Temporary Relocation
Agency in Tunis, Tunisia. The current Chair
of the Board of Governors of the Bank
Group, His Excellency Mr. Seydou Bouda,
Minister of Economy and Development of
Burkina Faso, presided over the ceremony,
which was attended by all members of the
Boards of Directors. Also present were the
Honorable Governors from Tunisia, Céte
d'lvoire, Rwanda, and Morocco, as well
as Mr. Kabbaj, the out-going President of
the Bank.

In his address, Mr. Kabbaj congratulated Mr. Kaberuka on his election as
the new President, highlighting some of
Mr. Kaberuka's achievements during his
tenure as Rwanda’s Minister of Finance

and Economic Planning. He expressed satisfaction at leaving behind an organization that had emerged as Africa's premier
development finance institution and cited
some of the Bank's achievements during his tenure: at the continental level,
Africa was going through one of its most
promising periods in recent history; and
an increasing number of countries were
achieving and sustaining higher economic
growth rates and making efforts to reduce
abject poverty. In concluding his address,
Mr. Kabbaj expressed deep gratitude to all
the Heads of State and Governments of
Bank Group member countries, the Boards
of Governors, Boards of Directors, and
Bank staff for their cooperation during his
term of office.

In his statement, His Excellency Seydou
Bouda, Chairman of the Boards of
Governors, thanked the Government and
people of Tunisia for hosting the temporary
relocation of the Bank and the swearing-in
ceremony of the president. He also paid
tribute to Mr. Kabbaj for his invaluable
service to the continent during his tenure;
stressed the need to eliminate poverty, the
major challenge facing Africa—which was
lagging far behind the rest of the world
with respect to almost all key development indicators and the MDGs; and noted
that because Mr. Kaberuka was assuming
the Presidency of the Bank within this
context of multiple challenges, the Bank's
stakeholders and staff would be watching
with great expectations for him to take the
Bank to greater heights.

 

Mr. Kaberuka took the oath of office as the
7th President of the African Development
Bank Group on September 1, 2005, and
officially assumed office on that date. In
his acceptance speech, he paid tribute to
His Excellency President Zine Al-Abidine
Ben Ali and to the Government and people of Tunisia for the warm welcome
and hospitality extended to the Bank. He
also thanked His Excellency President Paul

Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

Kagame, the Government and people of
Rwanda for the honor and confidence
bestowed on him by giving him the opportunity to serve as Minister of Finance and
Economic planing for eight years. He went
on to express profound gratitude to the
Boards of Governors for the confidence
vested in him by entrusting him with the
management of the Bank; and paid glowing tribute to the out-going President, Mr.
Kabbaj, for his leadership and for bringing
the Bank to the forefront as a solid and
credible institution.

In view of the analyses indicating that,
based on their current efforts many African
countries may not attain most of the MDGs
by 2015, Mr. Kaberuka urged RMCs and
their external partners to strive to achieve
the MDGs. To this end, he promised that,
under his leadership, the Bank and its
partners would spare no effort to translate
into reality the international community's
pledge to support Africa, as stated in the
Blair Commission report and in the decisions of the G-8 Summit.

Mr. Kaberuka applauded the Bank's
strategy of positioning itself as a
results-based organization, getting
closer to its client, and building its
capacity to better understand national and African economic conditions.
He vowed to accelerate the transformation of the ADB into a first-class
knowledge institution on African
economic development issues.

Mr. Kaberuka also refered to the Bank's
40th anniversary celebrations in 2004 and
to the Bank's proud achievements, underscoring the need for the Bank to pause
and reflect with a view to learning from
its mistakes, omissions, or commissions,
and charting its future. He reiterated that
the way forward called for a method to
implement the action plans put in place
under Mr. Kabbaj’s leadership to enhance
the Bank's effectiveness. Mr. Kaberuka

Annual Report 2005Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

applauded the Bank’s strategy of positioning itself as a results-based organization,
getting closer to its client, and building its
capacity to better understand national and
African economic conditions. He vowed to
accelerate the transformation of the ADB
into a first-class knowledge institution on
African economic development issues.

Mr. Kaberuka went on to call on the Bank
and on Africa's development partners to
support efforts underway in several African
countries to create enabling environments
to ensure the success of development
efforts. In this regard, he indicated that
the Bank would find the best way to
respond to the needs and priorities of
middle-income countries still faced with
large-scale pockets of poverty. The Bank
would also intensify its working relationship with the African Union and with the
Economic Commission for Africa by participating in post conflict reconstruction and
providing resources and expertise to help
fragile states kick-start their economies.
In concluding his remarks, Mr. Kaberuka
paid tribute to his six predecessors, wished
Mr. Kabbaj well in his future endeavors,
and thanked the Board of Directors and
Bank staff for their hard work.

Distributed Statements of the
Governors

In their respective distributed statements,
the Governors thanked the Government
and the people of Nigeria for hosting the
Annual Meetings and for the hospitality extended to them and to their respective delegations; they acknowledged with
appreciation the continuing partnership
between the Bank Group and the ECA; and
paid special tribute to Mr. Kabbaj for his
leadership and diligent service to the Bank
during his tenure.

On the economic front, the Governors welcomed the substantial economic progress
achieved in Africa in 2004—teflected in
the 5.3 percent real average GDP growth

Annual Report 2005

rate—and the increased macroeconomic
stability in several RMCs, noting that
sound economic policies, the cessation
of conflicts, political stability, and good
governance were key factors for economic
growth. However, the Governors underscored the need for African countries, particularly those in the sub-Saharan region,
to increase their growth rates to an average of 7-8 percent per year over the next
decade in order to achieve the MDGs
by 2015. They also stressed the need to
address the persistent high incidence of
poverty in the region; and welcomed the
emerging global partnership for development under the NEPAD framework, as well
as the Bank’s involvement in, and commitment to, NEPAD activities.

The Governors acknowledged the
Bank's continued impressive financial
performance over the past 5 years,
which had established the Bank as a
strong regional development finance
institution.

The Governors expressed support for the
initiatives launched by the Bank Group and
urged the Bank to accelerate its decentralization program with proper delegation of
authority to country and regional offices so
as to ensure efficient project implementation, development effectiveness, and policy
dialogue between the Bank Group and
RMCs. They expressed satisfaction at the
Bank's continued focus on regional initiatives such as the NEPAD and the African
Water Facility (AWF), noting the Bank's
crucial role in the implementation of the
NEPAD initiative, particularly in the areas
of infrastructure, financial sector development, governance, and the African Peer
Review Mechanism (APRM); and applauded the Bank's commitment to pursue harmonization efforts and better align its
Results-Based CSPs with country-owned
development strategies and PRSPs. They
reiterated that, as the premier develop
ment finance institution in Africa, the Bank
had to play an important role in addressing
the critical socioeconomic and development challenges facing the continent.

The Governors acknowledged the Bank's
continued impressive financial performance
over the past five years, which had established the Bank as a strong regional development finance institution. They urged the
Bank to pursue its prudent financial and
risk management policies in order to safeguard its current strong financial position.
On resource mobilization, the Governors
noted with deep satisfaction the successful
conclusion of the Tenth Replenishment of
he African Development Fund (ADF-X),
and thanked ADF-X Deputies for approving
US$5.4 billion for 2005-2007, to meet the
resource requirements of ADF countries.
hey urged the donor community to fulfill
its pledges to Africa—as promised at the
Monterrey Conference of March 2002;
elp reduce the debt of developing counries; and lift trade barriers.

 

Finally, the Governors commended the outgoing President, the Boards of Directors,
management, and staff for their hard work
and dedication and for the Banks substanial achievements in 2004.

Boards of Directors

During the year, the ADB/ADF Boards of
Directors held 37 formal meetings, 36
informal meetings, and 26 committee
meetings. In considering policies, strategies, and guidelines aimed at enhancing the Bank's operational effectiveness,
the Boards of Directors continued to be
guided by the Bank’s new strategic orientations and priorities. Thus, in line with the
attendant financing principles and with
ADF-X Financing Guidelines, the Boards
approved loans, grants, public guarantees
for sovereign loans, and HIPC debt relief
amounting to UA 2.29 billion. Of this
amount, UA 868.7 million was committedBox 1.2: Temporary Relocation of the Bank Group

During 2005, the Boards of Directors discussed and approved proposals on the context of the Extended
Mission Regime of the Bank's Temporary Relocation in Tunis, including supplementary budgets to cover

related operational costs.

In line with the Boards of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/2003/04, which requires the Boards of Directors
to review the situation in the Bank's Host Country and submit six-monthly reports to the Boards of
Governors, the Board of Directors submitted the following recommendations, which were approved by
the Boards of Governors during the 2005 Annual Meetings:

(i) The Headquarters of the Bank shall remain in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire;

(ii) The situation in the host country of the Headquarters is not yet conducive to the return of the

operations of the Bank to Headquarters;

(iii) [The Bank] shall extend the timeframe of the Temporary Relocation Period by twelve (12) months

from 3 June 2005;

(iv) The next substantive review of the Temporary Relocation Period shall be conducted by the Board

during the 2006 Annual Meetings;

(v) [The Bank] shall maintain the one (1) year notice period for the return of the operations of the
Bank to its Headquarters, to allow for an orderly and planned return;

(vi) The Board of Directors shall continue to conduct six-monthly comprehensive reviews of the situation in the host country to assess whether it is conducive to the return of the Bank's operations
to its Headquarters and, if necessary, convene a meeting of the GCC; and

(vii) The Board of Directors and the President shall take such administrative measures as may be
necessary or expedient for the implementation of the above Resolution, having regard to the
functions and powers of the Board of Directors and the President, as set out in the Agreement
Establishing the Bank, the General Regulations, and other subsidiary instruments of the Bank.

by the ADB; UA 1.42 billion by the ADF;
and UA 3.2 million by the NTF. The approvals covered 102 operations, comprising 25
project loans and one line of credit, all to
the public sector; two project loans and
two lines of credit to the private sector;
six policy-based operations (one sector
adjustment loan and five structural adjustment loans); one private guarantee and
one private equity participation; 51 grants,
comprising 19 national project grants,
15 technical assistance grants and 17
approvals for emergency assistance (from
the Special Relief Fund); and three project
preparation facility. In addition, 10 grants
were approved for HIPC debt relief operations in four countries.

 

An indicative financing program target
of UA 3.06 billion for 2006 will be considered by the Boards in early 2006. This
target is much higher than the UA 2.23
billion target approved for 2005 because
of increased resource mobilization through
ADF-X Replenishment.

Operational Activities

During 2005, the Boards consider several
matters, including the temporary relocation
of the Bank (see Box 1.2), and approved
policies, guidelines, strategies, and initiatives aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of Bank Group operations. Table 1.1
summarizes the key operational policies
approved during the year. A brief overview

Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

of finance-related and non- finance related
policies and guidelines follows.

Finance-Related Policies and
Guidelines

ADF-X Financing Policy Guidelines

In June 2005, the ADF Board approved
the ADF-X Financing Policy Guidelines,
designed to supplement and implement the
ADF's general operational guidelines during
the 2005-2007 ADF-X period. The objectives of Fund operations under ADF-X are
to reduce poverty, improve living standards,
and promote sustainable and equitable economic growth to achieve the MDGs. These
objectives will govern all project/program
loans and grants, policy-based lending operations, technical assistance operations, new
resources, and other ADF activities during
2005-2007. The Board agreed that ADF-X
resources should be allocated as follows:

(i) One percent of total ADF-X resources
be set aside as a contingency to cover
he Fund's exchange rate risk.

(ii) UA 100 million to be allocated immediately to the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF), and UA 150 million to
be made available for the PCCF when
necessary.

(iii) The balance of the resources to be
allocated on the following basis: At
east 85 percent for specific project
investments and technical assistance
operations, including policy-based
loans and grants and support to secor-wide programs—the vast majority
of these resources would be allocated
© Category A (ADF) countries and
up to a maximum of five percent to
Category B (Blend) countries; up to 15,
percent would be allocated for multinational projects; and no more than
25 percent of the aggregate country
allocation would be extended through
policy-based loans.

to 40 ADF-eligible countries through the
Fund's Performance-Based Allocation
(PBA) system for national project loans
and grants, including policy-based loans.
Because of the application of the new
Debt Sustainability Analysis, 21 countries
would be eligible to receive their allocations in the form of grants only, five counties would be eligible for a combination
of loans and grants, and 14 countries
(including the two blend countries) for
loans only.

Currency Choice to ADF Borrowers

n March 2005, the ADF Board approved
he Proposal to offer Currency Choice
to ADF Borrowers. This policy seeks to
improve ADF management of currency
tisks and to provide borrowers with a
roader selection of currencies in order to
meet their individual debt service needs
and capacities. The policy was endorsed
with the caveat that it will be subject
© a currency non-availability/substitution
clause and will not modify the applicable
ADF policies on procurement, the environment, project implementation and supervision.

 

In cases where the selection of a currency
for disbursement by borrowers would
either decrease or increase the ADF
imbalance for the SDR currency composition, the currency mismatch will be managed on a quarterly basis by the purchase
of the currency in which the Fund has
a shortage and the sale of the currency
that the Fund has in excess. The Board's
approval granted borrowers the benefit
of selecting one disbursement currency
from the pool of SDR currencies (U.S.
dollar, euro, Japanese yen, and pound
sterling) per loan. The policy will be
applicable to new ADF loans negotiated
after its date of effectiveness and will be
effective three (3) months from the date
of approval.

Managing the Currency Risks in the
Bank Group's Administrative Budget

In April 2005, the ADB Board approved
the Managing the Currency Risks in the
Bank Group’s Administrative Budget policy
as part of a periodic review of the market
value of currencies in which it operates.
The approved scheme will help mitigate
adverse currency translation effects on the
value of the currencies held by the Bank
and the Fund in the exchange rate-setting
mechanism for the Bank Group’s adminisrative and capital budgets. The exchange
rates between national currencies and the
Units of Account used in the Bank Group's
udget will be the closing rates published
y the IMF on a specified day during the
udget planning and approval exercise
‘0 reflect prevailing market rates. This
rate-setting mechanism will minimize the
variance between the budgeted and the
actual expenditure caused by the use of
udget exchange rates that differ from the
revailing exchange rates.

Advance Commitment Authority Scheme
n April 2005, the ADF Board approved
the Advance Commitment Authority (ACA)
Scheme of the African Development Fund
as the basis for determining commitment
capacity from generated resources. The
ACA scheme is a more efficient way of
using available resources, with little risk
of over-commitment. It has the advantage
of (i) increasing the volume of resources
available for immediate commitment
through more efficient use of predictable ADF reflows; (ii) aligning the Fund's
practices with those of the International
Development Association (IDA) and the
Asian Development Fund (AsDF); and (iii)
providing the ADF with another liquidity management tool. The ACA scheme is
based on future cash flows and includes
adequate mitigating mechanisms to protect against market risk. The generated
resources for the ADF-X Replenishment
period, amounting to UA 1.2 billion, were
immediately available for ADF operations.

 

Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

The 2006 Administrative Expenses and
Capital Expenditure Budget

n December 2005, the Boards approved
an administrative expenses budget of
UA 179.0 million for 2006, a capital
expenditure budget of UA 7.5 million, and
a contingency budget of UA 1.8 million.
he ADF Board approved an_ indicative
administrative budget of UA 132.4 million
‘or the Fund for the financial year ending
December 31, 2006.

he preparation of the 2006 Budget was
predicated on the need to reform the
udgetary process to ensure that it is
resource-based, transparent, and responsive to the imperatives of accountability.
he preparation of the budget was driven
y a number of decisions taken by the
Boards of Governors and Directors in line
with the Bank’s new strategic orientaions and priorities. Hence, the focus was
on implementing the Extended Mission
Regime, strengthening the operational
program, enhancing portfolio management, and accelerating the decentralizaion program, as stipulated in the Strategic
Resources Framework for Institutional
Development (SRFID) Initiative.

 

Non-Finance Related
Policies and Guidelines

Strengthening the Bank’s Research
Capacity and Expanding its Research
Program

In April 2005, the Boards approved the
Proposal to Build the Bank’s Research
Capacity and Extend its Research Program.
To achieve its mandate and provide financial resources for the needs of its RMCs,
the Bank launched an expanded program
of applied research with clear guiding
principles and objectives. The research program consists of five ‘research clusters’:
(1) Poverty Reduction and the MDGs, (2)
Macroeconomic Dynamics and Growth, (3)
Governance, Institutions, and Public Sector
Management, (4) Investment Climate and

Annual Report 200512

Chapter 001 Activities of the Boards

Competitiveness of African Economies,
and (5) Regional Integration and Trade.
During the year, the Bank also intensified its knowledge dissemination activities
within the Bank and among its RMCs. The
Office of the Chief Economist will monitor
progress in implementing these actions,
and the results of the research work will
be reported regularly in the Balanced Score
Card (BSC).

Anti-Corruption and Fraud Investigation
Good governance fosters accountability and transparency and helps fight corruption and fraud in RMCs. To ensure
effective investigation of corruption and
fraud within its internal and external
operations, in November 2005 the Board
approved the Establishment of an AntiCorruption and Fraud Investigation function. This function was established within
the Internal Audit Department, which
was renamed the Office of the Auditor
General (OAG) and restructured into
one Directorate and two Divisions: the
Anti-Corruption and Fraud Investigation
Division and the Internal Audit Division,
effective January 1, 2006.

 

The new Anti-Corruption and Fraud
Investigation Division will play a key role
in (i) undertaking, directing, and controlling investigations into allegations of
fraud, corruption, and other misconduct;
(ii) maintaining the highest standard of
professional efficiency and integrity; (iii)
managing and operating the procedures
and mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality to protect whistleblowers and
anonymous reporting; (iv) reporting regularly to the Auditor General on allegations
received, screened, and their investigation status; and (v) recommending to the
Oversight Committee on Corruption and
Fraud (OCCF) debarment and imposition
of sanctions against individuals, firms and
companies found to have engaged in corrupt practices. The OAG will be overseen by
the OCCF, which will be presided over by a

Annual Report 2005

Vice-President appointed by the President.
Its membership shall consist of two other
senior staff of the rank of Vice President
or Director. The General Counsel and the
Auditor General are ex-officio members of
the OCCF.

Corporate Governance Strategy

In December 2005, the Boards approved
the Bank’s Corporate Governance Strategy,
which recognizes that good governance
plays an essential role in promoting economic efficiency and equity and in sustaining economic growth in RMCs. The strategy addresses three key issues: Board and
corporate management; financial market
management; and corporate social responsibility. lt embraces a variety of processes,
structures, and codes that govern the
ehavior of a corporation.

he overall goal of the governance strategy
is to contribute to economic development
y promoting good corporate governance
in public and private sector corporations
and ensuring that the corporations create
inancial, social, and environmental value
or shareholders. To effectively promote
he strategy, the Bank must help RMCs
(i) establish appropriate frameworks conducive to good governance and coherent
egislative and policy framework; (ii) introduce basic standards of corporate social
responsibility into corporate governance
egislature and regulation; (iii) increase
awareness of the importance of good corporate governance among corporate stakeholders; (iv) promote corporate governance
standards within state-owned enterprises;
and (v) broaden understanding, within
inancial and banking sectors, of good
corporate governance standards among
arget clients.

 

 

 

he Bank's corporate strategy consists of
hree main components: standards and
norms development; institutional and
human capacity building; and _ financial
support. At the country level, the develop
 

ment of standards and norms will take into
account existing international guidelines.
At the corporate level, the Bank will use
its resources to support financial institutions and individual firms, including banks,
to promote their standards of corporate
governance.

The implementation of the strategy will
be governed by a set of principles based
on (i) complementarities—strategic partnerships with other key regional players;
(ii) selectivity—focus on countries and
institutions that can demonstrate a strong
commitment to the reform process and (iii)
flexibility—encouraging countries to adapt
corporate governance principles to their
specific context; and corporate entities to
adopt and follow them.

The Bank's efforts to improve corporate
governance will target three key players:
government organizations and regional
institutions; financial intermediaries; and
corporations, in particular, state-owned
enterprises and SMEs.

This chapter focuses on the Bank's main financing operations in the context of its strategic objectives. It reviews cofinancing operations, capacity building and training activities, mobilization of financial resources, support for debt relief under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative, including the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, and partnership and cooperation activities.

The Bank Group's
Operational Strategic Thrust

The Bank's new strategic orientations and
priorities continued to guide the strategic thrust of its operations. To achieve
its objectives of promoting sustainable
economic growth and reducing poverty in
its RMCs, the Bank continued to provide
them with technical assistance and policy
advice; it also continued to mobilize external and domestic resources for investment
in the RMCs. In allocating resources thus
mobilized, the Bank continued to prioritize agriculture and rural development,
the social sector (education, health, and
social protection), infrastructure development, and regional economic integration;
it approved substantial amounts for rural
water supply and sanitation, in support of
the Africa Water Vision and the attainment
of the MDGs; and also gave due attention
to crosscutting issues such as gender, good
governance, environmental sustainability,
and the fight against HIV/AIDS and other
communicable diseases.

Task Force on Institutional Reforms

In November 2005, the President of
the Bank Group set up a Task Force on
Institutional Reforms (TFIR) to find ways
to help the Bank build on its achievements
and reposition itself for greater effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of its
mandate. Five working groups were set
up to examine specific areas of the Bank's
mandate: (i) human resource management,

BOX 2.1: Lake Chad Basin Initiative to Reduce Vulnerability to,

and Risks of, STI/HIV/AIDS

 

In September 2005, the Bank approved a UA 10.0 million grant to finance the Lake Chad Basin
Initiative to Reduce Vulnerability to, and the Risks of, STI/HIV/AIDS. This multinational project
covers Chad, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic. It is co-financed by the Lake
Chad Basin Commission in the amount of UA 1.1 million.

Background: In January 1999, the international community passed a resolution to establish the
International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa to curb the spread of HIV/AIDS on the continent. The
Lake Chad Basin Initiative evolved from this resolution. In line with its Vision, and aware of the need to
support multinational initiatives to combat HIV/AIDS, the Bank made provision for the financing of the
Initiative from ADF-X resources.

Objectives: The specific objective of the project is to reduce the vulnerability and risks related to
STI/HIV/AIDS of the communities living around the Lake Chad Basin.

Impact and Outputs: The expected outputs from the project include (i) 55 operational health
facilities for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), CAS for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and
prevention of opportunistic infections by 2010; (ii) 1100 health workers trained and in place by 2010;
(iii) 125 retail outlets for condoms opened and operational by 2010; (iv) at least 125 NGOs and CBOs
trained and well-versed in monitoring and evaluation by 2010; (v) procurement of educational materials
(posters, brochures, picture boxes) and supply of IEC materials and equipment; (vi) at least one weekly
program broadcast by 2007; and (vii) three national seminars and a sub-regional seminar conducted
each year, beginning in 2007, with at least 20 local leaders trained per session.

It is expected that these measures will help reduce the HIV prevalence rate among under-24-year olds
from 6.7 percent to less than 5 percent by 2010; increase the number of people screened for VCT from
30 percent to 50 percent by 2010; and increase the number of under-25-year olds using condoms by at
least 80 percent by 2010.

(ii) structure and focus of operations, (iii)

Total loans and grants, including HIPC debt
relief, approved during the year decreased

Annual Report 2005Chapter 002 Bank Group Operations

rom UA 2.79 billion in 2004 to UA 2.29
illion in 2005. This 18 percent decline
was caused by a significant decrease in the
number of countries that reached decision
and completion points under the enhanced
HIPC initative; indeed HIPC debt relief,
ell from a record high of UA 1.01 billion
in 2004 to UA 508.7 million in 2005. In
contrast, as a result of the entry into effeciveness of the new ADF-X resources, grant
approvals surged to UA 420.3 million, a 94
percent increase over 2004 levels, because
of an increase in ADF-X resources and in
e number of ADF countries eligible for
grants only. Lending approvals over the
same period rose to UA 1.32 billion, a
6.9 percent rise over 2004 levels. Total
oan and grant approvals remained more
or less the same at UA 1.74 billion (see
able 2.1).

he main financing instruments in 2005
were project lending, which accounted
‘or 45.6 percent of total approvals—comrising 25 project loans (all to the public
sector), two private sector project loans;
hree lines of credit (two private secor and one public sector), and 10 HIPC
operations, representing 22.2 percent of
otal approvals. The share of policy-based
ending was 12 percent of approvals, comrising five structural adjustment loans
and one sectoral adjustment loan; while
51 grants—15 technical assistance grants,
19 project grants, and 17 special relief
und grants—accounted for 18.3 percent
of approvals.

he share of ADB window operations
in 2005 represented 37.9 percent of Bank
Group approvals, down 44.8 percent from
UA 1.52 billion in 2004 to UA 868.7 milion in 2005, but still 16.5 percent above

Annual Report 2005

approvals represented six percent of total
Bank approvals for the year, down from
UA 161.2 million in 2004 to UA 138.1
million in 2005. The approvals comprised
wo lines of credit (LOCs) to strengthen the
capacity of financial institutions to provide
oans to SMEs and corporate clients; and
wo private sector project loans amounting
0 UA 64.3 million. In addition, one equity
participation in the amount of UA 35.1 milion, and one private guarantee for UA 6.9
million were approved for the private secor. The ADB Special Relief Fund (SRF)
provided emergency support grants totaling UA 5.8 million to 16 countries affected
by natural disasters in 2005. This is much
igher than the UA 2.8 million approved in
2004 (see Table 2.1).

otal ADF window approvals rose from
UA 1.26 billion in 2004 to UA 1.42 billion in
2005, representing 62 percent of all Bank
Group approvals. Grant approvals also
increased substantially to UA 420.3 million
in 2005, compared with UA 216.7 million
in 2004 and UA 174.5 million in 2003,
in line with the new policy framework for
ADF operations. The share of grants in relation to total ADF approvals rose from 7.8
percent in 2004 to 18.3 percent in 2005.
In contrast, approvals under the Nigeria
Trust Fund (NTF) declined from UA 22.5
million in 2003 to UA 9.3 million in 2004
and UA 3.2 million in 2005 (see Table
2.1). In addition, three operations totaling UA 1.1 million were approved under
the Project Preparation Facility (PPF),
compared with none in 2004. Since the
introduction of the facility in 2002, a total
of eight operations amounting to UA 2.8
million have been approved.

 

 

In all, the Bank Group financed programs
and projects in 34 countries, many of them
in collaboration with other multinational
institutions and bilateral donors. Also, in
line with its Action Plan for Infrastructure
Development in RMCs and with its commitment to promote regional infrastructure

This significant increase reflects the importance the Bank places on infrastructure
development in RMCs; this should help
improve productivity and reduce poverty.
Of the infrastructure grant approvals, water
supply and sanitation received the largest
share—UA 122.7 million for five operations, compared with UA 27.9 million for
six operations in 2004. This was followed
by transportation with UA 75.9 million for
six operations, compared with UA 6.8 million for four operations in 2004; and power
supply with UA 5.1 million compared with
UA 8.0 million (3.7 percent of total grants)

tion. During 2005, the Bank's African
Development Institute (ADI) and the Joint
Africa Institute (JAI) implemented workshops, seminars, and symposia, all aimed
at building capacity in RMCs.

Capacity Building and Training
Activities in RMCs

Project-Related Training

Through the ADI, the Bank prepared and
delivered 13 national project implementation workshops in RMCs. These workshops
aimed to build the project management
skills and knowledge of RMC officials and
experts on Bank procurement, disbursement, and audit procedures in order to
ensure effective resource management.
The workshops, which were attended by
more than 500 participants, also provided
useful feedback on Bank Group operations
in RMCs.

The Bank continued to support the implementation of the Agricultural Management
Training for Africa program, which aims to
improve the implementation of agriculture
projects financed by the Bank and the
IFAD. Nine sub-Saharan African and three
North African RMCs participated in the
program. A number of agriculture projects
approved by the Boards in 2005—to be
implemented in the next few years—
included agricultural management training
activities.

Development Management Training
In cooperation with other development
agencies, the Bank continued to organize
workshops, seminars, and conferences on
development management. These included
the Annual Meetings Symposium and the
roundtable discussion, “Scaling up Poverty
Reduction”, which preceded the symposium. These activities attracted 500 and
120 participants, respectively.

To contribute to the activities of the JAI,
the Bank designed and delivered the

Ministerial Forum held during HLF-2 took
stock of implementation progress and
subsequent challenges to the commitments made in the Monterrey, Rome, and
Marrakech Declarations. The Forum also
identified ways to accelerate and scale
up best practices and sustain political
support. With the formal adoption of the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the
Ministerial Forum committed itself to the
partnership commitments, actions, targets,
and indicators to monitor progress.

Workshop on Local Government and
Decentralization. In June 2005, the
Bank collaborated with three development
partners—the German Development Bank
(KfW), the World Bank, and International
Democracy Election Assistance (IDEA)—to
organize a workshop on local government
and decentralization. The target group
comprised the 16 African countries implementing programs for decentralized governance. About 70 local governance prac
titioners from these RMCs and specialists
from partner agencies participated in this
workshop, which was held in Tunis.

Aid Effectiveness Workshop, Entebbe.
In collaboration with the World Bank,
the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP), and the OECD's Development
Assistance Committee, the Bank organized a workshop on aid effectiveness in
November 2005 in Entebbe, Uganda. The
workshop brought together over 120 participants from 16 eastern and southern
African countries and donor institutions.
It gave participants an opportunity to
examine the Paris Declaration, specifically: approaches to its implementation,
and implications for individual partner
countries.

Ad-Hoc Meeting of African Ministers
of Finance. In November 2005, the Bank
organized an ad-hoc consultative meeting
of African Ministers of Finance.Representatives from the ECA, the AU
Commission, the NEPAD Secretariat, some
regional integration organizations, the
World Bank, the IMF and the UNDP attended the meeting, which was held in Tunis. The
objective of the meeting was to analyze the
implications of the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative proposed at the G8 summit in
Gleneagles, Scotland, in July 2005, and to
build support for increased external assistance for RMCs.

Other Capacity Building Activities

In 2005, the Bank continued to support the
activities of the African Capacity Building
Foundation by providing financial support
and participating in the deliberations of its
Executive Board and Board of Governors.
Through ADI, the Bank implemented the
Japan Fellowship Program, awarding 12
scholarships to young Africans to pursue
master’s degrees in fields related to economic and social development.

Training and Capacity Building
Activities Within the Bank

Training and Staff Development

Staff development and training activities
undertaken in 2005 focused on building
capacity to support the Bank's strategic
orientations and priorities. New policies
and procedures to facilitate staff learning, and programs to enhance staff performance and retention were assiduously
implemented during the year. These included enhancing management development
programs with new modules designed to
ensure better leadership and management;
revamping the new staff orientation program—to foster a positive organizational
culture and effectively integrate new staff
into the Bank; strengthening operational
skills, with particular emphasis on project
design, implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation; and sensitizing staff on ways
of mainstreaming key crosscutting themes,
particularly gender, environment, microfinance, governance, and poverty.

Internal Capacity Building Activities

Over 50 courses were organized during the year, and more than 760 staff
received training in various functionary areas. Courses included Budget
Preparation; Results-Based CSPs; Exotic
Options and Structured Financial Products;
COSTAB; SAP; ORACLE; Procurement of
Goods, Works, and Contracts; QEA; Credit
Management; Coaching for Improved
Performance; special courses for administrative assistants; Negotiation Techniques;
Writing for the Web; Recruitment and
Selection Techniques; and E-booking.
Specific training programs were also
designed and implemented to support ADFX implementation and decentralization.

Internal Mobility. The Presidential
Directive on Mobility aims to enhance the
career prospects of staff by offering them
external training opportunities to develop
new skills to facilitate mobility within
he organization. Over 40 staff members
‘ook advantage of this Directive in 2005,
compared with 20 in 2004. In addition,
15 staff members were transferred to
ield offices, 61 sent abroad for training,
and four seconded to the IMF and the
World Bank for three-month periods. The
irst five awardees under the new Staff
Scholarship Program started their studies
during the year. Language training for staff
was revamped with the introduction of
Portuguese and Arabic language courses,
in addition to English and French courses.
A program to certify staff for increased
professional efficiency was introduced, and
a pilot program on certification in procurement and contracting implemented, with
assistance from the International Labor
Organization (ILO) Training Center.

 

Results-Based Management Training
Workshops. The Bank organized two
workshops on the application of the
Results-Based Logical Framework. Over
40 staff attended the workshops, which
aimed to strengthen the Bank's capacity

Chapter 002 Bank Group Operations

to develop and implement results-oriented
country operations. During the year, three
training workshops on the preparation of
the new Results-Based CSPs were also
organized for Operations Complex staff.

Workshop on Girls’ Education. In
September 2005, the Bank organized a
workshop to sensitize Bank Staff to gender
issues and educate them on the MDGs. The
objective was to help staff integrate gender
equity concerns into Bank operations and to
strengthen their capacity to propose more
relevant and more pertinent interventions
geared to achieving gender-related MDGs in
RMCs. The workshop led to the completion
of a Girls’ Education Checklist. In addition, a
Bank publication detailing the proceedings
and recommendations of the workshop was
prepared for wider dissemination.

Mobilization and Allocation
of Financial Resources

Activities aimed at mobilizing and allocating external resources in support of Bank
Group operations during 2005 included
the preparation of four policy documents:
(i) ADF-X Financing Policy Guidelines, (ii)
ADF-X Country Resource Allocations for
2005; (iii) Enhanced Performance-based
Allocation Framework for ADF-X; and
(iv) ADF Implementation Modalities for
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI). The Bank also continued to mobilize external resources by cofinancing operations in RMCs. In addition, at the fourth
and final ADF-X Replenishment consultative meeting, held in December 2004 in
Copenhagen, Denmark, State Participants,
along with representatives of ADF-eligible
countries, agreed to a total replenishment
of UA 3.7 billion (about US$5.4 billion)
over the ADF-X period (2005-2007).

ADF-X Country Resource

Allocation Guidelines

Under the ADF-X Policy Guidelines presented
in Chapter 1, only 38 Category A (ADF

Chapter 002 Bank Group Operations

only) and two Category B (Blend) countries
are eligible to benefit from the resources
of the ADF-X Replenishment. For the 40
ADF-eligible RMCs, the Performance-Based
Allocation system is used to determine
the volume of resources that each country
can access. After determining each country's allocation, the Debt Sustainability
Framework, which indicates a country’s
risk of debt distress, is used to determine
the form in which the resources will be
available. Under the Framework, countries
are classified according to their policies and
institutions and the degree of debt distress
in relation to their capacity to manage debt
and reduce their vulnerability to exogenous
shocks. In line with Debt Sustainability
Framework principles, some 21 countries
with a high degree of debt distress receive
their ADF allocations as grants; five countries with a moderate risk of debt distress
receive their allocations in 50/50 or other
loan/grant proportions; while 14 countries
with a low risk of debt distress receive all
their allocations as loans.

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds on capital
markets at the lowest possible cost to support its lending activities; its AAA credit
rating allows it to issue securities at low
interest rates. In December 2004, the ADB
Board of Directors approved a borrowing
program of up to UA 550 million for 2005.
The Bank raised UA 544.5 million at a
weighted average cost of 6-month U.S.
dollar LIBOR minus 25.2 basis points.

The Bank's borrowing portfolio stood at
UA 5,940.4 billion at December 31, 2005.
The Bank is well within its debt policy limits. The key debt ratios are as follows:

The Bank strives to raise funds on
capital markets at the lowest possible cost to support its lending
activities, and its AAA credit rating
allows it to issue securities at low
interest rates.

Annual Report 2005

¢ Total borrowings/total callable capital
(max 80 percent): 30.67 percent

¢ Senior debt/non-borrowing members’
callable capital (max 80 percent):
61.13 percent

The execution of the 2005 funding program
confirmed that the Bank's strategy of increasing its visibility in capital markets through
global bond issues and investor meetings is
leading to convergence between the Bank's
funding levels and those of its peers in all
market segments. The Bank concluded a
ZAR 900 million, five-year maturity Uridashi
transaction in May 2005—the largest transaction executed in ZAR by any supranational
since 1998, and the first ZAR borrowing by
the Bank since March 1999. Taking advantage of favorable market conditions, the
Bank priced a 3-year US$500 million global
benchmark in international capital markets
at an after-swap level on an all-in-cost basis
of U.S. dollar 6-month LIBOR minus 20 basis
points. This transaction attracted top-notch
investors, and its placement in the United
States was one of the highest supranational
transactions in 2005. The Bank continued to
raise funds through small-sized structured
transactions, executed with an attached
swap, to take advantage of attractive funding opportunities in the Japanese private
placement market.

Euro-Pula market, following the receipt of
necessary approvals from the Government
of Botswana. Thanks to the Bank's efforts,
the Botswana Pula received a settlement
currency status from international clearinghouses, making the transaction the
first true Eurobond in Pula. Botswana
Pula is the second African currency, after
the South African Rand, to achieve settlement status. Consistent with its strategy
of developing African capital markets, the
Bank has tentatively identified borrowing
opportunities in several African currencies.
Discussions with potential investors and
local banks, and partnerships with governments and regulatory bodies will drive the
pace of progress in this strategic activity.

Debt Relief under the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative

At end-2005, 24 of the 33 RMCs
classified as HIPCs were receiving
debt relief from the Bank under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative.

Decision Point Operations

The Bank Group continued to participate
in the enhanced HIPC Initiative. At end2005, 24 of the 33 RMCs classified as
HIPCs were receiving debt relief from the
Bank under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
In addition, the Bank Group approved
debt relief at decision point for Burundi in
November 2005, bringing the number of
countries between decision and completion points to 10. Table 2.4 provides a
detailed list of these RMCs, whose HIPC
debt relief cost is estimated at US$1.43
billion in decision point net present value
(NPV) terms, equivalent to US$2.64 billion
in nominal terms.

Completion Point Operations

debt committed under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. The debt relief cost for these 14
RMCs is estimated at US$1.37 billion in
decision point NPV terms, equivalent to
US$1.94 billion in nominal terms. Details
of the HIPC debt relief cost for these RMCs
are provided in Table 2.4.

In total, US$2.26 billion in nominal terms was
mobilized for the Bank Group's share of HIPC
debt relief (see Table 2.5). Of this amount, the
Bank Group contributed US$311.8 million
from its internal resources by end-2005; of
which US$284.9 million has already been used
to finance approved HIPC grants. The Bank had
initially pledged US$370 million from its internal resources for this purpose. By end-2005
as well, other donors had also contributed
US$1.95 billion, of which, US$1.68 billion had
already been utilized for the grants.

The Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative

During the G8 Summit at Gleneagles in July
2005, the Heads of State and Government
proposed that the ADF, the IDA, and the
MF provide 100 percent irrevocable debt
stock cancellation for countries that reach
he completion point under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative. This Multilateral Debt Relief
nitiative (MDRI) was the major debt relief
initiative in 2005 and aims to complete
he HIPC debt relief process by providing
more resources to help 39 countries worldwide—including 33 in Africa—to progress
towards the MDGs, while safeguarding
he long-term financing capacity of the
ADF and the IDA. The Initiative also seeks
‘© encourage the best use of new donor
resources for development. All countries

 

receiving the relief must be current with
their repayment obligations to international financial institutions and must demonstrate commitment to good governance.
The MDRI implementation modalities were
discussed during the ADF Deputies’ meeting in Washington, D.C. in December 2005
(see Box 2.2).

Post-Conflict Countries and the PCCF
In 2004, the Boards of Directors approved
a Post-Conflict Country Facility (PCCF) to
help clear the arrears of seven countries
to make them eligible for debt relief at
the decision point under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative. These countries (the Central
African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire,
Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, and Burundi) are
post-conflict countries (PCCs). With the
exception of Burundi, which reached its

Annual Report 2005BOX 2.2: Proposed MDRI Implementation Modalities

At the ADF Deputies’ meeting in Washington, D. C., in December 2005, Deputies concluded negotiations
‘on implementation modalities for the MDRI.

For the ADF and IDA, debt stock cancellation will be a three-phase process:

1. Post-completion-point HIPCs will be relieved of their repayment obligations and their gross assistance flows adjusted downward by the same amount.

2. — Donors will make new contributions to ADF and IDA to match, “dollar-for-dollar”, foregone principal and service charge payments based on an agreed burden sharing.

3. Additional funds will be allocated to all ADF-only and IDA-only recipients on the basis of existing
performance-based allocation (PBA) mechanisms.

Additional funds to cover the full cost of obligations due during the ADF-X and IDA14 period will be
made available immediately. Similarly, donors will be committed to making additional contributions to
the subsequent regular ADF and IDA replenishments to cover the full cost of obligations until all obligations under the cancelled loans have been met.

During the meeting, the Deputies underscored that providing firm and unqualified commitments over a
rolling 10-year period would allow ADF to commit pledged resources in advance over the regular disbursement horizon of each ADF Replenishment. To this end, donors pledged to fully finance the costs to
ADF over the 50-year time span of the Initiative. They agreed that the level of ADF-X donor contributions,
measured in real terms, would serve as the baseline on which new donor financing for the Initiative will
be assessed over time.

Regarding the scope of the Initiative, Deputies supported the following proposals from management:
an implementation date of January 1, 2006; a definition of credit coverage as debt outstanding and
disbursed; December 2004 as the cut-off date; the eligibility of 33 RMCs for debt cancellation; and the
use of the ADF-X normalized burden shares as the basis for the increase in resources for the Initiative.

Based on debt outstanding and disbursed at December 31, 2004, as the cut-off date, and January
1, 2006, as the implementation date, the cost of canceling the ADF debt of the 33 potential beneficiaries, after HIPC relief, is estimated at UA 5.84 billion (US$9.06 billion) in nominal terms. This is
disaggregated into UA 3.91 billion (US$6.07 billion) as debt relief to the 14 post-completion point
HIPCs; UA 1.28 billion (US$1.99 billion) for the 10 interim period HIPCs; UA 0.60 billion (US$0.93
billion) for the eight pre-decision point HIPCs; and UA 0.046 billion (US$0.071) for sunset clausepossible HIPC countries.

 

The ADF Deputies unanimously supported the following criteria for confirming immediate eligibility for
the 14 post-completion point HIPCs under the Initiative: (i) satisfactory macroeconomic performance;
(ii) satisfactory PRSP implementation; and (iii) satisfactory governance and public expenditure management systems. They endorsed the proposal to prepare a common list of countries eligible for debt relief
based on the one-time assessment that will be prepared jointly with the IDA and the IMF. The ADF will
participate in these assessments. The Deputies also agreed that, for other HIPCs, reaching completion
point would be sufficient to establish eligibility for the debt relief initiative. The Deputies’ Report on the
MDRI implementation modalities will be finalized in early 2006.

Under the indicative timetable for the implementation of the adopted MDRI, revised country allocations
of ADF resources for 2006 are to be finalized in the third quater of 2006, with retroactive adjustment to
January 1, 2006, as the effective starting date for beneficiaries.

decision point in November 2005, the
remaining six countries have not yet
reached the decision point because they
still face various forms of socio-political crisis and owe substantial accumulated arrears to various creditors. Under
the approved framework, the beneficiary country, donors, and the PCCF share
the cost of clearing the arrears. At endDecember 2005, the Boards had approved
PCCF grants for two (Burundi and Congo
Republic) of the seven eligible PCCs.

Under ADF-IX, an initial tranche of UA 100
million was approved for the PCCF, and
under ADF-X, an additional UA 150 million
is to be made available under the facility to
finance the clearing of arrears of post-conflict countries, if deemed necessary.

Partnership and Cooperation
Activities

The Bank's partnership and cooperation
efforts can be grouped under cofinancing
operations, bilateral technical cooperation,
multilateral technical cooperation, and collaboration with regional economic communities.

Cofinancing Lending Operations

The Bank pursued its efforts to mobilize external resources for RMCs through
cofinancing (see Table 2.6). During the
year, 19 operations were cofinanced for
UA 3.19 billion, compared with UA 2.85
billion for 31 operations in 2004 and UA
3.91 billion for 28 operations in 2003.
Of the total amount, the Bank contributed UA 577.6 million, compared with
UA 850.9 million in 2004 and UA 734.1
million in 2003. Beneficiary RMCs contributed UA 723.5 million in 2005, compared with UA 42.6 million in 2004 and
UA 70.4 million in 2003. The Bank's external development partners contributed
UA 1.89 billion in 2005, compared with
UA 1.96 billion in 2004 and UA 2.51 billion
in 2003. With regard to external contribu

Support for the Health Sector in Malawi

In November 2005, the Bank approved a UA 15.00 million grant to finance the Support to the Health
Sector Program in Malawi. The project is co-financed by IDA (US$15.00 million), DFID (US$182.00
million), NORAD (US$60.00 million), the OPEC Fund (US$8.00), UNFPA (US$0.10 million), other development partners (US$238.05), and the Government of Malawi (US$210.00 million).

Background: Achieving health-related MDGs remains a major challenge for Malawi, given its poor
Macroeconomic environment, the increasing levels of poverty, the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the shortage
of human resources in the health sector. In its National Health Plan (1999-2004), the Malawi Ministry of
Health (MOH) expressed its intention to adopt and develop a Sector-Wide Approach (SWAP) to improve
health conditions in Malawi. The MOH and its development partners believed that the SWAP arrangement would improve the efficiency and equity of available resources by reducing the fragmentation and
duplication resulting from a multitude of separate externally financed projects. The ADF intervention aims
to support this effort.

Objectives: The objective of the program is to establish, through a SWAP arrangement, an effective and
efficient health care delivery system that is responsive to the needs of the people of Malawi, especially
vulnerable groups, women and children, and the poor.

Impact and Outputs: The support will help Malawi (i) achieve the health-related MDGS: reduce child
mortality by two-thirds of its 1990 level by 2015, reduce maternal mortality by three-fourths of its 1990
level by 2015, begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015, and begin to reverse the incidence of
malaria by 2015; (ii) increase the number of deliveries attended to by skilled health workers from 56
percent to 75 percent by 2010; (iii) reduce the fertility rate from 6.3 to 5.0; (iv) increase the proportion
of facilities capable of providing basic emergency obstetric care from 3 percent to 25 percent; and (v)
increase the level of awareness on birth preparedness to not less than 60 percent.

tions, the World Bank and the IMF provided 31.6 percent; the European Union,
17.0 percent; and bilateral agencies, 51.4
percent (see Table 2.7). Among bilateral
cofinanciers, the main contributors were
he UK (7.5 percent), France (3.2 percent),
and the Netherlands (1.8 percent). Others
included Switzerland, Kuwait, Germany,
Saudi Arabia, Japan, Sweden, Canada,
Denmark, Belgium, and Norway.

The following sectors benefited from coinancing activities in 2005: multi-sector,
UA 1.52 billion (47.7 percent); environment, UA 591.9 million (18.6 percent);
social, UA 501.9 million (15.7 percent);
ransportation, UA 304.0 million (9.5 percent); energy, UA 213.9 million (6.7 percent); agriculture and rural development,
UA 37.7 million (1.2 percent) and finance,
UA 17.9 million (0.6 percent).

From 1967 to 2005, the Bank approved
852 co-financing operations amounting to
UA 84.24 billion. It contributed UA 15.08

billion (18 percent) from its own resources,
while multilateral, bilateral, and private
cofinanciers contributed UA 49.49 billion
(58.7 percent). Governments and local cofinanciers in RMCs contributed UA 19.72
billion (23.4 percent).

Bilateral Technical Cooperation

The focus of bilateral technical cooperation is
the mobilization, management, and administration of grant resources — entrusted to the
Bank Group by some of its members—to
support institutional capacity building and
project-cycle activities in RMCs. In 2005, UA
7.2 million was committed from bilateral
grant resources to finance 87 operations,
compared with UA 8.8 million for 93 operations in 2004. Activities financed included
capacity building and knowledge transfer,
regional integration and economic cooperation, agriculture and rural development,
private sector development, governance,
human resources development, and gender.
The focus under these activities was on preinvestment studies, training, the provision
of long-term experts, and workshops and
seminars.

During 2005, the Bank concluded discussions on establishing multi-donor trust
unds to support thematic areas such as
water, NEPAD, renewable energy, and the
rivate sector. The majority of the Bank
Group's traditional donors also made or
pledged financial or in-kind contributions to
the African Water Facility (AWF), which was
aunched during 2005. A brief description of
bilateral cooperation activities follows.

Austria

n April 2005, the Bank Group and Austria
signed a technical co-operation agreement
© facilitate project co-financing. Under
his agreement, a 1 million grant was
made available to support Bank Group
operations in the water and sanitation,
environmental protection, renewable
energy, and transportation sectors. In total,
89,000 from this grant was approved to

 

Annual Report 2005

finance the Study on the Maintenance of
Railway Infrastructure in Tunisia.

In April 2005 as well, an Austrian delegation, comprising government and business
community representatives and led by the
Director General of the Ministry of Finance,
visited the Bank. The visit provided an
opportunity for bilateral consultations
between the Austrian authorities and the
Bank and allowed the business community to learn about the Bank's programs
and operations. In the same month, the
Bank and the Austrian Ministry of Finance
organized a recruitment seminar in Vienna
and held workshops in Austrian universities.

In October 2005, the Bank and
Osterreichische Kontrollbank AG (OeKB)
of Austria signed a Letter of Agreement
to facilitate project-funding opportunities
between the Bank and OekKB. In the same
month, the Government of Austria and the
Bank organized a business opportunities
seminar, which was attended by representatives of about 70 Austrian companies. As
well, Austria contributed 100,000 to the
AWF Fund and seconded two experts to
support the facility. Austria is also financing an expert to support the Bank's efforts
to establish a trade facilitation program
similar to the programs in other MDBs.

Belgium

Belgium provided UA 50,167.2 to finance
two technical assistants to the Bank. In
September 2005, the Walloon Region
of Belgium and the Bank Group started
arrangements for high-level meetings in
2006 to determine the future of the Private
Sector Trust fund and identify potential
areas of collaboration in the water sector.

Canada

Canada approved CAN$222,355 during
the year to finance the following five institutional and operational activities: (i) the
Ghana Urban Poverty Reduction Study; (ii)

the participation of three African officials
in a conference in Toronto; (iii) development evaluation training for Bank Group
staff; (iv) preparation of the annual report
on gender and review of the procedures;
and (v) the Learning Activity on Girls’
Education.

In principle, Canada also agreed to replenish its trust fund after the conclusion of
a new technical cooperation agreement
with the Bank; it approved CAN$5 million
to support the Bank's Water Partnership
Program (WPP), created to support the
promotion of integrated water resource
management practices (IWRM) and the
implementation of the Bank’s IWRM policy
in RMCs. A multi-donor agreement is being
prepared to this effect.

As a member and first contributor to the
African Water Facility (CAN$20 million),
Canada was represented at the Governing
Council of the AWF in November 2005.
it was also represented at the Oversight
Committee for the NEPAD-IPPF activities.
During the fall of 2005, the Canada Fund
or Africa organized a training workshop
on results-based management (RBM) for
Bank staff and management involved in
he NEPAD-IPPF, the AWF, and the WPP.
he workshop helped improve understanding of RBM among staff involved in the
hree Canada-funded programs; it also
enhanced the ability of the staff to apply
his understanding in the development of
heir respective RBM frameworks.

 

China

n August 2005, the People’s Bank of
China organized a business opportunities
seminar (BOS) in Beijing for members
of the Chinese business community and
African regional and sub-regional development banks, including the ADB, the PTA
Bank and the West Africa Development
Bank (BOAD). During the seminar, the
Bank Group delegation presented an overview of Bank operations, focusing on pro-curement opportunities and policies, and
on infrastructure operations. The seminar
succeeded in raising awareness about
business opportunities in Africa, in particular, opportunities related to the Bank's
operations in Africa. China also contributed UA 18,600 to the Learning Activity on
Girl's Education, co-financed by Canada.

Denmark

Denmark approved DKK 0.8 million to fund
a multi-sector gender profile for Kenya
and a country governance profile for The
Gambia. It also funded the position of a
coordinator for the Nordic Funds in the
Bank and pledged to contribute DKK 300
million to the Bank Group's three water
initiatives during 2005-2009.

Finland

In November 2005, a Finnish delegation
visited the Bank to discuss various issues,
including Finland's possible support for
Bank Group water initiatives. Finland confirmed its intention to provide funding for
two technical assistants in water supply
and sanitation for an initial 2-year period.

France

n 2005, France approved UA 1.3 milion for five activities/programs relating
© governance, the water sector, NEPAD
infrastructure, and capacity building; it
confirmed a 12 million contribution to
he AWF and committed to providing a
long-term technical assistant to the Facility.
France and the Bank Group co-hosted the
April 2005 RWSSI Donors’ Meeting in
Paris. In addition, France pledged an initial
contribution of 40 million for the planned
multi-donor grant arrangement set up for
he RWSSI.

n November 2005, the Bank Group held
igh-level meetings in Paris with officials
rom the French Ministry of Economy,
Finance and Industry and with civil society. The Bank Group also maintained
contact with UBIFRANCE (Agency for

 

the Promotion of French Technology and
Trade), CIAM (the International Admission
Center for Management Studies), and
MEDEF International as part of its efforts
to encourage private-sector participation
in operations financed by France and in
other public-private partnership activities
in Africa. The Bank also embarked on
a strategic partnership with the French
Development Agency (Agence francaise
de développement) in the areas of water,
infrastructure, and private sector development.

Germany

Three German experts (strategic planning,
budget, and water) assumed duty in the
Bank during the year. A fourth expert
was sent to operations under a Special
Framework Agreement on the German
Environmental Initiative (amounting to
3 million), with a mandate to oversee
environmental issues arising from Bank
Group operations in Morocco, Algeria,
and Tunisia. Germany also co-organized
two workshops in Tunis, Tunisia: (1) Local
Governance and Poverty Reduction —
Lessons of Experience (ADB, JAI, KfW)
in June 2005, and (2) Capacity Building
for Pro-Poor Growth/Poverty and Social
Impact Analysis (PSIAs), (ADB, DFID, GTZ)
in November 2005. Germany also confirmed its commitment to the G8 Finance
Ministers’ decision on debt cancellation,
undertaken at Gleneagles, Scotland.

India

India approved UA 629,690 to finance
six activities: (i) the identification/formulation of the Multinational Project for the
Promotion of Female Farmers in Agro
Processing and Marketing Development;
(ii) the consultancy services of a network
engineer and webmaster, and an information technology training session for the
Bank Group; (iii) the second phase of the
ADB Service Level Agreement Study; (iv)
a study on outsourcing; (v) a Document and
Records Management System (DARMS)

expert; and (vi) a web developer. In March
2005, an India-Africa Project Partnership
2005 conclave was held in New Delhi,
India. Participants included Bank Group
officials, banking and financial institutions
from RMCs, and the Indian Government.
The program focused on development perspectives in Africa and on medium-term
lending opportunities for the Bank Group.
The conclave was mutually beneficial as it
paved the way for greater involvement of
the Indian business community in Bankfinanced projects and provided a forum for
the Bank to interact with Indian promoters
of SMEs.

Italy

During 2005, Italy and the Bank Group held
in-depth consultations on how to re-orient
their collaboration towards areas such as
post-conflict country support and institutional human resources. The objective was
to amend their 1986 Technical Assistance
Agreement and extensively revise their
existing partnership and cooperation.

During 2005, Japan approved UA 948,861
to finance the 2005/2006 ADB/Japan
Fellowship Program—the only scholarship program available to the Bank; the
Agriculture Sector Review in Uganda;
statistical capacity building under the
International Comparison Program (ICP);
and an external audit of the Japan Policy
and Human Resources Development Grant
(PHRDG). Japan also proposed a major
initiative to collaborate with the Bank
Group to promote private sector development in Africa. As discussed in Chapter 4,
this Enhanced Private Sector Assistance
for Africa (EPSA-Africa) Initiative, which
has a loan component of US$1.0 billion and a grant component of US$200
million, aims to improve the investment
climate in RMCs and to provide long-term
concessional resources for co-financed
operations with the Bank's sovereign
guaranteed lending.

Korea

Korea approved UA 426,486 to finance (i)
the Study and Preparation of the Malawi
Commercial Fish Farming Project, and
(ii) the identification and preparation
of COMESA Leather Value Addition,
Marketing Promotion, and Regional
Integration Project. In addition, Korea
Eximbank seconded an_ infrastructure
investment expert to the Bank for a 2-year
period and another expert is to be seconded from the Korean Ministry of Finance
and Economy in 2006. In November 2005,
the Bank and Korea Eximbank signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU),
which provides a legal framework for
the two institutions to undertake cooperative activities such as cofinancing and
exchange of information and personnel.

 

The Netherlands

During the year, UA 2.0 million was disbursed from the three existing Dutch thematic trust funds. The Water Partnership
Program is being transformed into a
multi-donor thematic fund with the
expected participation of Canada and
Denmark. The Netherlands also helped set
up the AWF. Under the Financing Energy
Services for Small-scale Energy Users
(FINESSE) program, staff participated in
workshops on renewable energy, and
regional and sub-regional meetings were
held on issues such as wind and solar
energy. Training of staff in the economics
of poverty continued under the PRSP Trust
Fund. A number of Dutch delegations,
including the Prince of Orange, visited
the Bank to discuss wide-ranging issues
of mutual interest, such as poverty reduction, harmonization, corporate decentralization, results-based management, water,
and energy.

Nigeria

The funding commitments of the Nigerian
Technical Cooperation Fund (NTCF) included the NEPAD Medium- and Long-Term
Strategic Framework Study (US$1.4 mil
Annual Report 2005

lion); a Regional Workshop on Geospatial
Data Infrastructure (US$80,000); a
Diplomatic Academy for training foreign
service staff in the DRC (US$424,500);
a study on the establishment of a free
trade zone in the Community of SahelSaharan States (US$50,000); the Review
of the Bank’s Governance Activities
(US$36,325); and the Study on the
Extension of the Nigeria Trust Fund
(US$309,303). As well, the Bank Group
and the Nigerian authorities held highlevel meetings to discuss the extension
of the 30-year life of the NTF. In this
regard, the Nigerian authorities requested an evaluation of the NTF which will be
undertaken in 2006.

Norway

Norway approved NOK 1.7 million in 2005
to finance a country governance profile for
Nigeria, a project performance evaluation
of two agriculture projects in Ethiopia,
and the preparation of the Horticulture
Development Project in Eritrea Project
Completion Report. Norway also pledged to
support the AWF with NOK 30 million over
a three-year period and to finance the services of a Norwegian water resources management technical assistant in 2006 for
an initial two-year period. The Norwegian
Agency for Development Cooperation participated in the AWF Governing Council
Meeting in October 2005 and in the
review of Bank Group activities in the
environment, rural energy, private sector
development, and petroleum sectors.

Portugal

In 2005, Portugal pledged to intensify its
partnership with the Bank, especially its
assistance to the five Lusophone member
countries (the PALOPS—Paises Africanos
de Lingua Oficial Portuguesa): Angola,
Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique,
and Sao Tome and Principe. Two delegations visited the Bank: the Portuguese
Deputy Secretary of State for Public Works
and Communications; and a mission of

eight consulting companies with interests
in the PALOPS and in Northern Africa.
In addition, the Executive Secretary of
the Community of Portuguese Language
Countries, based in Lisbon, also visited
the Bank.

During the year, Portugal approved
UA 516,000 to finance Transport
Sector Review (TSR) Studies in four of
the Lusophone RMCs (UA 420,000); a
Diagnostic Study of Public Administration
in Guinea Bissau (UA 48,000); and the
first ever Portuguese Language training
program for Bank staff (UA 48,000). It
also finalized a new agreement with the
Bank to be signed in 2006. The new agreement integrates the Bank Group's commitment to pursue the MDB harmonization
agenda for standardization, simplification,
and alignment, and proposes fundamental changes to the 1987 agreement. For
the second consecutive year, the Bank
also benefited from a Portuguese-funded
young professional, who was assigned for
nine months to the operations department
responsible for four Lusophone countries.

 

Spain

Spain approved UA 191,763.3 to finance
a forestry sector review in Angola.
Negotiations were held in 2005 for a
special human resources program of
UA 20,000 through ICEX’s training program. The program will include the secondment of a Spanish intern to the Bank for
a year. As well, a Spanish Government
delegation visited the Bank in 2005 to
re-affirm the country’s interest in assisting
RMCs.

Sweden

Sweden approved SEK 1.1 million to finance
a short-term Swedish technical assistant to the Bank; and the SADC-Financial
and Capital Markets Development Study.
Furthermore, it agreed to support the AWF
with SEK 45 million over a three-year period.
In June 2005, Sweden and the Bank Groupsigned an Aide-Mémoire, which provides a
framework for exploring ways to enhance
collaboration between the two parties.

United Kingdom/Department

for International Development
(UK/DFID)

In March 2005, the Bank Group and the
UK/DFID signed an MOU, which provides
a legal framework to enhance coordination of the activities of the two parties.
The two institutions agreed that countrylevel collaboration between 2005 and
early 2006 would focus on, but not be
limited to, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda, and
Mozambique. DFID, in consultation with
the Bank, carried out a baseline study that
established current levels of collaboration,
along with success criteria and indicators of
enhanced engagement. The Bank and DFID
also co-organized two workshops: Capacity
Building on Pro-Poor Growth/Poverty
and Social Impact Analysis (PSIAs), which
took place in Tunisia in November 2005;
and began preparatory work on the global
Transportation Knowledge Partnership
(gTKP) to be held in 2006.

 

Under the UK Government's twin presidencies of the EU and the G8 in 2005,
the Bank was identified as a credible
channel for ODA resources to the continent. This led to the Bank Group's
deep involvement in the preparation of
the Commission for Africa Report; the
Africa Infrastructure Consortium, with
its secretariat at the Bank; the Africa
Partnership Forum; and the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative. As well, the Lord
Mayor of London visited the Bank in
early 2005, and it was agreed that the
Bank would hold a promotional seminar
in London on the Bank Group's operations in its RMCs.

 

Multilateral Technical Cooperation

This section briefly describes Bank Group
technical cooperation activities with various multilateral institutions such as the

Bretton Woods Institutions, the European
Union, the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and regional and subregional organizations.

Arab Coordination Group

In 2005, the Bank Group and the Arab
Coordination Group held several reciprocal
meetings during which they discussed ways
to improve future collaboration; exchanged
views and operational experiences; and
envisaged greater harmonization of policies and procedures.

European Investment Bank

The Bank Group participated in the EuroMediterranean Fund for Investment and
Partnership (EFIP) Steering Committee and
Ministerial meetings during 2005. The EFIP
is critical to Bank Group operations in
North Africa because, through the EFIP, the
European Investment Bank (EIB) plans to
increase its interventions in private sector
development in the region by 50 percent.
The EIB recognizes the Bank Group's comparative advantage in SME operations and
in the finance and water sectors. Thus,
the two institutions can collaborate by
combining EIB resources with the ADB's
experience, to conduct feasibility studies
on projects that can be co-financed in
these sectors. In July 2005, the ADB, the
European Commission, and the EIB signed
a tripartite Strategic Partnership MOU. The
three institutions plan to hold a technical consultation meeting to agree on the
modalities for operationalizing the MOU.

International Monetary Fund (IMF)

The Bank Group is one of the key contributors to the IMF's Africa Regional Technical
Assistance Centers (AFRITACs). In April
2005, the Bank reviewed AFRITAC East
and West evaluation reports, which noted
that all beneficiary countries appreciated
the AFRITACs, which were effective delivery vehicles for capacity building. The centers have largely achieved their objectives,
although considerable work remains to

Chapter 002 Bank Group Operations

be done in planning capacity building for
each member country. Indeed, through a
demand-driven approach, the two pilot
centers have enhanced the quality of technical assistance delivered to RMCs. The
evaluation reports recommended the continuation of AFRITACs with some changes
in the structure and responsibilities of the
Steering Committees. The work program
for 2006-2009 was based on the recommendations of the evaluation report.

At a meeting in Tunis, the IMF Middle-East
and Central Asia Department and the Bank
Group agreed to exchange relevant information on their operations in North Africa.
The two institutions also agreed to work
closely with governments and with other
institutions and donors in the following key
areas: capacity building, financial sector
reform, second-generation reforms, and
regional integration. In particular, the two
institutions agreed to systematically coordinate their annual work programs and
missions to Egypt, Libya, and Algeria.

 

 

 

World Bank

At the beginning of the year, Bank Group/
World Bank technical level meetings
reviewed their validated 2004/2005 Action
Plans and agreed on specific monitorable actions to move their partnership
forward. Thus, since the post-Tunis 2004
consolidation phase, the two institutions
have moved away from financing isolated
investment projects in the same sector
and country toward collaboration under
coherent economic or sector programs in
areas such as capacity building, information exchange, and policy and strategy
development. During the year, the two
institutions also co-organized a series of
workshops and training sessions aimed at
scaling up aid effectiveness to help RMCs
accelerate progress towards the MDGs (see
Table 2.3). The two institutions held consultative meetings on issues raised during
the workshops and on possible collaboration in implementing the Commission for

and enhancing the World Bank’s participation in the Joint Africa Institute.

The United Nations and its
Specialized Agencies

Food and Agriculture Organization
The Bank and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) completed their 2005
work program, under which the FAO identified and prepared four projects in Kenya,
Senegal, and Sierra Leone. The two institutions co-organized a series of workshops,
including two thematic events, on water
resource management, biotechnology,
fisheries and aquaculture, and the Avian
Flu. They held high-level technical meetings to review progress achieved in the
implementation of on-going joint activities such as the Cotton Development
Project for Central and West Africa, and
the SADC Regional Program on Water
Management for Food Security. They
also discussed their draft work program
‘or 2006 and exchanged views on sectoral
issues of common interest such as the
Avian Flu, water resources management,
orestry, fisheries, and aquaculture.

International Fund for Agricultural
Development

Under the existing collaboration with the
FAD, the Bank will administer an IFAD
Rehabilitation and Community-based
Poverty Reduction Project (RCPRP) in Sierra
Leone in the amount of US$10.8 million.
he two institutions agreed to increase
joint operations programs in 2006.

International Labor Organization

During 2005, the Bank Group and The
nternational Labor Organization (ILO)
aunched joint country assessments of the
Growth-Oriented Women Entrepreneurs
Projects in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and
Uganda. The two institutions plan to invite

 

Annual Report 2005

other development partners that may be
interested in supporting women in SMEs. The
ILO and International Finance Corporation
PEP/Africa are the key multilateral partners in the Bank's Women Entrepreneurs
Partial Guarantee Program in Kenya.

United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF)

The Bank Group and UNICEF signed an
MOU during the International Conference
on the Attainment of the MDG for Rural
Water Supply and Sanitation in France in
April 2005. The MOU, a second amendment
to the 1988 Cooperation Agreement, aimed
to strengthen future collaboration between
the two institutions in the areas of education, health, including HIV/AIDs, gender,
child protection and water—all of which
are central to the common development
agendas of the two institutions in Africa.
The two institutions agreed to maintain
continuous contact in order to identify concrete activities in humanitarian crisis and
post-conflict situations, advocacy initiatives,
capacity building, research and analysis,
focusing on the areas mentioned above.

United Nations Development
Program

The UNDP and the Bank held high-level
consultations and meetings in Tunis and
in New York to discuss the status of implementation of the MOU signed in New York
in 2001. Discussions centered on country-level collaboration, particularly with
post-conflict and middle-income countries,
and with specific countries that submitted requests for project implementation
support, poverty reduction, private sector
development, and governance. A number
of countries were earmarked for closer
collaboration between the two institutions in areas such as the preparation of
country governance profiles, poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs), and country
strategy papers (CSPs). The UNDP also
attended the RWSS| donors’ conference in
Paris in April 2005.

The UNDP is expected to sign a delegated
works management agency agreement
with The Economic Community of West
African States in relation to the ADB Peace
and Development Support Project. This
will allow the UNDP Country Offices to
participate in project management in the
15 ECOWAS member states. The Bank and
the UNDP are collaborating in the Support
to the Mano River Union Countries and
Céte d'Ivoire HIV/AIDS Programs.

United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
At the 50th ADB/UNESCO consultation,
held in Tunis in June 2005, both organizations reiterated their common interest in
collaborating on world heritage sites as
tools for poverty eradication.

United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA)

The Bank and UNFPA developed training
modules and conducted training sessions
on the integration of population variables
into the Bank's projects. Two training sessions where held for the Bank staff in Tunis
in 2005.

The ADB and the UNFPA held technical-level meetings in New York in March
2005 to review ongoing activities, and to
agree on a work program for 2005-2006
and on the financial/resource implications of newly identified joint activities.
Other collaborative activities included
the Bank's participation in the HighLevel Roundtable on Reducing Poverty
and Achieving the MDGs-Investing
in Reproductive Health and Rights, in
Sweden. The Bank also participated
in discussions that culminated in the
preparation of the Call for Investing in
Reproductive Health and Rights as a
Development Priority. This fed into major
global discussions, including the UN
Summit to review progress in the implementation of the Millennium Declaration
in September 2005.World Food Program

Cooperation between the ADB and the
World Food Program gained momentum
given the number of emergencies in Africa
and the Bank Group's efforts to relax
procedures for access to its emergency
funds. As a result, in 2005 the Bank Group
approved 17 Emergency Relief Assistance
grants, as indicated in Table 1.1. The two
institutions continued to jointly identify
and develop synergies outside emergency
operations. This formed the basis for the
meetings between the two parties in Rome
in November 2005.

Regional and Sub-regional Economic
Organizations

African Union

n April 2005, the Bank Group hosted an
African Union (AU) delegation led by its
President, Alpha Oumar Konaré. The two
institutions reviewed the prevailing economic situation in the continent, the status
of their cooperation activities, and ways
‘o team up to better fulfill their respecive mandates of economic integration
of various sub regions. They considered
he slow pace of setting up AU institutions such as the African Central Bank
and the African Court of Justice, and the
legal framework for the implementation of
NEPAD. They also reviewed and adopted a
ist of projects, programs, and joint actions;
agreed to help strengthen the Joint ADBAU-ECA Secretariat and amend the existing ADB-OAU Cooperation Agreement to
etter reflect new development priorities
and responsibilities.

Economic Commission for Africa

he ADB and ECA continued to collaborate in areas such as poverty reduction,
good governance, economic reforms, the
ight against HIV/AIDS, and equitable
nternational trade. The two institutions
also agreed to renew the ADB-AU-ECA
oint Secretariat and Chief Executives
Consultative Meetings.

 

Economic Community of West
African States

The Bank Group continued to help the
West Africa sub-region by promoting consultations to fine-tune the ECOWAS and
UEMOA harmonization exercise, particularly on macro-economic issues, trade
reforms, and financial sector issues in view
of the establishment of an ECOWAS customs union. The Bank also provided assistance to the ECOWAS Secretariat to accelerate the implementation of a number of
important regional projects and programs,
including the West African Gas Pipeline
Project, the West African Power Pool, the
ECOMARINE, ICT programs, and agriculture and rural development programs. In
November 2005, the Bank launched a
UA 10 million (US$14.5 million) grant
for the ECOWAS Peace and Development
Fund, aimed at financing the capacity of
ECOWAS to promote peace in the sub
region. The Bank also finalized its strategy
document on the best intervention strategies in the sub-region.

Southern African Development
Community (SADC)

In October 2005, the Bank launched the
implementation of its Regional Assistance
Strategy Paper (RASP) for Southern Africa.
The paper was prepared in close collaboration with the SADC Secretariat and was
underpinned by the Regional Indicative
Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) prepared by SADC. The Bank also collaborated
with the SADC to ensure that the RASP
and the RISDP would lead to deeper integration, increased trade and growth, and
reduced poverty within the sub-region.

Strategic Planning and
Budgeting

During 2005, the Bank pursued the implementation of its new strategic orientations and priorities. Through its budgeting
rocess, it continued to deploy its human,
inancial, and operational resources in
ine with its strategic goals and_priorities. It made progress in the design and
implementation of a Balanced Scorecard
(BSC), conducted an in-depth analysis of
he impact of the proposed Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) on the ADF—
ocusing on the cost, financial, operational,
and legal implications—and collaborated
with sister institutions and stakeholders in
reparatory activities for implementation
of the MDRI.

he main activities undertaken during the
year included (i) drafting a progress report
on the implementation of the Strategic
Plan (2003- 2007); (ii) preparing the 2006
Administrative and Capital Budgets; (iii)
reparing the 2005 Annual Report of the
Bank Group; (iv) consulting with development partners on a Common Performance
Assessment Framework for Multilateral
Development Banks, Management for
Development Results (MfDR), and the
Results Agenda; (v) coordinating the Bank
Group's participation in the enhanced HIPC
nitiative; and (vi) developing and managing cooperation and strategic partnership
arrangements with key multilateral, bilateral, and regional agencies.

 

 

Alignment of Budgetary Resource
Allocations to the Strategic Plan

The budget constitutes part of the ongoing
dialogue between management and the
Boards of Directors on the implementation of the Bank's strategic orientations
and priorities, action plans, and financial
outlook. During the year, the Bank sought
to enhance its budgetary process by (i)
preparing a new budget structure to better respond to the concerns of Board
Members; (ii) decentralizing the budget
management system; (iii) enhancing communication with cost centers—to improve
predictability of resources and allow
smooth implementation of work programs;
(iv) highlighting previous and current year
budget execution, and (v) engaging in
budget process capacity building at the
institutional level.

The 2006 Administrative Expenses and
Capital Budgets, presented in Chapters
1 and 7 provide the necessary resources
for the implementation of the Bank's
2006 work program, which is based on
the Bank's Strategic Priority Objectives
(SPOs). These Budgets reflect the Bank's
strategic budgeting approach and were prepared within the framework of the 20052007 Strategic Resource Framework
for Institutional Development (SFRID),
and the ADF Action Plan to Improve Bank
Group Operations.

Budget preparation during 2005 was driven by a number of decisions taken by the

enhance efficiency in order to achieve better development effectiveness and results.

Boards of Governors and Directors and
by complementary action plans embedded in the SRFID. The Boards took note
of the SFRID, which is expected to have a
cumulative impact of UA 51.1 million on
the Bank's budget during 2005-2007. As
part of the budgetary exercise, the Boards
will decide on the precise level of allocation once a year. The first tranche, UA 16.1
million, was approved in the 2005 Budget
(14.1 million in the 2005 revised budget).
The second tranche, UA 10.7 million, was
approved in the 2006 Budget.

Budgetary resource allocation during
2005 was based on principles underpinned by country focus and capacity
building, increasing the effectiveness of
Bank Group operations, and operational
oversight and support. Resource allocations within the 2005 budgeting framework indicate that resource appropriations
were directed towards corporate priorities,
thus allowing the Bank to implement its
strategic goals. The bulk of budgetary
resources (69 percent) were allocated to
the frontline themes of strategic positioning (27 percent), development effectiveness (24 percent), and portfolio alignment (18 percent) because these relate
to operational activities and support for
operations. Resource allocation within the
programming and budgeting framework
was therefore aligned with the Bank's
major priorities and with its commitment
to scale up operations to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals.

 

Annual Report 2005

35Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

This alignment is the result of continued
efforts and progress toward linking the
Bank's strategic planning and budgeting functions, implemented through the
enhanced Strategic + Objective-based
Budgeting vehicle developed in 2004. This
approach seeks to ensure that strategic
planning, budget formulation, implementation and control, and program evaluation
and review—including the assessment of
outputs and outcomes through the BSC
system and other measurement mechanisms—are fully interlinked. Strategic alignment of the 2006 Budget is assured by
anchoring each departmental business plan
and cost center work program to the 21
SPOs, which are articulated around six
major strategic themes or perspectives, and
spell out how the Bank intends to pursue its
goals in its priority areas; primarily through
(i) development effectiveness; (ii) strategic
repositioning; (iii) portfolio alignment; (iv)
organizational efficiency; (v) human capital
management; and (vi) financial soundness.

Design and Implementation of a
Balanced Scorecard

The long-term goal of the Balanced
Scorecard (BSC) is to integrate its use with
the resource allocation process by aligning
the Bank's strategic planning and budgeting activities with results-based management (RBM) processes and activities. During
2005, the Bank rolled out its Corporate
Balanced Scorecard on a pilot basis. It
is now available to all potential users,
including senior management and Executive
Directors. During the pilot phase, training on
the use of the BSC was offered to several
management staff and Executive Directors.
In the medium-term, development of the
BSC will continue with its integration into
the Corporate Data Warehouse.

The Multilateral Development
Banks’ Common Performance
Assessment System

This system provides a common source of
information for evaluating the contribution

Annual Report 2005

of MDBs to development for results, ani
for improving this contribution over time.
It is a joint system that provides MDBs
with a forum for exchanging information
and lessons learned and for responding
to international commitments on performance and accountability. It builds on synergies within the group, and uses the MDBs
as a unit of analysis rather than as a uni
of comparison.

The main principles guiding the development of the Multilateral Developmen
Banks’ (MDBs) Common Performance
Assessment System (COMPAS) include
strong ownership by all the MDBs, a
common framework for gathering an
presenting information, a focus on collective performance by the MDBs as a
group, joint responsibility for the COMPAS
Report, limited transaction costs in the
preparation of the Report, and transparency (full disclosure in the Report).
The basic framework for the COMPAS
builds on the existing framework of the
MDBs and on managing for results action
plans. The framework focuses on a limited
number of indicators, which were selected
on the basis of criteria such as relevance
of results, coverage, comparability, and
availability of data.

 

he Bank is represented in the MDBs'
COMPAS Task Force and actively particiated in developing the draft framework
and the initial choice of indicators. The
roposed framework was submitted during
he Roundtable Meeting on Harmonization,
Alignment, and Managing for Results, and
at the MDB Heads’ meeting in Washington,
D. C., in September 2005 for approval in
principle. The Bank has submitted its completed COMPAS Matrix to the coordinator
or final compilation and the output will
be published as the COMPAS Report in
early 2006. The outputs will also feed into
he Global Monitoring Report (GMR)
and into the Update on Cooperation
among MDBs.

 

Decentralization Strategy

The Bank Group’s Decentralization Strategy,
approved by the Boards in September
2004, included strengthening the existing
field offices network (in Batches 1 and 2)
and opening 16 new offices in 2005 and
2006 (Batches 3 and 4). The plan was to
establish and progressively operationalize
the 25 country and regional offices over a
two-year period, as follows: Batch 1 (Egypt,
Ethiopia, Gabon, Nigeria in 2000); Batch 2
(Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda
(Tunisia was superseded by the relocation
of the Bank in 2003) in 2004-2005); Batch
3 (Algeria, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mali,
Morocco, and Rwanda in 2005), and; Batch
4 (Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad,
Malawi, Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Zambia
in 2006). These offices are expected to
strengthen in-country activity and knowledge; conduct policy and strategy dialogue
with countries; participate in donor consultations; and constitute a focal point for key
project implementation aspects.

By end 2005, all offices in Batches 1 and
2 were operational. Under the accelerated
decentralization program, offices were
opened in Madagascar, Mali, Rwanda,
and Morocco in 2005. Of the 25 countries
approved for the Decentralization Strategy,
six have yet to conclude and sign host
country agreements. These are Angola,
Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Algeria
and Kenya.

During the year, the operational country offices participated in a number of
identification, preparation, and appraisal
missions. These offices were also active
in coordinating Bank activities related to
poverty work, policy and country dialogue,
and capacity building in their respective
countries or regions. They also coordinated
the Country Strategy Papers (CSPs) for
Madagascar and Malawi, and economic
and sector work in Uganda (the Uganda
Joint Assistance Strategy).Development Research,

Development Research

The Bank's Development Research unit
continued to generate and disseminate
knowledge on African development issues,
providing guidance to operational units
and informing policy makers in RMCs. To
further strengthen and re-orient the Bank's
research function, it increased the number
of research staff from two to six.

During the year, the bank continued to produce a number of publications, including
the following, which can be found on the
Bank's website (http://www.afdb.org):

. e African Development Report
2005 focused on public sector management in Africa, a critical policy issue.

. e African Economic Outlook
2004/2005 reviewed recent economic
developments in Africa and made projections for key macroeconomic variables until 2007. Its thematic topic for
2004/2005 was the financing of small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
e number of country studies was
ncreased from 22 to 29.

 

 

. e African Development Review
covered a broad spectrum of policy
development topics that are critical for
Africa's economic development. The
number of issues increased from two
to three per year.

¢ The Economic Research Working
Paper Series was re-launched in spring
2005, with the addition of nine working papers to the series.

Statistical Services
In 2005, the Bank provided technical support
for data collection to RMCs participating

in the International Comparison Program
‘or Africa (ICP-Africa). This support aimed
‘o help eligible countries conduct presurvey work such as logistics, survey
ramework development, and training of
tice collectors. Under the supervision of
he Bank, between January and June 2005,
48 RMCs started monthly data collection,
roviding the Bank with the monthly price
data of available goods and services for
he 853 products on the ICP-Africa list.
he Bank set up data quality network
and data validation processes for intraand inter-country validation procedures.
t developed two in-house Excel-based
‘ools (MergeCountryDataMacro and the
SEMPER) for intra-country data validation
and another tool (ELFA) for inter-country
validation. It also organized 12 seminars
and workshops to assist RMCs with data
validation. The first seminar brought
together officials from 51 countries to
discuss the development of a general
framework for quality control and quality
assurance guidelines. Subsequent seminars
were held at the sub-regional level. The
seminars provided an opportunity for
countries to share data quality control
experiences and strengthen partnerships.
A regional workshop on national accounts
was also organized to launch national
accounts activities and agree on relevant
methodologies.

 

In 2005, the Bank signed Protocols of
Agreement with four sub-regional organizations: AFRISTAT, COMESA, ECOWAS,
and SADC. In turn, these organizations
signed related Protocols of Agreement
with their respective countries. The first
disbursements for implementing ICP activities were paid to countries through their
sub-regional organizations. Countries
not belonging to these organizations —
Morocco and Tunisia—signed directly with
the Bank, while Algeria and Libya are in
negotiations. During 2005, the Bank also
developed a partnership with ONS-UK
(Office for National Statistics) and INSEE
Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

France (National Institute for Statistics
and Economic Studies) in connection with
supervision and data collection activities
in RMCs, the quality of data collected, and
methodology development.

The Bank is leading an_ international
effort to develop a Strategic Framework
for Statistical Development in Africa,
which will serve as the basis for coordinating all statistical support activities in
Africa. This effort, a joint collaboration
with the World Bank, Paris21, and ECA is
geared towards helping all RMCs develop
National Strategies for the Development
of Statistics (NSDSs) by end-2006, in line
with the Action Plan on Managing for
Development Results prepared during
the Second International Roundtable on
Managing for Development Results (held
in Marrakech). This will help RMCs develop
effective statistical systems to address data
deficiencies in their countries. The NSDSs
will be aligned with the PRSP process
to ensure the development of integrated
data systems that can effectively support
poverty reduction strategies and the results
measurement agenda.

In collaboration with the UNDP, the Bank
supported RMC's efforts to develop databases to facilitate the monitoring of MDG
indicators and improve statistical literacy
among policy makers, researchers, civil
society, and other stakeholders. During
the year, the Bank launched a biannual,
the African Statistical Journal, aimed at
promoting understanding of statistical
developments in RMCs. The journal will
also serve as a research outlet and information-sharing publication for academic
and practicing statisticians and economists.

The Bank continued to focus on developing
and managing the statistical systems needed to support its operational work and
development research activities. This
involved developing and maintaining (i)

socioeconomic databases covering the
major development indicators used to
monitor economic and social progress in
RMCs, and (ii) databases on Bank Group
operations to provide information on the
Bank's financial contribution to development efforts in RMCs.

Library Services

In 2005, the Bank’s Library installed and
successfully tested an integrated webbased information management system,
which will be fully operational in early
2006. The system comprises an information portal (an aggregate Web service that
captures information via multiple Internet
channels and search engines) that will
cater to those who want immediate access
to a broad range of online resources in
defined subject areas.

In addition, the Bank's Library continued to
maintain resource sharing and cooperation
arrangements with the libraries, research
centers, and information institutions of the
Bank's development partners, establishing
a networked consortium to achieve economies of scale in the acquisition and smooth
flow of information.

Operational Policy
Development and Review

Policy and review activities continued to
provide critical anchorage for strengthening the development effectiveness of
he Bank Group’s operational support
‘or RMCs. During 2005, these activities
ocused on four priority areas: preparaion and review of operational policies
and guidelines, operations quality review,
promotion of good governance, and microinance.

Operational Policies and Guidelines

During the year, the Boards approved
ive operational strategies, policies, and
guidelines, as outlined in Chapter 1. At
he end of the year, preparation was at an

 

Annual Report 2005

advanced stage on a number of operational policies and guidelines that will be finalized in 2006. Other activities include the
revision of supervision report formats—to
re-orient staff to manage Bank operations
for the achievement of results while maintaining a balanced approach to solving
procurement, disbursement, and related
issues; the development of indicators—to
measure the performance of field offices
in improving Bank operations related to
procurement, disbursement, supervision,
and harmonization and alignment; and the
development of a comprehensive review
checklist for appraisal reports—a qualityenhancement tool.

During the last quarter of 2005, the Bank
launched a consultative process involving internal and external stakeholders—to
identify the Bank Group's areas of comparative advantage. It prepared a concept
paper for participants, highlighting the
main issues that needed to be examined.
The exercise is expected to be completed
in early 2006, in time for the ADF-X MidTerm Review. The Bank Group also examined the problems and unique difficulties
confronting RMCs in prolonged conflict,
post-conflict, or governance crisis situations, and those prone to external shocks.
It started elaborating a comprehensive
and more effective development assistance
strategy—to be presented to the Boards in
early 2006—to better address the unique
characteristics and circumstances of these
countries.

Operations Quality Review

In June 2005, the Bank launched its quality-at-entry assessment (QEA) and qualityof-supervision assessment (QSA), signaling

ance (QA). It also prepared frameworks for
conducting the QEA/QSA and QA workshops, taking into account lessons learned
from the experiences of partner institutions,
in particular, the World Bank. These quality
assessments will complement the Bank's
internal review processes and are expected
to help strengthen portfolio performance
and raise the development effectiveness of
Bank Group operations.

Over 100 professionals participated in the
first QEA exercise, which identified areas
in the project preparation and appraisal
stages that need to be improved. The
appraisal reports of a structured sample of
27 operations were examined for “readiness for implementation” of the programs
and projects concerned. The majority of the
were deemed satisfactory. The following
areas were identified as needing improvements: risk analysis; assessment of existing
monitoring and evaluation systems and
institutional capacity; better use of lessons
learned; and improving the skills mix of
appraisal teams.

Promotion of Good Governance

During 2005, the Bank started developing a strategy and guidelines to combat
money laundering and terrorism as part
of its policy on good governance. To this
end, the Bank created a Bank-wide AntiMoney Laundering Group, which prepared
a concept paper on issues related to antimoney laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism and launched the
process of hiring consultants to prepare
the Bank Group's strategy, with related
staff guidelines and an action plan. The
strategy is expected to be ready in mid2006. In addition, following agreements
reached during the 2005 meetings of
the G8 in Gleneagles, the ADB and the
OECD are collaborating in the Partnership
Against Corruption in Africa to address
corruption challenges facing RMCs, particularly those receiving debt write-off.
The initiative is designed to assist RMCsaddress the supply and demand sides of
corruption, while focusing on strengthening institutions of integrity and specialized anti-corruption agencies.

Microfinance

During the year past, the Bank continued implementing its Business Plan:
Mainstreaming Microfinance into Bank
Group Operations, which was approved in
2003. Specific activities included cleaning
up the microfinance portfolio; developing
a Microfinance Policy and Strategy for the
Bank Group, in line with Internationally
Accepted Microfinance Standards and
Principles; recruiting qualified microfinance specialists; and consolidating
external partnerships with key bilateral
and multilateral microfinance institutions,
especially as 2005 was designated the
“International Year of Mircrocredit” by the
United Nations.

An updated database of 75 on-going
rojects, representing a total value at
approval of UA 989 million of ADF
resources, of which UA 189 million was
or credit components, provided the basis
or the Bank to take action to align these
rojects with microfinance principles and
est practice standards. Action plans for
50 projects were developed and are being
implemented; among them, mid-term
reviews, project restructuring, and rerogramming of funds to support capacity
uilding in the microfinance institutions
of the RMCs concerned. External partnerships in microfinance were cemented
hrough participation in the activities of
he Consultative Group to Assist the Poor
(CGAP), notably, in meetings to develop
and approve activities of the funding
agency consortium, and in the finalization
of the Donor Guidelines on Microfinance.
Bank staff also participated in important
microfinance conferences and seminars
on key areas such as the management
of remittance flows and the building of
inclusive financial systems in RMCs.

 

 

 

Evaluation of Operations

A major study was conducted in 2005 to
assess the independence of the Bank's
operations evaluation function. The study
was sanctioned by the Committee on
Development Effectiveness and was
conducted by external reviewers, who
assessed independent evaluation at the
Bank against the four requisite dimensions
in the Evaluation Cooperation Group's
template: organizational independence,
behavioral independence, avoidance of
conflict of interest, and protection from
external influence. The reviewers’ report
and a subsequent paper identified the
major evaluation gaps within the Bank
Group and recommended actions to close
them.

The Bank's monitoring and evaluation
capacity building efforts were enhanced
by a Regional Development Evaluation
Seminar, held in Tunis in April 2005. The
weeklong seminar was organized by the
Bank, in collaboration with the Joint Africa
Institute (JAI), the World Bank, and the
South African Public Service Commission.
Its primary objective was to introduce
key development evaluation concepts,
approaches, and methodologies to decision-makers engaged in PRSP activities in
Africa. Survey responses indicated a high
evel of satisfaction with the seminar. The
Bank's strategic partnerships with other
development partners, with respect to
evaluation, were further enhanced during
he year by the secondment of an adviser
rom the World Bank and the sharing
of experiences with the Inter-American
Development Bank.

 

n 2005, the Bank started working
on its Knowledge Management and
Dissemination Strategy. The rationale for
he strategy is the need for more accessible, relevant, and timely evaluation findings, lessons, and recommendations to
better influence the design and implemen
 

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

tation of Bank operations. To this end, for
the first time, a dedicated quarterly publication ‘Sharing’ was published to facilitate
the dissemination of evaluation findings,
lessons, and recommendations. The strategy’s action plan also aims to identify other
types of activities that can strengthen
dissemination, feedback, monitoring and
evaluation, and capacity building in the
Bank's independent evaluation function
over the next three years.

Internal Audit

The Bank Group's internal audit function
continued to provide independent and
objective assurance on various Bank Group
activities, including advisory and consulting
services, in compliance with International
Standards for the Professional Practice
of Internal Auditing. It systematically
evaluated risk management, control and
governance processes, adding value and
improving Bank operations. Thus, the 2005
annual work program was prepared with
a view to providing management with
reasonable assurance of the effectiveness
of the Bank's auditing systems and interna
controls. To this end, audit activities during
the year focused on Operations Complex
audits, planned Corporate and Finance
Complex audits, and specially requeste
audits.

The Operations Complex audits focused
on good governance, management, ani
accountability in projects and programs
funded by the Bank, within the Bank, an
in RMCs. The operational audits focused on
forming an overall opinion on the adequacy of the controls systems instituted by the
Bank, Borrowers, executing agencies, an
project implementation units, including
field verification of projects.

 

During 2005, AUDT conducted 11 audits in
selected RMCs, 12 Corporate and Finance
Complex audits, and two specially requested audits.

Annual Report 2005

394o

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

Futhermore, the Bank's strategic orientation
of opening new field offices and endowing
them with increased authority required
that AUDT provide reasonable assurances
that adequate control mechanisms would
be established and would function effectively as expected. In this light, AUDT
audited two field offices in 2005. Effective
November 1, 2005, the Banks’ Internal
Audit Department was renamed the Office
of the Auditor General; its functions are
discussed in Chapter 1.

Human Resources
Management

The Bank's total regular staffing complement at end-December 2005 was 1,020
(excluding 52 elected officers and staff
attached to the Boards), compared with
1,012 (excluding 31 elected officers) in
2004 and 987 in 2003 (see Table 3.1).
Staff comprised one Vice President, 22
Directors, 69 Managers (including 12
Resident Representatives), 583 professional, and 345 GS staff members. Of the
rofessional and management (PL) staff at
ost, 80 percent were from RMCs and 20
ercent from non-RMCs; while 20 percent
of management staff was from non-RMCs.
n total, 79 percent of PL staff at post was
male and 21 percent female. During 2005,
he Bank contracted 70 short-term staff, 31
of whom are deployed at the Bank’s headquarters in Abidjan, and 39 at the Tunis
RA offices, under special service contract.
n addition, 136 staff was engaged locally,
hrough temporary recruitment agencies,
‘or deployment at the Bank's TRA.

Staff Planning and Recruitment

he Bank pursued its efforts to align human
resources management with corporate priorities. Indeed, it sought to align business
strategies with human resource priorities
hrough a number of measures, including
(i) bringing on board 100 new professional staff by the end of the year— taking
into account diversity in terms of gender,

 

Annual Report 2005

age, and geographical representation; (ii)
providing new field offices and existing
offices with adequate staff; (iii) managing
the Program for Senior Analysts; and (iv)
managing and improving the Technical
Assistance, Secondment and Internship
programs.

The Bank's recruitment campaign,
relaunched in 2003, continued at an
increased pace during 2005. The campaign
focused on recruiting for priority operational areas and on diversity of panel members
to ensure geographical and gender representation. By end-December 2005, 75 new
staff, including three direct appointments,
had assumed duty; six new staff members
are expected to come on board during the
first quarter of 2006. Under the internal
mobility program, 45 professional staff
members were promoted through competitive processes. However, the recruitment campaign was put on hold pending
completion of the work of the TFIR, which
was established by the new President in
November 2005.

© ensure better representation of member
countries among staff, Bank recruitment
missions visited Austria and Switzerland in
2005, continuing the recruitment drive to
RMCs and non-RMCs launched in 2004.
he Bank also pursued efforts to ensure
diversity in gender and age among staff.
ndeed, 15.2 percent of staff members
recruited in 2005 were women; 9.2 percent of managerial positions were occuied by women; and the average age of
new staff was 42.5 years.

During the year, recruitment for field offices
was completed for Senegal, Madagascar,
Mali, and Mozambique, and a financial
management officer selected for the Sierra
Leone Program Office. Interviews were
concluded to fill vacancies in existing offices in Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Egypt, and
Gabon, and efforts are underway to recruit
staff in other field offices in Rwanda,

 

Morocco, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

During the year as well, the Program for
Senior Analysts (PSA), created in 2002,
reached an important milestone with the
absorption of its first 4 graduates into the
regular staff complement by end-2005.
Eight PSA participants were recruited in
2005, bringing the total number of PSA
recruits in the Bank to 36, of whom 77
percent were male and 23 percent female,
while 55 percent were from RMCs and
45 percent from non-RMCs. The Bank will
continue with this scheme in 2006, with a
target of 15 intakes per year.

The conditions and procedures of the
internship program were reviewed to
enhance its effectiveness. In 2005, 92
students completed internships with the
Bank; of this number, 45 percent were
emale and 55 percent male, while 70
percent were from RMCs and 30 percent
rom non-RMCs.

 

Futhermore, two technical assistants joined
he Bank in 2005, bringing to 14 the total
number of technical assistants in the Bank.
Eight professional staff also joined the
Bank on secondment, bringing the total
number of staff on secondment to 12.

Compensation and Benefits

During 2005, the Bank sought to enhance
efficiency in benefits administration
hrough process and information technology changes, slated to continue in 2006.
he impetus for these changes was the
Bank's manual administrative processes,
and payments and benefits, which account
or the bulk of the Bank's total expenses.
he improvements aimed at (i) achieving cost reductions through automation
and employee self-service, (ii) increasing
employee productivity and commitment,
and (iii) improving insights for better strategic planning. A number of business process initiatives were incorporated into theChapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

Annual Salary Review for
Professional Level (PL) Staff

On December 21, 2005, the Boards of
Directors approved management's proposal for a merit-based salary increase for
staff. Salary reviews continue to reflect the
Boards commitment to ensure competitive
remuneration for all staff categories and
to recognize and reward performance.
In response to an in-house review of the
competitiveness of the Bank's salaries in
relation to the comparator market, the
Boards of Directors approved management's proposal for average salary and
structural increases, to take effect from
January 2006. The Boards also directed
management to undertake a comprehensive review of the compensation (salary
and benefits) and classification systems
in 2006. This review will form the basis of
the next compensation policy (2008-2013)
and will ensure that the compensation
philosophy is relevant and provides an
integrated and coherent framework for
mobilizing staff members to fulfill the
Bank's mandate.

Health and Welfare

The Bank's Medical Center continued
to treat minor illnesses and to play an
active role in supporting and providing preventive medicine and advice on
country-specific health requirements and
risk exposure of traveling staff members. In addition, the Bank strengthened management and administration
of its Medical Plan, and staff members
and their dependents can now use the
healthcare system and network of direct
billing providers established in Tunis. The
Medical Plan now has over 4,500 insured
members and the Bank will continue to
implement cost reduction strategies for
the Plan in the coming years.

Staff Retirement Plan

In Januuary 2005, the Bank started implementation of the Staff Retirement Plan
(SRP) reforms adopted in November 2004.
The report on the 2005 Asset - Liability
Management Study (ALM) was presented to the Plan’s investment committee
by the scheme’s advising actuary, and
implementation of the report findings is
expected to start in 2006. Under the new
investment policy, the assets of the Plan
are invested with the objective of tracking
the returns of the MSCI-World Index (for
the equity portion of the invested assets)
and the Citigroup World Government
Bond Index (for the fixed-income part
of the invested assets). The underlying
currency exposures are hedged back to
their weights and composition in the unit
of account. As a result of the adoption of
this new policy, the portfolio of the SRP
Fund had to be rebalanced. Negotiations
with the external fund manager were
completed and a new investment management agreement signed. The benefits
of the new agreement include reduced
management fees and a flat fee for the
currency-hedging program. This new fee
structure became effective on January
1, 2005, and the new guidelines on
September 1, 2005.

 

In April 2005, Retiree Identity Cards were
distributed to new and existing retirees.
These cards will help SRP administrators
verify the existence of beneficiaries; the
cards will also provide retirees with a
document recognizing them as members
of the ADB Retirement Plan. During the
first half of 2005, the SRP processed
pension benefits for 487 retirees and
beneficiaries, for a total of UA 5.7 million.
Pension payroll was automated and successfully launched in May 2005, eliminating many of the manual procedures that
cause delays in the processing of benefits
payments. The actuarial valuation of the
Plan for 2005 was finalized, and the report
adopted by the investment committee. For

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

the first time, this report contains recommendations on the Bank's contribution to
the pension, following the reform of the
Plan.

Financial Management

The financial management function targets
two areas: the formulation of financial
and risk management policies, guidelines,
and procedures; and the monitoring and
reporting on compliance thereof. Financial
Complex operations fall under three thematic groups: (i) asset and liability management, (ii) credit risk management, and
(iii) treasury risk management.

Asset and Liability Management
The Bank's General Authority on ALM was
revised in 2005 to consolidate stand-alone
policy documents on market risks and
to bring related policies up to date with
recent market and institutional develo
ments. The revised framework document
is expected to strengthen Board oversight
by facilitating an integrated approach to
ALM throughout the Bank. Following the

e

F

approval of the revised ALM Authority, th
ALM guidelines for the ADB and the N
were updated to conform to the Authori
and to continue enhancing the document.

 

Credit Risk Management
The Bank continued to adjust its credit
risk management activities to the growing
emphasis on non-sovereign projects in
the Bank's lending operations. Through its
credit risk management team, it submitted
credit opinions on new commercial projects
with innovative structuring features to
the Board. The Bank also continued to
focus on improving project quality-at-entry
through the development and implementation of the Showcase Projects Initiative
(SPI) — aimed at providing staff with the
necessary tools to perform state-of-theart project appraisals, including pertinent
risk and stakeholder analysis. The SPI was
implemented through hands-on training,

 

 

Annual Report 2005

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

which culminated in the development of
relevant pedagogical materials.

Treasury Risk Management

During 2005, the Bank’s treasury risk management function focused on strengthening straight-through processing of treasury
transactions and on building decision support tools for performance analysis, risk
analysis, and control of treasury activities.
It also improved the reconciliation process
for reporting treasury transactions in the
general ledger. Following the adoption
of the fair-value option, it implemented
a methodology for the valuation of the
borrowing portfolio, to ensure compliance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

General Counsel and
Legal Services

The Bank continued to use the law as a
tool to promote socio-economic development in Africa, and to further the
compliance and effectiveness of internal
rules and regulations essential for smooth
institutional, operational, administrative
and financial affairs. Consistent with
this objective, the Bank’s legal function
ensured that major activities, including
the election of the new president, were
in consonance with provisions of the
Agreement Establishing the Bank and
with subordinate internal rules and regulations; and it facilitated a smooth transition of authority under the oversight of the
Board of Governors and of the Steering
Committee of the Board of Governors on
the Election of a President.

Other legal activities undertaken by the
Bank's legal function during the year
included designing and developing an
appropriate legal framework for the new
features of the ADF-X, and for the proposed debt forgiveness and compensatory
financing scheme under the MDRI, further
advancing resource mobilization for RMC

Annual Report 2005

development through the establishment of
new special funds and trust funds; notably, the NEPAD-IPPF and the Enhanced
Private Sector Initiative for Africa (EPSA);
and accelerating the implementation of
the Bank's decentralization program with
the conclusion of several negotiations
with host countries for the establishment
of field offices.

During the year as well, the Bank made
progress on the implementation of the
harmonization agenda, with its legal function providing clear guidance on the Bank
Group's capacity to engage in Budget
Support Loans and Sector Wide Approaches
(SWAps) in the context of specific Charter
provisions about the origin of goods and
services.

Other legal activities included providing
support to the Finance Complex in implementing the 2005 borrowing program,
advising on the establishment of an anticorruption and fraud investigation function
in the Bank's newly established Office of the
Auditor-General, seeking resolution of staffrelated disputes before the Administrative
Tribunal; and conducting (with the NEPAD
Secretariat) country reviews under the
African Peer Review Mechanism, continuing to focus on improved competitiveness
in Middle Income Countries (MICs) and on
debt management by RMCs, and providing
training for lawyers in RMCs under the
African School of International Financial
Law program.

Information Technology
Management and
Telecommunications

During the year, the Bank pursued its efforts
and made progress, under its Information
Technology and Telecommunications
Modernization Program, in implementing,
consolidating, and maintaining its information technology and telecommunications
infrastructure. The related major activities

and achievements during the year included
the following.

(i) Capitalizing on the substantial investment in information technology facilities
undertaken in recent years by ensuring that
staff continue to have access to, and are
fully trained in the use of, appropriate applications, software, and equipment, and that
the potential benefits of business process
reengineering were fully realized. Specific
achievements in this regard included:

e Implementing integrated enterprise
resource planning (SAP) applications
to enable single data capturing and
sharing across the Bank Group's business areas, and an Internet transaction
server, with secured access, to allow
staff to access SAP anytime from
anywhere; and training staff in the
Uganda and Egypt Country Offices to
use the SAP system.

e Upgrading SUMMIT, a fully integrated treasury system, to incorporate
enhanced features such as improved
SUMMIT/NUMERIX integration, implementation of a Web Access Module,
real time risk analysis, and effective
implementation of a pilot Collateral
Management Module (to be rolled out
in 2006).

 

©  Operationalizing the Bank’s Business
Continuity Plan (BCP). This involved
renewing the Bank’s contract with
SunGARD, the service provider, for
five years, with amendments. The
new contract covers all changes that
have occurred in the Bank's information systems architecture since 2003
and includes provision for a solution
(VytalVault) that backs up the Bank’s
data electronically to SunGARD.
However, the full implementation of
this solution will depend on the successful completion of the system tests
in progress. Under the contract, theBank will undertake regular readiness
testing at SunGARD's premises. These
investments helped improve efficiency
in daily operations and will ensure
business continuity in case of interruption of service at Headquarters.

¢ Installing a new operational information technology infrastructure at the
TRA in Tunis and continuing to upgrade
core applications (SAP, DARMS, and
SUMMIT) that have an impact on business continuity processes.

(ii) Upgrading satellite communications
systems to provide online access to HQ
systems and video-conferencing capabilities in the network of field offices. In this
regard, field office systems in Tanzania,
Uganda, Ethiopia, Senegal, Madagascar,
and Mali became fully operational in 2005.
At end-2005, negotiations were underway
with the respective regulators and governments in connection with commitments to
the grant telecommunications licenses and
permits for the remaining field offices.

(iii) Upgrading the Bank's knowledge management capabilities. During the year, the
Bank implemented the following knowledge management projects:

¢ DARMS: All Board documents (totaling
48,000) were captured and imported
into the system.

© Corporate Data Warehouse Project:
A phased development approach
was adopted: Phase 1 comprised all
data on projects, loans, missions and
travel, and accounting; Phase two, all
data related to institutional procurement, staff retirement plans, budget,
human resources part 1 (staff records,
benefits, and payroll), financial assets
mobilization and investments.

e The intranet and extranet platforms
were enhanced to provide capability
for searching internal data repositor
ies and databases. The system will be
integrated with in-house applications, and will have the capability
to grant external partners and staff
from sister institutions restricted
access to internal resources through
the extranet.

Administrative Services

Through negotiations with service providers, most maintenance contracts at
Headquarters were renewed at the same
cost level as during the previous two
years. Despite the suspension of the Bank's
investment program, some technical equipment at Headquarters was replaced to
avoid compromising their operation in the
long term. Installations at the TRA were
also upgraded to comply with fire security
regulations, and an advanced fire agency
was established on one of the sites occupied by the Bank. The Bank continued to
fit out and equip office space at the TRA in
Tunis to meet the increasing need generated by the implementation of the staff
recruitment program. Under its new procurement strategy, the Bank signed longterm contracts with international suppliers
in order to obtain preferential competitive
rates because of the variety and volume of
its acquisitions.

Procurement Policy and
Monitoring Services

The Bank continued to execute its procurement policy and monitoring functions,
reviewing procurement rules, developing
guidelines, and reviewing procurement
documents for operations units throughout the project cycle. It also continued to
review complex tender documents and
borrowers’ evaluation reports, participated
in 20 project-cycle missions covering several projects in RMCs, and helped operations
units resolve close to 240 complex procurement issues—a 30-percent increase
over the previous year.

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

During the year, the Bank's procurement function completed the Annual
Procurement Post Review Report for
2004. \t conducted procurement postreview missions for six on-going projects
identified in the Annual Portfolio
Performance Review as high-risk projects
(with procurement problems and disbursement rates that were about 50 percent).
In addition, it prepared 12 monthly briefs
summarizing sensitive procurement cases
officially received by the Bank for review
by management.

To support procurement capacity building
in RMCs, the Bank organized a number
of procurement-related workshops and
seminars, including 14 national project
implementation workshops. It also organized three procurement training seminars
for Bank staff; 10 seminars on business
opportunities in RMCs—to pursue dialogue, communication, and interaction
with clients and partners; and five other
seminars in Tunis for RMC delegations—to
disseminate information on procurement
opportunities created under the Bank's
projects.

The Bank's procurement unit also pursued efforts to harmonize, enhance, and
improve the Bank's procurement policies, procedures, and relations with partner institutions by participating in several activities, including a Meeting of
the Heads of Procurement to agree on,
and finalize amendments to, the Master
Procurement Documents for Works, and
for Plant Design, Supply, Install; and seven
international fora on procurement harmonization.

The Bank continued to work closely
with the World Bank to prepare Country
Performance Assessment Reports for three
RMCs (Burkina Faso, Senegal and Gabon).
Finally, the Bank began revising its procurement policies, rules, and procedures.
This exercise involves streamlining and

Annual Report 2005

Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

harmonization with other MDBs, and facilitating the use of country systems; it is
expected to be completed in 2006.

Corporate Communications

Using the full range of communications
platforms, the Bank's communications
function expanded institutional outreach
to external audiences—to improve knowledge and visibility of the Bank within
RMCs and non-RMCs. It also undertook
measures to improve internal communications, including the introduction of the
Bank in Action — a daily, English/French
electronic news bulletin presenting a snapshot of the activities of Bank staff at the
TRA in Tunis, in field offices, and in different parts of the world. A compendium of
Bank in Action bulletins will be published
at the beginning of 2006.

The election of a new president (during
the Annual Meetings in May 2005 and the
Extraordinary Annual Meetings in Tunis in
July 2005) generated intense media interest about the Bank, both within and outside Africa. In response to the heightened
demand for information about the Bank
Group and about the new President, the
Bank's Communications Division prepared
and distributed a series of backgrounders
in hard and in digital copy (CD-ROMs); it
also launched the publication of an ADB
Annual Meetings newspaper during the

Annual Report 2005

Meetings. The inauguration of the new
President on September 1, 2005, also
engendered great interest in the Bank,
resulting in wider and more robust interactions with major international media. As
a result several news organizations interviewed the President and key management
staff, leading to unprecedented positive
media coverage for the Bank.

During 2005, the Bank took the following concrete measures to implement the
Information Disclosure Policy adopted by
the Boards in 2004.

e It revamped its website to integrate
a more powerful search engine, and
incorporate design features to make
he site more user-friendly.

¢ It produced an Information Disclosure
Policy Guide that will be used to train
roject managers and other senior
staff, as of 2006.

¢ It opened a Public Information Center
(PIC) in its TRA in Tunis to improve
he dissemination of Bank information
and provide documentation on the
Bank's activities to visitors on mission
‘o the TRA. The Bank also initiated
discussions with the government of
anzania and with the World Bank,
‘o explore the possibility of opening
a joint pilot Development Information

 

Center in Dar es-Salaam. If successful,
this effort will be replicated in other
interested countries.

Institutionalizing development communications in the Bank will ensure that the
most important aspects of the Bank's
work benefit from quality stakeholder
awareness and participation that can only
be obtained through strategic outreach.
To this end, the Bank’s communications
staff reached out to project managers,
providing communications support during
project development and implementation,
among other activities. As well, to foster
communications and cooperation with
other partner organizations, the Bank
participated in external events such as
the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in
Washington D.C.; the African Journalist
of the Year Award, co-organized by the
Global Media Organization, Cable News
Network (CNN) and MULTICHOICE,
held in Nairobi, Kenya; and the Annual
General Assembly of the Southern African
Broadcasters Association, held in Arusha,
Tanzania.

ABank Group Corporate Communications
Strategy was also developed and will
be presented to the Boards in 2006.
The strategy will provide statutory and
material tools to expand communications on projects and disseminate
knowledge.Chapter 003 Corporate and Financial Management

During 2005, the Bank pursued its efforts to translate its policies, guidelines, and operational priorities into projects and
programs aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth and reducing poverty in its

regional member countries. This Chapter presents the Bank's activities in this regard and

examines the current status of Bank Group initiatives.

The Bank Group's Strategic
Approach

In line with its new strategic orientations
and priorities and with its operational
guiding principles (discussed in Chapter
2), the Bank continued to focus on the
following priority areas of intervention
at the country and regional levels to
achieve its twin objectives of stimulating
economic growth and reducing poverty
in RMCs.

© Country level: agriculture and rural
development; infrastructure, comprising transport, power supply, communications, water supply and sanitation; education; health; private sector
development; and good governance.

© Regional level: economic cooperation
and integration through continued
support for the New Partnership for
Africa's Development (NEPAD), the
African Peer Review Mechanism, and
water initiatives.

© Crosscutting issues: promoting sustainable environmental management and
gender equity.

The Bank also continued to support structural reforms and debt relief in RMCs
through the enhanced HIPC Initiative
and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
launched by the G8 countries in July
2005.

Bank Group Focus on
Poverty Reduction

The Bank's response to the persistent
and widespread poverty in Africa is multidimensional. It includes implementing its
new Poverty Reduction Policy; continuing
to support RMCs in their poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP) processes; strengthening Bank staff capacity in poverty analysis; and providing technical assistance,
advisory services, and Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) to RMCs. This response is
particularly important in light of the global
consensus to harmonize poverty reduction
policies, programs, and procedures, and of
the need to accelerate efforts to achieve
the MDGs.

Implementation of the Poverty
Reduction Policy

In line with management's declaration of
2005 as “the year of implementation”,
the Bank undertook several activities to
expedite the implementation of its new
Poverty Reduction Policy. These activities
included disseminating various elements
of the policy among staff; training staff in
the “economics of poverty”; and holding a
workshop on pro-poor growth and poverty
and social impact analysis (PSIA) and their
articulation in PRSPs. The Bank also took
further steps to deepen the poverty reduction dimensions of specific themes such
as agricultural development and pro-poor
growth, the promotion of gender equity,
and the allocation of more resources to the

education, health, and water and sanitation sectors.

With the approval, in July 2005, of the
new Annotated Format for Results-Based
Country Strategy Papers (RBCSPs), the
Bank also strengthened the poverty focus
of CSPs. Taking into account the funding
principles of the Bank's Strategic Plan,
the new format strengthens the linkage
between Bank operations and the priorities
set out in the PRSPs of RMCs. The format
emphasizes the importance of managing
for results and favorable outcomes. It also
highlights the significance of developing
viable, poverty-relevant monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems in the Bank and
in its RMCs. This will increase the Bank’s
contributions to policy harmonization, poverty reduction, and development effectiveness at the country level.

 

The progress report on lending and nonlending poverty reduction activities in
2001-2002 is being finalized, and the
report for 2003 has begun. The main
objective of these reports is to examine
the extent to which the Bank's Poverty
Reduction Policy is being used to inform
the institution's lending and non-lending
operations.

Collaboration with Development
Partners

As a result of the emerging consensus on
harmonization, alignment, and managing
for results, the Bank continued to strength
Annual Report 200552

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

en its collaborative arrangements with all
major multilateral and bilateral agencies
(World Bank, IMF, ECA, UNDP, UNFPA,
DFID, GTZ, and the SPA) on the shared
objective of poverty reduction. Areas of
collaboration included capacity and institution building; co-financing of programs and
projects, especially those related to PRSPs
and Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs); and harmonization of intervention
mechanisms. As part of this effort, the ADB,
the World Bank, and the UNDP organized
a policy harmonization workshop in 2005
to facilitate the implementation of PRSPs.
Joint support for PRSP implementation also
featured prominently in discussions at the
SPA meeting in Johannesburg in January
2005.

Stakeholder Participation
The Bank maintained its emphasis on a
participatory approach and on stakeholder
consultation in preparing and implementing policies and operations, and in executing non-financing activities. This was in
line with its focus on poverty reduction
and its support for the enhancement of
development effectiveness. In December
2005, the Bank organized a workshop for
24 participants from 19 RMCs, comprising practitioners and central bank and
government officials, to critically review its
new Microfinance Policy and Strategic
Orientations. By increasing its presence
in RMCs through more field offices, the
Bank will intensify its consultations with
key stakeholders and with development
partners.

During 2005, the Bank continued to guide
and nurture its growing interaction with civil
society organizations (CSOs). It dissemina
ed its policy on cooperation with CSOs to
Bank staff, RMCs, and other development
partners. The policy provides a framewor'
for improved collaboration with civil society. It underscores the Bank's commitment
to stakeholder participation as a key strategy for achieving its overarching objectives

 

Annual Report 2005

of poverty reduction and good governance,
while contributing to project quality and
sustainability. The Bank is also disseminating the Handbook on Stakeholder
Consultation and Participation in ADB
Operations. Furthermore, in consultations
with the World Bank, the UNDP and the
ECA, the Bank updated its database on
NGOs and CSOs in 2005. The new directory will be posted on the Bank's website
in early 2006.

Development Effectiveness
of Bank Group Operations

Portfolio Quality

Quality at Entry and During
Implementation

Consistent with the funding principles of
its strategic orientations and priorities, the
Bank pursued its efforts to improve the
development effectiveness of its operations.
In 2005, it adopted the Annotated Format
of the Results-Based Country Strategy
Paper (RBCSP) and the Bank Group Action
Plan on Harmonization, Alignment and
Managing for Results (HA&MER). It continued to focus on quality assurance (QA)
activities to improve the implementation
performance of its operations. This included
maintaining the core tasks of the internal review process; preparing the Annual
Portfolio Performance Review for 2004;
preparing the first QA workshop; launching the first quality-at-entry assessment
(QEA); preparing the quality-of-supervision
assessment (QSA); and revising selected
operational procedures, and designing new
ones.

In line with the Action Plan to
Improve the Implementation of ADF
Operations, in 2005 the Bank intro
duced a more formal and rigorous
QEA of Bank operations to improve
the quality of country operations.

he Annual Portfolio Performance
Review for 2004, which was endorsed by
e Boards of Directors in 2005, noted that
ere were improvements in some aspects
of the Bank's portfolio; the number of ageing operations had declined from 209 in
996 to 107 in 2003; and the number of
problem projects had decreased substanially, from 238 operations in 1995 to 32
operations in 2003 (proportionately from
35 percent in 1995 to 10 percent in 2003).
n contrast, the ratio of projects-at-risk rose
rom 33 percent in 2001 to 48 percent
in 2003/2003; while commitments-at-risk
increased from 34 percent in 2001 to 46
percent in 2005. The review also highighted continuing problems with procurement, poor adherence to implementation
schedules, and low disbursement rates.
Nevertheless, the Bank's efforts to reduce
he number of problem projects have paid
off as the number of such projects stabiized at about 10-12 percent over the past
ive years.

 

 

n 2005, the Bank organized a workshop
on quality assurance, aimed at strengthening staff capacity to mainstream quality
into all phases of the Bank's operational
processes. The workshop was part of an
ongoing process to strengthen the skills
and aptitudes needed to maintain high
quality standards in the design and implementation of operations.

 

In line with the Action Plan to Improve
the Implementation of ADF Operations,
in 2005 the Bank introduced a more
formal and rigorous QEA of Bank operations to improve the quality of country
operations. This first QEA was successfully implemented in 27 projects and
programs approved by the Boards during 2004. More than 100 Bank Staff
participated in the assessment exercise,
which highlighted some aspects of the
quality of Bank operations that management should focus on. The launching of
the QEA process provided the Bank witha diagnostic tool for analyzing the quality
dimensions of projects and programs. The
rocess identified operational weaknesses
in project implementation that should be
addressed by staff and management. It
also provided important benchmark data
or evaluating quality improvements in
Bank operations. Furthermore, the findings will facilitate Bank Group efforts
‘0 fine-tune the sequencing of quality
improvement interventions articulated in
he ADF-X Action Plan and in the Bank
Group's overall work program.

During the year, the Bank adopted a
ramework for assessing the effectiveness of results-based project supervision.
his process will be conducted through
a QSA exercise to be launched in 2006.
t is expected that the QSA will complement the Annual Portfolio Performance
Review by enhancing accountability and
institutional learning. The QSA process
will directly contribute to the overall
development effectiveness of Bank operations.

 

 

Results-Based Management

Since the Second High Level Forum on
Harmonization, Alignment, and Managing
for Results, held in Paris in 2005, the Bank
Group has been working on implementing
the managing for results agenda. Indeed,
the Bank Group's approach to resultsbased management (RBM) is anchored
to the following core principles: focusing
dialogue on results at all phases of the
development process; aligning programming, monitoring and evaluation activities
with the agreed expected results (aligning the Bank's country strategies to the
PRSPs or the National Development Plans
of RMCs); and using results information
to improve management's learning and
decision-making, as well as reporting and
accountability.

During 2005, the Bank Group introduced
an enhanced Results-Based LogFrame

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

tool to be used by staff during the
preparation, appraisal, supervision, and
evaluation of Bank operations, with a
view to achieving targeted results. It
organized three training sessions, which
were attended by more than 100 professionals from the Operations Complexes
and support units. To complement the
results-based operational toolkit, management prepared a QSA format that will
enable Operations Complexes to focus on
results during the operations supervision
process. As part of the process of transforming the Bank into a full-fledged RBM
institution, the Bank prepared ResultsBased CSPs for ADF-eligible countries
(RB-CSPs). All the 19 CSPs approved by
the Boards in 2005 for ADF countries
incorporated managing for results principles, with emphasis on better alignment with the countries’ PRSPs. The new
CSPs include a monitorable results-based
matrix that will be evaluated at the end
of the cycle.

The Bank also prepared the ADF-X Results
Measurement Framework (RMF), which
will be considered by the Boards in
2006. Prepared in close collaboration
with the IDA, the RMF proposes a set
of MDG-related indicators to be used in
monitoring poverty reduction outcomes
and the contribution of the ADF to these
outcomes in eligible countries. The RMF
is supported by a five-level action plan:
(i) Developing the capacity of RMCs to
formulate comprehensive and consistent
development strategies and strengthening their knowledge base by supporting
their PRSPs and building their national
statistical capacity; (ii) Aligning the Bank's
tools with country needs and improving
project monitoring and evaluation; (iii)
Reporting on development effectiveness
at the corporate level; (iv) Realigning staff
motivation and providing them with RBM
training; and (v) Enhancing management
buy-in and staff awareness of the RBM
process.

 

Bank Group Initiatives

In line with its new strategic orientations
and priorities, the Bank launched several
initiatives to help RMCs pursue their development efforts and make progress towards
achieving the MDGs. These initiatives
include the Harmonization, Alignment and
Managing for Results (HA&MER) Initiative;
the Africa Infrastructure Consortium; a
number of water initiatives (in particular,
the African Water Facility (AWF) and the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI)); the Enhanced Private Sector
Assistance for Africa (EPSA) Initiative; the
Middle Income Countries (MICs) Initiative;
and the FINESSE Program. The Bank also
continued to deepen its support for the
NEPAD Initiative.

The Harmonization, Alignment, and

Management for Results Initiative

Harmonization, alignment, and management for results is an important aspect
of the Bank’s efforts to improve development effectiveness. In line with this,
management adopted an Action Plan for
Harmonization, Alignment and Managing
for Results (HA&MfR), which is based
on five core principles: country ownership, harmonization, alignment, mutual
accountability, and managing for results.
Specifically, HA&MFR will improve development effectiveness by (i) strengthening country ownership and government
leadership of the development agenda;
(ii) aligning development assistance with
the development priorities and the resultsoriented strategies of the partner country;
(iii) aligning donor policies, procedures,
and practices with country processes and
systems rather than creating parallel systems; and (iv) strengthening the capacities of national systems and procedures.
These core principles translate into the
following operational directives: dialogue
should focus on results at all phases of the
development process; donors’ strategies
should be aligned with PRSPs or develop
Annual Report 2005

5354

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

ment plans; actual programming, monitoring and evaluation activities should be
aligned with the agreed expected results;
the results reporting system should be kept
simple, cost effective, and user-friendly;
management should be for, not by, results;
and results information should be used for
management learning and decision-making and for reporting and accountability.

During 2005, the Bank developed a comprehensive strategy for becoming a resultsbased management (RBM) institution. The
Bank's approach is based on a three-tiered
conceptual framework that will allow the
institution to intervene at the corporate,
country, and project levels, in order to
mainstream results-based management.
An information technology blueprint—
aimed at providing the institution with the
technical ability to implement the conceptual framework—and an implementation
plan were also developed. Implementation
of these RBM activities will continue using
resources earmarked under the Strategic
Resources Framework for Institutional
Development (SRFID).

The Bank is determined to implement
commitments and agreements made at
various international and regional fora on
HA&MER, and sees partnerships as key
to promoting the HA&MfR agenda. As a
result, it is involved in various partnerships
established to operationalize HA&MFR at
RMC and institutional levels. In this context, the Bank, together with the World
Bank and other partners, is shifting progressively from institutional-level harmonization activities to country-level activities
and program focus. To this end, in 2005
the Bank launched a system to document
important institutional and country-level
HA&MER activities. To expedite the country-level implementation of the Paris commitments and agreements and provide an
opportunity for exchange of experiences
and best practices, the Bank co-organized, with the World Bank, the UNDP,

Annual Report 2005

and the OECD's Development Assistance
Committee, a sub-regional workshop on
the Paris Declaration for 14 eastern and
southern African countries and their development partners, in Entebbe, Uganda, in
November 2005. A similar workshop for
Central, West, and North African countries
is planned for 2006 in Bamako, Mali.

The African Infrastructure
Consortium

Recognizing the pivotal role of economic
infrastructure in improving Africa's competitiveness, in exploiting its trade opportunities, in facilitating its integration into
the global economy, and in alleviating
poverty, G8 leaders, at their summit in
Gleneagles in July 2005, recommended
the setting up of an African Infrastructure
Consortium (AIC). The Consortium would
be jointly implemented by the African
Union, NEPAD, the World Bank, and the
ADB—with NEPAD as the lead infrastructure agency—to facilitate infrastructure
investment in Africa.

Following the G8 Summit, an AIC meeting was held in London to consider the
proposal, tabled by the UK, for the establishment of the Consortium. The meeting
brought together participants from the
AU, the NEPAD Secretariat, ECOWAS, the
European Union, the World Bank, and the
ADB. Participants unanimously agreed to
the UK proposal. After a series of follow
up activities undertaken by the UK and the
Bank Group, the AIC was formally launched
in October 2005 in London; the ADB
was selected to host the AIC Secretariat
because of its leadership role in infrastructure development under NEPAD.

The Consortium is a tripartite relationship
among bilateral donors, multi-lateral agencies, and African institutions, including subregional development banks in the continent. The African institutions are led by the
ADB, and membership in the Consortium
is open to donors who make significant
financial contribution to infrastructure
development in Africa. The AU Commission,
NEPAD secretariat, and regional economic
communities participate as observers in
meetings of the Consortium.

The primary objective of the Consortium
is to build a strategic partnership among
donors and stakeholders to facilitate the
development of infrastructure in Africa,
as prioritized by the AU/NEPAD and
national governments, in support of economic growth and poverty reduction. The
Consortium is a co-operative mechanism
aimed at removing bottlenecks to progress
in infrastructure development in Africa,
and an advocate for more funding for
infrastructure.

With respect to its activities, it will address
national and regional constraints to infra-structure development through advocacy,
co-ordination of interventions, sharing of
best practices, targeted strengthening of
capacity at regional and continental levels,
collective leverage on commitments and
delivery of infrastructure programs, collection of data for monitoring and evaluation,
support for project preparation activities,
and support for targeted analytical work in
support of infrastructure development. The
emphasis will be on regional infrastructure due to the peculiar challenges at the
regional level. The sectors to be covered
are transport, energy, water supply and
sanitation, information and communications technology.

Water Initiatives

More than any other sector, water and
sanitation cut across all major aspects of the
development agenda — poverty alleviation,
environmental sustainability, private sectorled growth, education, participatory development, and good governance. Investment
in water resource development is therefore
a major strategy for promoting economic
growth and achieving poverty reduction. Yet,
water resource development and utilization
in Africa is abysmally low. Only three percent of total renewable water resources are
tapped for domestic, agricultural, and industrial consumption each year. In fact, some
300 million people in Africa have no access
to safe water and about 313 million have no
access to sanitation. To correct this situation
so as to ensure sustainable economic growth
and improve the living standards of people
in RMCs, the Bank focuses on water resource
development and management as one of its
core areas of intervention. To this end, it has
undertaken various water initiatives with the
support of regional and international stakeholders. These initiatives include the Rural
Water and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI), the
African Water Facility (AWF), spearheaded by the African Ministerial Council on
Water (AMCOW), and the NEPAD Water
and Sanitation Program within the NEPAD
Infrastructure Program.

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

The Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Initiative

The RWSSI is the Bank's most significant water
initiative. It was designed as the institution's
medium for attaining the main goals of the
African Water Vision and the MDGs on water
and sanitation for rural areas. The primary
objective of the RWSSI is to mobilize African
governments and international donors to
accelerate investments in rural water supply
and sanitation in order to improve access to
water and sanitation for rural populations.
The strategic plan underscores that the main
target of the RWSSI is to extend safe water
and basic sanitation coverage to 80 percent
of rural dwellers by 2015, from a base level
of about 47 percent for water supply and
44 percent for sanitation in 2000. The cost
of total resource requirements for achieving
80 percent access to water and sanitation by
2015 is estimated at US$ 14.2 billion.

 

 

The RWSSI is based on partnerships with
other donors and stakeholders. It encourages stakeholders to implement, manage,
and operate community-based country
programs. This approach fosters country
ownership and operational consistency,
and reduces duplication of efforts by harmonizing external assistance.

With regard to partnership with other
donors, the World Bank and the African
Development Bank held a joint retreat in
Tunis on October 3 and 4, 2005, to share
experiences and develop joint investment
programs in RMCs. They reached a tentative agreement to set up a joint technical
assistance unit for water and sanitation
projects in the ADB in January 2006.

In November 2005, the Bank approved a UA 25.6 million grant to finance the Yaoundé Sanitation
Project in Cameroon. The project is co-financed by the Government in the amount of UA 2.89 million.

Background: The main rainwater drainage system in Yaoundé is regularly blocked by solid waste, leading to flooding in some areas in the city. This disrupts the city’s socio-economic activities, increases the
spread of water-borne diseases, pollutes the water treatment station, and causes environmental damage.
To address the problem, the government prepared a Yaoundé City Sanitation Master Plan, with financing
from the Bank Group. The plan, which was completed in 1996 and its engineering design updated in
2002, is the basis for the preparation of the Yaounde City Rainwater Drainage Project, and, ultimately,

the Yaoundé Sanitation Project.

Objectives: The specific objectives of the project are to (i) improve rainwater drainage in Yaoundé; (ii)
improve the living conditions of the city's population; and (iii) build the capacity of the sector's stake
holders.

Outputs: The expected outputs from the project include (i) construction of a canal that is 4.32 kilometers
long; (ii) protection and cleaning of three underground collectors that are about 2.35 kilometers long; (iii)
development of two maintenance roads on either side of the canal and construction of access ramps; (iv)
construction of two footbridges, a rail bridge, and a road bridge; (v) building of four disposal structures
at the level of the forks which empty into the canal; (vi) construction of 50 containers and installation
of 50 garbage bins along the canal; (vii) development of the areas around the canal (paving of four
kilometers of footpaths, planting of trees and gardens, installation of 54 public benches and public
lighting, building of two parking areas, each 400 square meters, and of two shelters; (viii) provision of
short term sanitation training abroad for some staff members from the Yaoundé District Communes, the
Directorate of Technical Services, the Yaoundé Urban Observatory and some associations and NGOs; and
(ix) establishment of a project monitoring and evaluation system.

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

In December 2005, the Bank approved a UA 43.6 million grant to finance the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Program in Ethiopia. The program is co-financed by other donors (UA 80.36 million); the
Government (UA 46.22 million); and communities (UA 10.17 million).

Background: Since 1999, the Government of Ethiopia has formulated several water supply and sanitation policies, strategies, and programs. Nevertheless, rural water supply and sanitation coverage remains
low at 24 percent and eight percent, respectively. Using a demand-driven approach to services delivery,
the Government intends to raise national rural water supply and sanitation coverage to 62 percent and
54 percent, respectively. Ethiopia is among the five countries selected for the initial implementation of
the Bank Group's Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, aimed at assisting RMCs achieve the
MDGs and the African Water Vision targets for water supply and sanitation in rural areas.

Objectives: The main objective of the program is to improve access to rural water supply and sanitation
services in Ethiopia, thereby contributing to the achievement of water-related MDGs.

Impact and Outputs: The expected outputs from the project include (i) construction of 24,500 water
points, 10,000 demonstration latrines, and 6,500 communal latrines in schools, clinics, and rural growth
centers by 2008; (ii) rehabilitation of 1,550 water points by mid-2008; (iii) construction of up to 1.45
million improved traditional pit latrines by communities—with own financing—by mid-2008; (iv) training in the implementation of the RWSS program for 15 staff from the Ministry of Water Resources and
the Ministry of Health, 108 staff from Regional Water Bureaus and Regional Health Bureaus, 5,500 staff
from Woreda Water Desks and Woreda Health Desks, 800 artisans as local service providers, 600 community facilitation teams, and 52 Woreda Support Groups; (v) training in water services management for
96,000 community representatives, comprising 30 percent women, from 12,300 water communities; (vi)
provision of hygiene education for over 100,000 community representatives; (vii) quality testing of field
water in 550 Woredas by mid-2008; (viii) installation of computer hardware and software for databases
and management information systems at various ministries and institutions and training of staff to use
them; and (ix) availability of spare parts at the community level.

With these measures, the rural water supply and rural sanitation coverage are expected to reach 62
percent and 54 percent, respectively, by 2015.

The African Water Facility

The AWF, an initiative led by the African
Ministerial Council on Water (AMCOW),
aims to mobilize resources for water infrastructure development in Africa. Its objective is to raise about US$615.7 million to
finance facilitation and capital investment
activities. The Facility’s resource mobilization efforts are spearheaded by AMCOW
and the AWF Governing Council, with
support from the Bank. By end-2005, the
European Commission, Canada, France,
Norway, Austria, Sweden and Denmark

had pledged to provide financial support—amounting to 9.6 million at end2005—for the Facility. The Bank has also
committed to contribute about 1.8 million
over 3 years to cover permanent staff,
management and other administrative
costs, including office space.

Other significant achievements under this
initiative in 2005 include the appointment
of the AWF Director and two senior professional staff; the first inaugural meeting of
he AWF Governing Council; the approval
of AWF Operational Procedures by the
Board and the adoption of the Five-Year
2005-2009 Operational Program and of
he Budget for 2006.

The Enhanced Private Sector
Assistance for Africa Initiative

he Bank's Strategic Plan underscores that
a vibrant and robust private sector is
essential to achieve the Bank's objecives of sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction in RMCs. Nevertheless,
developing a vibrant private sector remains
a daunting challenge for Africa because of
ow savings, capital flight, and inadequate
oreign direct investment.

 

n 2005, the Government of Japan expressed
interest in collaborating with the ADB to
develop the private sector through a special initiative called the “Enhanced Private
Sector Assistance for Africa” (EPSA). This
initiative is in line with the Bank's Private
Sector Development Strategy (PSD Strategy).
It comprises two components: a grant component available for public and private
sector operations, and a loan component
of US$1 billion for sovereign and nonsovereign guaranteed lending operations.
This integrated approach provides strong
support for the PSD Strategy, which mainstreams private sector development into all
aspects of the Bank's operational activities.
Under EPSA, donors will be invited to cofinance government-sponsored programs
and activities for private sector developmentin African countries. However, due consideration will be given to the debt sustainability of each recipient, and to the ongoing
discussions among the international financial institutions on a forward-looking debt
sustainability analysis framework.

hrough the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC), Japan will provide concessional loans to regional member counries from its ODA resources; and the Bank
will undertake project cycle activities such
as project preparation for the JBIC. Where
appropriate, loans will be combined with
echnical assistance grants to enhance
he overall resource package for borrowers. In addition to sovereign guaranteed
loans to finance government-sponsored
rograms for private sector development,
EPSA will facilitate direct lending to private
enterprises, commercially operated pubic enterprises, and sub-sovereign entities
without a sovereign guarantee, to provide
he required infrastructure for industrial
and commercial development.

 

 

The Fund for African

Private Sector Assistance

The grant component of EPSA will be
financed with Fund for African Private
Sector Assistance (FAPA) resources. The
donor community and Japan are expected
to contribute US$200 million to establish
this Fund. Indeed, Japan has pledged to
provide an initial contribution of US$20
million, which could be increased by up
to 20 percent of the targeted donor contribution over the next five years. FAPA
resources will be used to provide untied
grants for studies, technical assistance, and
capacity building to governments, regional
economic communities and similar intergovernmental organizations, research institutions, commercial enterprises, and so on.
The grants will enhance the Bank's ability
to be more active in the upstream phase
of the project preparation cycle, thereby
strengthening the quality of its pipeline of
bankable projects. The resources will also

serve to promote innovative programs that
specifically support SMEs.

The Middle Income Countries
Initiative

Middle-income countries (MICs) in Africa
are countries that have achieved significant
rogress in raising their living standards,
ut still face a number of development
challenges, including (i) persistent pockets
of poverty and inequality; (ii) vulnerability
‘0 shocks; (iii) pressures from globalization
and economic integration; and (iv) private
sector development. As a result of these
challenges, several MICs are not on track
‘o meet the MDGs and need financial
assistance to do so. Some MICs, such as
Morocco and Tunisia, have often turned
‘o the Bank for financial assistance for
heir development programs; others, such
as Algeria, Egypt, Mauritius, Nigeria, and
South Africa have left their borrowing allocations largely untouched, opting for other
inancing options.

 

he Middle-Income Countries Initiative
seeks to address the needs of RMCs, as
well as those of low-income countries tha

changes in Bank policies, procedures, ani
products to help these RMCs achieve the
MDGs and improve the competitiveness o
Bank Group operations.

¢ Technical Assistance: The amount o
the MIC Trust Fund should be increase
by UA 15 million from the ADB's ne
income, and annual increases shoul
be provided as needed. The technica
assistance ceiling per project shoul
also be raised from UA 100,000 to
UA600,000.

 

 

© Competitive Pricing: The commitmen
fee for all new sovereign-guarantee
loans should be eliminated, and the
range of commitment fees for nonsovereign guaranteed operations
expanded from (0.5 percent - 1 per
cent) to (0 percent - 1 percent). The
lending spread should be decreased
from 0.5 percent to 0.4 percent, and
the funding margin for new sovereign
loans eliminated. Finally, the market
risk premium should be eliminated for
all new fixed-rate sovereign and nonsovereign loans.

¢ Environmental Impact Assessments:
The publication of Environmental
Impact Assessments for private sector projects in all countries should be
reduced from 120 days to 60 days for
Category 1 projects, to facilitate loanprocessing procedures.

e Enhanced Quality and Development
Effectiveness: A committee should be
established to ensure implementation,
monitoring, and reporting of recommended activities, and management's
undertakings in the Initiative. The committee should prepare periodic reports
for consideration by the Board.

Financing Energy Services for
Small-Scale Energy Users Program
Since 1994, the development community
has consistently and increasingly singled
out energy as central to poverty reduction. Indeed, to effectively tackle poverty in Africa, the Bank must address the
evolving challenges of the energy sector
in its interventions. In line with this, the
Bank's renewable energy and energy efficiency program encourages African countries to mainstream renewable energy
and energy efficiency projects and programs with support from the Bank. This
is done through the FINESSE programs
financed by the Dutch Government to
the tune of US$5.3 million. The program
seeks to promote the efficient use of
the continent's vast renewable energy
resources,

During 2005, the Bank consulted various
stakeholders, with a view to refining and

Annual Report 2005

5758

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

guiding its interventions in the energy sector, particularly in the sustainable energy sub-sector. This process culminated
in a regional consultative workshop in
February 2005, which was attended by
over 80 participants, including representatives from more than 30 African
countries. The Bank also organized several sensitization and awareness-raising
seminars to enhance the capacity of
Bank staff to manage sustainable energy investment projects. Furthermore, to
mainstream sustainable energy projects
into its operations, the Bank stressed the
inclusion of sustainable energy in the
preparation of CSPs. It also identified
specific sustainable energy projects and
programs for inclusion in its portfolio;
and launched a process to identify and
develop, in its operations, project components that can benefit from GEF grant
resources. It also established strategic
partnerships with various bilateral and
multilateral development organizations
with a view to collaborating in the area of
renewable and sustainable energy.

The FINESSE program will increase the
capacity of Bank staff and of RMCs to handle sustainable energy investments, design
a policy framework to guide Bank operations, and develop an extensive portfolio
of sustainable energy investment projects.
In so doing, the Bank is positioning itself
to effectively help African countries fulfill their development aspirations through
increased access to energy. These activities will also enable the Bank's regional
member countries to meet the objectives
of global environmental conventions such
as the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity, the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification, and
the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change.

 

The NEPAD Initiative
The NEPAD Initiative is a holistic approach
to the development of the continent. Since

Annual Report 2005

its inception, it has advocated a development paradigm based on collective
responsibility, ownership, development of
new partnerships, and mobilization of
local capacities and resources.

The NEPAD Heads of State and
Government Implementation Committee
mandated the Bank Group to be the lead
agency for infrastructure development
and to guide African countries in developing banking and financial standards.
It also designated the Bank as a strategic partner of the African Peer Review
Mechanism (APRM).

The NEPAD Strategy for Infrastructure
Development includes a short- term
action plan (STAP) complemented by a
medium- to long-term strategic framework (MLTSF). For the most part, STAP
projects under NEPAD are financed by
multiple partners. The Bank's contribution
or 2002-2005 consisted of US$532.6
million to finance 33 projects/initiatives,
and US$1.6 billion in co-financing.

he MLTSF is being financed at a total
cost of US$3.9 million, of which US$1.4
million will be provided by the Nigeria
echnical Cooperation Fund (NTCF). The
procurement process for hiring a consulting firm to conduct the study was
aunched and a consulting firm should
e recruited in early 2006. The MLTSF
will provide a coherent and strategic
ramework for defining, implementing,
and monitoring infrastructure development in the continent. Furthermore, the
NEPAD Infrastructure Project Preparation
Facility (NEPAD-IPPF), established within
he Bank in 2004 with CAN$10 million
in seed funding from Canada, was converted into a multi-donor facility in 2005.
he Danish Government has already conributed US$500,000 to the facility and
more donors are expected to participate.
o date, the IPPF has supported the
preparation of five physical projects.

 

 

The NEPAD provides the overall framework
for directing water resources development
efforts to achieve the strategic goal of
ensuring water security for Africa. The Bank
assisted NEPAD in implementing its water
and sanitation infrastructure development
program to enhance regional integration.
The NEPAD STAP includes the development of national integrated water resource
management policies, projects to mitigate
floods and droughts and to meet basic
needs, and trans-boundary water resource
management projects. The implementation
of this aspect of STAP focused on seven
river basins: the Rivers Niger and Senegal
in West Africa; River Congo and Lake Chad
in Central Africa; River Nile in East Africa;
and Rivers Zambezi and Okavango in
Southern Africa. NEPAD's medium- to
long- term strategic framework also comprises a water and sanitation infrastructure program.

 

With respect to the APRM, the Bank's
activities in 2005 were directed at providing further assistance on country assessments to the APRM Secretariat and Panel
of Eminent Persons. In this context, the
Bank took part in all the nine support missions conducted in 2004 and
2005 to launch national self-assessments
in Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Rwanda,
Uganda, Nigeria, Algeria, Benin, and
South Africa. In 2005, the Bank also participated in three APRM country review
missions to Ghana, Rwanda, and Kenya
to validate the findings of the country
self-assessment reports and finalize the
country action plans. It provided assistance to the APRM Secretariat and to the
APRM Panel for the preparation of the
country review reports.

During the year as well, the Bank also
collaborated with the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa to
address economic governance issues
in RMCs, especially on country assessments. It supported the Association ofAfrican Development Finance Institutions
in developing prudent financial standards
in 2005.

Sectoral and Crosscutting
Activities

This section presents the Bank's interventions at the country and regional levels,
focusing on the key sectors defined in its
Strategic Plan and in the Action Plan to
improve ADF operations. Specific projects
and programs approved in each sector
during the year are described in the Project
Profiles in Chapter 6.

Agriculture and Rural Development

Poverty in Africa is predominantly a rural
phenomenon, with the majority of the
poor engaged in agriculture-related economic activities. Within this context, and
consistent with the Bank's new strategic
orientations and priorities, and with its
efforts to help African countries meet the
MDG of halving the incidence of poverty
by 2015, the Bank continued to focus its

 

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

operations on agriculture and rural development. Its poverty reduction strategies
include measures to improve productivity,
raise economic growth rates, and enhance
the development effectiveness of Bank
Group operations. In line with this, it suports RMCs efforts to develop comprehensive and pragmatic plans for agricultural
modernization and rural development.
he plans focus on agricultural policy,
institutional and technological changes,
he development of small- and mediumscale agriculture-based enterprises, microinance, commercialization of agricultural
roducts, food security, community-based
programs, resource management, and the
development of rural infrastructure such
as feeder roads, rural electrification, irrigation schemes, and crop storage facilities.
he Bank Group also supports RMCs in
preparing Country Economic and Sector
Work (ESW) in agriculture and rural development, and in undertaking appropriate
measures to address their low institutional
capacities, which hamper their development efforts.

 

During 2005, the Bank Group approved
loans and grants for 21 projects in the
agriculture and rural development sector.
Total approvals for the sector amounted to
UA 231.1 million, or 13.3 percent of total
Bank Group approvals for 2005, compared
with UA 274.5 million, or 15.8 percent of
Bank Group approvals in 2004. Thus, compared with 2004 approvals, Bank Group
approvals for the sector decreased by 15.8
percent, due to a strategic shift to infrastructure and to the social sector, with particular emphasis on water and sanitation
and rural electrification. Concessional and
non-concessional window approvals stood
at UA 208 million and UA 23.1 million,
respectively, representing 90 percent and
10 percent of total assistance to the sector,
respectively. This compares well with 2004
when concessional and non-concessional
window approvals were UA 242.4 million
and UA 31.1 million, respectively, and represented 88.3 percent and 11.7 percent of
total assistance to the sector, respectively.

From 1967 to 2005 cumulative loan and
grant approvals for the agriculture and rual
development sector amounted to UA 6.64
billion (for 755 projects), representing 18.1
percent of total Bank Group cumulative
lending.

Projects approved in 2005 were at the
national and multinational levels, and
focused on far-reaching poverty reduction
operations, food security, fisheries, environmental protection, and the upgrading
of rural and feeder road infrastructure. The
10 key beneficiary countries were Angola,
Chad, The Gambia, Guinea, Madagascar,
Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and
the Democratic Republic of Congo. The
specific projects financed are outlined in
the Project Profiles in Chapter 6.

In October 2005, the Bank approved a UA 20.0 million loan to finance the Casamance Rural
Development Project in Senegal (PADERCA), with the aim of increasing the agricultural output in the
region on a sustainable basis. The project is co-financed by the Government of Senegal and project
beneficiaries in the amount of UA 4.5 million.

Background: At the beginning of the 1980s, the Casamance, a region endowed with considerable agricultural potential, was paralyzed by a separatist insurrection, which had a negative impact on the local
economy and hampered development efforts. After the signing of a peace agreement and the creation
of the National Agency for the Revival of Socioeconomic Activities in Casamance (ANRAC) in 2004, the
Bank expressed its willingness to provide support for the reconstruction of the region. This led to the
creation of PADERCA.

Objectives: The primary objective of the project is to support rural development through the conservation and development of water, soil, and forest resources. The specific objectives include (i) safeguarding
agricultural production, (ii) protecting the natural environment, and (iii) increasing the income of farmers.
This intervention will complement the Bank's ongoing and future activities in Casamance under the Road
Maintenance Program and Water Initiative, making the Bank one of the major players in the region.

Impact and Outputs: The project will generate numerous jobs for skilled and unskilled people (including
displaced or demobilized populations), improve agricultural productivity (raise cereal production by 42,000
tons), and improve access to basic services (potable water, education, health, and transport). In addition, the
project will have a positive impact on the environment through natural environment regeneration measures
(nearly 15,000 ha of rehabilitated lands). The incomes of farmers will also increase by over 35 percent. These
measures will significantly improve the living conditions of rural communities.

to economic and social sectors. Developing
water supply and sanitation facilities contributes to food security by making available water for irrigation; it also contributes
to good health by providing safe drinking
water and sanitation. Improved transportation infrastructure removes barriers to
the movement of goods and people and

increases economic activity. Therefore,
consistent with the Bank's Vision and
with the guiding principles of its Strategic
Plan, infrastructure development is one of
the priority areas for Bank Group assistance.

During 2005, the Bank Group supported
23 infrastructure projects with UA 687.1
million, representing 39.4 percent of total
Bank Group approvals. Compared with
2004, Bank Group approvals to the secor rose by 1.7 percent, from UA 675.7
million to UA 687.1 million. The bulk
of approvals in 2005 were for power
supply projects (40.1 percent); transporation (30.9 percent); and water and
sanitation (29 percent). Relative to 2004,
Bank Group approvals for water and
sanitation increased by 65.4 percent,
rom UA 120.4 million to UA 199.1
million; approvals for power increased
by 392.7 percent (from UA 56 million
0 UA 275.9 million), while approvals
or transport decreased by 57.5 percent
(from UA 499.3 million to UA 212.1 milion). Concessional window allocations
increased by 68.9 percent (from UA 246.4
million to UA 416.3 million), while nonconcessional window lending decreased
by 36.9 percent (from UA 429.3 million to
UA 270.8 million). Cumulatively, since
1967 the infrastructure sector has received
UA 13.2 billion, or 36 percent of loans
and grants approved by the Bank Group.Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

 

In December 2005, the Bank approved a grant of UA 52.5 to finance the Nsele-Lufimi and KwangoKenge Roads Rehabilitation Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The project is also cofinanced by the DRC Government in the amount of UA 5.8 million.

Background: The reopening of major roads is a top priority for the DRC Government under its Minimum
Partnership Program for Transition and Recovery, 2004-2007. This includes the rehabilitation of the
Nsele-Lufimi and Kwango-Kenge roads, situated on National Highway 1. These roads link the capital
Kinshasa to the provinces of Bandundu, West Kasai, and East Kasai, which are among the country's
major breadbaskets.

Objective: The objective of the project is to re-establish access to major urban centers, densely populated
areas, major economic activity centers and the other countries of the sub-region, to foster economic
growth. This comprises about 10,200 kilometers of national roads.

Outputs: As a result of the project (i) 94.6 kilometers of road, between Nsele and Lufimi, and 72.8
kilometers of road, from Kwango to Kenge, will be rehabilitated; (ii) 140 kilometers of feeder roads will
be improved; (iii) seven drinking water supply points and seven rural markets will be developed; (iii)
fences for six schools built; (iv) about thirty stalls and warehouses reconstructed; (v) about 15,000 people
sensitized to problems related to road security, environmental protection, the fight against water-borne
diseases such as diarrhea and malaria, and sexually transmissible diseases such as HIV/AIDS; (vi) 90 senior officials will be trained in procurement, contracts, project site supervision techniques, environmental
management, transport project accounting, and road investment; (vii) computer and office automation
equipment will be acquired; (viii) complete survey reports and bidding documents for the Loange-Mbuji
Mayi road (601 kilometers) improvement works will be produced; and (vii) an audit of project accounts
will be set-up.

In 2005, the Bank's operations in the
water and sanitation sub-sector focused
on the provision of rural water supply
and sanitation. The Bank’s activities in
the energy sub-sector focused on (i) rural
electrification—to stimulate rural development, and (ii) interconnection of energy
systems at the regional level—to allow

energy transfers from regions with readily
available energy to areas of scarcity. In
the transport sector, the emphasis was
on road improvement, affordable transportation costs, and better living conditions for people. The eight RMCs that
benefited during the year were Guinea,
Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Madagascar,

Chad, Ethiopia and Burundi. The specific projects funded are discussed under
Project Profiles in Chapter 6.

Social Development

The challenge of meeting the MDGs is
becoming increasingly urgent as the 2015
target date approaches. During 2005, the
social sector continued to gain prominence in Bank Group support to RMCs for
the achievement of the MDGs, consistent
with the priorities outlined in the Bank’s
Strategic Plan. The Bank continued to
provide assistance for (i) control of HIV/
AIDS and other communicable diseases,
(ii) access to quality primary health care,
(ii) basic and vocational education, (iv)
post-conflict reconstruction, and (iv) other
targeted poverty reduction interventions.
During 2005, the Bank Group approved
loans and grants for 27 social sector
operations, amounting to UA 233.7 million, or 13.4 percent of total lending for
the year. Compared with 2004, approvals
to the social sector increased by 48.8 percent (from UA 157.1 million to UA 233.7
million). Cumulatively, UA 4.3 billion or
11.7 percent of loans and grants approved
by the Bank Group since 1967 have been
to the social sector.

In November 2005, the Bank Group approved a UA 20.00 million grant to finance the Support for Post-Primary Education and Training Project (Education III
Project) in Uganda. The project is co-financed by the Government of Uganda in the amount of UA 2.23 million.

Background: The universal primary education program in Uganda has been remarkably successful: After ten years, primary school enrolments have increased from 2.2
million in 1993 to 7.6 million, an annual rate of increase of 13.2 percent. This achievement is putting pressure on the post-primary system, which lacks the capacity
to absorb the primary school graduates. The transition rate from the primary to the secondary level is about 40 percent, and the Government plans to raise it to 80
percent by 2015, to ensure that an increasing number of children acquire full basic education (primary education and at least four years of secondary education). To
this end, the dual strategy is first to strengthen lower secondary education (S1-S4) for it to adequately serve the purpose of being a substantive upper end of the basic
education cycle, a basis for further education and training, and preparation for direct employment. Second, to offer $4 graduates an alternative option by improving
the quality and relevance of Business, Technical, and Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) in relation to the employment opportunities in the economy.

Objectives: The specific objectives of the project are (i) to improve access to, and the quality of, secondary education to underserved communities, and (ii) to
contribute to the development of a more relevant and effective training system for business/technical/vocational skills.

Impact and Outputs: The expected outputs of the project include (i) construction of 24 new seed secondary schools in rural communities, equipped with laboratories, and with teaching and learning materials to support the teaching of science and mathematics; (ii) completion of six existing seed schools, with the addition
of more buildings and equipment; (iii) rehabilitation of six existing grant-aided public secondary schools, including the addition of laboratories and libraries; (iv) the
provision of 11 of the target seed schools with dormitory facilities for girls; (v) revision of lower secondary (S1-S4) Mathematics and Science curriculum; (vi) training
of 1,400 teachers in HIV/AIDS prevention, guidance and counseling; (vii) rehabilitation of two technical institutes and re-equipment with upgraded equipment; (viii)
rehabilitation, re-equipment and strengthening of the Vocational Training Institute in Jinja to deliver instructor training in BTVET; (ix) annual training of 150 BETVET
teachers; and (x) development of a more effective project coordination and management experience for the staff of the Ministry of Education Planning Department
and Departments of Secondary Education and BTVET .

These measures will increase access to secondary education; improve science education; support business, technical and vocational education and training; and
enhance project coordination and management.

In June 2005, the Bank Group approved a UA 30.0 million loan to finance the Skills Training and Vocational Education Project in Nigeria. The project is cofinanced by the Government of Nigeria in the amount of UA 3.71 million.

Background: The Nigerian economy is undergoing economic reforms in its quest for economic development. A prerequisite for economic development is a productive, competent, and flexible workforce. The demand for skilled workers and technicians in Nigeria is already acute and will become more intense as the industrial
sector becomes the dominant provider of employment. Yet, vocational and technical education (VTE) is unable to respond to changing labor market requirements.
Its curricula, instructional equipment, teaching methods, and evaluation techniques are outdated, and the Technology and Science Department lacks the management capacity to improve the low-performing vocational and technical schools. The proposed project will help develop a VTE policy, train staff, revise/develop
curricula, and enhance equipment to improve efficiency. It will monitor labor market requirements and involve the private sector in training program development,
accreditation, testing and certification to improve system-wide efficiency.

Objectives: The overall objective of the project is to improve access to quality vocational and technical education in formal and non-formal training institutions
in Nigeria. Specifically, it will (i) improve access to skills training and vocational education; (ii) enhance the quality and efficiency of skills training and vocational
education, (iii) strengthen public-private partnerships; and (iv) improve project management.

Impact and Outputs: The expected outputs of the project include (i) 10 VTE institutions to be rehabilitated and fully equipped with training equipment and teaching and learning materials by 2010; (ii) 500 in-service, 4,000 pre-service teachers/instructors, 14 TSD officials, 10 Assessors, 10 test item writers, 26 VTE institution
managers/administrators, 10 career counselors, two labor market analysts, and 50 maintenance unit staff to be trained by 2010; (iii) teachers, VTE managers, key
partners, and counselors to be trained in gender and education by 2010; and (iv) LMIS fully operational by 2010.

These measures will increase enrollments in beneficiary VTE institutions by 15 percent, improve the ratio of females in the beneficiary population by 20 percent,
increase the number of qualified vocational teachers by 30 percent, and increase availability of appropriate teaching/learning materials.

Annual Report 2005education-related MDGs. In 2005, the
Bank Group approved four operations
totaling UA 114.0 million, representing
48.8 percent of total approvals in the
social sector. This was a 186 percent
increase over 2004 levels (UA 39.8
millions). The operations were aimed
at improving access to, and quality of,
primary and secondary level education
for underserved communities, and at
developing business/ technical/ vocational skills. Rwanda, Guinea, Nigeria,
Tunisia, and Uganda are some of the
RMCs that benefited from the education projects, which are discussed under
Project Profiles in Chapter 6.

Health Care
During 2005, the Bank Group approved
10 operations in the health sub-sector,

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

amounting to UA 90.7 million, representing 38.8 percent of total approvals
to the social sector. This 11 percent
decline (from UA 102 million in 2004
to UA 90.7 million) was due to the
late approval of the RB-CSPs in some
RMCs. But this trend is expected to
reverse in 2006 because 12 of the 20
CSPs were approved during the second semester of 2005. The operations
approved in 2005 were in support
of RMCs’ efforts to improve access
to primary health care, in particular, strengthening health care systems,
rehabilitating health facilities, capacity
building, reducing maternal and mortality rates, and controlling communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.
Beneficiary countries in 2005 included
Benin, Burkina Faso, Malawi, Sierra

Leone, and Angola. The projects are
profiled in Chapter 6.

The Bank Group also financed some
core projects in the social sector, including regional projects and
humanitarian emergency assistance in
the amount of UA 29.1 million, or 12.4
percent of total approvals to the social
sector. Approvals for other social sector projects increased by 89 percent,
compared with 2004 (from UA 15.4
million to UA 29.1 million). Chad,
Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria are
some of the RMCs that benefited from
the other projects in the social sector.
The different projects are profiled in
Chapter 6.

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

   

In May 2005, the Bank Group approved a UA 25.0 million loan to finance the Health Care Development Support Project in Burkina Faso. The project is cofinanced by the Government in the amount of UA 3.0 million.

Background: The health situation in Burkina Faso is marked by high morbidity and mortality rates and low access to basic health care. Only 35.2 percent of the
population has access to basic health care. Malaria, one of the leading causes of morbidity, with an average of 600,000 cases per year, is endemic, along with acute
respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases. High maternal and infant mortality rates and the AIDS pandemic remain critical problems. The health situation is exacerbated by
the lack of health personnel and the prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases. The incidence of poverty is very high with about 46.4 percent
of the population living below the poverty line.

Faced with these challenges, the Government of Burkina Faso prepared its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2000 and revised its National Health Policy.
This led to the development of a National Health Development Plan (PNDS) in 2001. To reduce the morbidity and mortality rates, the revised policy focused on
strengthening primary health care and on giving priority to the decentralization of the health system. To implement the PNDS, the Government approached all
its development partners for financial assistance, and, in 2004, submitted a request for the Bank to finance the strengthening of the two health regions of the
Centre-East and North.

Objectives: The project's ultimate objective is to help improve the health status and well-being of the Burkinabe population. The specific objectives are to (i) improve
access to, and the quality of, health services in the North and Centre-East health regions; (ii) control diseases in the project area; and (iii) strengthen management
of the health system through the Ministry of Health.

Impact and Outputs: The expected outputs of the project include (i) two Regional Hospitals (CHR), two Medical Centers, with Surgical Units (CMA), and 31 Health

and Social Welfare Centers (CSPS) to be built and/or rehabilitated, normalized, and equipped by 2009; (ii) supply of 35 health units and nine district distribution
depots with essential and generic drugs by 2008; (iii) creation and equipment of four HIV screening centers by 2009; (iv) training of 100 counsellors, a third of
them female, in HIV/AIDS management, and 18 physicians in ARVT by 2010; (v) sensitization and patient management in nine health districts by 2008; (vi) training of medical and paramedical personnel and health workers in the project area; (vii) building of the Center-East SIEM and rehabilitation of the North SIEM, and
both equipped by 2009; and (viii) training of 600 traditional doctors, a third of them women, in the production of traditional medicine in an appropriate setting
by 2009.

These measures will help reduce the mortality rate by 50 percent, infant mortality rate by 50 percent, HIV prevalence rate from 2.7 percent in 2004 to about 1.5
percent in 2010, and malaria-related morbidity by 16 percent and malaria-related mortality by 25 percent.

In December 2005, the Bank Group approved UA 66.1 million (a UA 58.2 million loan and a UA 7.9 million grant) to finance the Road Improvement and Transport
Facilitation Program on the Southbound Bamako-Dakar Corridor (Kati-Kita-Saraya-Kedougou-Dakar). This is a multinational project covering WAEMU/Mali and
Senegal. The project is co-financed by WADB (UA 15.30 million); JBIC (UA 5.89 million); WAEMU (UA 0.74 million); IB, EU, KFW, and JAPAN (UA 95.41 million);
Governments (UA 17.24 million) and private transport sector operators (UA 0.15 million).

Background: During the sectoral meeting of the Public Works Ministers from WAEMU States in Dakar, from August 27 to 31, 2001, the construction of the KatiKita-Saraya highway was identified as necessary for the preservation and improvement of land trade among trans-boundary populations. WAEMU drew up a
community Infrastructure and Road Action Program, which was approved by the Ministerial Council of the Union and development partners in 2002. Senegal and
Mali conducted economic feasibility studies and prepared preliminary engineering designs on the Kati-Kita-Saraya road stretch, with a subsidy from the Islamic
Development Bank. The study was updated in 2005, with financial assistance from the ADF. Cognizant of the beneficial socio-economic impact of the project, the
Governments of the Republic of Mali and the Republic of Senegal joined efforts to implement the project and submitted requests for financing to donors, including
to the ADF.

Objectives: The specific objectives of the project are to (i) establish a permanent good service-level highway link through the South, between Mali and Senegal, and
remove constraints on movement in order to reduce overall transport costs and foster economic exchanges between the two countries; (ii) improve the sustainability
of investments by controlling axle loads; (iii) and improve the living conditions of project area dwellers. This will strengthen economic integration and sub-regional
cooperation between WAEMU and ECOWAS member countries.

Outputs: The expected outputs from the project include (i) 421 kilometers of road improvement between Kati and Faleme in Mali; (ii) 112 kilometers of road
improvement between Faleme and Kedougou in Senegal; (iii) the building of two bridges in Mali and a bridge at the border between the two countries; (iv) 235
kilometers of road rehabilitation between Tambacounda and Birkilane in Senegal; (v) connection of 100 kilometers of rural roads to the major highway in the two
countries, (vi) the drilling of 10 boreholes in Mali and eight boreholes in Senegal; (vii) the supply of 1500 desks to Kita schools in Mali; (viii) five health posts to be
built and equipped in each country; (ix) the training of 20 matrons and 10 community health workers; (x) the building of two distressing areas and one quarantine
area for cattle; (xi) one equipped control post to be built at the border between the two countries; and (xii) eight corridor monitoring and evaluation surveys to

be conducted.

In 2005, the Bank Group approved loans
and grants amounting to UA 85.8 million (a decline from UA 219.2 million
in 2004) for six multinational operations, in support of regional integration
and economic integration in Africa. The
operations financed were in infrastructure, the social sector, and humanitarian
emergency relief. The specific projects are
discussed in detail under Project Profiles
in Chapter 6.

Private Sector Development

Cognizant of the essential role that the private sector plays in stimulating economic
growth and reducing poverty, the Bank is
mainstreaming private sector development
activities into all aspects of its operations,
as outlined in the Bank's Private Sector
Development (PSD) Strategy. The PSD
Strategy, which is in line with the Bank’s

new strategic orientations and priorities,
is built on three pillars: (i) country ownership of the private sector development
process; (ii) partnership with development
partners and other economic operators;
and (iii) selectivity of intervention sectors,
as defined in the Bank's country strategy
papers.

In 2005, the Bank approved six private
sector operations, amounting to UA 180.1
million—up from UA 166.0 million in
2004—an 8.5 percent increase. Two project
loans totaling UA 64.3 million, two lines of
credit (LOC) amounting to UA 73.8 million,
one equity investment in the amount of UA
35.1 million, and a credit guarantee in the
amount of UA 6.9 million were approved.
The project loans were for Senegal and
Morocco, and the LOC for a bank in Nigeria.
The projects are profiled in Chapter 6.

During the year, the Bank Group continued to develop specific programs to ease
conditions for SME access to financing. The first franchising program was
aunched in South Africa in 2005 to promote franchising as a business strategy
aimed at helping previously disadvanaged individuals develop SMEs.

he Bank plans to promote franchising
programs in Morocco and in Egypt in
2006. Plans are underway to expand
he program to other countries. In
2005, the Bank approved the GrowthOriented Women Entrepreneurs’
Development Project in Kenya (see Box
4.3). In 2006, the Bank intends to roll
out a similar program in Cameroon and
aunch a capacity building initiative
or women entrepreneurs in 7-10 pilot
countries.

 

Annual Report 2005

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

All entrepreneurs are vulnerable to political instability, poor infrastructure, high production costs, and
non-conducive business environments. However, women-owned enterprises are further handicapped by
their small size, lack of access to key resources (including land and credit), limited training and mentoring, and social and business barriers. Furthermore, training for women entrepreneurs is generally of poor
quality, inaccessible in rural areas, inadequately followed-up with regard to its practical application, and
lacking in emphasis on entrepreneurship, marketing, and business matters.

Background: In October 2005, the Bank approved a US$10 million loan as a partial guarantee facility
under the Growth-Oriented Women Entrepreneurs Development Project in Kenya. Under this project,
partial guarantees will be extended to selected local banks to provide comfort in extending loans to
women-owned SMEs which lack collateral. Such loans will be guaranteed, up to 50 percent, by the Bank
facility, excluding interest. With the partial guarantee line, the Bank will fill an existing gap and increase
access to financing, through well-established private banks, for at least 400 women entrepreneurs who
have shown progress in their business. Over 500 new jobs will be created by the project.

Objective: This private sector project seeks to enhance the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and to help successful SMEs grow their businesses. It includes a technical assistance facility
to train and mentor project clients in order to promote growth and better business management. It
will support capacity building for financial institutions, business development providers, and women

entrepreneurs’ associations.

 

Outputs: The project will also support long-term development and management of adequate SME
financial services by local financial institutions. The capacities of business development service providers
will also be strengthened to provide relevant and adequate business services. The project is consistent
with the Bank's private sector strategy to support SMEs in Africa, with its Gender Plan of Action, and

with its intervention strategy in Kenya.

Non-Lending Activities

he Bank prepared three Private Sector
Country Profiles for Algeria, Mali, and
Egypt in 2005, as part of its efforts to suport an enabling environment for private
sector development in RMCs. The profiles
provided an in-depth analysis of the private sector; the political, economic and
egal environment, opportunities and constraints; and a strategy for the future. The
Bank also studied the development impact
of LOCs in 2005. Its interventions in relaion to LOCs will be tailored to incorporate
he recommendations of this study.

 

During 2005, the Bank set up a task force,
comprising its private and public sectors, to
identify infrastructure projects that can be
developed under a private-public partnership format. To this end, a private-public
partnership workshop was held in Tunis to

Annual Report 2005

uild awareness within the Bank and to
rainstorm on possible areas for partnership. The Bank also started developing a
inancial and incentive system to encourage the use of workers’ remittances as
a development tool and to link it to the
rivate sector. In 2006, the Bank will work
with development partners to conduct a
remittances study aimed at developing a
concrete action plan for designing susainable programs to enhance the use of
remittance flows to finance development
in Africa.

During the Annual Meetings in Abuja,
he Bank organized a seminar to idenify actions and strategies to increase the
participation of key private sector stakeolders in infrastructure development in
Africa, especially in the implementation of
NEPAD's Short Term Action Plan (STAP).

 

The Bank was also involved in meetings
of the governing bodies of the African
Management Services Company (AMSCO)/
African Training & Management Services
(ATMS); and in its hosting of a SMEfacility experts meeting involving the
Commonwealth Secretariat, the NEPAD
Secretariat, and the European Investment
Bank, which sought to develop mechanisms to help lower the financial threshold
on SMEs in Africa.

Gender Mainstreaming Activities
Women constitute the majority of the
poor in Africa, particularly the rural poor.
However, although they play a major role
in agriculture, they have less economic and
political power than men. This hampers
their efforts to improve their own and
their families’ lives. Because empowering
women and promoting gender equality foster economic growth and enhance poverty
reduction, gender mainstreaming is one
of the important crosscutting issues in the
Bank Group's Strategic Plan. Indeed, the
Bank incorporates gender concerns into its
project cycle through its policies on education, health, governance, water resources,
agriculture and rural development.

A number of the projects and programs
approved in 2005 incorporated gender
issues in their design, as outlined under
Project Profiles in Chapter 6. In keeping
with the Bank's results-based focus, these
projects were designed to promote gender
equality outcomes through the inclusion
of specific targets and indicators. Through
training and the development of country
gender profiles, the Bank also sought to
strengthen the capacity of Bank staff to
design and implement gender-sensitive
projects. Beneficiaries of gender-related
financed projects include the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso, Mali,
Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tunisia,
and Guinea. The Bank also addressed
gender concerns in its interventions in the
health sub-sector in RMCs such as Malawiand Benin, and prepared Country Gender
Profiles for Namibia, Lesotho, Tanzania,
and Malawi.

With respect to gender mainstreaming and
networking on gender issues, the Bank, in
collaboration with the World Bank and the
FAO, conducted a gender-training workshop for Bank staff, to enhance their gender-related analytical skills and techniques,
strengthen their capacity to identify gender
gaps, and promote the application of gender analysis throughout the project cycle.
The Bank also participated in the ten-year
review of the Beijing Platform for Action,
which took place in New York in March
2005 and in the Regional Conference for
Empowering Women through Education
and Training. It played an active role in the
NEPAD Gender Taskforce workshop organized by the NEPAD Secretariat in Pretoria
in July 2005.

Environmental Management

The mainstreaming of environmental sustainability concerns into Bank Group activities continued in 2005 with the development of the Environmental Implementation
Action Plan for 2005-2007. This led to

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

the revision of the format and contents
of the environmental guidelines in the
Results-Based CSP. The new guidelines,
which include a better crosscutting skillsmix, were used in preparing new Country
Strategy Papers for Angola, Madagascar,
Cape Verde, Mozambique, and Congo.

During the year, the Bank Group approved
hree environmental management projects
amounting to UA 74.1 million. This was
a significant increase, compared with
he US 1.7 million approved for 2004.
Cumulatively, from 1967 to 2005, loan
and grant approvals for environmental
management amounted to UA 93.1 milion, representing 0.25 percent of total
Bank approvals. The beneficiary countries
‘or the approved projects are Morocco and
Kenya. The approved projects are profiled
in Chapter 6.

n 2005, the Bank developed Strategic
Environmental Assessment Guidelines to
upstream environmental assessments from
the project level to the policy, program, and
lan levels, The tool was used to screen
the Bank's policy-based lending, structural
adjustment lending, sectoral adjustment

 

Objectives: In April 2005, the ADF approved UA 16.5 million (a UA 13.6 million loan and a UA 2.9
million grant) for the above project, which aims to improve water resources management, agricultural
land use, and forest resource conservation in the Ewaso Ng'iro North River catchment area. The project
focuses on three main areas of intervention: water resource development and management; participatory catchment conservation; and capacity building and strengthening of the Ewaso Ng'iro North
Development Authority (ENNDA) and districts for successful project implementation.

Impact and Outcomes: It is estimated that over 70,000 households, almost 20 percent of the project
area's population, will benefit directly from project activities, while indirect benefits will be more widespread. Women are expected to constitute about 20 percent of beneficiaries. Users of water points,
mainly the large population of nomadic pastoralists in the ASAL areas, will benefit from the greater
availability of water. On average, about 160 livestock units will be saved per year per water point
developed. The water points will have a clear impact on reducing women’s labor in meeting their water
requirements/needs. Eventually, the ASAL areas may experience less water scarcity as regenerated forest
areas and fairer regulation of water flow increase the water discharge to downstream areas. Inhabitants
of the more densely populated humid areas will also benefit from the greater availability of fuel wood
through community plantations and agro-forestry activities under the project.

lending, and projects of a regional nature.
The main benefit of the tool is that it allows
far-ranging and cumulative environmental
impact assessments, compared with the
traditional project-specific environmental
impact assessment. Furthermore, a strategic environmental assessment can help
facilitate consultations with the public
by identifying issues, initiating baseline
data collection, and developing action
programs.

In 2005, the Bank experienced more rigorous compliance with environmental and
social policies in the implementation of its
projects through its strengthened review
process. Category | and many Category II
projects developed by the Bank in 2005
included significant environmental components, including an involuntary resettlement component, where appropriate.
Category | projects are projects that are
likely to induce irreversible adverse environmental and social impacts or significantly affect environmental and_ social
components considered sensitive by the
Bank or the borrowing country. Category
Il projects are projects that are likely to
have detrimental or side-specific environmental and social impacts that are less
adverse than Category | projects and can
be minimized by the application of mitigating measures or the incorporation of
internationally recognized design criteria
and standards.

 

During 2005, the Bank executed an MOU
with the Global Environment Facility (GEF)
to gain direct access to GEF resources
in helping RMCs prepare and implement
projects pertaining to global environmental
issues such as biodiversity, climate change,
land degradation/desertification, and international waters. Other activities undertaken
in 2005 included (i) training on strategic environmental assessment, to provide
Bank staff with the necessary experience
to help RMCs build related capacities; (ii)
a three-day refresher training course for

Chapter 004 Operational Priorities and Development Effectiveness

Nigeria's National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), finalized in May 2004, is a
homegrown strategy for growth and poverty reduction for 2004-2007. It includes a detailed action plan to
fight corruption and to improve transparency and accountability. The Government recently implemented a
range of measures in this regard. Accountability has been enhanced by the introduction in the 2005 budget
of an MTEF and by the harmonization of budget classification with a new chart of accounts, including the
cleaning-up of capital and recurrent budgets, in line with the new codes; the requirement for all tiers of
Government to prepare a fiscal strategy paper during budget formulation, specifying priorities and indicative capital budget ceilings for ministries/agencies, and; the strengthening of capacities in the Accountant
General's Office.

Current initiatives to enhance accountability include the Fiscal Responsibility Bill and the Public
Procurement Bill, which will provide a legal underpinning to the ‘Due Process’ introduced at end-2003
in all line ministries, requiring capital projects to be consistent with national development priorities
and standard procurement procedures. The Government has also established a Budget Monitoring and
Price Intelligence Unit (BMPIU) responsible for oversight of public sector contracting and procurement.
Reform measures that have enhanced transparency include the publication of budgets and federal
revenue allocations to all three tiers of Government, and the preparation of quarterly reports on budget
implementation and outcomes. The Auditor General's report will also be published.

Nigeria's participation in the G8 Transparency Initiative and in the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI), under which full audits of the annual oil accounts of relevant agencies (including the
Central Bank and NNPC) will be conducted and published, is expected to increase transparency in the
petroleum sector. As part of the Government's campaign to combat corruption, the Anti-Money Laundering
(AML) Act was reviewed and a revised version was submitted to the National Assembly for consideration.
The Government has also established various anti-corruption agencies such as the Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC).

Actions taken by the Government in 2005 to discipline or dismiss high-ranking civil servants on grounds
of corruption have confirmed the Government's firm commitment to fight corruption. With regard to
stakeholder participation, the political interests of Nigerian citizens are represented through deputies
in the National Assembly. The preparation of NEEDS involved a broad public consultation phase with the
participation of civil society and other stakeholders. With regard to the /egal and judicial framework,
in 2005 the Government completed a draft strategy for legal and judicial reform, to strengthen the rule

Good Governance

The Bank Group's governance policy and
its implementation guidelines provide the
basis for addressing governance issues facing
RMCs. Also, good governance remains a key
criterion in the performance based-allocation
of ADF resources, with more resources going
to countries with high governance ratings.
In 2005, the Bank completed two Country
Governance Profiles in Swaziland and Gabon,
and the profiles for Egypt and Lesotho
will be finalized in 2006. Country governance profiles provide detailed assessments
of major governance issues in the concerned
countries. They analyze the governance situation in the political, social, economic and
corporate governance areas. They also review
existing policies, institutional frameworks
and related capacity issues. Finally, they highight governance challenges, and propose
Measures and recommendations to move the
governance agenda forward.

The Bank Group's support for good governance and anti-corruption programs is classified
under the multi-sector, along with projects in
ublic sector management, industrial import
facilitation, export promotion, and institutional
support. The Bank Group approved projects
otaling UA 264.4 million for the multi-sec
of law and speed-up court cases, and developed an Implementation Plan.

Bank staff, to strengthen compliance with
environmental and social policies in Bank
Group operations; (iii) the participation
of the Bank as a member of the Steering
Committee in the development of subregional NEPAD Environment Action Plans,
and; (iv) a national training workshop on
environmental management and integrated
crosscutting issues conducted by the Bank
in Maputo, Mozambique, for representatives of key ministries, civil society and
international and bilateral partners.

InApril 2005, the Bank hosted the meeting of
the MFI Working Group on the Environment

Annual Report 2005

in Tunis. The meeting was attended by more
than 25 multilateral and bilateral institutions, to discuss the implementation of the
Paris Second High Level Forum Declaration
on Harmonization & Alignment. The Bank
also joined the Executive Committee of the
TerrAfrica Program, a multi-partner platform, to provide an enabling framework
for action to scale up the mainstreaming
and financing of country-driven sustainable land management approaches. This
has led to the inclusion of a Sustainable
Land Management Project ($20 million)
for Ethiopia in the Bank Group's 2006

Regional Socioeconomic Trends and Bank Group OperationsChapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

This chapter examines recent socioeconomic developments and Bank Group operations in regional member
countries against the backdrop of the global economic environment in 2005. It rewiews the major dimensions of
macroeconomic performance in each of the Bank Group's five operational regions. The conclusion highlights
challenges and prospects for the continent.

Economic and Social
Trends in Africa

Macroeconomic Performance

Africa's economic performance in 2005
remained buoyant despite a slowdown
in economic growth caused by relatively
weak demand for imports in industrialized
countries, deterioration in the terms of
trade of some oil-importing countries, poor
crop harvests due to locust invasions in the
Sahel region, and droughts in the eastern
and southern regions of the continent.

Africa's real GDP growth rate declined
marginally from 5.3 percent in 2004 to 4.9
percent in 2005; its real per capita GDP
growth rate also declined slightly from 3.0
percent in 2004 to 2.8 percent in 2005.
Nevertheless, the continent's GDP per capita
increased from US$901 in 2004 to US$ 1032
in 2005, a 14.5 percent rise caused by the
sustained increases in oil prices (see Annex
l-2 for individual country macro-economic
indicators). The 4.9 percent average growth
rate in real GDP masks considerable variations across countries, as there was a modest increase in the number of countries with
higher growth rates in 2005, including oilexporting and oil-importing countries. While
economic growth in oil-exporting countries
was largely driven by high oil price increases, growth in oil-importing African countries
was largely on account of the continuation
of sound and prudent macroeconomic policies. The year 2005 was the third consecutive

 

year in which the continent's recorded real
GDP growth rates exceeded four percent
per year. Nevertheless, this growth rate falls
short of the 7-8 percent required by many
countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDG) by 2015.

In spite of the relatively slow economic
growth and the sustained increases in oil
prices in 2005, Africa's average inflation rate
rose marginally from 9.0 percent in 2004
to 10.0 percent in 2005 (see Table 5.1).
The average fiscal balance for the continent
registered a surplus of 2.1 percent of GDP
in 2005, up from a negative of 0.5 percent
of GDP in 2004. This improvement is attributable to fiscal discipline and to a tighter
monetary policy that helped curb inflationary
pressures. Although some African countries,
in particular non-oil exporters, experienced a
worsening of their terms of trade as a result
of high oil prices, overall average terms of
trade growth for the continent accelerated
to 13.0 percent in 2005, compared with
3.9 percent in 2004. This favorable terms of
trade development is partially attributable
to the higher world prices of some non-oil
commodities, which helped offset the terms
of trade impact of oil price increases. This
development also helped improve Africa's
external position in 2005.

Africa's average current account balance
registered a surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP
in 2005, up from a very small surplus of

0.5 percent of GDP in 2004. This improved
export performance and debt relief measures under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
have contributed to a continuing decline
in the continent's debt-service ratio, which
reached 10.6 percent in 2005, from 20.5
percent in 1999. Similarly, Africa's total
debt in relation to its GDP continued to
decline, from nearly 60 percent in 1999 to
35.7 percent in 2005.

Africa's share of global foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, 2.7 percent, was relatively low, compared with inflows to other
developing countries. However, a number
of factors contributed to the recent recovery
noted in FDI inflows to Africa: the continued liberalization of FDI policies, improve
macroeconomic management in severa
countries, and increased investments in oi
production and other natural resources. FD!
inflows to Africa have been heavily concentrated in natural resource exploitation,
particularly in oil and gas projects in Angola,
Algeria, Gabon, Nigeria, and Sudan; an
mining in South Africa and Tanzania.

Social Indicators

African countries continue to lag behin
other developing countries in areas such
as life expectancy, school enrollment, and
access to basic services: life expectancy a
birth (51 years) is well below the average
for developing countries (63 years)—this
figure has declined further in severa
countries due to the HIV/AIDS pandemic;

only 67 percent of the population has
access to health services—reflected in the
high infant and maternal mortality rates;
infant mortality, estimated at 84 per 1,000
live births, is lower than the average for
developing countries, estimated at 94 per
1,000 live births, while the maternal mortality rate, estimated at 623 per 100,000
live births is far higher than the rate for
developing countries, estimated at 440
per 100,000 live births.

Total school enrollment rates in Africa, estimated at 97 percent for primary education
and 43 percent for secondary education,
are below the average for developing
countries, estimated at 101 percent and 57
percent, respectively. Only 64 percent and
42 percent of the population has access to
potable water and sanitation, compared
with 79 percent and 49 percent, respectively, in all developing countries.

On average, Africa's population grew by 2.2

percent in 2005, continuing the downward
trend from 2.7 percent in 1990. However,

this average masks considerable differences
among countries and among regions. For
example, the fertility and mortality rates in
North African countries, including in Mauritius
and in the Seychelles, decreased and these
countries recorded population growth rates
of less than 2.0 percent. In contrast, countries
heavily affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic,
mainly in Southern Africa, saw their death
rates increase significantly and their population growth rates decline to an estimated 1.3
percent. Population growth estimates for the
remaining regions range from 2.4 percent for
West Africa to 2.5 percent for East Africa and
2.6 percent for Central Africa.

The region's population stood at 110.3 million
in 2005, representing 12.2 percent of the continent's total. The region's contribution to the
continental GDP, 5.8 percent, was the lowest
of all the five regions.

Economic growth in Central Africa, measured by the real GDP growth rate, decelerated to 4.8 percent in 2005, from 10.5
percent in 2004. Nevertheless, the GDP
per capita rose from US$434 in 2004
to US$491 in 2005. Inflation in this
region almost doubled; rising from 4.3
percent in 2004 to 8.5 percent in 2005
(see Table 5.2), but remained below the
continental average of 10.0 percent. The
rise in inflation was caused by oil price
increases, which led to expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies in the four
oil-producing countries of the region,
and to the weakening of the CFA franc
relative to the U.S. dollar in the five CFA
countries.Chapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

he region's fiscal balance improved
rom 1.7 percent of GDP in 2004 to
6.0 percent of GDP in 2005. Similarly,
its current account balance improved
0 a reasonable surplus of 1.1 percent
of GDP in 2005—after four years of
continuous deficits; but still remained
below the continental average of 1.8
percent of GDP. The improvement in the
current account situation resulted from
positive developments in the terms of
rade, which was 8.8 percent, and from
he dividends of post-conflict initiatives.
he region also benefited from the
enhanced HIPC Initiative, reflected in
he reduction of its external debt burden from 90.4 percent in 2003 to 60.2
ercent in 2005, and of its debt serviceratio from 11.8 percent to 6.2 percent
over the same period. The region's debt
burden will be significantly reduced
when the 100 percent debt cancellation
initiative approved by the G8 countries
akes effect. Table 5.2 summarizes the
other macroeconomic indicators for the

Social Indicators

Average life expectancy at birth in the
region is 45 years, lower than the continental average of 51 years. Only 64 percent of
the population has access to health services
in the region; which is below the continental
average of 67 percent. This limited access to
health services and sanitation has serious
implications for quality of life in the region:
the infant mortality rate (IMR) is high at 107
deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with
the continental average of 84 deaths per
1,000 live births; the maternal mortality rate
(MMR) averages 1010 deaths per 100,000
live births, compared with the African average of 623 per 100,000 live births. Indeed,
only four out of 10 countries in the region
registered MMRs below the continental
average (see Table 5.3).

In contrast, 73 percent of the population
has access to water; this is higher than
the average for Africa, which is 64 percent.
However, only 37 percent of the population
has access to sanitation, compared with
the continental average of 42 percent.

The gross primary school enrollment rate
for males and females is 103 percent and
87 percent, respectively. This is an improvement over the male/female enrollment
level of 94 and 69 percent, respectively,
recorded a decade ago. At the secondary school level, the regional average
enrollment rate for male students is 25
percent, while that for female students is
24 percent. Both rates are below the average continental levels of 46 percent and
35 percent for male and female students,
respectively. No country in this region has
achieved a secondary male/female enrollment ratio above the continental average.
The low school enrollment rate, particularly
for females, poses serious policy challenges
for education and development in the
region.

East Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The East Africa region comprises 11 countries
(two ADB countries and nine ADF countries):
Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia,
Tanzania, and Uganda. Its population in
2005 was 213.0 million, representing about
23.5 percent of the continent's population.
The region accounted for 7.0 percent of the
continent's GDP in 2005, the second lowest
contribution, after Central Africa.

Chapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

East Africa recorded the best regional
economic growth performance in Africa in
2005, with a real GDP growth rate of 5.6
percent. Although this is lower than its real
GDP growth rate of 7.0 percent in 2004,
it is well above the continental average
of 4.9 percent in 2005. The region's GDP
per capita rose from US$286 in 2004 to
US$315 in 2005, but it was still the lowest
among the regions. The average inflation
rate in the region also rose from 7.5 percent in 2004 to 8.4 percent in 2005 (see
Table 5.5). This inflationary growth would
have been higher than observed, but for
the continued pursuit of relatively sound
inflation targeting policies in the region,
especially in Tanzania and in Uganda.

The region's average fiscal deficit detetiorated to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2005,
from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2004. It's fiscal deficit of 3.4 percent is relatively high
compared with the continental average
surplus of 2.1 percent of its GDP. East
Africa's terms of trade also deteriorated
from 5.6 percent in 2004 to 8.2 percent in
2005 partly due to the persistent increase
in oil prices during the year. As a result, the
region's external position worsened, with

the 11 countries in the region (Ethiopia,
Madagascar, Tanzania, and Uganda) have
reached completion point and qualified for
the MDRI. The region's debt service-ratio
also declined from 10.2 percent in 2004 to
7.5 percent in 2005. This will decrease further when the debts of six countries in the
region are totally written-off because of the
debt relief initiatives of the G8 countries.

Social Indicators

Average life expectancy in the region is
49 years, marginally below the continental
average of 51 years (see Table 5.6). A high
incidence of poverty and the HIV/AIDS
pandemic largely account for the low life
expectancy in the region. These factors
pose serious challenges to development.

On average, 54 percent of the population
in the region has access to health services,
compared with the continental average of
67 percent. The infant mortality rate (IMR)
is high with an average of 87 deaths per
1,000 live births, compared with the conti
nental average of 84 per 1,000 live births.
The region’s maternal mortality rate (MMR)
is also very high, with a regional average of
882 per 100,000 live births, compared with
623 per 100,000 live births for Africa. Fortytwo percent of the population has access to

compared with the continental average
of 105/89 percent. Four countries in this
region registered high and fairly genderbalanced ratios. In general, East Africa's
enrollment ratio for secondary education
has improved significantly over the past
five years; however, it remains low at
28/29 percent (male/female), compared
with the continental average of 46/35
percent (male/female). Raising the percentage of the population with access
to health services, water and sanitation
as well as the male/female enrollment
ratios to at least the continental level
remains a development challenge for
the region.

Bank Group Operations

Only 2 out of 11 countries in East Africa
—Mauritius and Seychelles—have access
to ADB-window resources, while the
remaining nine are ADF-eligible with limited access to ADB resources for private
sector and enclave projects. In 2005, the
region received Bank Group loan and
grant approvals in the amount of
UA 239.7 million (see Table 5.7). This was
distributed among eight countries, with
the highest allocation going to Uganda
(36.9 percent), followed by Madagascar
(23.9 percent), Ethiopia (18.2 percent),

social sector, UA 21 million (8.8 percent);
and environment, UA 16.5 million
(6.9 percent).

Between 1967 and 2005, the region
received UA 5.41 billion, or 14.8 percent of cumulative Bank Group loan and
grant approvals. Ethiopia had the highest
cumulative approvals (27.0 percent), followed by Uganda (17.4 percent), Tanzania
(17.1 percent), Kenya (13.4 percent), and
Madagascar (10.7 percent). (See Table

population. North Africa contributed 37
percent to the continent's GDP in 2005,
the highest contribution among the five
regions.

North Africa's economic performance was

the third strongest in Africa in 2005, with

mance in the region's

region rose to 6.1 percent in 2005, from
5.0 percent in 2004. This is much lower
than the continent's average inflation
of 10.0 percent. Oil price increases and
increased government spending associated
with oil windfalls in the oil-exporting countries in the region were the contributory
factors to inflation.

 

North Africa's fiscal position improved significantly, as it turned from a deficit of
0.9 percent of GDP in 2004 to a sizeable
surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2005—a
very healthy fiscal position, compared with
the rest of Africa. The region’s external
position also strengthened in 2005 as a
result of rising oil prices and improved
external competitiveness. Indeed, its terms
of trade grew from 2.3 percent in 2004

to 17.9 percent in 2005; and its current
account surplus increased to 10.3 percent
of GDP in 2005, up from 6.9 percent in
2004. Overall, North Africa has the second
lowest debt burden in the continent, after
Southern Africa. In addition, its total debt
stock declined from 40.4 percent of GDP
in 2004 to 33.2 percent of GDP in 2005,
and its debt-service ratio, which has been
declining steadily, stood at 8.8 percent
in 2005, compared with 13.1 percent in
2004 (see Table 5.8).

Social Indicators
The North Africa region has the lowest
incidence of poverty on the continent. In
addition, its average life expectancy is 68
years, well above the continental average
of 51 years; while the infant mortality average is 40 per 1,000 live births, the lowest
in the continent. The maternal mortality
rate in North Africa is also the lowest in
the continent, at 164 deaths per 100,000
live births, compared with the continental
average of 623 deaths (see Table 5.9). On
average, 88 percent of the population in
the region has access to health services,
compared with 67 percent for the conti
 

nent. With respect to access to potable
water and sanitation, the region registered
85 percent and 64 percent, respectively.
These rates are fairly high, compared with
the continent's average of 64 percent and
42 percent, respectively.

The gross primary school enrollment ratio in
the region is 98/91 percent (male/ female).
The male enrollment rate is below the average continental ratio of 105 percent, but
the female enrollment rate surpasses the 89
percent ratio for the continent. Secondary
school level enrollment records are also
quite impressive, with a regional ratio of
70/76 percent (males/females). Five of the
7 countries in the region surpassed the
continental ratio of 46/35 percent (males/
females). Except for Mauritania and Sudan,
most of the social indicator averages for
the countries in this region are superior to
the averages for continental and developing
countries (see Table 5.9).

Four North African countries (Algeria, Egypt,
Morocco, and Tunisia) are ADB-window eligible, while Libya is not a borrowing RMC.

Mauritania is ADF eligible and Sudan has
been under sanctions since 1995 because it
defaulted on the payment of its arrears.

In 2005, loan and grant approvals to the
region totaled UA 642.1 million, up from
UA 516.5 million in 2004 (see Table 5.10).
Four countries benefited from the 2005
loan and grant approvals: Egypt (44.3 percent), Tunisia (28.3 percent), Morocco (27.4

Southern Africa
Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The Southern Africa region comprises 10
countries: Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,

 

Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
The region was home to 127.4 million
people in 2005, or 14.1 percent of the
continent's population. Southern Africa
accounted for 33.1 percent of the continent's GDP in 2005, the second highest
after North Africa. The region's real GDP
growth rate increased from 4.6 percent
in 2004 to 5.0 percent in 2005 (see Table
5.11), marginally above the continental
average real GDP growth rate for 2005.

The GDP per capita income rose to
US$2,436 in 2005, up from US$2,146 in
2004. The increased growth in the region
was largely due to improved manufacturing
performance in South Africa and to strong
growth in Angola and Mozambique.

The Southern Africa region succeeded in
bringing down its inflation rate from 25.5
percent in 2004 to 17.2 percent in 2005;
however, this is still much higher than
the continental average of 10.0 percent.

Overall, improved economic growth perormance, coupled with prudent macroeconomic management in many of the
countries in Southern Africa, improved
he overall fiscal position of the region. In
act, the region's fiscal deficit improved to
0.8 percent of GDP in 2005, down from

its terms of trade deteriorated from 1.8

deficit remained virtually unchanged at
2.5 percent of GDP. The region is the least
indebted in the continent, with only three
countries classified as HIPCs. Its total
external debt averaged 24.7 percent in
2005, down from 26.8 percent in 2004;
its debt-service ratio also declined from 13
percent in 2004 to 8.1 percent in 2005.
Its external debt burden is expected to
decrease significantly when the HIPC countries in the region begin to benefit from the
recent Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.

Social Indicators

Life expectancy in Southern Africa is 42
years; the lowest in the entire continent
and lower than the continental average of 51 years (see Table 5.12). The
low and declining life expectancy rate
is attributed to the worsening HIV/AIDS
pandemic. Available statistics reveal that
an average of 48 percent of the population had access to health services in the
region, compared with 67 percent for the
continent. In contrast, 70 percent and 50

percent of the population have access
to potable water and sanitation, respectively. These rates are far higher than
the continental averages of 64 percent
and 42 percent for water and sanitation,
respectively. Infant mortality is low in the
region, averaging 74 deaths per 1,000
live births, compared with the continental
average of 84 deaths per 1000 live births.
Furthermore, Southern Africa has the second lowest average maternal mortality
rate (605 deaths per 100,000 live births),
after North Africa.

The region recorded the highest primary
school enrollment ratio (male/female) in
the continent, averaging 109 percent for
males and 102 percent for females. It
registered near balanced secondary school
enrollment ratios of about 56/55 percent
for males and females, even though there
are considerable differences among the
countries. The enrollment rates at the primary and secondary school levels exceeded
the continental averages.

Bank Group Operations

The Bank Group started its operations in
the region in 1969. Four countries in the
region (Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and
Swaziland) are ADB-window eligible, while
the remaining five (Angola, Lesotho, Malawi,
Mozambique, and Zambia) are ADF-eligible.
Zimbabwe is a blend country, eligible for
funding from the ADB and ADF windows.

In 2005, Bank Group loan and grant
approvals to the region stood at UA

West Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The West Africa region comprises 15 counties. It is the largest (geographically and
demographically) of all the regions in Africa.
Of the 15 countries, eight of them (Benin,
Burkina Faso, Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau,
Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo) belong to
he CFA Zone, while the other seven (Cape
Verde, Ghana, Guinea, The Gambia, Liberia,
Nigeria, and Sierra Leone) have their own
currencies. Except for Nigeria, all countries in
he region are net oil importers. In 2005, the
region's GDP constituted 17.1 percent of the
continent's total, a higher contribution than
hat of Central and East Africa combined.

n 2005, West Africa's population totaled 260.6
million, or 28.8 percent of the continental total.
Its average GDP growth rate declined from 7.4
percent in 2003 to 4.9 percent in 2004 and
0 4.4 percent in 2005, largely as a result of
he persistent instability of the socio-political
situation in Cote d'Ivoire (see Table 5.14).
Although the region's GDP per capita grew
rom US$510 in 2004 to US$605 in 2005, itChapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

still ranked far behind the North and Southern
regions with regard to living standards, but
fared marginally better than the Central and
East regions.

Inflation in the region increased from 5.1
percent in 2004 to 9.5 percent in 2005
because of expansionary monetary and
fiscal policies. Even so, the inflation rate
in West Africa was marginally lower than
the continental average of 10.0 percent in
2005. Overall, the fiscal position of West
Africa improved considerably in 2005 due

to price increases of oil and key non-oil
commodities. For two consecutive years,
the region recorded increasing levels of
fiscal surplus, at 3.1 percent and 6.6 percent of GDP in 2004 and 2005, respectively. The region's external position also
improved in 2005, with its terms of trade
rising to 23.8 percent, from 9.3 percent
in 2004. Despite these favorable conditions, West Africa's current account deficit
increased by about a percentage point,
from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2004 to 5.5
percent in 2005.

The external debt burden of the region
declined from 58.4 percent of GDP in 2004
to 43.2 percent of GDP in 2005. However,
the debt service grew from 7.2 percent of
exports in 2004 to 14.8 percent of exports
in 2005, much higher than the continental
average of 10.6 percent in 2005. The debt
burden of the region is expected to reduce
significantly as many of the 13 HIPC countries in this region reach their completion
point and qualify for the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative.

Social Indicators

Average life expectancy in West Africa is
48 years, slightly below the continental
average of 51 years (Table 5.15). If it is
not checked, the spread of the HIV/ AIDS
pandemic in the region is likely to further
reduce the life expectancy rate. Access to
health services in the region averaged 66
percent, which is fairly close to the continental average of 67 percent. With respect
to water and sanitation, 60 percent and 37
percent of the population have access to
potable water and sanitation, respectively,
compared with 64 percent and 42 percent, respectively, for the continent. Infant

Conclusion

For the third consecutive year, Africa’s
average real GDP grew by more than 4.5
percent. The growth performance in 2005
occurred against a backdrop of weak
global demand in the industrialized world,
high oil prices, and poor harvests due to
drought and locust invasions in some parts
of the continent. Several non-oil producing
countries achieved average growth rates
of above 4 percent. This suggests that
much of the gains in economic performance are attributable to the sound and

 

Annual Report 2005

85Chapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

prudent macroeconomic policies pursued
by a number of African countries.

Nonetheless, this impressive growth
performance falls short of the 7-8 percent real GDP growth rate required to
progress towards achieving many of
the MDGs. The daunting development
challenges still facing Africa include
(i) accelerating the pace of economic growth while ensuring that such
growth is pro-poor and reduces poverty, contributes to a more equitable
income distribution, and is environmentally sustainable; (ii) consolidating
macroeconomic stability, strengthening
good economic and political governance, promoting the private sector, and
establishing the necessary basic social
services and development infrastructure
for the poor; (iii) mobilizing new domestic and external financial resources to
meet the development financing gap;

Annual Report 2005

and (iv) meeting the special challenge
posed by the relentless surge of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic and other communicable diseases such as Malaria and
Tuberculosis.

In 2006, it is expected that strong oil revenues will buoy domestic demand among
oil exporters and partially offset capacity
constraints undermining productivity in
Africa. Looking forward, high oil prices
are expected to continue feeding demand
in oil-producing African countries, whose
economies are expected to grow at about
5.4 percent. In Africa, the balance of
payments and economic consequences
of higher oil prices are expected to
intensify over 2006 as other commodity
prices—which have reduced the termsof-trade impact of high oil prices—ease.
Despite high oil prices, inflation in Africa
is expected to remain in the single digits
because of lower food prices and pru
dent monetary policies. Recent economic
reforms, and increased donor support will
also help support real GDP growth, which
is projected to be at or above 4.5 percent
in 2006 and 2007.

Thus, there is an urgent need to scale
up investments to achieve a much higher real GDP growth rate and improve
income distribution in Africa in order
to reach the MDGs. Equally important is the need to maintain macroeconomic stability, broaden the policy
environment, improve governance and
institutions, accelerate human capital
development, strengthen regional integration, and maintain peace and stability. In 2006, the implementation of the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative in
14 RMCs, coupled with the enhanced
HIPC Initiative, should contribute significantly to the achievement of these
objectives.Chapter 005 Economic and Social trends in Regional Member Countries and Bank Group Operations

This Chapter presents operational activities undertaken by the Bank Group—the African Development Bank,
the African Development Fund, and the Nigerian Trust Fund—during the year. It examines the global and sectoral composition of Bank Group operations and profiles projects approved during the year.

The African
Development Bank

Operations

The Bank provides non-concessional
loans—to support development activities in creditworthy RMCs and in blend
countries that are also eligible for concessional financing—through its ADB
window. It mobilizes financial resources
from international capital markets to
finance (i) key operations in eligible
RMCs—to make their economies more
competitive, and (ii) financially viable
private sector operations in all RMCs.
Through its Special Relief Fund (SRF), the
Bank also provides emergency assistance
to RMCs emerging from situations of
conflict and to RMCs affected by natural
disasters.

Total ADB approvals declined during the
year, from UA 1.52 billion in 2004 to UA
868.7 million, because of substantial
reductions in HIPC debt relief and in
policy-based lending. Approvals during
the year were as follows: 10 project
lending operations (UA 597.3 million);
2 policy-based loans (UA 147.7 million); 17 emergency assistance grants
under the Special Relief Fund (UA 5.8
million); three debt relief operations
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (UA
76.0 million); one private equity participation (UA 35.1 million), and; one
private guarantee (UA 6.9 million). (See
Table 6.1).

he distribution of ADB approvals by sector
was as follows: power supply accounted for
he largest share of total loans and grants
(36.1 percent), followed by finance (28.2
percent), the multi-sector (13 percent),
he environment (7.7 percent), the social
sector (7.4 percent), industry, mining, and
quarrying (4.5 percent), and agriculture
and rural development (3.1 percent). (See
able 6.2).

Public Sector Operations

n total, 28 projects and programs totaling
UA 688.6 million (79.3 percent of total
ADB operations) were approved for project
oans, policy-based operations, Special
Relief Fund, and debt relief operations.
hese operations are presented below.

 

 

Project loans were the main financing
instrument for public sector operations and
were allocated to promote the development
of the physical and social infrastructure
necessary for sustainable development and
poverty reduction. Project lending in 2005
stood at UA 459.2 million, comprising five
project loans for UA 321.1 million, and
one line of credit for UA 138.0 million. The
five project loans were for (i) the Fisheries
and Aquaculture Sector Support
Project in Gabon, (ii) the Northern
Plains Irrigation Project in Mauritius,
(iii) the Gafsa Phosphates Company
Capacity Building in Environmental
Protection and Phosphate Mining
in Tunisia, (iv) the Ain Beni Mathar Solar
Thermal Power Station Project in Morocco,

and (v) the El Kureimat Combined Cycle
Power Plant Project in Egypt. The line of
credit approved was the Second Line of
Credit to the National Bank of Egypt to
finance the SMEs Support Project (see
Profiles of ADB-Approved Projects and
Programs below).

Two policy-based operations (UA
147.7 million) were approved for Tunisia.
They comprised one sectoral adjustment
loan (UA 50.0 million) for the Secondary
Education Support Project, and one structural adjustment loan (UA 97.8 million) to
support the implementation of government
economic policies and orientations for private sector development.

In total, 17 grants (amounting to UA
5.8 million) were allocated from the
Special Relief Fund for Emergency
Operations (SRF) for operations in 16
countries. The relief funds for Djibouti,
Burundi, Niger, Malawi, Mozambique,
Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were
intended to help reduce the suffering of
the victims of drought in these countries.
Humanitarian and emergency assistance
was provided to Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger,
and Nigeria, to help eradicate poliomyelitis, and to Egypt, to control the 2004 locust
invasion. Somalia and Seychelles received
emergency assistance for victims of the
December 2004 Asian Tsunami.

Three debt relief operations (UA 76.0
million) were approved for Madagascar,

development of small- and medium-scale
enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate broad-based
economic growth that will lead to poverty
reduction in RMCs. To this end, the Bank
approved four private sector loans totaling
UA 138.1 million, or 15.9 percent of total
ADB approvals, one equity participation
for UA 35.1 million, and one guarantee for
UA 6.9 million (see Table 6.1 and Figure

BOX 6.1: Solar Thermal Power Station in Morocco

 

In March 2005, the Board approved a UA 118.1 million loan to finance the construction of the Ain Beni Mathar Integrated Solar Thermal Power Station
in Morocco. The Global Environment Fund and the National Electricity Authority are co-financing the project in the amounts of UA 36.5 million and UA 28.1 million,
respectively

Background: The project was initiated in 1994 when a group of consultants was commissioned to conduct a pre-feasibility study for a solar thermal power station
in the regions of Ouarzazate and Taroudant, in the southern-central part of Morocco. The region has enough sunshine to justify the construction of such a power
station. In 1996, the scope of the study was broadened to include the regions of Jerada, Ain Beni Mathar, and Guercif, to take advantage of the proximity to the
Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline, the availability of sufficient water-flow to cool the power station and clean the solar mirrors, and the proximity to a high voltage
grid to facilitate evacuation of power generated at the plant. On the basis of the study, the Ain Beni Mathar region was chosen for the construction of the power
station.

Objectives: The objectives of the project are to (i) consolidate and modernize major infrastructure networks; (ii) support Moroccan companies to modernize production processes and tools; and (iii) prepare Moroccan companies for competitive conditions. These are in line with the Government's action plan and with the
Bank's strategy for the Kingdom of Morocco.

Impact and Outputs: The project will diversify energy sources and ensure the steady supply of electricity to the country in response to growing demand. It will
help raise the National Electricity Authority's production capacity from 200 to 250 MW and supply the interconnected system with close to 1590 GWh per year, of
which 55 GWh is of solar origin. It will also help increase the proportion of renewable energy in the country’s energy balance.

BOX 6.2: Bank Group Response to the Avian Influenza

 

In the face of growing global public health concerns about the continuing outbreaks of the Avian Influenza in the second half of 2005, the Bank Group constituted
a working group of human and animal health experts to review potential actions and propose a way of dealing with the potential public health crisis. In the event
of a pandemic, RMCs would need significant financial and technical support to strengthen their capacity to prevent an outbreak and to control the spread of the
disease.

The working group consulted with the World Bank, other multilateral development banks, and UN agencies, in particular, the UN World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) and the AU-Inter African Bureau for Animal Resources (AU-IBAR) on an action plan, and on the co-ordination of international response to the disease.

The Bank Group participated in a number of global meetings aimed at examining a development assistance framework to control the Highly Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (HPAI). The first meeting, organized by the FAO, the WHO, and the OIE in Geneva in November 2005, focused on reaching a common understanding of the
requirements for preventing and controlling HPAI transmissions. A second meeting, a pledging conference to review global and regional financing needs and gaps,
was convened by the Government of China, the European Commission, and the World Bank in Beijing. The conference raised US$1.9 billion in financial pledges.

In December 2005, a series of regional meetings on avian influenza were organized to raise the state of preparedness of RMCs. The FAO organized the sub-regional
meetings for East, Central, North, and West Africa, with the help of regional communities such as UEMOA. The SADC group of countries also worked with OIE to
assess the state of the countries’ preparedness. These resulted in country action plans to strengthen existing national plans.

By the end of 2005, the Bank Group was considering an action plan in response to the potential Bird Flu crisis with the following possibilities:

(i) Participating in consultations designed to foster greater understanding of the threat posed by the Avian Influenza and to search for strategies aimed at preventing and containing the spread of the disease in the Africa region;

(ii) Reviewing the Bank Group's funding mechanisms in order to provide short-term assistance and medium to longer-term support to its RMCs to strengthen the
quality of their veterinary services, improve access to such services by farmers, and improve the surveillance capacity of farmers;

(iii) Providing emergency support through the Bank Group's Special Relief Fund (SFR) to eligible RMCs that may need urgent support to strengthen their state of
preparedness for an Avian Influenza emergency;

(iv) Working with other development partners to set up a Special Avian Influenza Relief Fund, to the tune of UA 50 million, to assist RMCs that are at risk and to
prevent the outbreak or spread of the disease. The Bank Group contribution is under review but could take the form of multinational operations;

(v) Undertaking Economic and Sector Work (ESW) on the cost-effective compensation/incentive structures for affected farmers and providing appropriate advice
to RMCs;

(vi) Continuing to provide support for regional and economic integration activities aimed at detecting, monitoring, and surveillance of the Avian Influenza; and

(vii) Consulting with the World Bank on how to access the funds pledged during the Beijing conference for HPAI.

The African
Development Fund

Operations

The African Development Fund (ADF) window provides highly concessional loans
and grants to 38 low-income RMCs that
are unable to borrow at market rates under
the ADB window. The two blend countries
(Nigeria and Zimbabwe) are also entitled
to concessional borrowing from the ADF.

These funds are geared for investment in
basic economic and human development
projects and are allocated on the basis of
country creditworthiness, per capita GNP,
and country performance. Based on established rules, the allocation of resources
for planned operations in ADF-borrowing countries must reflect each country’s
policy and institutional performance, and
its project implementation record. The ADF
resources are intended to promote acceler
ated, broad-based, equitable, sustainable
economic growth and social development,
with poverty reduction as the main goal.

In 2005, ADF approvals amounted to UA
1.42 billion for 65 operations in 24 countries
and six multinational projects, compared
with UA 1.26 billion for 99 operations in
27 countries and 18 multinational projects
in 2004. The 13.0 percent increase in 2005
approvals over 2004 approvals was due to

Project and Program Lending

Loan-Financed Projects

In line with the Bank's strategic orientations and with ADF X financing directives,
the ADF lending program continued to
prioritize agriculture and rural development, transport, the social sector, and
multi-sector activities—which all have a
significant impact on economic growth
and contribute to poverty reduction in
low-income RMCs. These four sectors
accounted for 84.5 percent of total ADF
loans in 2005 (see Table 6.4 and Figure
6.6). The social sector (education, health
and poverty reduction projects) received
UA 102 million (17.7 percent of total
approvals) for four projects. The agriculture and rural development sector was
allocated UA 122.5 million (21.2 percent
of total loans) for 11 operations. The Bank
Group's continuous focus on these sectors
reflects the importance it places on them

in the drive to improve output growth,
raise living standards, and reduce poverty
and social alienation in RMCs.

Multi-sector operations support activities
that promote public sector management,
private sector development, good governance, and institutional support necessary
for consolidating institutional and economic reforms in RMCs. The goal is to
ensure that growth is broad-based and
equitably distributed in eligible RMCs
to sustain economic and social development. During 2005, the ADF allocated
UA 127 million (representing 22 percent
of total loan approvals) to support four
multisector operations. This is lower than
the UA 221.5 million (31.6 percent of
loan approvals) for 10 operations in
2004.

Infrastructure development (comprising
the transportation, water supply and
sanitation sectors), received UA 212.6

million, or 36.8 percent of approvals,
during 2005. Of this amount, transportation received the largest share, with
UA 136.2 million (23.6 percent of the
total) for four projects. Development of
transportation infrastructure is an important aspect of the Bank’s interventions,

Chapter 006 ADB, ADF, and NTF Operations

 

In December 2005, the Bank approved a UA 17.2 million grant to finance the Bom Jesus-Calenga
Smallholder Agricultural Development Project in Angola. The project is co-financed by the Government
of Angola and beneficiaries in the amounts of UA 1.9 million and UA 0.7 million, respectively.

Background: After three decades of civil conflict, Angola was transformed from an exporter to a net
importer of agricultural commodities because many formerly productive farmers became dependent
on food aid. Following the adoption of a peace agreement in 2002, the Government identified the
agriculture sector as one of the priority sectors through which it would tackle problems related to
unemployment, food shortages, and poor living standards. In this light, the Government focused on the
rural sector, particularly on smallholder farmers, with a view to increasing food production, multiplying
improved seed varieties, and organizing and training rural farmers. In 2005, the Government submitted
to the Bank Group a request to finance a smallholder agricultural development project.

Objectives: The objectives of the project are (i) agricultural development, (ii) capacity building, (iii) project
management, and (iv) rural infrastructure development, consisting of irrigation, roads, water and health
infrastructure.

Impact and Outputs: The project will lead to an annual increment in crop production, estimated at
2.5 tons per ha for beans, 3.0 tons per ha for maize, 20.0 tons per ha for tomatoes, 20.0 tons per ha
for onions, 15.0 tons per ha for cucumber, and 25.0 tons per ha for cabbage. This will increase food
security and agricultural incomes. In addition, the Bom Jesus site beneficiaries will obtain legal rights to
irrigated land through provision of land titles by the Government; the human and logistics capacities of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will be strengthened; structural plans, land surveys,
and land titling in the Bom Jesus site will be drawn; improved seed varieties will be propagated and

developed for farmers; and improved farming methods and practices introduced to farmers.

because it provides the rural poor with
access to farms and to industrial production areas, promotes strong linkages to
poverty reduction activities, and supports
regional integration operations under
the NEPAD framework. Three water supply and sanitation operations received
UA 76.4 million (13.2 percent of total
loan approvals).

Policy-Based Lending

During the year, the ADF approved 4
policy-based loans totaling UA 127 million, compared with 10 loans amounting to UA 214.2 million in 2004. The
4 PBLs approved in 2005 represented
8.9 percent of total loans and grants
and were allocated to support the
structural adjustment programs.

Annual Report 2005

Grant-Financed Operations

As part of its efforts to address the
particular challenges facing low-income
ADF countries, the Bank increased grant
financing considerably, especially under
ADF-IX and ADF X. In 2005, the ADF
approved UA 414.5 million (41.8 percent of total loans and grants) in grants
for 34 operations, compared with UA
213.9 million for 54 operations in 2004.
Grant resources are normally used to fund
technical assistance and capacity-building
initiatives and projects. They are also used
to support priority activities such as HIV/
AIDS interventions, post-conflict reconstruction and natural disaster prevention,
education and health, water and sanitation, and environmental protection.

During 2005, 18 countries benefited
from grant financing (see Figure 6.7),
and UA 27.6 million (6.7 percent of
total grants) was approved for multinational projects and programs to
support regional economic cooperation and integration activities, private
sector development, good governance,
and institutional support.

Grant Financing by Sector

In line with the Bank Group's goal
of reducing poverty and promoting
broad-based growth and sustainable
socio-economic development, grant
operations in 2005 focused on water
and sanitation, agriculture and rural
development, the social sector, and
transportation.

Water and sanitation received the largest share of grant approvals—UA 122.7
million (29.6 percent of the total) for five
operations; agriculture and rural development, the second largest share—UA
85.5 million (20.6 percent of the total)
for eight operations; and the social
sector, the third largest share—UA
76 million (18.3 percent of the total)
for five operations. Another UA 75.9
million (18.3 percent of total) was allocated for six operations in the transport
sector for road construction, upgrading and maintenance. The multi-sector
received UA 39.7 million (9.6 percent)
for six operations. Two grants were
allocated to power supply (UA 5.1 million), and one grant each to finance
(UA 6.8 million) and the environment
(UA 2.9 million) (see Table 6.4 and
Figure 6.8).

Grant Financing for Technical
Assistance

Technical assistance grants provided
by the ADF are intended to (i) enhance
the capacities of RMCs in designing,developing, and implementing development projects and programs, and (ii)
strengthen national institutions and
regional agencies. In 2005, 15 grants,
amounting to UA 32.8 million, were
approved for this category. Of the 15
grants, four grants totaling UA 7.8 million were allocated to fund project cycle
activities, and 11 grants, amounting
to UA 25.0 million, were approved for
institutional support, including private
sector development.

Project Preparation Facility

The Project Preparation Facility (PPF) provides resources to RMCs on a reimbursable basis, to help ensure the quality of
the Bank Group’s pipeline of projects and
programs at entry. The PPF is designed
as a complementary facility to the grantfinancing mechanism with a distinct role

These activities include feasibility studies,
updating economic studies, baseline data
surveys, final project designs, revision of
tender documents, environmental impact
assessment, and studies on crosscutting
issues. In 2005, the Fund approved three
PPFs for a total amount of UA 1.1 million.

Project Grant Financing

Project grant financing is one of the new
instruments the Bank uses to support
some of its activities in priority areas such
as HIV/AIDS interventions, post-conflict
reconstruction, investments in water and
sanitation, the social sector and emergency/natural disaster assistance. During
2005, 19 project grants, amounting to UA
381.8 million, were approved.

HIPC Debt Relief

The HIPC Initiative is intended to reduce
countries’ indebtedness to sustainable levels
and encourage the use of direct debt service
savings for poverty reduction activities.
Resources made available under HIPC are
earmarked for financing key pro-poor growth
programs listed in the recipient countries’
PRSP or development plans. In 2005, four
operations amounting to UA 429.5 million
were approved under this initiative, compared with UA 301.4 million in 2004. This
represents a 42.5 percent increase over
2004 support for the HIPC Initiative.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) provides
financing at below market rates to assist
development efforts in RMCs, particularly
in low-income countries. Article XIII of the
Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust
Fund (the NTF Agreement), signed by the
Bank and Nigeria on February 26, 1976,
provides that the NTF shall be in effect for
a period of thirty (30) years. This may be
extended by mutual agreement between
Nigeria and the Bank. According to Article
XIll, Section 1 of the NTF Agreement,
unless its duration is extended beyond
April 25, 2006, (the “Termination Date”)
y mutual agreement, on that date, the
NTF shall legally cease all activities, except
hose related to orderly winding down of
prior commitments. In this regard, during
2005 the Bank held two high-level meetings with the Nigerian authorities in Abuja
and in Tunis to discuss the extension of
he Agreement Establishing the NTF for
another 30 years.

he Nigerian Government has, in principle, agreed to extend the duration of
he NTF. In this light, it has requested a
Comprehensive Evaluation Study of the
NTF. The terms of reference for the study
were prepared in 2005 and the study will
be undertaken in early 2006 by an independent evaluation team. The study will
assess the performance of NTF operations
and existing management procedures and
governance structures for NTF operations.
t will also provide recommendations on
he future strategic direction and focus of
he NTF beyond April 25, 2006. The study
will serve as a key input to the successful
completion of negotiations on the extension of the NTF duration.

 

No loans or grants were approved under
the NTF in 2005. However, three operations, amounting to UA 3.1 million, were
approved through this window, under the
HIPC Initiative.

Cumulative Loan and Grant
Approvals, 1976-2005

During 1976-2005, the NTF approved UA
304.6 million for 71 projects in 30 RMCs.
Of this amount, UA 14.1 million was allocated to multinational projects.

The sectoral distribution of NTF cumulative loan approvals, shown in Figure 6.11,
indicates that transportation accounted
for 32.5 percent of approvals, followed
by agriculture and rural development at
18.8 percent, and the social sector at 18.2
percent. Distribution for the other sectors was as follows: communications, 9.2
percent; finance, 5.8 percent; water supply
and sanitation, 5.7 percent; industry, mining and quarrying, 5.4 percent; and power
supply, 4.5 percent.

The regional distribution (Figure 6.12)
shows that West Africa received 39.2 percent of NTF cumulative loan approvals,
followed by East Africa, 24.5 percent;

Subscriptions

The authorized capital stock of the Bank
stood at UA 21.87 billion (2,187,000
shares) at December 31, 2005. The authorized capital is made up of 236,520 paid-up
shares (10.81 percent) and 1,950,480 callable shares (89.19 percent), and has been
allocated to regional and non-regional
members for subscriptions in the proportion of 3:2 respectively.

The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V)
was approved by the Board of Governors
in 1998 and became effective in 1999. A
member country’s payment of the first GCIV installment triggers the subscription to
the entire callable capital portion of shares
allocated to it; however, shares representing the paid-up portion of subscriptions
are only issued when the Bank receives
actual payments for such shares.

Cumulative subscriptions stood at UA
21.64 billion (98.95 percent of the authorized capital) at December 31, 2005, compared with UA 21.60 billion (98.77 percent) in 2004. The increase in the level of
subscriptions is attributable to (1) shares
subscribed on payment of installments
under GCI-lV and GCI-V, and (2) shares
subscribed because of new allocations
under the Share Transfer Rules. At end2005, the total callable capital stood at
UA 19.37 billion. Unsubscribed shares

totalled 19,510 and comprised shares to be
issued upon payment of future cash installments (8,161 shares) and shares made
available for reallocation (11,349 shares).
Shares held by the former Social Republic
of Yugoslavia have been transferred to the
Bank and considered as Treasury shares.

In 2005, the cumulative paid-in amount on
subscriptions before cumulative exchange
adjustment on subscription was UA 2.26
billion, compared with UA 2.21 billion in
2004.

In accordance with the terms of the GCI-V
Resolution and the Share Transfer Rules,
shares for which payment have become
ue but remain outstanding are forfeited by
the ninetieth (90th) day following the due
ate. Shares corresponding to the amounts
in arrears are automatically withdrawn,
cancelled, and reissued for subscription at
the ratio of one paid-up share to seven callable shares under GCI-IV; and one paid-up
share to fifteen two-thirds (15.67) callable
shares, in accordance with Sub-paragraph
2.2 of the GCI-V Resolution.

The position of capital subscriptions at
December 31, 2005, is shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital
Stock and Voting Powers, which forms part
of the Financial Statements of this Report.

 

Bank Rating
Four major ratings agencies, Standard &
Poor's, Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the

Budgets for the financial year 2006

Japan Credit Rating Agency reaffirmed
their AAA and AA+ rating of the African
Development Bank's senior and subordinated debt, respectively, with a stable
outlook. Their ratings reflect the Bank's
strong membership support, its preferred
creditor status, sound capital adequacy,
and prudent financial management and
policies.

Capital Markets Operations

The Bank strives to raise funds on capital
markets at the lowest possible cost to support its lending activities; its AAA credit
rating allows it to issue securities at low
interest rates. In December 2004, the ADB
Board of Directors approved a borrowing
program of up to UA 550 million for 2005.
The Bank raised UA 544.5 million at a
weighted average cost of 6-month U.S.
dollar LIBOR minus 25.2 basis points.

The Bank's borrowing portfolio stood at
UA 5,940.4 billion at December 31, 2005.
The Bank is well within its debt policy limits. The key debt ratios are as follows:

© Total borrowings/total callable capital
(max 80 percent): 30.67 percent.

¢ Senior debt/non-borrowing members’
callable capital (max 80 percent): 61.13

those of its peers in all market segments.

The Bank concluded a ZAR 900 million,
five-year maturity Uridashi transaction in
May 2005—the largest transaction executed in ZAR by any supranational since
1998, and the first ZAR borrowing by the
Bank since March 1999. Taking advantage
of favorable market conditions, the Bank
priced a 3-year US$500 million global
benchmark in international capital markets
at an after-swap level on an all-in-cost
basis of U.S. dollar 6-month LIBOR minus
20 basis points. This transaction attracted
top-notch investors, and its placement in

Annual Report 2005

the United States was one of the highest
supranational transactions in 2005. The
Bank continued to raise funds through
small-sized structured transactions, executed with an attached swap, to take advantage of attractive funding opportunities in
the Japanese private placement market.

The Bank made further progress on the
groundwork done in 2004 on local currency bond issues in Africa. Local currency issues are expected to facilitate
the financing of Bank operations in local
currency and to promote the development
of domestic bond markets across the continent. The Bank's borrowers will gain from
reduced foreign exchange risk exposure
and the economies of RMCs will benefit
from mobilization of domestic savings, better capital allocation, and development of
an efficient financial sector.

In December 2005, the Bank launched
its first Botswana Pula transaction in the
Euro-Pula market, following the receipt of
necessary approvals from the Government
of Botswana. Thanks to the Bank’s efforts,
the Botswana Pula received a settlement
currency status from international clearinghouses, making the transaction the
first true Eurobond in Pula. Botswana
Pula is the second African currency, after
the South African Rand, to achieve settlement status. Consistent with its strategy
of developing African capital markets, the
Bank has tentatively identified borrowing
opportunities in several African currencies.
Discussions with potential investors and
local banks, and partnerships with governments and regulatory bodies will drive the
pace of progress in this strategic activity.

 

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments
(net of repos and swaps) as of December
31, 2005 totaled UA 4.75 billion, compared to UA 4.45 billion at the end
of 2004. Investment income for 2005
amounted to UA 155.4 million, or a return

of 3.36 percent on an average liquidity of UA 4.63 billion, compared to UA
123.6 million in 2004, or a return of
2.93 percent, on an average liquidity of
UA 4.22 billion.

Effective January 1, 2001, the ADB's liquid
assets were tranched into 3 portfolios,
namely operational portfolio, prudential
portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio, each
with a different benchmark that reflects
the cashflow and risk profile of its assets
and funding sources. These benchmarks
are one-month LIBID for the operational
portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market
LIBOR, resetting on February 1 and August
1 for the prudential portfolio. The equitybacked portfolio is managed against a
repricing profile benchmark with 10 percent of the Bank's net assets repricing
uniformly over a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as
at December 31, 2005 amounted to
UA 17.40 billion. Total outstanding loans,
as at December 31, 2005 was UA 5.51
billion, compared to UA 5.64 billion as at
he end of 2004. Undisbursed balances
at December 31, 2005 totaled UA 1.86
billion, an increase of UA 332.6 million
rom December 31, 2004. The number of
active signed loans stood at 313 for a
otal amount of UA 5.51 billion. Also, at
December 31, 2005, 479 loans amounting
0 UA 6.75 billion had been fully repaid. A
breakdown of the loan portfolio by product
ype is presented in Figures 7.1 and 7.2.

Disbursements on Bank loans decreased by
5.5 percent from UA 630.2 million in 2004
o UA 595.4 million. At December 31,
2005, cumulative disbursements (including private sector loans) amounted to
UA 15.41 billion. At December 31, 2005,
709 loans were fully disbursed for a total
amount of UA 14.03 billion, representing
91.1 percent of cumulative disbursements.Financial Products

Loans. The Bank offers three loan products: variable, floating, and fixed interest
rate loans with a selection of loan currencies, currently, U.S. Dollars, Euro, Japanese
Yen, and South Africa Rand (ZAR). To suit
the long-term financing needs of borrowers, loans have a maximum maturity of
20 years, including a grace period on the
repayment of the principal amount, generally not exceeding five years.

For the single currency variable interest
rate loan, the lending rate is determined
‘wice a year, on January 1 and July 1, and
is based on the Bank's average cost of a
designated pool of borrowings funding
he loans in the specific currency. The
lending rate for the floating interest rate
joan is derived from the 6-month market
reference rate in the specific currency, for
example, LIBOR, Euro Interbank Offered
Rate, or JIBAR. The lending rate is reset
on February 1 and August 1 each year and
applies to the 6-month period following
he reset date. For the fixed interest rate
joan, the lending rate in each currency is

 

 

the fixed amortizing swap rate derived
from the 6-month market reference rates.
Borrowers may select from a number of
rate-fixing alternatives, including fixing at
each disbursement or after all disbursements have been completed. Prior to rate
ixing, the currency-specific floating interest rate applies.

he pricing formula applicable to all three
joan products is the same. The applicable
rate of interest is the sum of the chosen
jase rate plus a lending spread. In line
with the recommendations of the Middle
ncome Country Task Force, new loans
© sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed
jorrowers enjoy a lending spread of 40
asis points above the 6-month market
reference rate. For non-sovereign guaraneed borrowers in the private and public
sectors, the lending spread is computed
ased on the Bank's risk-based pricing
ramework.

he distribution of loans by interest rate
asis and currency is shown in Figures 7.1
and 7.2.

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector
enterprises can be extended directly or
through private financial institutions. With
agency lines (Als), the credit risk of the
borrower is borne by the Bank. The private
financial institution acts as an agent for the
Bank, implementing activities, including, but
not limited to, identifying projects within
certain parameters; appraising such projects
on behalf of the Bank; undertaking administrative steps related to disbursements
for approved projects (billing, collection of
Bank's funds, filing of security); supervising
projects, monitoring the performance of the
borrower, and submitting related reports;
and transmitting amounts related to the
repayment of the loan to the Bank.

Guarantees. Through the guarantee
product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible
borrowers to obtain financing from third
party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees will also enable borrowers to
obtain financing in their own local currency
where the Bank is not able to provide such
financing directly from its own resources.

Risk Management Products are offered
to enable borrowers to manage the market
risks associated with their loans from the
Bank, including interest rate, currency, and
commodity price risks. These products help
borrowers to manage their balance sheets
and their changing needs more efficiently
over time. Risk management products such
as interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
interest rate caps and collars are available
to borrowers during the life of the loan.

Equity Participation or Quasi-Equity
Products. The Bank's ability to provide
risk capital through equity investment is
a key element of its resource mobilization
role. Even though the Bank cannot be a
majority shareholder in a company, it can
participate in a project by acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred stocks,
or debentures.

sure to risks that are not essential to its
core business of providing development
finance and related assistance. To this end,
the Bank has adapted its risk management policies, guidelines and processes to
reduce exposure to interest rate, currency,
liquidity, counterparty, legal, and other
operational risks, while maximizing its
capacity to assume the risks of extending
credit to its public and private sector clients
within its approved risk limits.

Credit Risk

Credit risk, the potential default of one or
more debtors, is the largest source of risk
for the African Development Bank and is
managed within an integrated framework
of credit policies, guidelines and processes. The foundation of the Bank's credit
management framework is a systematic
credit risk assessment based on a uniform
internal credit risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Bank's statistical loss
expectations.

The Bank manages three principal sources
of credit risk: 1) sovereign credit risk on its
public sector portfolio; 2) non-sovereign
credit risk on its portfolio of private sector,
non-sovereign and enclave projects; and
3) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio

of treasury investments and derivative
instruments.

Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the
Borrowing Member State. Consequently,
the expected loss rate on the Bank's public
sector portfolio is derived from regular
assessments of the ultimate collectibility
tisk of the sovereign guarantees from the
Borrowing Member States. The credit risk
ratings of the Bank’s Borrowing Member
States are updated quarterly by the credit
management division.

In 2005, while the overall risk profile of
the Bank's sovereign guaranteed portfolio
remained largely unchanged, the portfolio's weighted-average risk rating weakened from 2.97 at the end of 2004 to
3.15 at the end of 2005, primarily due to
the revised accounting norms changing the
measurement basis of exposures’. The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across
the Bank's five credit risk classes is shown
in the table above.

To ensure adequate diversification, the

0.50 percent on the commitment fees
charged on qualifying undisbursed ADB
loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the
advantages of preferred creditor status
and rigorously applies sanctions on nonperforming sovereign borrowers, some
countries have experienced difficulties to
service their debts to the Bank on a
timely basis. With the adoption of the
revised International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) from 2005, the Bank
no longer makes general provisions for
performing loans. In line with the IFRS
norms, the Bank makes a provision for
the impairment? in its sovereign portfolio
commensurate with the assessment of the
incurred loss in the portfolio. The Bank's
impairment allowance of UA 376.4 million
is consistent with the estimated incurred
loss associated with impaired loans at the
end of 2005.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a con

servative risk capital cushion for sovereign
credit risks. The Bank's capital adequacy
policy articulates differentiated risk capital
requirements for all credit-sensitive assets
(loans and equity investments) plus coningent liabilities (guarantees and client
risk management products) in each risk
class*. At the end of 2005, the Bank’s
ublic sector portfolio required as backing,
45 percent of the Bank’s total on-balance
sheet risk capital’. This compares with 47
percent at the end of 2004 and reflects
he changes in both the composition of
the sovereign portfolio and the sources of
risk capital as a result of the application of
he revised IFRS.

Non-Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to private sector
orrowers or to enclave projects it does
not benefit from full sovereign guarantees
or the equivalent. The Bank may also
provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly
owned, without a sovereign guarantee.
Consequently, the expected loss rate on
its non-sovereign portfolio is derived from
the assessment of the ultimate collectibil

3.A loan is considered to be impaired when the borrower is observed to experience difficulties in servicing the debt in a timely manner.

= 25%, low risk = 28%, moderate risk = 35%, high risk = 50%, very high risk = 75%, and equity investments = 100%
5. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of translation adjustments. Reflecting a conservative approach to measuring capital adequacy for operational planning, the Bank does

not include callable capital in its computation of risk capital.

ity risk of each project loan including any
security or guarantees. The credit management division assigns a credit risk rating
for all new projects at entry and the risk
ratings on all outstanding projects are
updated quarterly.

In 2005, the non-sovereign loan and equity
portfolios continued to grow. By year-end,
the weighted-average risk rating improved
slightly from 3.40 in 2004 to 3.12 in 2005.
The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the Bank's five credit risk classes is shown in the table on page 135.

To ensure a prudent distribution of its
non-sovereign portfolio, the Bank manages
its lending activities within a framework
of country, sector, client, and instrument
exposure limits and risk profile benchmarks. In addition, the Bank generally
requires a range of securities and guarantees from the project sponsors to partially
mitigate the credit risk for direct private
sector loans.

In compliance with the revised IFRS, the
Bank no longer makes general provisions to cover the expected losses in the
performing non-sovereign portfolio. For
the non-performing portfolio, the Bank
makes a specific provision based on an

incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of
2005, the impairment allowance to cover
the incurred loss on impaired loans in
the non-sovereign portfolio was UA 16.1
million.

In addition to lending, the Bank may
make equity investments in private sector
projects, either directly or through investment funds. To the extent possible, equity
investments are carried at fair value. In
cases where an equity investment that is
not fair valued is assessed as potentially
non-performing, the Bank may make a
provision based on accepted impairmen
tests measured against the Bank's carrying cost. At the end of 2005, the average
provisioning rate for equity investments in
private sector was equivalent to 2.7% o

Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of its business, the
Bank utilizes various financial instruments
to meet the needs of its borrowers, to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market
interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquidity prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments
involve, to varying degrees, the risk that
the counterparty in the transaction may be
unable to meet its obligation to the Bank.

Reflecting a preference for minimizing
exposure to counterparty credit risk, the
Bank maintains eligibility criteria that limit
the Bank's financial operations to counterparties with the very best credit ratings. For
example, the minimum rating for counterparties for derivative instruments is AA- or
the equivalent®.

In addition to these stringent rating standards, the Bank operates a framework of
exposure limits based on the counterparty credit rating and size subject to a
maximum of eight percent of the Bank's
total risk capital for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) potential exposure methodology and monitored regularly against
the Bank's credit limits after consideringhe benefits of any collateral. As a rule, the
Bank executes an ISDA master agreement
and netting agreement with its derivaive counterparties prior to undertaking
any transactions. As shown below, the
estimated potential counterparty credit
exposure of the investment and derivative
portfolios continues to be predominantly
AA or higher.

© cover potential unexpected credit
related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a
conservative risk capital cushion for counerparty credit risks as per the current BIS
standards. At the end of 2005, the Bank's
counterparty credit portfolio including all
investments and derivative instruments
required as backing just over 1.9 percent
of the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk
capital. This is a minor change from 1.7
percent in 2004.

 

 

Liquidity Risk

As a long-term development lender, the
Bank holds sufficient liquid assets to enable it to continue normal operations even
in the unlikely event that it is unable to
obtain fresh resources from the capital
markets for an extended period of time. To
achieve this objective, the Bank computes
a prudential minimum level of liquidity
ased on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The
rudential minimum level of liquidity is
updated quarterly and includes all potenial debt service payments due to early
redemption of swaps and borrowings with
embedded options. To enable the Bank
‘0 take advantage of low-cost funding
opportunities as they arise, the Bank's
olicy permits a judicious increase of liquid
resources where there is an economic benefit. Throughout 2005, the level of liquid
assets remained well above the minimum
rescribed by the Bank's liquidity policy.

 

 

 

 

0 strike the optimal balance between
generating adequate investment returns

and holding securities that can be easily
sold for cash if required, the Bank divides
its investment portfolio into tranches with
different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank’s core liquidity portfolio is
invested in relatively liquid securities that
can be readily sold if required. In addition
to the core portfolio, the Bank maintains a
second tranche of liquidity that is always
invested in the most highly liquid securities
to cover its expected operational cash flow
needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and
borrowings with embedded options are
included in the computation of the size of
the operational tranche of liquidity. A third
tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the
Bank's equity resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities designated
as “held-to-maturity” investments (HTM).
Only HTM investments with a remaining
maturity of one year or less are considered
as liquid investments against the Bank's
minimum liquidity requirements.

 

 

Currency Risk

The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency
exchange exposures by, requiring liabilities
in any one currency (after swap activities)
to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily by holding
or lending the proceeds of its borrowings
in the same currencies in which they were
borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid
creating new currency mismatches, the
Bank requires its borrowers to service their
loans in the currencies disbursed.’

Because a large part of its balance sheet
is funded by equity resources, which are
denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset
position that is potentially exposed to
translation risk when currency exchange
rates fluctuate. The Bank's policy is to
minimize the potential fluctuation of the
value of its net worth measured in Units
of Account by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net

African Development Bank Chapter 007

assets with the currency basket of the SDR.
In line with this policy, throughout 2005
the Bank's currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band of the risk-neutral
position in each of the currencies making
up the SDR composition. Towards the end
of 2005, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) carried out its 5-yearly review of the
SDR basket; consequent to the review,
the revised SDR basket took effect from
January 1, 2006. In keeping with the
Bank's currency risk management policy,
currency transactions were carried out in
early 2006 to realign the net assets to the
revised SDR basket. During 2005, despite
sharp movements in the values of the
major currencies during the year, the Bank
registered only a minor change in translation adjustments of less than 0.5 percent
of net assets.

The distribution of the currencies of the
Bank's recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of
expenses in Euros, CFA and Tunisian Dinar.
For 2005, the Bank's strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to
cover the estimated currency composition
of expenses during the year mitigated the
unfavorable impact of the currency movements during the year.

 

Interest Rate Risk

The Bank’s exposure to interest rate risk can
be traced to two principal sources: 1) the
interest rate sensitivity of the net interest
margin between the rate the Bank earns
on its assets and the cost of the borrowings
funding those assets; and 2) the interest rate
sensitivity of the interest margin the Bank
earns on the assets funded by its equity
resources. The Bank's principal interest rate
risk management objective is to generate
a stable overall net interest margin.® It is
understood that as an inevitable part of
managing interest rate risk, the strategies
that would help to stabilize the Bank's net
interest margin (longer duration of equity)
would often lead to increased volatility of

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

the economic value of the Bank's equity on
a mark-to-market basis.

Assets Funded By Debt

Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank
seeks to generate a stable net interest
margin on assets funded by debt by
matching the interest rate characteristics
of each class of assets with those of the
corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate loans” whose interest rate resets
semi-annually based on the average cost of
a dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings.
These pools are funded with a mix of fixed
rate and floating rate borrowings to provide
borrowers with broadly stable interest rates
that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds pass-through
formulation incorporated in the lending rates
charged on the Bank's pool-based loans has
traditionally helped to minimize the interest
rate sensitivity of the net interest margin
on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of
declining demand for this product in favor
of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully
managing the gradual winding down of the
designated funding pools.

The Bank also offers fixed and floating rate
loans whose interest rate is directly linked
to market interest rates. For the marketbased loan products, the Bank’s net interest margin is preserved by using swaps
to align the interest rate sensitivity of the
loans with that of the Bank's underlying
funding (six-month LIBOR floating rate).
The Bank may also provide borrowers with
risk management products such as swaps
to modify the currency and interest rate
terms of its market-based loan products.
Although it prefers to retain the credit
risks, the Bank safeguards the intermediation fee it earns on risk management
products by simultaneously laying off the
market risks with an approved derivative
counterparty.

 

Annual Report 2005

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by
borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within duration mismatch limits around
benchmarks that replicate the interest rate
characteristics of the underlying funding
for each portfolio tranche. The portfolio
of liquid assets funded by borrowings
is currently divided into two tranches to
reflect the different business purposes
and underlying funding. The core part of
the investment portfolio is held to comply
with the Bank’s liquidity policy and uses a
six-month LIBOR floating rate benchmark.
The operational liquidity portfolio is man
aged to meet projected operational cas|
flow needs and uses a one-month LIBOR
floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets
and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan
products, the Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping
all new borrowings into floating rate in
one of the Bank's active currencies on a
standard six-month LIBOR rate reference.
Where the Bank issues debt with embedded options, the Bank simultaneously
enters into a swap with matching terms to
synthetically create the desired six-month
LIBOR-based floating rate funding. For risk
management purposes, callable funding is
considered as one alternative to issuing
short-term debt such as Euro Commercial
Paper. The Bank manages refinancing risk
by limiting the amount of debt that will
mature or is potentially callable within
one year to 25 percent of the outstanding
debt portfolio.

 

 

Assets Funded by Equity

The second principal source of interest rate
risk is the interest rate sensitivity of the
income earned from funding a significant
portion of the Bank's assets with equity
resources. Changes in market interest
rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity

resources (the SDR) affect the net interest
margin earned on assets funded by equity
resources. In general, lower nominal market interest rates result in lower lending
and investment rates, which in the longterm, reduce the nominal earnings on the
Bank's equity resources.

The Bank manages the interest rate profile
of the assets funded by equity resources
with the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the net interest margin to fluctuations
in market interest rates. This is achieved
by continuously adjusting the re-pricing
profile of the assets funded by the Bank’s
equity resources (fixed rate loans and
investments) to match a re-pricing profile
benchmark. The Bank's re-pricing profile
enchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby
a uniform 10 percent of the Bank's assets
unded by equity re-price in each year.
Using this benchmark, the Bank's net
interest margin on assets funded by equity
ends to track a ten-year moving average
of 10-year maturity SDR interest rates. At
he end of 2005, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the
benchmark in almost all annual buckets.
For net assets re-pricing within one year,
he Bank had a manageable gap relative
(0 the benchmark.

n addition to these two principal sources
of interest rate risk, the Bank is exposed
© prepayment risk on the parts of its loan
portfolio issued before 1997. Although
he Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on these older loans, in
practice the level of prepayments has
generally been within acceptable levels. In
2003 and 2004, however, driven by low
market interest rates, contracting credit
spreads for emerging market borrowers
and enhanced debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total loan prepayments increased sharply to UA 471
million and UA 542 million respectively.
In 2005, with the reversal in the market
interest rates, prepayments of pre-1997loans declined sharply to UA 70 million.
For all market-based loans issued since
1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk by linking the prepayment
penalty to the cost of redeploying the
funds at current market rates. In 2005,
prepayments of market-based floating rate
loans amounted to UA 192 million.

Operational Risk

The Bank, like all financial institutions,
is exposed to many types of operational
risks including the potential losses arising from internal activities or external
events caused by breakdowns in information, communication, physical safeguards,
business continuity, supervision, transaction processing, settlement systems and
procedures, and the execution of legal,
fiduciary, and agency responsibilities. The
Bank maintains a comprehensive system
of internal controls and back-up procedures designed to keep operational risk
at appropriate levels in view of the Bank's
financial strength and the characteristics
of the activities and markets in which it
operates. These internal controls are periodically updated to conform to industry
best practice.

 

In 2005, internal control improvements
focused on completing implementation
of the Bank's main treasury management
IT systems to reduce the ambient level
of operational risk in the Bank's trading
activities and to facilitate reporting of
its financial instruments in compliance
with international accounting standards.
In addition, the Bank made significant
progress in implementing COSO, an internationally recognized internal control
framework, with a view to consolidate
and enhance the existing internal control
processes.

 

Risk Management Process

The processes and procedures by which
the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve as its activities change in

response to market, credit, product, and
other developments. The highest level of
risk management is assured by the Bank's
Board of Executive Directors, which is
chaired by the President. In addition to
approving all risk management policies,
the Executive Directors regularly review
trends in the Bank's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with those
policies. An independent risk management
team supports the Bank’s risk management process,

The asset and liability management committee (ALCO) is the Bank’s most senior management forum on risk management issues.
ALCO is chaired by the Vice President,
Finance and meets at least monthly to
perform its oversight role. Among its key
functions, the committee reviews regular
and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves
strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and
confirms country and project credit risk ratings and the associated expected/incurred
loss estimates. ALCO is supported by seven
standing working groups that report to the
committee on specific risk management
issues. These working groups cover country
risk, commercial credit risk, interest rate
risk, currency risk, financial projections,
financial products and services, and operational risk.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for
implementing the Bank's risk management policies and guidelines is delegated
to appropriate business units.

Financial Results

In 2005, the Bank adopted all relevant
new or revised accounting standards and
interpretations issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (the IASB)
and the International Financial Reporting
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the
IASB. The application of these new or
revised standards and_ interpretations
resulted in certain changes to the Bank's

African Development Bank Chapter 007

accounting policies. Several of the changes
required retrospective application, resulting in the restatement of previously published financial statements

The accounting changes with the most significant financial statement effects related
to the adoption of the fair value option for
qualifying borrowings and related derivatives; the determination of the provision
for loan losses based on the incurred rather
than expected losses; the discontinuation of
the non-accrual policy; the election by the
Bank to immediately recognize actuarial
gains and losses against equity; and the
recognition of an investment in an associate
and related impairment. These accounting
changes are described in more detail in
Note C of the audited financial statements.
The effects on the previously published 2004
financial statements of all the accounting
changes implemented in 2005 could be
summarized as follows: net income for 2004
was restated from UA 107.4 million to UA
143.5 million; the reserves at December 31,
2004 increased from UA 1 486.4 million to
UA 2 186.6 million; total assets increased
from UA 10 043.9 million to UA 10 792.2
million.

The highlights of the Bank’s performance
in 2005 include the following:

© Net income increased by 54.22 percent
from the restated amount of UA 143.5
million in 2004 to UA 221.3 million for
2005. The increase is primarily attributable to a change of UA 67.7 million in
the provision for loan losses, from the
restated provision of UA 53.9 million
for 2004 to a net write-back of UA 13.9
million in 2005. Loan and investment
income increased by UA 1.1 million
and UA 31.8 million respectively. The
increase in investment income, which
was due to overall higher yields in
2005, was partially offset by a UA 20
million increase in interest expense. In
addition, other income increased by

 

Annual Report 2005

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

UA 8.3 million from UA 7.4 million in
2004 to UA 15.7 million in 2005 due to
cash received in respect of capital gains
on equity investments.

The Bank continues to maintain a stable risk bearing capacity. In compliance
with the interpretation guidelines of the
new and revised accounting standards
applicable to the Bank, that became
effective on January 1 2005, the prior
years’ effects of the application of
such standards were taken to reserves.
Also, as result of the application of
he revision to IAS 21 on functional
currency, cumulative currency translation adjustment at the end of 2004 of
UA 468 million was equally transerred to retained earnings in 2005.
Consequently, reserves including cumuative currency translation in 2004
increased from the restated amount of
UA 2.19 billion at December 31, 2004 to
UA 2.27 billion at the end of 2005.
otal reserves (i.e. including accumulated provisions on outstanding loan principal) at December 31, 2005 amounted
0 UA 2.66 billion or 48.23% of loans
outstanding at the end of the year.

Administrative expenses, net of reimursement by ADF and NTF for their
share of such expenses, increased by

 

Annual Report 2005

UA 4.1 million from UA 37.6 million
in 2004 to UA 41.7 million in 2005.
his was the result of the overall
increase in the administrative expenses
of the Bank group in 2005, compared
‘0 2004. The share of administrative
expenses between the Bank, the ADF
and NTF is based on a predetermined
cost sharing formula driven primarily
by the relative levels of certain operaional volume indicators.

Net income allocation and distribuion decisions of the Bank are driven
primarily by the adequacy of reserves.
Over the last few years, the Bank
as earned levels of net income suficient to enable not only the further
strengthening of the Bank's reserves
osition, but also contribute on behalf
of its shareholders to other development initiatives for Africa. In 2005,
he Board of Governors approved the
distribution of UA 144 million to various development initiatives in the coninent. The distribution comprised of UA
5 million to the Special Relief Fund for
African Countries Affected by Drought,
UA 11 million to the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
UA 15 million to a fund for technical
assistance to ADB-eligible countries, UA
30 million to the Post Conflict Countries

 

Facility (PCCF) and UA 36.7 million to
the special fund for post conflict assistance to the Democratic Republic of
Congo and UA 46.3 million to the ADF.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004

NOTE A- OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social
progress of its regional member states. The Bank finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically
in co-operation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in
the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance.
The Bank also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and
social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Development Fund
(ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. Notably, the ADB, ADF, and NTF each has separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing to the
economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly
among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the
nternational Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

n terms of prior years, accounting policies are consistent in all respects, except as noted in note C.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue recognition

nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding
and held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of

he financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments and the amortization of
remiums and discounts calculated on the effective interest method for held-to-maturity financial instruments.

 

Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank's right to receive payment is established.

Functional and presentation currencies

Although the Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries, as a result of the application of IAS 21 revised,
“The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its
member countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements
are presented. The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as
equivalent to one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by
the IME.

Currency translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried in UA. Translation differences
are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt.

Annual Report 2005

147148

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

This is composed of the UA amount at the predetermined rate net of the difference between the predetermined rate and the rate at the
time of receipt. Such difference is described in the Financial Statements as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS).
When currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever withdrawn
its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. Moreover, there is a significant financial disincentive to withdrawing membership. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that the members are independent African and
Non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress
of its regional member countries individually and jointly.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares. The Bank
may offset its obligation to make payments for the shares against the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The
repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter
referred to as “the termination date”. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to the Bank
for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date are outstanding.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying a former
member would have adverse consequences for the Bank's financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the risk had passed,
and indefinitely if appropriate. Further, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered by the Bank for purchase by
eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be
made until six months after the termination date. If the Bank were to terminate its operations within six months of the termination date,
all liabilities of the Bank shall first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before
any distribution can be made to any member country, including the withdrawing member.

If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently taken into account when
the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price
of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition,
the former member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would
have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price
of its shares was determined.

Employee benefits

1) Pension obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The plan provides benefit payments to participants
upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on
retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An actuarial valuation of the cost
of providing benefits for the Staff Retirement Plan is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching retirement age,
pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to
annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year they occur. Past
service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, and otherwise, is amortized on a straight-line basis
over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in the
balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank's defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets and
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

2) Post-employment medical benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to eligible
former staff, including retirees. Membership of the Plan includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a

Annual Report 2005African Development Bank Chapter 007

minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and
are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and
included in the statement of income and expenses. The Medical Benefit Plan Board, which is an independent Board created by the Bank
determines the adequacy of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and
plan members. The obligations to the Plan are valued every three years by independent qualified actuaries.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank’s balance sheet when the bank assumes related contractual rights
or obligations.

1) Financial assets
The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its investments
at initial recognition.

i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. The investment trading portfolio is acquired principally for
the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ji) Loans and receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. Accrued income and receivables include accrued interest on derivatives.

iii) Held-to-maturity investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management has the positive intention
and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are reported at amortized cost.

iv) Available-for-sale financial assets
The Bank has classified equity investments for which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future.

v) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are recognized on a
trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced
to the borrowers. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value
through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or
where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Available-forsale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes
in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period
in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly
in equity, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity

Annual Report 2005

149150

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

is recognized in profit or loss. However, interest on available-for-sale instruments is calculated using the effective interest method and
recognized in the income statement. Accrued interest on financial assets is disclosed in other accounts receivable.

2) Financial liabilities

i) Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity purposes. The
Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest rates. The
Bank's borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset
and liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding. In addition
to long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes
only. Certain of the Bank’s borrowings contain embedded derivatives that are required under IAS 39 to be separated from the host
contract and carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Certain borrowings, some of which also contain embedded derivatives, are
designated at fair value through profit or loss. Borrowings not so designated are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost
with interest expense determined using the effective interest method. The unamortized balance of the issuance costs are netted off
against borrowings in the balance sheet. Borrowing expenses include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums,
which is determined using the effective interest method. Certain of the Bank's borrowings have been obtained from the governments
of some member countries of the Bank and are interest free. In accordance with IAS 20 — “Accounting for Government Grants and
Disclosure of Government Assistance”, the benefit of borrowing at subsidized rates from member countries’ Governments has not
been recognized through the imputation of interest expense in the financial statements.

ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held-for-trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at
inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank primarily applies this fair value designation to borrowings which
have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the borrowing at fair value
through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch which would have arisen if the borrowings
were carried on the balance sheet at par value adjusted for unamortized premiums or discounts while the related swaps were carried
on the balance sheet at fair value.

 

iii) Other liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost. The
amounts include accrued finance charges, borrowings and other accounts payable.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. These instruments include currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the interest
rate or currency characteristics of the borrowing portfolio and are linked to the related borrowings at inception and remain so throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is disclosed as borrowing cost over the life of the derivative
contract and included in the income statement.

Although IAS 39 allows special hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the application of such special hedge
accounting criteria does not make evident the asset/liability and risk management strategy of the Bank and would result in certain
hedged instruments being carried at fair value, while other similar hedged instruments are carried at amortized cost. The Bank has
elected not to designate any qualifying hedging relationships, but rather classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all
changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their
risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and fair valued with the unrealized
gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Annual Report 2005African Development Bank Chapter 007

Impairment of financial assets

1) Assets carried at amortized cost

The Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired and makes provision for such impairment. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are
incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or
group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes
observable data that comes to the attention of the Bank.

f the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the
inancial asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment arises from delays that may be
experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the
non-collectibility, in whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

he carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment
loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

Upon the adoption of the amendments to IAS 39 on January 1, 2005, the Bank discontinued the practice of placing loans in non-accrual
status. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including those in arrears.

2) Assets carried at fair value
he Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
elowits costis considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets,
he cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss
on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or loss in the income statement. Impairment
losses recognized in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement. If, in a subsequent
eriod, the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event
occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.

Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

 

Fair value disclosure

he fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For financial assets with inactive markets or
unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.
hese include the use of recent arm's length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been
valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily
determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable, however, the values actually realized in
a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

 

Annual Report 2005

51152

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Swaps: Fair values for the Bank's interest rate and currency swaps are based on quoted market prices or pricing models and represent
the amounts that the Bank would receive or pay to terminate the agreements.

Borrowings: The fair valu

es of the Bank's borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques based on

discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread. Credit spreads are
obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank's new public bond issues.
The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated

derivatives. The models u

se market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation

models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews.

Equity investments: The underlying assets of the Bank's equity investments carried at fair value are periodically fair valued both by fund
managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises is based on the

latest available quoted bi

id prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods, for example,

discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's investments in these funds is estimated as the Bank's percentage ownership of the
net asset value of the Funds.

Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or

valuation techniques tha
pricing models and valua
rates, yield curves, exchan

use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses tools based on industry standard
ion techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest
ge rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank's financial instruments are subject

to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does no’

sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in

these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. For

air value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consid. A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that

instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition,
a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate data from observable markets. The Bank
only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that it arises from a change in a factor (including time) that market
participants would consider in setting a price. The gain or loss is amortized over the life of the borrowing on a straight-line basis.

 

Investment in associate

Under IAS 28, “Investme:

nts in Associates”, the ADF is considered an associate of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the

Bank has significant influence, but not control, over financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and

the ADF is described in m
Under the equity method

ore detail in Note H. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreasedAfrican Development Bank Chapter 007

to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's share of the profit or
loss of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred
between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2005, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1% of the Bank's economic
interest in the capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since
its creation in 1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank's investment in ADF. Further,
in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in ADF is assessed for impairment.

Retained earnings

Retained earnings of the bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior year’s income and unallocated current year net income.
Upon recommendation by the Board of Directors, the Board of Governors approves allocations or distributions of unallocated net income
to various specified development causes consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Bank.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as
appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference between
cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

- Buildings 15-20 years

- Fixtures and fittings 6-10 years

- Furniture and equipment 3-7 years.
- Motor vehicles 5 years.

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less
costs to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are
included in the income statement.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets include computer systems software and they are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible
assets is calculated using the straight line method over 3-5 years.

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain regional member
countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made under
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an operating
lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized
as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make
certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the
disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and
are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the

Annual Report 2005

153154

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

circumstances. The most significant judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Impairment losses on loans and advances

The Bank reviews its loan portfolios to assess impairment at each financial reporting date. In determining whether an impairment loss
should be recorded in the income statement, the Bank makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating that there
is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a portfolio of loans before the decrease can be identified with an individual loan in that portfolio. This evidence may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment
status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management
uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar
to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount
and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

2) Fair values of financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and comparative
market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data, however areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty),
volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect reported
fair value of financial instruments.

3) Impairment of available-for-sale equity investments

The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in
the fair value below its cost. This determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank
evaluates any evidence of a deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology,
and operational and financing cash flows.

4) Held-to-maturity investments

The Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention
and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

NOTE C - ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

In the current year, the Bank has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (the IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2005. The adoption of these new and revised
Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Bank's accounting policies in the following areas that have affected the
amounts reported for the current or prior years:

- the fair value option (IAS 39)

- incurred loss provisioning (IAS 39)

- employee benefits (IAS 19)

- investment in associate (IAS 28)

- determination of the Bank's functional currency (IAS 21)

Annual Report 2005African Development Bank Chapter 007

The impact of these changes in accounting policies is as follows:

The fair value option (IAS 39)

In June 2005, the International Accounting Standards Board issued an amendment to IAS 39 entitled “Financial Instruments: Recognition
and Measurement: The Fair Value Option”. Although this amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after January 1,
2006, early adoption under specific guidelines is permitted and encouraged. The Fair Value Option (FVO) allows an entity like the Bank
to make a voluntary election to account for financial assets or liabilities at fair value under certain prescribed conditions including situations where there are accounting mismatches for example, where economic hedging relationships have not been designated for hedge
accounting purposes. The Bank has elected to early-adopt the FVO in 2005. With the adoption of the FVO, Management has fair-valued
all borrowings with embedded derivatives that meet the condition in the standard, and reported the fair value movement in the income
and expenses account.

he transitional guidance of the revised IAS 39 on Fair Value Option requires that prior years’ comparative figures be restated for
all financial instruments that are designated as at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of previously outstanding borrowings designated at fair value under the transition was UA 4,604.70 million at December 31, 2005 (2004: UA 3,923.12 million). The
carrying amount of these same borrowings together with the related embedded derivatives in the previous financial statements at
December 31, 2004 was UA 3,946.93 million.

Incurred loss provisioning (IAS 39)

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Bank placed in non-accrual status all loans to, or guaranteed by a member country, if principal, interest or
other charges with respect to any such loan were overdue by six months or more. Upon the adoption of the revised IAS 39 on January
1, 2005, the Bank no longer placed loans in non-accrual status. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.
he revised standard requires that both principal and charges receivable on loans be assessed for impairment using the incurred loss
model. In accordance with consequential changes to IAS 30, cumulative amounts that had previously been non-accrued as a result of the
ormer non-accrual policy amounting to UA 526.13 million (net of provision) were transferred to reserves on January 1, 2005.

he change from an expected loss to incurred loss provisioning methodology under the revised IAS 39 also requires the restatement of
rior years’ comparative figures. The provision calculated under the revised methodology was UA 194.61 million at December 31, 2005
(2004: UA 213.59 million). The provision in the previous financial statements at December 31, 2004 was UA 450.08 million.

Employee benefits (IAS 19)

n accordance with the provisions of the standard, which permits early adoption, the Bank has early adopted in 2005 the amendments to
AS 19 — “Employee Benefits” issued in December 2004 which becomes effective on January 1, 2006. Under the amended standard the
Bank has elected to recognize actuarial gains and losses immediately in retained earnings in the year that they occur. Before the adoption
of the amended standard, the policy of the Bank had been to recognize actuarial gains and losses that exceeded 10 percent of the greater
of the present value of the defined staff retirement obligation and the fair value of the plan assets through the income statement.

 

The change in accounting policy has resulted in the restatement of prior year comparative figures. The actuarial loss previously not
recognized that was charged to retained earnings was UA 65.67 million.

Investment in associate (IAS 28)

The Bank also adopted the revised IAS 28 on “Investments in Associates” to account for its investment in ADF. Under IAS 28, the ADF
is considered an associate of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank has significant influence, but not control, over
financial and operating policy decisions. IAS 28 requires that the equity method of accounting be used to account for investments in
associate. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or
decreased to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. In addition, in accordance
with IAS 36, the net investment in ADF is assessed for impairment. The impairment amount relating to prior years was also included in
the total amount transferred to reserves on January 1, 2004. As a result of the application of IAS 28, the share of ADF surplus reported
in the Bank's statement of income and expenses amounted to UA 0.20 million in 2005 (2004: UA 0.01 million).

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

Determination of the Bank's functional currency (IAS 21)

Prior to 2005, the Bank considered the currencies of all its member countries as its functional currencies. With the application of IAS 21
revised, “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies
of all its member countries to the Unit of Account (UA), effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial
statements are presented. As a result of the application of IAS 21, translation gains of UA 1.58 million were recognized in the statement
of income and expenses in 2005.

Other

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, a number of International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations
had been promulgated, but were effective for periods after December 31, 2005. Of these, IFRS 7 — “Financial Instrument Disclosures”
is expected to be the most relevant for the Bank. Management is currently assessing the effect on the financial statement disclosures
of the Bank.

NOTE D - INVESTMENTS

As part of the overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, repurchase agreements, resale agreements and related financial derivatives including futures, forward contracts, currency
swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official
entities. For asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than one year and a minimum credit rating of A. Over-the-counter
(OTC) options on government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does not exceed
one year, and such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Currency and interest rate
swaps including asset swap transactions are permitted only with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with minimum credit
ratings of AA-/Aa3 at the time of the transaction.

The Bank uses external managers in the management of certain of its liquid assets, in accordance with the Bank's Asset and Liability
Management Guidelines. At December 31, 2005, UA 42.20 million (2004: UA 177.45 million) of investments were under external
management.

Securities sold under repurchase agreements with a market value of UA 466.96 million were outstanding at December 31, 2005
(2004: UA 9.30 million). The securities pledged as collateral have a carrying value of UA 422.68 million at December 31, 2005
(2004: UA 9.14 million). These securities include trading and held-to-maturity instruments, which have been included in the respective
balance sheet captions.

Administrative expenses hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure ie. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
hedge its administrative expenses. The nominal value of the forward transactions as at December 31, 2005 amounted to UA 64.12 million

with an unfavorable market value of UA 0.65 million.

NOTE F - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments on paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making their
payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in the local currency; or

2) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the
first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-regional members — five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual
installments. The First installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The Second to the Eighth installments shall
be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the non-negotiable notes balance was as follows:

NOTE G - LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other freely
convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount
disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically
the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs and are not intended
for sale. Further, management does not believe that there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank. The
types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:

Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank's own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis points,
resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to those lenders that benefit from the Bank's loans.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency variable terms or retain the terms of
their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other
terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements.

Effective October 1, 1997, the Bank provides several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases the applicable rate of interest
is the sum of two components, namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: The Bank introduced single currency variable rate loans on October 1, 1997. The variable
base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on January
1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: The Bank introduced LIBOR-based single currency floating rate loans with effect from
October 1, 1997. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank's selected reference interest rate in each market. The Bank's standard floating base rate is the six (6) month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR,
EURIBOR and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following
the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization
schedule.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate
to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains
unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank's assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be
financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2005, the Bank had no outstanding irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued to
commercial banks on undisbursed loans (2004: UA 14.94 million).

Also, the Bank may provide guarantees for securities issued by an entity eligible for the Banks’ loans. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the borrower incurs the underlying financial obligation and are called when a guaranteed party demands payment under
the guarantee. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31,
2005 the Bank had no outstanding guarantee to any entity (2004: UA 15.38 million).

NOTE H - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in Associate: African Development Fund

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing
to the economic and social development of the African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly
among the African countries, and to provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions
were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement
since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increase
and General Replenishments.

he ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected
y State Participants, which reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants and the ADB. The
President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

© carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share
of the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis
of a cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects
executed during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended
December 31, 2005 amounted to UA 111.86 million (2004: UA 103.06 million), representing 68.76 percent (2004: 69.64 percent) of
he shareable administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the
Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
rovides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants
in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the
articipants. At December 31, 2005, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 1.01 % (2004: 1.11%).

 

he ADB's investment in the ADF was tested for impairment and an impairment loss of UA 0.15 million was retrospectively recognized
in the income statement in 2004.

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

Other Equity Participations

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, or public sector companies
that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is
to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The
Bank’s equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role
in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects which
also have significant economic merit.

Although the Bank is allowed to take equity positions of up to twenty five percent (25%) the Bank currently holds less than 20% of the
total equity capital of each institution in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies
in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’
Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29, 2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up capital and reserves and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building.
The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions
owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments
are included in the income statement.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank's owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for the
purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third party.
If the Bank decides to give up on the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.

Annual Report 2005African Development Bank Chapter 007

NOTE J - BORROWINGS

It is the Bank's policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital resources to 80 percent of the
callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both senior and subordinated debt to
80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries. At December 31, 2005, total borrowings amounted to UA 5,940.40
million comprising senior debt and subordinated debt amounting to UA 5,210.66 million and UA 729.74 million, respectively. As of the
same date, the ratio of senior debt to the non-borrowing members’ callable capital of UA 8,523.93 million was 61.13 percent. Also at
December 31, 2005, the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital of UA 19,367.00 million was 30.67 percent.

At December 31, 2005, borrowings with embedded callable options amounted to UA 466.60 million (2004: UA 533.96 million). These
options can be exercised annually on interest payment dates from the time the bond is first callable until its maturity date.

The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities and to
lower its funding costs.

The Bank has entered into currency swap agreements with major international banks by which proceeds of a borrowing are converted
into a different currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for the future exchange of the two
currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate
payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit and loss was UA 4,604.70 million at December 31, 2005
(2004: UA 3,923.12 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December
31, 2005 was UA 4,553.43 million (2004: UA 3,946.93 million).

There was a net loss of UA 30.72 million on financial assets and liabilities carried as at fair value through profit or loss for the year ended
December 31, 2005 (2004: loss of UA 7.70 million). This included a loss of UA 10.18 million which was attributable to changes in the
Bank's credit risk during the year ended December 31, 2005 (2004: UA 10.31 million). The fair value changes attributable to changes
in the Bank's credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings at fair value through profit or loss
using the Bank's credit spread versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period.

The valuation of some borrowings and derivatives are based on valuation techniques and the effect for 2005 amounted to a loss of
UA 51.27 million (2004: UA 18.86 million - gain).

NOTE K - EQUITY

Equity is composed of capital, retained earnings and fair value gains on available-for-sale equity investments . These are further detailed
as follows:

Capital
Subscriptions paid in

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank is made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
general capital increases. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29,
1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments
to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares
to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up
and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6 %) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to

Annual Report 2005

73Chapter 007 African Development Bank
the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock
of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the
authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

The Bank's capital as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

otal unsubscribed shares at December 31, 2005 amounted to UA 233.94 million, comprising UA 81.61 million for shares to be issued
upon payment of future cash installments, UA 113.50 million for shares available for reallocation, and UA 38.83 million representing
he balance shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia) after allocating UA 9.09 million to
reasury shares. Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 41.93
million callable, and UA 5.99 million paid-up, shares) are currently held as treasury shares of the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6)
of the Bank Agreement. In 2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the
ormer Yugoslavia to apply for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions
including the assumption pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the
event that a successor state declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former
Yugoslavia, which could have been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of
he Bank in accordance with the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such
successor state. Furthermore, pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate
he shares of former Yugoslavia to interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor
states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of
he state's Official Development Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia.
he Bank has since accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries
were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US$ have been fixed
at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies
when received to Units of Account. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions
account.

leases may be extended for periods that are no longer than the original term of the leases.

NOTE O - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on
a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the Plan, upon completion of 6 months service
without interruption of more than 30 days.

The Plan is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November 2004,
the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the Plan, including simplification of the calculation of the employee contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's residual responsibility and rights as the Plan sponsor, changes in survivor child benefits and an
increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost associated with these
changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and has been recorded in 2004. Most participants have switched to the revised plan. Staff joining
the Bank after January 1, 2005 can benefit only from the revised Plan. Under the revised Plan, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent
of regular salary. A tax factor used in the previous Plan has been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution,
but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the Plan are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the
provisions of the Plan. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the Plan’s liabilities. At December 31, 2005,
virtually all of the investments of the Plan were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the following
objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well as
hedging the currency exposure of the Plan's anticipated future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the
Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the currency exposure of the Plan’s anticipated future liabilities.

 

 

Staff Medical Benefit Plan: The staff medical benefit plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution
B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17, 2002 and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the Medical Benefit Plan, staff
members or retirees contribute a percentage of their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing of the plan. A medical benefits plan board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives
of retirees and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the plan. The contributions from the Bank, staff and
retirees are deposited in a trust account.

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity
securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking
expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and

183Chapter 007 African Development Bank

expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk
premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA
corporate bonds.

For measurement purposes, the annual growth rate in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to decrease ratably
between the current period and 2009, with the growth rate assumed to remain at that level thereafter.

The following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation at December 31 for the Staff Retirement Plan:

Debt securities 64,328 71,029
Equity securities 91,843 51,441

 

Total 156,171 122,470

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, all the assets of the Medical Benefit Plan were invested primarily in time deposits.

In the year ended December 31, 2006, the Bank's estimate of contributions it expects to make to the Staff Retirement Plan and the Staff
Medical Benefit Plan are UA 10.74 million and UA 5.10 million, respectively.

The health care cost growth rate can significantly affect the reported post-retirement benefit income or costs and benefit obligations for

NOTE P - RISK MANAGEMENT

In the normal course of its development banking business, the Bank may be exposed to the following types of financial risks:

Country Credit Risk: Country credit risk includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or willingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country

exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessments. These include the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as
well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

Commercial Credit Risk: In the ordinary course of business, the Bank uses a variety of financial instruments, some of which involve
elements of commercial credit risk in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet. Commercial credit risk exposure represents the
maximum potential accounting loss due to possible non-performance by counterparties under the terms of the contracts. Additionally, the
nature of the instruments involves contract value and notional principal amounts that are not reflected in the basic financial statements.
For securities, the Bank limits trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties with the highest credit ratings. Credit risk is controlled through application of eligibility criteria and limits for transactions with individual counterparties, based on their credit rating and size,
subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital for any single counterparty. The Bank may require collateral in the form
of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.

The Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce such credit risk, the Bank
only enters into long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible under the Bank's Assets and Liability Management Guidelines,
which include requirement that the counterparties have a minimum credit rating of AA-/Aa3. The Bank does not anticipate that any of its
counterparties will fail to perform their obligations under such agreements.

Market Risks: Market risks encompass funding, liquidity, currency and interest, and exchange rate risks. Such risks are managed through
the pricing of loans and the Bank's overall asset and liability management practices. The Bank's liquidity policy ensures that it has the
resources to meet its net disbursement and debt service obligations and allow it flexibility in deciding the appropriate time to access the
capital market. To achieve this objective, the Bank operates on a prudential minimum as well as an operational level of liquidity established
by this policy. The prudential minimum level of liquidity is based on the debt service payment of the next year, the projected net loan
disbursement for the next year, the loan equivalent value of signed guarantees and the undisbursed equity investments. All potential debt
service payments due to early redemption of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are included in the determination of the debt
service payment of the next year. To enable the Bank to take advantage of low-cost funding opportunities as they arise, the Bank's policy
allows it to build up liquid resources above the prudential minimum level. The maximum level of liquidity is limited to the total of the minimum plus 50% of the stock of undisbursed loans. The Bank maintains interest rate limits for each internally managed or externally managed
active currency portfolio. The borrowing cost pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's recent loans,
has helped to limit the interest rate sensitivity of the net spread earnings on its loan portfolio. The Bank holds or lends the proceeds of its
borrowings in the same currencies borrowed (after swap activities).

 

Also, to avoid currency mismatches, borrowers are required to service their loans in the currencies disbursed by the Bank. Furthermore, in
order to minimize exchange rate risks, the Bank matches its borrowing obligations in any one currency (after swap activities) with assets in
the same currency. The Bank also offers loans with interest rates directly linked to market interest rates. For such market-based loan products, the Bank's net margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity of the loans with that of the Bank's underlying
funding (6-month LIBOR floating rate).

Liquidity Position

The Bank’s liquidity policy ensures that it has the resources to meet its net disbursement and debt service obligations while at the same time
allowing the flexibility in deciding the appropriate time to access the capital markets. The Bank's liquidity policy requires that it holds liquid
assets in a target zone, above the required prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) and less than the operational level of liquidity (OLL).
The PML is computed as the sum of the debt service payment for the next year, the projected net loan disbursement for the next year, the
loan equivalent value of signed guarantees and the undisbursed equity investments. As an operational guideline, the OLL is computed as the
PML plus 50 percent of the stock of undisbursed loans. The table below provides an analysis of assets, liabilities and members’ equity into
relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to contractual maturity date. It is presented under
the most prudent consideration of maturity dates where options or repayment patterns allow for early repayment possibilities. Therefore,
in the case of liabilities, the earliest possible repayment date is shown, while for assets, it is the latest possible repayment date. Assets and
liabilities that do not have a contractual maturity date are grouped together in the “Maturity undefined” category.

Liquidity position at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. The length of time
for which the rate of interest is fixed on a financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to interest rate risk. The table below
provides information on the extent of the Bank's interest rate exposure based either on the contractual maturity date of its financial instruments or, in the case of instruments that reprice to a market rate of interest before maturity, the next repricing date. Securities that comprise
the Bank's dealing portfolio are assumed to reprice within the “one year or less” category.

Interest rate risk position as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was as follows:

NOTE Q - RELATED PARTIES
The following related parties have been identified:

The Bank makes or guarantees loans to some of its members who are also its shareholders, and borrows funds from the capital markets
in the territories of some of its shareholders. As a multilateral development institution with membership comprising 53 African states and
24 non-African states (the “regional members” and “non-regional members” respectively), subscriptions to the Capital of the Bank are
made by all its members. All the powers of the Bank are vested in the Board of Governors, which consists of the Governor appointed by
each member of the Bank, who exercises the voting power of the appointing member country. Member country subscriptions and voting
powers are disclosed in Note K. The Board of Directors, which is constituted by eighteen (18) Directors elected by the member countries,
is responsible for the conduct of the general operations of the Bank, and for this purpose, exercises all the powers delegated to it by the
Board of Governors. The Bank also makes or guarantees loans to certain of the agencies of its regional member countries and to public
and private enterprises operating within such countries. Such loans are approved by the Board of Directors. Outstanding balances on
loans granted to regional member countries are disclosed in Note P. Outstanding borrowings of the Bank are disclosed in Note J.

In addition to its ordinary resources, the Bank administers the resources of other entities under special arrangements. In this regard, the
Bank administers the resources of the African Development Fund (ADF). Furthermore, the Bank administers various special funds and
trust funds which have purposes that are consistent with its objectives of promoting the economic development and social progress of
its regional member countries. In this connection, the Bank administers the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) as well as multilateral and bilateral
donor funds in the form of grants.

 

The ADF was established pursuant to an agreement between the Bank and certain countries. The general operation of ADF is conducted
by a 12-member Board of Directors of which 6 members are selected by the Bank. The Bank exercises 50 percent of the voting power
in ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. To carry out its functions, the ADF utilizes the offices, staff,
organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it reimburses the Bank based on an agreed cost-sharing formula, driven in large
part by the number of programs and projects executed during the year. The Bank’s investment in ADF is included in Equity Participation
and disclosed in Note H. In addition to the amount reported as Equity Participation, the Bank periodically makes net income allocation to
the Fund, to further its objectives. Net income allocations are reported as Other Resources in the books of the Fund. Net income allocation to the Fund in 2005 amounted to UA 46.30 million (2004: UA 10.00 million).

 

 

 

The NTF is a special fund administered by the Bank with resources contributed by Nigeria. The ADB Board of Directors conducts the general operations of NTF on the basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and, in this connection the Bank consults with the Government
of Nigeria. The NTF also utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank for which it reimburses to the Bank, its
share of administrative expenses for such utilization. The share of administrative expenses reimbursed to the Bank by both the ADF and
NTF are disclosed in Note N.

The Grant resources administered by the Bank on behalf of other donors, including its member countries, agencies and other entities are
generally restricted for specific uses, which include the co-financing of Bank’s lending projects, debt reduction operations and technical

assistance for borrowers including feasibility studies. Details of the outstanding balance on such grant funds are disclosed in Note T-5.

The Bank also administers the Staff Retirement and Medical Benefit Plan. The activities of the Staff Retirement and Medical Benefit Plans
are disclosed in Note O.

NOTE R - EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative: At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on
a proposal for the African Development Fund (ADF), the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative. Through the Development Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support
for this Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to
ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries
worldwide, 32 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered by relieving postcompletion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain
the financial integrity of the ADF, donors would make additional contributions to ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal
and service charge payments.

For the ADF, based on debt disbursed and outstanding at December 31, 2004 (cut-off date) and an effective implementation date of
January 1 2006, a total of approximately UA 6.1 billion in loans outstanding to eligible HIPC countries is expected to be either cancelled
under the MDRI or repaid from HIPC resources. Of this amount, UA 4.0 billion related to countries that were already at HIPC completion
point as of December 31 2005.

As of March 29, 2006, when these financial statements were authorized by the Board of Directors for transmission to the Board of
Governors for approval, the MDRI, which is expected to become effective during 2006, had not become effective. Once it becomes effective, it would result in the immediate reduction in total ADF loans outstanding by the amount of loans actually cancelled, and therefore
a corresponding decrease in the net assets of the ADF. Such decrease is expected to be offset over time with the compensation received
from the donors. Although the full effects of the MDRI on future financial statements of the Fund will only be known after final agreement by the donors on the key terms, the reduction in total ADF outstanding loans as stated above will impact the net assets of the Fund
and consequently the ADB’s share of such assets for the purposes of the determination of the value of the Bank’s investment in ADF. The
MDRI has no effect on the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005.

NOTE S - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 29, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The
financial statements will be approved by the Board of Governors at its annual meeting in May 2006.

NOTE T-2: ARREARS CLEARANCE OPERATIONS

(i) The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally co-ordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World Bank
and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of
Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions received
from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount of DRC’s
arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due have been consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present value
of the new loans equals the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The new loans carry the
weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC; b) the magnitude of DRC’s
arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC has created extensive destruction of
hysical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there was no automatic linkage
tween the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the consolidated facility. In June
2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Consequently, the consolidated
acility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, has been established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance
lan. Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors of the Bank may from time
to time make to the special account, representing the Bank's contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income
allocation is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the
Bank. Consequently, income received on the consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves
(0 the special account only after the formal allocation, in whole or in part, of such amount by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

 

(ii) Assistance to Post-Conflict Countries
he Bank has established a framework to assist post-conflict countries in clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework
entails the setting aside of a pool of resources with contributions from the ADB net income allocations and contributions from the ADF.
Contributions would also be accepted from third parties that are interested in facilitating the process of re-engaging the post-conflict
countries in the development process and in assisting them to reach the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point. Resources
would be provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after
maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection, the Board of Governors by its
Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004 approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income of the Bank, to the PostConflict Countries Fund (PCCF). The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005 approved an additional
allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank's contribution to the facility. Contributions
received from ADB will not be used to clear debts owed to the Bank by beneficiary post-conflict countries. The resources of the PCCF are
kept separate and distinct from those of the ADB.

 

 

 

 

(iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPCs). Under this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over
an extended period to bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original framework of HIPC initiatives, selected loans to
eligible beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans,
as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiatives, and their nominal values.

 

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their
carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and
therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust
Fund at book values.

Chapter 007 African Development Bank

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original
framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt
service reductions; and release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt relief is
provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion points, of up to 40 percent of total debt relief is provided
whenever possible, within a 15-year horizon. At December 31, 2005, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 17 ADB borrowing
countries, of which 14 had reached the completion point. During the year ended December 31, 2005, debt relief of UA 106.05 million
(2004: UA 129.48 million) was received on behalf of the ADB borrowing countries.

NOTE T-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

(i) The Nigeria Trust Fund was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African
Development Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of
30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the Fund shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However, the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. Although the terms of
the current agreement would terminate on April 25, 2006, negotiations are at an advanced stage between the Bank and the Nigerian
Authorities for the renewal of the agreement and extension of the life of the Fund. To enable the Fund to continue to operate pending
the conclusion of the negotiations, the two parties have agreed to a one-year extension of the life of the Fund under the same terms and
conditions as the current agreement. The initial capital of this Fund was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25
million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14,
1976, and payment of the second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the Fund with Naira 50 million. The first installment of
Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was received
on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.

The resources of the Nigeria Trust Fund at December 31, 2005 and 2004 are summarized below:

(ii). The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution 2074 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in 1991 to include
the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields are likely to facilitate the
Bank's objective of meeting the needs of regional member countries in those fields. The resources of the Fund consist of contributions by
the Bank, the African Development Fund and various member states.

The summary statement of the resources and assets of the Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought)
as at December 31, 2005 and 2004 follows:

At December 31, 2005, a total of UA 5.25 million (2004: UA 1.77 million) had been committed but not yet disbursed under the Special
Relief Fund.

NOTE T-4: TRUST FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These funds,
held separately from those of the ordinary resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are
translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

(i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby
Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members
who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

(ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of Algeria
to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975, an
amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2005, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2004: US$ 13.45 million) had been so
repaid.

(iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance to African
member countries affected by drought and famine.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

We have audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank (the Bank) for the year ended 31 December 2005
which comprise the balance sheet, the statement of income and expenses, the statement of recognised income and expense,
statement of cash flows and the related notes A to T. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors
as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank.

This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of the Agreement
establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work,
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of management and auditor
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audit.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting policies used and significant estimates and judgments made by the Bank’s
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Disagreement on reclassification of the Bank’s capital from equity to liabilities

As set out under the Member Countries’ Subscription accounting policy in Note B to the financial statements, the Agreement
Establishing the Bank provides that a member country (or “State”) may withdraw from the Bank at any time (defined as the
“termination date”). Exercising such right of withdrawal requires the Bank to arrange for the repurchase of such member
country’s shares as part of the settlement of accounts with that State. In our view, although the Bank is able to withhold any
amount due to the member country for its shares so long as the State remains liable as borrower or guarantor to the Bank,
and notwithstanding the fact that the member country remains liable for its direct and contingent liabilities to the Bank as
long as any part of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date is outstanding, the Bank does not have
the unconditional right to avoid settling its contractual obligations at termination date to the member country. Therefore, in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 32, member countries’ capital stock should be reclassified
in the Bank’s financial statements as financial liabilities instead of equity.

The impact of this accounting treatment would be to reclassify credit balances of UA 2,263,445,736 and UA 2,213,505,210
of capital stock and to reclassify debit balances of UA 151,758,878 and UA 147,203,564 of cumulative exchange adjustment on subscriptions from equity to liabilities in the balance sheet of the Bank for the years ended 31 December 2005 and
31 December 2004 respectively. A further impact would be to reduce the Bank’s net income by UA 144,000,000 and
UA 114,640,000 which relates to the expensing of the Board of Governors’ approved distributions of income in the years
ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 respectively. The total reserves of the Bank remain unchanged as a result
of this reduction in net income relating to the Board of Governors’ approved distributions of income.

Qualified opinion arising from disagreement on reclassification of the Bank’s capital from equity to liabilities

In our opinion, except for the effects on the financial statements of the matter referred to in the preceding two paragraphs,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Bank as of 31 December 2005,
and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Financial Management
Subscriptions

African Development Fund resources mainly consist of Bank and State Participants’
subscriptions, and other resources received
by the Fund. The cumulative subscription
to ADF as at December 31, 2005, was
UA 14.95 billion, compared with UA 12.82
billion in 2004.

The replenishment level for the Tenth
General Replenishment of the resources of the Fund (ADF-X) was set at
UA 3.40 billion, and covers the 3-year
operational period starting in 2005 and
ending in 2007. ADF-X became effective in
September 2005, and, as of December 31,
2005, State Participants had subscribed to
UA 2.02 billion, representing 59 percent of
the ADF-X target replenishment level.

Subscriptions to the Fund are usually paid
in three equal annual installments, in
either cash or promissory notes. Payments
received for ADF-X in 2005 amounted to
UA 503.9 million. The encashment schedule of the promissory notes is directly
linked to specific replenishments and usually covers a standard 10-year period based
on disbursement projections. In 2005, the
Fund encashed promissory notes for a total
amount of UA 749.7 million, compared
with UA 805.5 million in 2004.

Investment

ADF cash and investments amounted to
UA 1.96 billion at December 31, 2005,
compared to UA 1.54 billion in 2004.

Annual Report 2005

Investment income for the year amounted
to UA 68.8 million, a return of 3.98
percent, on an average liquidity level of
UA 1.73 billion compared with an income
of UA 48.2 million in 2004 for a return of
3.14 percent on an average liquidity of
UA 1.53 billion.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancellations, at December 31, 2005,
amounted to UA 13.17 billion compared
with UA 12.16 billion at the end of 2004.
At the end of 2005, there were 1,933
active signed loans and grants amounting
to UA 7.79 billion. Also at December 31,
2005, a total of 47 loans amounting to
UA 217.4 million had been fully repaid.

Disbursements

Disbursements of loans and grants
increased slightly from UA 680.5 million in 2004 to UA 691.1 million. As at
December 31, 2005, cumulative disbursements on loans and grants amounted to
UA 9.28 billion. A total of 1,258 loans and
grants were fully disbursed for an amount
of UA 7.52 billion, representing 81 percent
of cumulative disbursements.

Financial Results

The ADF reported a surplus of UA 19.7
million for 2005, compared to UA 0.9
million for 2004. Income from loans and
investments amounted to UA 134.5 million
in 2005 compared to UA 112.3 million in
2004. Income from investments increased
by UA 20.6 million or 42.71 percent from
UA 48.2 million in 2004 to UA 68.8 million in 2005, due mainly to an increase

the Fund's liquidity. The Fund implemented
a new investment policy which included
investments in higher yielding held-tomaturity securities in 2004. Income from
loans increased marginally from UA 64.1
million in 2004 to UA 65.8 million in 2005.
Administrative expenses, which represents
the Fund's share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB Group, increased by
UA 8.8 million, from UA 103.1 million
in 2004 to UA 111.9 million in 2005.
The Fund's share of the total shareable
expense of the ADB group is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which
is driven primarily by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators.

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy,
service charges on loans made to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from
loan income if principal repayment and
service charges are in arrears for 6 months
or more. As a result of this policy, an
amount of UA 4.7 million representing the
non-accrued loan income for the year was
excluded from 2005 income compared to
an amount of UA 0.4 million in 2004.African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004

NOTE A - PURPOSE, ORGANISATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organisation

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, promote
cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms
for such purposes.

The ADF has a twelve-member (12) Board of Directors, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President
of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred to as the
Bank Group. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF is
not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow. The principal purpose
of ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB finances development projects and
programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the
development of its member countries and where necessary, provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an Agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries,
particularly the lesser-developed countries.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions by State Participants, other resources received by the Fund
and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of the Fund consisted of subscriptions by the
Bank and the original State Participants to the ADF Agreement. Thereafter, the resources have been replenished through Special and
General Increases of subscriptions.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to the nature and organization of the Fund, these special purpose financial statements have been prepared for the specific purpose
of reflecting the Net Development Resources of the Fund and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Articles 35(1) and (2) of the
Agreement Establishing the Fund, which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its financial position and
income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's financial statements are as follows:

Monetary basis of Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement Establishing the Fund (the
Agreement) defined a Unit of Account as having a value of 0.81851265 gram of fine gold.

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into

effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of

Annual Report 2005African Development Fund Chapter 007

IMF members were, from that date, made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles
of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This
was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s Unit of Account
to be equivalent to the Unit of Account of the African Development Bank (the Bank) which is for the time being defined as equivalent
to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors on June 22, 1993, adopted January
1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect of the Resolution, and the Fund's Unit of Account has since then been defined as equal to
the Bank's Unit of Account.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into Units of Account at the
rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into Units of Account at rates prevailing at the Statement
of Net Development Resources date. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment.
Translation gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions.
Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into Units of Account at December 31, 2005 and 2004 were as follows:

2005 2004
1 Unit of Account equals:

Argentinian Peso 4.301570 4.595360
Brazilian Real 3.344340 4.121060
Canadian Dollar 1.664180 1.869200

United States Dollar 1.429270 1.553010

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting
from the rates indicated above.

Chapter 007 African Development Fund

Participants Subscriptions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full, as subscriptions receivable from participants,
upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when ADF receives instruments of
subscriptions from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the Replenishment Resolution. The portion
of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants, are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet
payable, and are not included in the Net Development Resources of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout
the replenishment period (generally 3 years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions when
they become due from certain members is conditional upon the respective member's budgetary appropriation process.

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes. The
notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

For the ADF IX and X replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent to the
net present value of their entire subscription and contribution. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with the
full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income
generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the
cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned to the credit of the State Participant. Such
discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective contributions to capital by the relevant Participant
over and above the initial cash advanced.

Maintenance of value of currency holdings

rior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in Units of Account and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the Unit of Account or its
oreign exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant
shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of
he amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within that paricipant’s territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's
olding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

n accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09 and 2005-01 which all
stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth general replenishments,
subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received into the
Fund's Unit of Account, are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits going to Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions.

Investments

he Fund’s investment securities are classified based on management's intention on the date of purchase. Securities which management has
he intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. All other investment securiies are carried at market value. Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations
issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-.
For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits,
certificates of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than a year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and
other financial institutions with a minimum credit rating of A.

 

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses and interest earned.

Annual Report 2005African Development Fund Chapter 007

Due to the nature of investments held by the Fund and its policies governing the use of such investments, the Fund classifies its held-tomaturity and trading investments maturing within 3 months from the date of purchase as liquidity in the statement of cash flows. Investments
in the trading portfolio are carried and reported at market values and related unrealized gains and losses are included in income.

Loans

he Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans are not
included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a borrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are overdue
y 6 months or more, unless the Fund's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate future. Further,
management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed
in non-accrual status, charges that had been accrued on loans to the borrower, which remained unpaid, are deducted from the income
rom loans of the current period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment has been
received by the Fund.

he Fund participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily indebted poor countries
(HIPCs) to help ensure that the reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under this initiative, creditors
rovide debt relief for those countries that demonstrated good policy performance over an extended period to bring their debt burdens to
sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds from donors, including
he Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to the Fund.

 

Under the original framework of the initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement between the Fund, the beneficiary country
and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net present
value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received and the
carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced framework, the implementation mechanism comprises partial payments of ADF debt service as it falls due with funds
received from the Trust Fund.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current year’s presentation.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

These obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the form of
non-negotiable non-interest bearing notes payable, at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in Units of Account and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment between 40 and 50 years, after a ten-year grace period commencing from the date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is repayable from the eleventh to the twentieth year at a rate of 1 percent per
annum and thereafter at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount
disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum
commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature
of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a period of 10
years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in equal installments over 7 years.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers
or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2005, outstanding
irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 3.18 million (2004: UA 2.41 million).

As at December 31, 2005, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of

UA 687.69 million (2004: UA 843.01 million) of which UA 78.36 million (2004: UA 67.04 million) was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2005, would have been
higher by UA 5.39 million (2004: UA 5.33 million). At December 31, 2005, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual
loans amounted to UA 43.19 million, compared to UA 38.86 million at December 31, 2004.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of 20 years,
including a five-year grace period. The service charge rate on utilized lines of credit is the same as for project loans.

Chapter 007 African Development Fund

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund's lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the Third and Fourth General Replenishments, 10.00 percent under the Fifth and Sixth General Replenishments, 7.50 percent under the Seventh and Eighth General Replenishments have been
allocated as grant funds to provide technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in
specified member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the Ninth Replenishment
and 34.29 percent under the Tenth Replenishment were set aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance
and project financing. Under the Eighth and Ninth General Replenishments, technical assistance may be provided for, on a reimbursable
basis.

Technical Assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period, from the
date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not possible, the
grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement of the operations of
existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment period of 5
years thereafter.

Technical Assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative

Under the original framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by
the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative.
Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, loans identified to be paid off were written down to their estimated net present value.
The amount of the write-down, representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown as a reduction
in Sources of Development Resources. The amount of UA 71.08 million in the statement of Net Development Resources represents the writedown relating to the debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework. The outstanding balance and net present
value of the loans owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and UA 60.96 million, respectively.

In 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing
the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework.
Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service
reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total net present
value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total
debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the debt service obligation
of ADF eligible beneficiary countries paid by the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF amounted to UA 79.74 million.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the African Development
Fund (ADF), the International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their
claims on countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Through the Development
Committee Communiqué of September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI), and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

 

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries worldwide, 32 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered by relieving post-completion-point
HIPCs' repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial integrity of

Annual Report 2005African Development Fund Chapter 007

he ADF, donors would make additional contributions to ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.
For the ADF, based on debt disbursed and outstanding at December 31, 2004 (cut-off date) and an effective implementation date of
january 1, 2006, a total of approximately UA 6.1 billion in loans outstanding to eligible HIPC countries is expected to be either cancelled
under the MDRI or repaid from HIPC resources. Of this amount, UA 4.0 billion related to countries that were already at HIPC completion
joint as of December 31, 2005.

As of March 29, 2006, when these financial statements were authorized by the Board of Directors for transmission to the Board of
Governors for approval, the MDRI, which is expected to become effective during 2006, had not become effective. Once it becomes effecive, it would result in the immediate reduction in total ADF loans outstanding by the amount of loans actually cancelled, and therefore
a corresponding decrease in the net assets of the ADF. Such decrease is expected to be offset over time with the compensation received
tom the donors. The effects of the MDRI on future financial statements of the Fund will be known after final agreement by the donors
on the key terms and will be reflected in the financial statements of the ADF once it becomes effective. The MDRI has no effect on the
inancial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

n connection with an internationally co-ordinated effort between the ADB Group, the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral
donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002 approved an
arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants (the Deputies)
authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF (ADF-IX) to clear
he entire stock of the DRC's arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual
Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF VIII as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on charges to the ADB.

 

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to the
Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from Participants in the form of a special general
increase and nine General Replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions and Voting Power.

The Tenth General Replenishment, approved by the Board of Governors resolution F/BG/2005/01 adopted on May 4, 2005 came into
effect on September 06, 2005, when State Participants deposited with the Fund, instruments of subscription representing an aggregate
amount of 30.98 percent of the total intended subscription.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions received into Units of Account are recorded in the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions Account.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under the international law and hence no longer a State Participant in the Fund or a member of
the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in the Fund, less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of
the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported in these financial statements as Other Resources.

Also included in Other Resources is a total of UA 123.33 million representing the contributions by the Bank of UA 121.33 million, and
by the Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Fund’s Agreement.
The contributions by the Bank included UA 15.00 million allocated from the Bank's 2002 net income to mitigate the negative impact on
the commitment capacity of the Fund, of the cost relating to the temporary relocation of the operations of the Bank Group to Tunisia.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value
of the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low income regional member countries of the Bank.
While the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed and outstanding balance, and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of
administering the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding
loans.

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

In accordance with the agreement establishing the Fund, the Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to
it under Article 8, which empowers the Fund to receive other resources including grants from State Participants, non-participating
countries, and from any public or private body or bodies.

At December 31, 2005 the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources amounted to UA 4.06 million (2004: UA 3.85 million) representing the balance on a grant received from Japan, for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of ADF.

NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the African Development Bank for the estimated fair value of its use of the
latter's offices, staff, organization, services and facilities. The amount reimbursed, referred to as administrative expenses, is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects
executed during the period by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 111.86
million (2004: UA 103.06 million).

Chapter 007 African Development Fund

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS
OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development Fund (the Fund)
for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the statement of net development resources, statement of
income and expenses and changes in development resources, statement of comprehensive income and the statement
of cash flows and the related notes A to P. These special purpose financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited special purpose financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 26 (v) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26 (v) of the
Agreement Establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of
Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of
Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of management and auditor
These special purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on our audit.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the special purpose financial statements are
free from material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting policies used
and significant estimates and judgments made by the Fund’s management, as well as evaluating the overall special
purpose financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net development
resources of the African Development Fund as at 31 December 2005 and the income and expenses and changes in
development resources, comprehensive income and its cash flows for the year then ended and have been prepared in
accordance with the basis of the accounting policies set out in Note B.

Investments

NTF cash and investments, which are solely
denominated in US Dollars, amounted to
UA 323.7 million at December 31, 2005,
compared to UA 309.1 million in 2004.
Investment income for 2005 amounted to
UA 7.6 million, representing a return of
2.35 percent, on an average liquidity level
of UA 323.1 million.

A recent amendment of the NTF Agreement
has removed the limitation on investments of uncommitted NTF resources to
short-term securities. This has enabled the
adoption of a dual portfolio management
approach for the NTF resources whereby
25 percent of the liquidity is managed
against a rolling average of the 3-month
US$ LIBOR, while the remaining 75 percent of the liquidity is invested as a heldto-maturity (HTM) portfolio maturing on
the statutory sunset date.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December, 31 2005, amounted to UA
248.4 million compared with UA 242.1
million at end of 2004, an increase of 2.6
percent. As at December 31, 2005, there
were 61 active signed loans amounting
to UA 74.4 million. There were 24 fully
repaid loans for a total amount of UA
58.7 million.

Disbursements

Disbursements for 2005 amounted to
UA 3.4 million compared to UA 4.8 million for 2004. As at December 31, 2005,
cumulative disbursements amounted to
UA 183 million. A total of 55 loans were
fully disbursed for a total amount of
UA 176.7 million, representing 96.5
percent of cumulative disbursements.

Financial Results

Net income for the NTF increased from
a restated amount of UA 6.6 million in
2004 to UA 10.7 million in 2005, due to
an increase in investment income and a
write-back of excess provision for loan
losses. Investment income increased from
UA 5.6 million in 2004 to UA 7.6 million
in 2005 due to the change in the investment strategy of the Fund. Administrative
expenses which is made up mainly of
the Funds share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB group increased
by UA 0.6 million, from UA 1.5 million
in 2004 to UA 2.1 million in 2005. The
Fund's reserves net of cumulative currency
translation adjustments increased from
UA 238.3 million in 2004 to UA 280.5
million in 2005.Nigeria Trust Fund

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African
Development Bank (the Bank or ADB) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund is to assist in the development efforts
of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from
the date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the Fund shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However,
the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. Although the terms of the current
agreement would terminate on April 25, 2006, negotiations are at an advanced stage between the Bank and the Nigerian Authorities
for the renewal of the agreement and extension of the life of the Fund. To enable the Fund to continue to operate pending the conclusion of the negotiations, the two parties have agreed, in principle, to a one-year extension of the life of the Fund under the same terms
and conditions as the current agreement.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. In terms of the prior year, accounting policies are consistent in all respects,
except as noted in note C. The significant accounting policies of the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue recognition

nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding
and held by the Fund. The effective interest is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the
inancial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments and the amortization of
remiums and discounts calculated on the effective interest rate basis for the held-to-maturity financial instruments.

Functional and presentation currencies

he Fund conducts its operations in United States Dollars. The Fund has determined that its functional currency is the US dollar. In accordance with Article VII, section 7.3, of the Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust Fund, the financial statements are presented in Units
of Account (UA).

he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the African Development Bank as equivalent
to one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency translation

ncome and expenses are translated to the UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
ranslated from the United States Dollars into the UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included
in reserves under Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the “Statement of Changes in
Equity". Capital replenishments are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses on conversion of currencies into other currencies are included in the determination of net income.

 

Annual Report 2005

233Chapter 007 Nigeria Trust Fund

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Fund's balance sheet when the Fund assumes related contractual rights
or obligations.

1. Financial assets
The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables
and held-to-maturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition.

(i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. The investment trading portfolio is acquired principally for
the purpose of selling in the short term.

(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides
money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management has the positive intention
and ability to hold to maturity.

(iv) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and held-to-maturity are recognized on a trade-date basis, which
is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund has
ransferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Loans receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets
at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the
inancial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

2. Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are reported at amortized cost.

 

Impairment of financial assets
he Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
joss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be
reliably estimated. Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that comes to the
attention of the Fund.

 

 

Annual Report 2005Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 007

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables, or, held-to-maturity investment
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment arises from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

he carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment
joss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Following the adoption of revised IAS 39 on January 1, 2005,
he Fund discontinued placing loans in non-accrual status. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.

Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair value disclosure
he fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For financial assets with inactive markets or
unlisted securities, the Fund establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.
hese include the use of recent arm's length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

 

 

Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued using methodologies and assumptions that
necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in
a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable. Management believes that these methodologies
and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

(i) Cash and cash equivalents
he carrying amount is the fair value.

(ii), Investments
Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available,
air values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

(iii) Loans

he Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
hese financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans.
Fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end variable lending rate in that currency, adjusted
or impairment.

Retained earnings

Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years income and unallocated current year net income.
Unallocated net income consists of current year earnings. Upon recommendation by the Board of Directors, the Board of Governors
approve allocations or distributions of unallocated net income to various specified development causes consistent with the Agreement
establishing the Fund.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity witl
certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect

International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make
he reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the

disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and

are based on historical experience and other factors, inclu
circumstances. The most significant judgments and estima

(i) Impairment losses on loans and advances

ing expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the
es are summarized below:

The Fund reviews its loan portfolios to assess impairment at each financial reporting date. In determining whether an impairment

loss should be recorded in the income statement, the
that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated
fied with an individual loan in that portfolio. This evi
change in the payment status of borrowers in a group,
in the group. Management uses estimates based on h
evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfo
used for estimating both the amount and timing of fu
estimates and actual loss experience.

(ii) Fair values of financial instruments

Fund makes judgments as to whether there is any observable data indicating
uture cash flows from a portfolio of loans before the decrease can be identilence may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse
or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets
istorical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective
io when scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions
ure cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss

 

The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Where

valuation techniques (for example, models) are used t
fied personnel independent of the area that created tl

0 determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualihem. All models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and

comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data, however areas such as credit risk (both own

and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require

management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors

could affect reported fair value of financial instruments.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments
The Fund follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classify’

ing non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and

fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, the Fund evaluates its
intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

Annual Report 2005Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 007

NOTE C- ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

In the current year, the Fund has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting
Standards Board (the IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are relevant
to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on, or after January 1, 2005. The adoption of these new and revised
Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Fund's accounting policies. The following area and amounts have been
affected for the current or prior years:

Incurred loss provisioning (IAS 39)

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Fund placed in non-accrual status all loans to, or guaranteed by a member country, if principal, interest or
other charges with respect to any such loan were overdue by six months or more. Upon the adoption of the revised IAS 39 on January
1, 2005, the Fund no longer placed loans in non-accrual status. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.
The revised standard requires that both principal and charges receivable on loans be assessed for impairment using the incurred loss
model. In accordance with consequential changes to IAS 30, cumulative interest charges that had previously been non-accrued as a result
of the former non-accrual policy, amounting to UA 14.81 million less impairment provision of UA 7.97 million, has been transferred to
reserves on January 1, 2005.

 

The change from expected loss to incurred loss provisioning methodology, under IAS 39 (revised), also requires the restatement of
prior year comparative figures. The provision calculated under the revised methodology was UA 3.45 million as at December 31, 2005
(2004: UA 4.61 million). The provision in the previous financial statements as at December 31, 2004 was UA 16.81 million.

Other

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, a number of Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
Of these, IFRS 7 — “Financial Instrument Disclosures” will impact the Fund, and its effect is currently being assessed.

NOTE D - INVESTMENTS

As part of the overall portfolio management strategy, the Fund invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, and assetbacked securities.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than one year, the Fund may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official
entities. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Investments in money market instru
ments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than one year and a minimum credit rating of A.

In the course of business, the Fund is exposed to the following types of financial risks:

Country Credit Risk

Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 007

Country credit risk includes potential losses arising from a country’s inability or willingness to service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund
manages country credit risk through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall
creditworthiness assessments. These include the assessment of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political
conditions and future growth prospects. Any occurring losses from country credit risk are considered in the determination of the accu
mulated provision for loan losses.

Chapter 007 Nigeria Trust Fund

Market Risks

Market risks comprise currency, interest rate and liquidity risks. Currency risk is mitigated by the Fund's policy of holding all its investments, as well as loans, in US Dollars. In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund's investment management policy ensures that it has
sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations. Interest rate risk on the Fund's loans is minimal as the loans are at a contractually fixed rate. Interest rate risk arising out of the variability in investment interest income is mitigated by holding a core component
of investments, not required for immediate disbursements, in longer duration investments.

NOTE J - RELATED PARTIES

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF on the
basis of the terms of the NTF Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the offices, staff, organisation, services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such facilities, based on an agreed-upon cost
sharing formula. NTF administrative expenses (Note H) comprise primarily such reimbursements made to the Bank during the year.

NOTE K - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 29, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The
financial statements will be approved by the Board of Governors at its annual meeting in May 2006.

Annual Report 2005Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 007

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS
OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK IN RESPECT OF THE NIGERIA TRUST FUND

We have audited the financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund) for the year ended 31 December 2005 which
comprise the balance sheet, the statement of income and expenses, the statement of changes in equity, the statement of cash flows
and the related notes A to K. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for
the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Section 8.2 of the
Agreement Establishing the Fund.

This report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2
of the Agreement Establishing the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body,
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Respective responsibilities of management and auditor
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

Basis of audit opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting policies used and significant estimates and judgments made by the Fund’s management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at
31 December 2005 and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards.

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to Note A to the financial statements, which indicates that the Fund was
established under an agreement signed on 26 February 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development Bank and the
Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date the
Agreement became effective and that the resources of the Fund shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. The terms of the
current agreement would terminate on 25 April 2006. Negotiations are still in progress between the African Development Bank and
the Nigerian Authorities for the renewal of the Agreement and extension of the life of the Fund. To enable the Fund to continue
to operate pending the conclusion of the negotiations, the two parties have agreed in principle to an interim one year extension of
the life of the Fund under the same terms and conditions as the current agreement. These conditions indicate the existence of an
uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Fund’s ability to continue as a going concern.

*Origin of Supply (OOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursenment purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated as evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or
contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for France.

**The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures
have been reported to the Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant
invoices are received and processed.

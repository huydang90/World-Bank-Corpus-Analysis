Comprises
The African Development Bank
The African Development Fund
The Nigeria Trust Fund

The overarching objective of the African Development Bank Group is to spur sustainable economic development and social progress
in its regional member countries (RMCs), thus contributing to poverty reduction. The Bank Group achieves this objective by (i)
mobilizing and allocating resources for investment in RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice and technical assistance to support

development efforts.

The African Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development bank
whose shareholders comprise 53 African
countries (regional member countries—
RMCs) and 24 non-African countries (nonregional member countries—non-RMCs). It
was established in 1964 and officially began
operations in 1967. It is headquartered in
Abidjan, Cate d'Ivoire; however, because of
political instability in Céte d'Ivoire, the ADB
Governors’ Consultative Committee (GCC),
at a meeting in February 2003 in Accra,
Ghana, decided to move the Bank to its current temporary location in Tunis, Tunisia.

The Bank Group's primary objective is to
promote sustainable economic growth
to reduce poverty in Africa. It achieves
this objective by financing a broad range
of development projects and programs
through (i) public sector loans (including
policy-based loans), private sector loans,
and equity investments; (ii) technical assistance for institutional support projects and
programs; (iii) public and private capital
investment; (iv) assistance in coordinating
RMC development policies and plans; and
(v) grants of up to US$ 500,000 in emergency support. The Bank prioritizes national
and multinational projects and programs
that promote regional economic cooperation and integration.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement) des
Annual Report 2007

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 10

ignates the Board of Governors as the
institution's highest policy-making organ,
with one representative from each member
country. The Board of Governors issues
general directives on the Bank's operations and approves amendments to the
Agreement, the admission of new members,
and increases to the Bank's capital. The ADB
Board of Governors elects an 18-member
Board of Directors to which it delegates
its powers, with the exception of those
expressly reserved to it in the Agreement.
Twelve Directors are elected from RMCs and
6 from non-RMCs for a 3-year term, renewable for one term. The Board of Directors
oversees all Bank operations.

The Boards of Governors elect the president of the Bank Group for a 5-year term,
renewable for one term. The president, who
must be from an RMC, chairs the Board of
Directors, appoints vice-presidents—in consultation with the Boards—and manages
the Bank's daily operations.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on nonconcessional terms. In 1997, it introduced 3
new loan products to meet the needs of its
clients: a single-currency variable-rate loan,
a single-currency floating-rate loan, and a
single-currency fixed rate loan. The interest
rate for the single-currency variable-rate
loan is based on the quarter's average cost
of all outstanding Bank borrowings specifically allocated to fund these loans. The interest rate for the floating-rate loan is based

on the 6 month LIBOR in the basket of
currencies offered by the Bank. The rate for
fixed-rate loans is based on the Bank's cost
of borrowing to fund them. The repayment
terms for Bank loans are as follows:

e Repayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years for public sector loans;

e Repayment period of up to 14 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
4 years for publicly guaranteed lines of
credit; and

e Repayment period of 5 to 20 years,
including a grace period of 1 to 3 years
for private sector loans.

The African Development Fund

The ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973 and
became operational in 1974. Its main objective is to reduce poverty in RMCs by providing low-income RMCs with concessional
loans and grants for projects and programs,
and with technical assistance for studies
and capacity-building activities.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Fund (ADF) designates the
Board of Governors as the Fund's highest policy-making organ. The Board of
Governors meets at least once a year. The
ADF Board of Directors includes 6 Executive

11/04/08 13:32:27 | |Directors from non-RMCs—nominated
y their constituencies—and 6 Executive
Directors representing the ADB; it oversees
the general operations of the Fund.

he Fund's resources come from contribuions and periodic replenishments by particiants, usually on a 3-year basis. For ADF-XI
(2008-2010), Deputies agreed to a replenishment of UA 5.76 billion, which represents
a 52 percent increase over the ADF-X level.
The replenishment level includes UA 3.70
illion of donor contributions and UA 2.06
illion of advance commitment capacity.

No interest is charged on ADF loans; however, the loans carry a service charge of 0.75
ercent per annum on outstanding balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50 percent
er annum on undisbursed commitments.
Project loans have a 50-year repayment

 

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 11

period, including a 10-year grace period.
Lines of credit have a 20-year repayment
period with a 5-year grace period. The Fund
also provides grants to RMCs; these do not
carry any interest charges.

The Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF is a special ADB fund created in
1976 by agreement between the Bank
Group and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. Its objective is to assist
the development efforts of low-income
RMCs whose economic and social conditions and prospects require concessional
financing. The NTF became operational
in April 1976 following approval of the
Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust
Fund by the Board of Governors. Its initial
capital of US$ 80.0 million was replenished
in 1981 with US$ 71.0 million.

Under the terms of the Agreement
Establishing the NTF, the operations of the
Fund were envisaged to come to an end 30
years after the Agreement came into force.
Although the Bank and the Nigerian authorities agreed to 2 one-year extensions of the
Agreement from its original expiry date of
April 25, 2006, no new loans or grants have
been approved from the NTF window since
that date. In November 2006 an evaluation of activities of the Fund was commissioned and the exercise was completed in
July 2007. On the basis of the evaluation
exercise, finding and recommendations, and
subsequent to the meetings held between
the Bank and the Nigerian authorities in
November 2007, the latter have agreed
to extend the life of the NTF for a further
10 years. Approvals from this window are
expected to recommence in 2008.

Message From the President of the African Development Bank Group

and the Chairman of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African Development Bank Group

|. am honored to submit this Report which
once again presents a very good year for
the Bank and for Africa. Despite turbulence
in the financial markets and the risks for
the global economy, Africa maintained its
growth path with real GDP increasing by
5.7 percent in 2007. The continent's economies continued to ride on strong demand
for commodities and unprecedented private
investment flows. As expected, growth was
uneven across subregions. However, even
those countries not generously endowed
with natural resources continued to reap the
benefits of economic reforms, debt relief, and
positive neighborhood effects. Nonetheless,
the threat of inflation is returning, fueled
by rising food and energy costs. In addition,
we have to wait and see how the interplay
between the financial sector and the real
economy develops, given the current uncer

tainty in the financial markets, and what this
implies for the global economy and African
countries in particular.

2007 was a solid year for the Bank with
strong operational and financial results. Our
financial position remains quite strong and
income from all windows robust. A credible
performance in private sector operations
has continued to lead the growth of our
portfolio. | am very pleased to also note the
increase, though modest, in disbursements
in 2007. We will intensify our efforts in
2008 to continuously improve the portfolio.
| believe the opening of our field offices will
be instrumental in this endeavor.

We have continued to forge a new operational direction, increasingly more focused
and selective, carving out a set of distinctive
activities and responsibilities in domains
such as water where we can have the
greatest impact. We have strengthened our
alliances with bilateral and multilateral partners, which will permit all of us to become
more complementary and results-focused.

Our institutional repositioning continued to
make good progress in 2007. Numerous key
policy papers were adopted by the Board,
including a new Human Resources Strategy.
The staff recruitment process accelerated
during the year, thereby reducing the gap in
capacity. Furthermore, a first ever staff survey
was conducted, which helped us to identify
areas of strength and weakness in the institution. Business processes were revamped to
improve the quality and speed of response
to our clients. Budget reforms have begun
which will align the Bank's resources with its
strategic priorities and allow more fungibility
in resource management, thereby enabling
greater accountability.

 

Our decentralization exercise has continued with 23 fully functioning offices, while
entative agreement has been reached to
open the remaining two. During my regular
visits, | have seen first-hand the potential of
he field offices to improve dialogue and to
scale up delivery of client services, provided
hey are well customized. The next step is
‘o ensure that, where feasible, there is a
greater delegation of powers, within our
strict fiduciary framework. In 2007, | pursued
my program of visiting as many RMCs as
possible and have personally inaugurated
several of the newly opened field offices.
have found these 12 visits to the field in
2007 extremely valuable.

 

his was the year of ADF Replenishment,
which is always a major event in the life
of the Bank. | want to acknowledge the
remarkable achievement of ADF-XI and to
commend all those who made it possible.
| take the opportunity here to express our
gratitude to the State Participants to ADF,
who demonstrated such a strong confidence
in the Bank and to Africa. With a record
replenishment totaling UA 5.76 billion for
the 2008-2010 cycle, a 52 percent increase
over the ADF-X level, we will be able to fund
our growing projects and programs. | want
to acknowledge here that the decision by
donors to increase resources for multinational operations and for the Fragile States
Facility will go a long way in enabling the
Bank to fulfill its mission in regional integration and in supporting countries emerging
from crisis.

 

Let me in the same spirit commend the
Nigerian Authorities for deciding on a 10year extension for the Nigeria Trust Fund.
We will resume operations from this window
in 2008.

11/04/08 13:32:52 | |Our Board of Directors, my top management, and our staff remain as committed as ever to always aim high for better
results. A Results Measurement Framework
and Project Outputs system has been developed to monitor progress. The Bank has also
introduced in 2007 some Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), which seek to communicate
the Bank's strategic objectives and provide a
basis for continuous performance measurement. | am confident about the year ahead
but | am under no illusion that major challenges remain for the Bank and for Africa.

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 17

Let me take this opportunity to once again
commend the Government of the People's
Republic of China for a most successful
Annual General Assembly in May 2007 in
Shanghai.

Finally, may | express my thanks to our
shareholders and partners for their continued support, to our Board of Directors
and Management for skillfully steering the
Bank throughout the year, and to our staff
for their devotion to duty. | look forward
to a successful year for all our countries

and for the Bank in 2008 and commend
this Report.

Executive Summary

In 2007, the African Development Bank Group continued its efforts to strengthen the development effectiveness of its operations to support its RMCs in their drive to achieve sustainable economic growth, attain the MDGs, and alleviate poverty
across the continent. The year 2007 saw the successful replenishment of the ADF-XI by a record amount of UA 5.76 billion
to finance development in low-income countries. It was agreed by the Deputies that 7.5 percent of the resources available for
allocation would be targeted to a Fragile States Facility. An allocation was also made from ADF-XI to finance multinational
operations. The Bank Group's institutional reforms, decentralization, enhanced selectivity and focus on managing for results
are well on track to unlock the growth potential of its RMCs.

Macroeconomic Context

Across the continent, average economic
growth continued to be buoyant in 2007,
marking the longest period of economic
expansion for two decades. For the last
6 years, the annual real GDP growth rate
has averaged 5.2 percent, while rates of
5.9 and 5.7 percent were recorded for
2006 and 2007 respectively. In total, 25
countries registered growth rates above 5
percent in 2007, 20 attaining 6 percent
or above. During the year only 3 countries
recorded a negative growth rate.

The continent's GDP per capita rose from
US$ 1,161 in 2006 to US$ 1,291 in 2007,
while real GDP per capita growth improved
marginally from 3.5 percent in 2006 to 3.7
percent in 2007. However, Africa’s strong
performance during 2007 still falls short of
the 7-8 percent real GDP growth required
to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), in particular the fundamental goal of halving the number of people
living in extreme poverty by 2015.

Resource Mobilization and the ADF
XI Replenishment

As at end-December 2007, a total of UA 2.71
billion of the available ADF-X resources (95.4
percent) had been committed to programs
and projects, leaving a balance of UA 131.0
million. In anticipation of the possible total
commitment of ADF-X resources, the AfDB
began discussions and consultations with
the ADF Deputies on the modalities for the
Eleventh Replenishment of the ADF. Four

Annual Report 2007

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 18

consultative meetings took place in 2007: the
first was held in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania in
March; the second in Tunis, Tunisia in June; the
third in Bamako, Mali in September; and the
final meeting in London, UK in December.

During these meetings, the Deputies welcomed the progress made to date on
the institutional reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness of ADF and urged
Management and the Board to implement
them more quickly. On operational focus
and effectiveness, they expressed strong
support for increased selectivity in 3 core
areas, namely, infrastructure, governance,
and regional integration.

In terms of the replenishment level, the
Deputies agreed on an amount of UA 5.76

billion for the ADF-XI cycle (2008-2010).
This represents a 52 percent increase over
the ADF-X level. The replenishment level
includes UA 3.70 billion of donor contribution and UA 2.06 billion of advance
commitment capacity. However, the ADFXI resources available for allocation after
netting out contingencies amounts to UA
5.427 billion. From these resources, the
Deputies agreed to allocate (i) 7.5 percent
(UA 407.1 million) to a Fragile States
Facility (FSF) to provide targeted support to
fragile and post-conflict countries, includng debt relief; (ii) 17.5 percent (UA 949.7
million) to multinational operations; and
(iii) the remaining 75 percent (UA 4.07
billion) to the ADF regional member countries, using the revised performance-based
allocation (PBA) formula.

11/04/08 13:32:53 | |Operational Activities

In 2007, Bank Group loan, grant, and other
approvals totaled UA 3.10 billion, compared with UA 2.60 billion in 2006—an
increase of 19.3 percent. Of the total
approvals for 2007, UA 2.58 billion went to
finance operations while UA 515.4 million
was allocated to debt relief, assistance to
post-conflict countries, private sector equity
participation, and special funds. The ADB,
the nonconcessionary window of the Bank,
accounted for UA 1.67 billion (53.9 percent
of total Bank Group approvals), while the
ADF, the concessionary window, accounted
for UA 1.38 billion (44.6 percent of total
approvals), and special funds accounted
for UA 45.8 million (1.5 percent of total
approvals). There was no lending from the
Nigeria Trust Fund in 2007 as the operations of the Fund had reached the end of
the Agreement's tenor.

 

The top 4 sectors to benefit from loan
and grant approvals were: infrastructure;
agriculture and rural development; industry, mining and quarrying; and social. Total
approvals for infrastructure projects rose
sharply from UA 857.7 million in 2006 to
UA 1.93 billion in 2007. Thus, the share
of infrastructure in total loan and grants
increased from 37.2 percent to 74.8 percent over the same period. Amongst the

components of infrastructure, the power
supply subsector received the highest share,
followed by transportation, water supply
and sanitation, and communication.

The dominance of infrastructure operations reflects the Bank's strategy of targeting those sectors that have a significant
impact on economic and social development. Regional integration is another area
of focus for the Bank, as this serves to
increase competitiveness and productivity,
expand trade, and allow for economies of
scale. Multinational operations during the
year amounted to UA 193.3 million, compared to UA 418.0 million in 2006, which
represents a decline of 53.8 percent.

In 2007, Bank Group loan and grant
approvals to all 5 subregions (not including multiregional) amounted to UA 2.39
billion, allocated thus: North Africa, UA
591.9 million; East Africa, UA 576.3 million; Southern Africa, UA 539.6 million;
Central Africa, UA 429.5 million; and West
Africa, UA 251.6 million.

African Development Bank (ADB)

The ADB is an arm of the Bank Group that
provides loans to RMCs on nonconcessional terms. In 2007, approvals from the
ADB window increased to UA 1.67 billion,

which is a 59.8 percent rise from the 2006
evel of UA 1.05 billion. The breakdown of
approvals was: UA 1.48 billion for operaions and UA 185.4 million for private secor equity participation.

he major shift in allocations was to private
sector operations, which more than trebled
rom UA 278.5 million in 2006 to UA 1.00
billion in 2007. Private sector operations
or the year witnessed the largest single
oan approved by the Bank for a power
project in its 40 years of operation. This was
© finance the South Africa Eskom power
supply project (US$ 500 million), to suport the country's large-scale Electrification
Program and address the widespread problem of power outages. Public and publicly
guaranteed project loans also increased
significantly over the year, from UA 245.3
million in 2006 to UA 646.2 million in
2007. In total, 14 countries benefited from
23 ADB loans and grants in 2007, including
private sector operations, and 3 countries
from other approvals.

 

Disbursements on ADB loans increased
from UA 548.4 million in 2006 to UA 884.8
million in 2007, representing an increase
of 61.3 percent. Cumulative disbursements
(including non-sovereign loans) amounted
to UA 16.87 billion. At December 31, 2007,
747 loans were fully disbursed for a total
amount of UA 15.78 billion, representing
93.4 percent of cumulative disbursements.

African Development Fund (ADF)

The ADF is the Bank Group’s concessionary
window for countries that cannot access
funds under the ADB window. In 2007,
ADF total approvals (loans, grants and
other assistance for debt and debt service
reduction) declined by 10.4 percent to UA
1.38 billion, compared with its level of
UA 1.54 billion in 2006. This was prior to
the record replenishment of the Fund for
the ADF-XI cycle agreed by the Deputies
in December 2007. ADF loan and grant
approvals declined from UA 1.37 billion in

2006 to UA 1.10 billion in 2007 and the
major recipient sector for these resources
was infrastructure, which received 67.2
percent of the total, then agriculture at
15.4 percent, social sector at 10.9 percent,
and finally multisector at 6.5 percent.

Project and policy-based loans approved
by the Fund amounted to UA 793.0 million
of all resources committed to operations.
Grants stood at UA 304.6 million in 2007,
compared with UA 484.2 million in 2006,
representing a decline of 37.1 percent.
Other approvals totaling UA 284.2 million
were for debt and debt service reduction.
Fifteen countries benefited from ADF loan
approvals during 2007, while 17 countries
benefited from grant approvals.

 

 

In 2007, the disbursement of loans and
grants on Fund operations amounted to
UA 725.0 million compared with UA 685.2
million in 2006, an increase of 5.8 percent.
Cumulative disbursements as at December
31, 2007 stood at UA 10.68 billion. A total of
1,429 loans and grants were fully disbursed
for an amount of UA 8.64 billion, representing 80.9 percent of cumulative disbursements since the Fund became operational.

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)

The NTF is a special ADB fund created in
1976 by agreement between the Bank
Group and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. Approvals under the
NTF window ceased legally when the
Agreement establishing the Fund reached
the end of its 30-year tenor. Although the
Bank and the Nigerian authorities agreed
to 2 one-year extensions of the Agreement
from its original expiry date of April 25,
2006, no new loans or grants have been
approved from the NTF window since that
date. In November 2006 an evaluation of
activities of the Fund was commissioned
and the exercise was completed in July
2007. On the basis of the evaluation
exercise, findings and recommendations,
and the meetings held between the Bank

Annual Report 2007

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 20

and the Nigerian Authorities in November
2007, the latter have agreed to extend
the life of the NTF for a further 10 years.
Approvals from this window are expected
to recommence in 2008.

Disbursements from the NTF increased by
9.4 percent from UA 5.4 million in 2006
to UA 5.9 million in 2007. Cumulative
disbursements at December 31, 2007
amounted to UA 194.4 million. In sum,
58 loans were fully disbursed for a total
amount of UA 188.8 million, representing
97.1 percent of cumulative disbursements.

Development Effectiveness and
Managing for Results

Within the framework of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, in 2007
the Bank Group deepened its harmonization and alignment activities at the institutional, country, and global levels. An
assessment of outputs and outcomes of
operations exiting the Bank Group’s portfolio shows a significant contribution to
country-level progress in recent years.

The Bank Group has made steady progress
in enhancing its institutional reform program to improve operational effectiveness and service delivery to RMCs. Four
key drivers of change were identified,
namely: human resources (HR), business
processes, the budget, and decentralization. Consequently, in the area of human
resources, a new HR Strategy was approved
by the Boards of Directors which included
a number of important reforms. Also the
Bank undertook in June 2007 its first comprehensive staff survey to highlight areas
of strength and weakness in the institution
and identify areas needing improvement.
The survey drew a 73 percent response
rate. The President met with staff and
managers to discuss the survey findings in
October and November 2007.

Effective operational business processes
have been introduced to improve cli
ent responsiveness and Country Teams
strengthened to act as focal points for Bank
operations. A new Budget Management
Regulatory Framework was introduced to
better align the Budget with strategic priorities and to allow for increased flexibility
in resource management. The decentralization of Bank Group operations also continued apace, leading to an established Bank
presence in 23 RMCs, thereby enhancing
dialogue at the country level, intensifying
supervision and Bank engagement, and
scaling up effectiveness on the ground.

Knowledge Management and
Research

The Bank Group aims to be the continent's
premier development institution, serving as
a repository of knowledge and research on
African development issues. In this endeavor, it seeks to generate knowledge for a
better understanding of the dynamics of
poverty, and for the promotion of sustainable growth and socioeconomic development in its RMCs. Focal knowledge activities include: (i) conducting quality research
on development challenges facing Africa;
(ii) developing an efficient mechanism for
sharing knowledge to enhance the Bank's
operations and programs; (iii) emphasizing
the measurement of results and evaluating
the Bank's effectiveness; and (iv) creating
and leveraging resources to support the
generation and use of knowledge in Bank
policies and programs and in RMCs. The
Bank will also serve as a strong voice for
Africa on development issues both inside
the continent and internationally.

 

During the year, the Bank conducted
research studies and published its standing
publications. It undertook statistical capacity-building activities in RMCs in addition to
skills training in planning, program implementation and monitoring. These training
sessions were attended by about 722
officials from its RMCs. In the context of
knowledge dissemination, under the Bank's
Eminent Speakers’ program, 3 world
11/04/08 13:32:55 | |renowned experts (Professor Paul Collier
of Oxford University, Sir Nicholas Stern
of the London School of Economics, and
His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, Secretary
General of the Francophonie and former
President of Senegal) discussed key development issues for Africa, namely post-conflict recovery, climate change, and regional
integration respectively.

The 2008 Administrative Expenses
and Capital Expenditure Budgets
In December 2007, the ADB Board of

| | 00_Introduction_UK.indd 21

Directors approved an Administrative
Expenses Budget of UA 219.2 million, a
Capital Expenditure Budget of UA 8.5 million, and a contingency budget of UA 2.2
million for 2008. The ADF Board of Directors
approved an indicative Administrative
Budget of UA 158.2 million for the Fund
for the financial year ending December
31, 2008.

Net Income Allocation
The 2007 financial statements of the Bank
Group highlight the robustness of the

Bank's financial position as manifest from
the combined net income before transfers
of UA 375.1 million and an allocable
income of UA 349.2 million. Furthermore,
the AAA ratings of the Bank's senior debt
continue to reflect its sound capital base
and prudent financial management.

11/04/08 13:33:44 | |of the Republic of Rwanda. Dr. Zhou
thanked his fellow Governors for the trust
they had placed in China by agreeing to
hold the AfDB Group Annual Meetings
in Shanghai. He was optimistic that this
would enhance and deepen the existing
cooperation between China and Africa.

His Excellency Wen Jiabao, Premier of the
People’s Republic of China, similarly welcomed all participating Heads of State and
Governors to Shanghai. He emphasized the
commitment of the Government and people of China to peace and development in
Africa. He urged the international community to deliver on their pledged assistance
to the continent, reduce or cancel African
debt, improve trade terms, facilitate market
access for African products, and support
technology transfer and capacity building
for self-development in Africa. The Premier
declared the meeting open and wished
Governors success in their deliberations.

In his opening remarks, Dr. Donald
Kaberuka, President of the Bank Group,
stated that the Bank was greatly honored by the presence of the Premier of
the People’s Republic of China and 3
eminent African Heads of State at the
opening ceremony of its Annual Meetings.
He thanked the Government and people
of China for hosting the Bank Group's
Annual Meetings. President Kaberuka also
acknowledged Messrs. Kwame Fordwor,
Willa Mung'omba, Babacar N'Diaye, and
Omar Kabbaj—his predecessors—who
were present at the meeting. He further
expressed his gratitude to the Government
and people of Tunisia for their support in
enabling the Bank to continue its normal
operations from its Temporary Relocation
Agency (TRA) in Tunis. He also commended the Authorities of the Bank's host
country, Céte d'Ivoire, for their continued
efforts at promoting peace and national
reconciliation under the Ouagadougou
Agreement. Dr. Kaberuka also thanked His
Excellency Dr. Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor

of the People’s Bank of China, for successfully managing the work of the Bureau,
the Joint Steering Committee, and the
Governors’ Consultative Committee.

The President assured Governors that the
Bank was making good progress on all
fronts and that its repositioning to become
more results-focused was on course. With
respect to the Nigeria Trust Fund, the
President informed the Governors that no
commitments had been made from that
window in 2006 and that future operations of the NTF would be founded on a
review being jointly undertaken in 2007 by
the Bank and Nigerian authorities.

Looking ahead to the challenges facing
the continent, the President stated that,
as in Asia, the future of African economies
would be private sector driven and that
the Bank was fully prepared to play a
catalytic role in this respect. Other areas
of increased Bank focus would include
infrastructure development, regional integration, governance, addressing climate
change, and support to fragile states and
middle-income countries (MICs). On Bank
Group operations, President Kaberuka
ated that the Bank Group had increased
its financing activities by 13.1 percent in
2006, including the Bank's largest single
operation of US$ 500 million to support

Egypt's financial sector reform. With regard
to ADF operations, the President stated
that nearly 70 percent of the resources
made available under the ADF-X replenishment had been committed. With respect to
the decentralization of Bank Group activities, 22 out of the planned 25 field offices
had been opened in 2006.

President Kaberuka noted that the outlook
for African economies was good, and that
several countries could replicate Asia's
experience by taking the following actions:
(i) building on the emerging dynamics of
peace and stability as a necessary precondition for investment; (ii) maintaining the
pace of reform and safeguarding against
policy or governance slippages; and (iii)
enhancing institution building. While recognizing that the continent's economic
outlook over the next decade would primaily depend on African nations themselves,
the President felt that the international
community could assist by reversing the
decline in core aid levels observed in
2006 and by bolstering trade negotiations
to facilitate access of African products
to developed country markets. The Bank
Group, for its part, would take advantage
of the ongoing ADF-XI negotiations with
its partners to reposition the institution as
a preferred conduit for resource mobilization in response to the continent's pressing

to Seychelles, Mauritius and Comoros, took
place in February, while the second tour, in
March 2007, took Executive Directors to
Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Study
tours provide Executive Directors with the
opportunity to (i) learn first-hand about
RMCs' development needs and _priorities; and (ii) consolidate the Bank’s policy
dialogue with RMC officials, donors,
private sector actors, and civil society
organizations.

Chapter 002 Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms

During 2007, the Bank Group continued to pursue its institutional reforms aimed at maximizing its development effectiveness and the quality of its operations, supporting the efforts of its RMCs and building their capacity to strengthen their economies. The Bank also consolidated its role as the apex development institution for the continent, a repository of knowledge
and research, and the preeminent voice for African development issues. This chapter reviews the contribution of the Bank's
organizational units to meet these objectives.

INSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS

In 2007, significant achievements were
made in the implementation of the institutional reforms aimed at reinforcing the
Bank's operational effectiveness and results
agenda, and improving service delivery and
quality to RMCs. Four priority areas were
identified as key drivers of change namely:
human resources (HR), business processes,
the budget, and decentralization.

e Human Resources: A new HR Strategy
was approved by the Board of Directors
which included new mechanisms for more
rigorous HR management and more accurate need analysis; improved staff recruitment to attract and retain top candidates;
managing staff for results; and a more
objective staff performance system. Key
achievements in 2007 included the implementation of an enhanced recruitment
campaign for non-managerial professional
staff, improved conditions of service for
staff in country offices (including pension
provision), and completion of a comprehensive staff survey (see Box 2.1).

¢ Business Processes: More effective operational business processes have been introduced to improve client responsiveness.
A streamlined review and approval process was adopted and Country Teams were
strengthened to act as focal points in the
design, review, and coordination of the
Bank's operations. Delegation of appropriate and specific authority in operational
decision-making is being developed to

Annual Report 2007

| | 02_Chapter2_UK.indd 10

achieve greater empowerment of staff with
robust fiduciary safeguards and accountability. This is critical for faster delivery of
higher-quality services to clients.

Budget Reforms: The 2008 budget is the
first following Board approval, in June
2007, of proposed reforms. The reforms
aim at: (i) ensuring strict alignment
between resource allocation and institutional priorities, (ii) introducing flexibility in
the management of the budget; (iii) establishing a new accountability and performance framework which links work program
deliverables to Key Performance Indicators
(KPIs) (see Box 2.2). The new framework
is intended to provide the Bank with a
mechanism to foster efficiency in the use
of the scarce budgetary resources.

 

Decentralization: The decentralization of
Bank Group operations registered significant progress during the year with an
established Bank presence in 23 RMCs.
This has increased the Bank's visibility and
improved interaction and sustained dialogue with national authorities and other
development partners. A new countryspecific Customized Staffing Matrix was
introduced to better address country needs
and portfolio supervision and management.

 

High-Level Panel on the Bank’s
Strategic Orientation

The AfDB's High-Level Panel (HLP) was
established by President Donald Kaberuka
in 2006 as an independent advisory body
on the Bank's strategic vision and the

operational strategies needed to achieve
it. The HLP was led by co-chairs Joachim
Chissano, former President of Mozambique,
and Paul Martin, the former Prime Minister
of Canada. The draft report was presented
at the Bank's Annual Meetings in Shanghai,
China, in May 2007. The final report is
now available and can be accessed via
the Bank's website (http://www.afdb.org).
The competent authorities of the Bank
will review the final report in due course,
including Management's response to the
recommendations made.

COMPLIANCE REVIEW
AND MEDIATION

The primary function of the Independent
Review Mechanism (IRM) is that of mediation and compliance review. Compliance
review seeks to investigate whether or not
there is just causation between the alleged
non-compliance with the Bank Group's
policies and procedures and the reported
harm/damage incurred. Mediation aims
to restore an effective dialogue among
requesters, the Bank, and any other interested party, and to reach an acceptable
solution for all concerned.

In May 2007, the Bank received a request
from a number of Ugandan NGOs and
individuals for a compliance review of
the Bujagali Hydroelectric Power and
Interconnection Projects. The review is currently under preparation and the Review
Panel’s report will be presented to the
Boards of Directors during the first half of
2008. In addition, the Bank developed and

11/04/08 13:34:37 | |updated the IRM website and published
the IRM brochures in 4 languages (English,
French, Portuguese, and Arabic). Seminars
were organized in 2007 to update Bank
staff and civil society organizations in
regional member countries on the IRM’s
mandate and procedures.

KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT AND
RESEARCH

The Bank Group aims to be the continent's
premier development institution, serving as
a repository of knowledge and research on
leading African development issues. In this
endeavor, it aims to generate knowledge
for a better understanding of the dynamics
of poverty, and for the promotion of sustainable growth and socioeconomic development in its RMCs. This will enhance the
development effectiveness of the Bank's
operations on the continent. Focal knowledge activities include:

© Conducting quality research on developmental challenges facing Africa;

Developing an efficient mechanism for
sharing and using knowledge to enhance
the Bank's operations and programs;

Emphasizing the measurement of results
in the Bank's operations and maintaining
relevant databases to monitor and evaluate the Bank's effectiveness; and

Creating and leveraging resources to support the generation, dissemination, and
use of knowledge in Bank policies and
programs and RMCs.

The Bank will also create a strong voice for
Africa on development challenges and act
as an advocate on those issues both within
the continent and internationally.

Development Research
Research activities during 2007 focused

| | 02_Chapter2_UK.indd 11

|_ a | | |

Corporate Management and Institutional Reforms Chapter 002

on themes that are relevant to the Bank's
development operations and effectiveness
in RMCs. During the year, the Bank completed a number of research studies: “Debt
Relief and Service Delivery in Africa," which
looked at those countries benefiting from
the HIPC and Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI); “A Simulation of the
Impact of Oil Prices on African Economies,"
and “The Analysis of the Oil and Gas
Situation in Africa,” which was conducted
in collaboration with the African Union
(AU). The Bank also reviewed the formula for the Performance Based Allocation
(PBA) and, in collaboration with the World
Bank and DFID, undertook a study on
“Remittances and Migration.”

In 2007, the Bank continued to produce
and disseminate its flagship publications,
including The African Economic Outlook
(AEO) 2006/2007, produced jointly with
the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD); The African
Development Report 2007, which focused
on sustainable management of Africa's natural resources; The Africa Competitiveness
Report (ACR) 2007, a biennial publication produced jointly with the World
Bank and the World Economic Forum; 3
issues of The African Development Review
(ADRv) 2007, and The Economic Research
Working Paper Series (ERWP). In addition, in partnership with the UN Economic
Commission for Africa (UNECA), the Bank
organized the second African Economic
Conference (AEC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
in November 2007, which was attended
by 556 participants from Africa and overseas. Furthermore, a high-level side event
was organized at the EU-Africa Summit
in Portugal to disseminate key messages
emerging from the AEO and ADR 2007.

Capacity Building and Training
Activities in RMCs

The Bank Group supports capacity building—both within the institution and in
RMCs—through training, strengthening

national institutions, and knowledge dissemination. In 2007, the Bank Group's
African Development Institute (ADI) and
the Joint Africa Institute (Al) held complementary workshops, seminars, and symposia aimed at improving capacity in program
planning, implementation and monitoring.
These were attended by 722 officials from
RMCs. In addition, 5 seminars were organized on generating a deeper understanding
of the issues around the PerformanceBased Allocation (PBA) formula, and the
determination of the loans/grants proporion of the allocations using the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) framework.

Furthermore, in 2007, 3 renowned experts
were invited under the Eminent Speakers’
Program to share their knowledge and
experience on challenging development
issues facing Africa. In July 2007, Professor
Paul Collier of Oxford University gave a
‘alk on postconflict recovery; also in July,
Sir Nicholas Stern of the London School
of Economics addressed the problem of
climate change; finally, in September 2007,
His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf examined the role of regional integration. In
cooperation with other institutions, the
Bank Group also organized development
management seminars and conferences,
such as the joint AfDB/ECA roundtable
discussion on “Africa and Asia: Partners in
Development.”

Statistical Services

he Bank Group's statistical work focuses
on strengthening statistical capacity within
he Bank and in RMCs, particularly in areas
such as national accounts, databases for
monitoring MDGs, and dissemination of
statistical data. The Data Platform (DP) was
aunched in December 2007, to provide
staff and external users with easy online
access to a wide range of development
data on RMCs. A further development
was the Statistical Framework for Effective
Implementation of the Results Agenda,
which integrates statistical data-genera
 

Annual Report 2007

tion activities into the Bank's country programming (Results-Based Country Strategy
Papers), project cycle and policy-based
lending, and institutional support activities.
In 2007, the Bank also initiated a system
to improve the collection and management
of infrastructure statistics.

A number of statistical publications were
produced by the Bank in 2007: Selected
Statistics on African Countries; Gender,
Poverty and Environmental Indicators
for African Countries; Compendium of
Statistics on Bank Group Operations; ADB
Statistics Pocketbook; The Wall Chart on
MDGs; and the African Statistical Journal.
During 2007, the Bank was also involved in
the Reference Regional Strategic Framework
for Statistical Capacity Building in Africa
(RRSF) activities, which lends guidance on
statistical development in Africa.

HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT

In 2007, the Bank reviewed its Human
Resources Management instruments, which
are geared to improving accountability, performance, rewards, and recognition. In this
context, a new Human Resources Strategy
(2007-2011) was adopted by the Bank in
May 2007. During the year, the recruitment
and transitioning of 73 new directors and
managers (24 external and 49 internal) took
place, which resulted in a 50 percent renewal of the Management team. In addition, by
the end of the year, 149 employment offers,
including 40 Young Professionals, had been
accepted. This scaling-up of the recruitment
process has reduced vacancy levels for
professional staff from over 20 percent to
below 5 percent. Specialists were recruited
in sectors identified as strategic priorities,
in line with the Bank’s positioning as a
results-based, knowledge institution. Table
2.1 below shows the budgeted posts for
2007 and actual staff at post at year-end.
The staff at post excludes persons offered
positions but who were yet to assume duty.

Annual Report 2007

| | 02_Chapter2_UK.indd 12

The Bank also took steps to support its
decentralization process: 125 new staff were
recruited for the 23 field offices that had
become operational by 2007. This increased
the number of field office staff from 171 to
296 by year-end 2007. A new performance
management system geared toward output-based evaluation has been developed
and will become effective in January 2008.
Within this framework, the Bank implemented its first staff survey in June 2007,
which drew a 73 percent response rate (see
Box 2.1). The President met with staff and

 

managers to discuss the survey findings in
October and November 2007.

Additional measures taken to improve
working conditions include flexible working hours, enhancements to the selection process, and the implementation of a
dual career path and promotions system.
To support internal equity, 67 short-term
employees who have served the Bank on
successive contracts for extended periods
of time, have seen their status converted
into regular positions.

11/04/08 13:34:38 | |In 2007, the Bank conducted for the first time since
its establishment a comprehensive survey to give
staff an opportunity to feed back to Management
their views on the institution's major strengths and
weaknesses. The survey reflects the Bank's continued focus on good governance, transparency, and
dialogue, both at operational and corporate levels.
In this respect, it represents an important step
toward a more open and accountable institution.

All staff were invited to participate, both General
Staff (GS) and professional level (PL), at the TRA,
HQ, and field offices. In total, 909 staff took part
in the survey, representing a 73.0 percent response
fate. The results were disseminated to the Boards
and to all Bank staff during meetings chaired by
the President in October/November 2007. The findings were also posted on the intranet.

The survey revealed that staff perceived the Bank's
main strengths to be its ability to attract staff; the
pride and commitment of its workforce; and the
institutional improvements in progress. The key
areas requiring improvement were identified as:

Professionalism and specialization of Bank staff;

© The institutional environment; downward communication; openness and trust; listening and
respect;

ADMINISTRATIVE
SERVICES

The institutional reorganization of the Bank
resulted in a need for optimal usage of
office space, while improving and building
a conducive working environment. In 2007,
initiatives were also introduced to improve
client service and increase efficiency gains.
One key innovation was the introduction of
the Purchasing Card (P-Card), which aims
to decentralize and facilitate the procurement of small value items.

As result of such initiatives, significant savings have been realized in the area of institutional procurement, which totaled UA 2.0
million in 2007. Furthermore, staff operating
costs as a percentage of the total volume of

The findings of the survey will be integrated
into Bank-wide processes and reforms. Several
instruments to address perceived weaknesses are
already being developed, such as the new Staff
Performance Management and Evaluation System;
the new Compensation and Benefits Framework;
Career Development and Promotion policies; and a
new Delegation of Authority Matrix. Furthermore,
all the Complexes have been requested to develop
their own action plans and these will be reviewed
for implementation in 2008.

It is envisaged that follow-up surveys will take
place using the 2007 Staff Survey as a comparator for monitoring progress. Specific priority areas
will be revisited on an annual basis while further
comprehensive staff surveys will be repeated at
2-3 year intervals.

procurement activities decreased from 3.5
percent in 2005 to 2.1 percent in 2007. In
addition, the Bank launched the “Lodged
Card" in the second quarter of 2007 to
improve its travel services. In the framework
of the Bank's decentralization program,
the Sudan office was opened during the
last quarter of 2007, with all the necessary
administrative and logistical support provided for its effective operation.

INFORMATION AND
COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT

The Bank Group took action in 2007 to consolidate and maintain its ICT infrastructure. The
main achievements included the following:

¢ Support to Field Offices: The 23 operational field offices have been provided
with the requisite ICT equipment and infrastructure to make them fully operational.
Disbursement applications are scanned in
field offices and sent by email to the TRA
for further processing and archiving. All
staff in field offices have been trained on
project and loan administration.

© Corporate Data Warehouse: The reporting and analytic requirements of financial
accounting were successfully implemented
during the year. A management reporting facility was developed which will be
made available for the entire Operations
complex in 2008. The Bank also finalized
the “Client Connection” facility, which
will give RMCs online access to their loan
portfolios and other related information,
including procurement data. The system
has been tested in Tunisia and will be made
available to all RMCs in the second quarter
of 2008.

Training in IT: During the year, 36 SAP training sessions were organized and attended
by 222 staff members. In addition, training
sessions on the usage of SAP were held for
all field office staff and the SAP Employee
Self Service has been generalized for use in
the Bank.

Business Continuity Planning

The Bank appointed a Business Continuity
Coordinator in late 2007 to review and
redesign its current Business Continuity
Plan and test it regularly to ensure that
it meets current Bank needs and best
standards. In this context, in 2008 there
will be a reassessment of risks, identifying risk avoidance measures and risk
mitigation strategies, developing new governance structures for business continuity, and establishing new policies and
procedures for maintaining the Business
Continuity Plan and the Bank's disaster
recovery arrangements. The implementation of a renewed comprehensive Business

Box 2.2: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Continuity Strategy will have an impact on
human resources, the information systems
and communication network, facilities, and
the evolving business model of the Bank
going forward.

EVALUATION OF
OPERATIONS

Evaluation has a twofold function: (i)
to provide a systematic assessment of
the institution's performance in attaining development results, and (ii) to
identify factors that support or constrain
successful operations. Evaluation covers lending and nonlending activities
(including advisory services and technical assistance), as well as development
partnerships and aid coordination.

In 2007, the Bank produced a selective range of evaluation studies, from
project performance evaluations to
country assistance evaluations (Ethiopia
and Cameroon). Studies were conducted
during the year on the Nigeria Trust Fund
and Joint Africa Institute. In addition,
some 100 Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) were reviewed and 2 synthesis
studies prepared. The Bank also undertook evaluations of the Bank’s approach
to development processes, including the
harmonization of development assistance with other donor organizations. The
Bank has developed Key Performance
Indicators or KPls (see Box 2.2), which
will provide a better measure of its efficiency and effectiveness.

 

The Bank Group will make the evaluation of its operational activities an
increasingly significant and measurable
contribution to its effectiveness and
accountability. To this end, there will
be a continued shift from project-level
evaluation activities toward high-level
evaluation of policies, strategies, and
processes at sector, country, and corporate levels.

Annual Report 2007

| | 02_Chapter2_UK.indd 14

The Bank Group established in 2007 a performance-tracking system based on a set of key performance indicators (KPIs). The system helps to
communicate the Bank's vision, maintain managerial and organizational focus on strategic objectives,
and provide a basis for performance measurement,
thus enhancing accountability both internally and
to shareholders.

The system is founded on a limited number of
strategic areas of focus (or “ perspectives”) synthesizing results, performance, and risks/reputation.
Each perspective is underpinned by a few specific
indicators, or KPls, which are tracked on a quarterly
basis. The areas of focus are informed by targets
established for each complex and which are owned
by the VP/Head concerned. KPIs can be divided
into 2 categories: (i) operational performance and
development effectiveness and (ii) institutional or
corporate effectiveness.

1. Development Effectiveness: KPIs have
been developed for key areas of operational
focus, for example:

Infrastructure: Level of access to water supply,
electricity, and road infrastructure. For ICT:
the number of people with access to mobile
telephones, landlines, and the Internet.

INTERNAL AUDIT, ANTICORRUPTION, AND
FRAUD INVESTIGATION

Internal Audit offers independent and
objective assurance, advisory, and consulting services for Bank Group operations,
finance, and corporate administrative activities. In 2007, the Bank Group conducted
10 audits in the Operations Complex, 11
in Finance and Corporate Complexes, and
audits of 15 Trust and Grant Funds. It also
provided opinions on over 200 project audit
reports. Furthermore, Audit staff participated as resource persons in 4 project financial
management workshops in RMCs.

of key areas, such as: (i) project and program
design; (ii) supervision; (iii) the ability to learn
and feed back into the implementation and

decentralization; and (v) harmonization with
development partners.

The KPls will be adapted and improved with
experience, as their utility is tested in the overall
drive to enhance accountability and transparency
in Bank Group operations.

operational in 2006, continued to undertake unhindered investigations into allegations of corruption, fraud, or other misconduct against Bank personnel and third
parties who engage in business with the
Bank Group. In January 2007, the Bank
approved a comprehensive Whistle-blowing and Complaints Handling Policy to support this function. This provides an avenue
for raising concerns related to fraud, corruption, and other misconduct and assures
that persons who disclose such information are protected from retaliation. The
Bank Group received 27 complaints (18
in 2006), of which 12 were referred or
considered frivolous (4 in 2006). The cases
that entered preliminary inquiry and subsequent investigation are summarized in
Table 2.2 below.

PROCUREMENT AND
PROJECT FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT

During 2007, the Bank Group undertook
a review of the existing procurement and
project financial management processes in
the institution. The ensuing report identified bottlenecks and proposed remedial
actions to strengthen the Bank's development effectiveness. In 2007, a number
of procurement documents were revised
including: procurement policy rules; the
development of guidelines, guidance
notes, manuals, and related Presidential
Instructions.

A capacity-building exercise was launched
in 2007 with the ultimate aim of accrediting staff both in the TRA and in the field
offices as part of the drive to improve
procurement service delivery. The Bank
Group also launched e-enabled procurement processes to reduce transaction costs
and ensure timely delivery. Furthermore,
assistance was provided to the Operations
Complex in the review of procurement
documents throughout the project cycle.

In total, 14 national project implementation workshops and seminars were jointly
organized by the Bank Group and the
African Development Institute during the

| | 02_Chapter2_UK.indd 15

year. In addition, 6 business opportunities seminars for government officials and
private sector representatives of RMCs provided fora for dialogue and familiarization
with Bank operations and processes. The
harmonization of procurement policies and
procedures with partner institutions has
been another active area of Bank engagement. During 2007, the Bank continued to
cooperate closely with the World Bank in
the preparation of Country Procurement
Assessment Reports (CPARs).

CORPORATE
COMMUNICATIONS

In 2007, the Bank Group developed a
significant range of outreach products
and services, and strengthened its corporate communications system. This system
comprises: a state-of-the-art multimedia
center, a graphics design unit, a web-content management program, staff media
training modules, an improved Public
Information Center, a contacts database,
and a calendar of corporate events.

Improvements in the Bank's internal communications during the year included better coverage of Bank events (such as
the Shanghai Meetings); in-house videostreaming of events; coordinated outreach
strategies with key players; enhancements

to the internal daily newsletter, Bank in
Action; and the strengthening of internal service lines (web, publications, graphic
design, etc.). The design of a closed-circuit
television system for the Bank was prepared
during the year and an initial implementation budget was approved by the Board.
Comprehensive print, audio, and video communication packages were also produced
in 2007 on selected projects, in addition
to a number of brochures, manuals, and
guidebooks. The development of a Field
Office Communications Guide will assist in
the preparation of a local Communications
Strategy for field offices. Furthermore, in
Zambia and Mozambique, a Development
Information Center was jointly created with
the respective governments, World Bank,
UNESCO, and other donors.

GENERAL COUNSEL AND
LEGAL SERVICES

During 2007, the Bank's legal function
continued to provide flexible, innovative,
and effective services to advance the Bank's
development mandate. In this connection,
legal services and advice were provided
for: (i) ADF-XI replenishment negotiations;
(ii) implementation of the 2007 borrowing program, which included the Bank's
first domestic South African Rand bond
issue; (iii) resource mobilization, investment
and liability management transactions;
(iv) new agreements for the establishment of bilateral and multi-donor trust
funds, contributions to existing trust funds,
and grants utilizing trust fund resources;
(v) budget process reforms, including drafting the enabling amendments to the Bank's
Financial Regulations; (vi) strengthening
the Bank's recourse mechanisms for staff
grievances; (vii) designing a new staff performance evaluation system and proposed
changes in compensation and benefits policies; (viii) finalization of 2 landmark postconflict country facility arrears clearance programs; and (ix) preparations for the Whistle

This chapter reviews the operational priorities and principles which guided the Bank's activities during 2007. The new
selectivity in Bank operations was demonstrated by a shift to high-impact areas such as infrastructure, private sector development, and regional integration, which saw record levels of approvals. These areas are analyzed below, together with
other sectors of continuing Bank intervention such as agriculture and rural development and social development. Other new
focal priorities, such as middle-income countries (MICs) and fragile states, are also discussed. Finally, the Bank's resource

INTRODUCTION

Guided by its overarching mission of poverty reduction through sustainable economic
growth, the Bank Group focused its activities throughout 2007 on 4 core operational priority areas, namely, infrastructure,
governance, private sector development,
and regional integration. These activities
support progress in complementary areas
such as agriculture and rural development, social and human development, and
the mainstreaming of crosscutting issues,
particularly gender, environmental sustainability, and climate change.

During the year the Bank Group continued
to pursue ongoing and new strategic initiatives, such as Harmonization, Alignment,
and Managing for Results (HA & MfR),
the Water Initiatives, NEPAD, the African
Fertilizer Financing Mechanism (AFFM), the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative
(HIPC), the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), and arrears clearance
using the Post-Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF). Furthermore, the Bank Group continued to implement its internal reforms to
enhance its development effectiveness on
the ground.

 

 

In the context of institutional policy reform,
work is at an advanced stage on various documents, including the following:
(i) “Eligible Expenditures for Bank Group
Financing"; (ii) “Revision of the Bank's
Environmental and Social Assessment

Annual Report 2007

Procedures”; (iii) “Format of Midterm
Progress and Completion Reports on
Results-based CSP"; (iv) “Fragile States”;
(v) “Middle Income Countries”; (vi)
“Regional Operations”; (vii) “The FreeRider Problem,” and (viii) “Enhancing the
Use of Country Systems.”

he Bank Group also contributed to the
development of the African Community
Practice in Managing for Results, and to
he publication of the Global Monitoring
Report and the Common Performance
Assessment System (COMPAS) Report.

 

INVESTING IN
INFRASTRUCTURE

Infrastructure (power supply, water and
sanitation, transportation, and communication) is critical for economic growth,
private sector development and investment, increased competitiveness and productivity, improved access to basic services,
and employment creation. The provision
of infrastructure also acts as a catalyst for
the development of other sectors and the
achievement of key MDGs by improving
access to markets, schools and hospitals.
It is therefore one of the principal areas of
intervention by the Bank Group.

Approvals for infrastructure projects in
2007 reached a record level of UA 1.93
billion, accounting for 74.8 percent of
the total Bank Group loan and grant
approvals for the year, and representing

of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

an increase of about 125 percent from
he 2006 level of UA 857.7 million. The
breakdown of infrastructure approvals
shows that 48.2 percent was allocated
(© power supply projects; 39.2 percent to
ransportation; 11.0 percent to water and
sanitation; and 1.7 percent to informaion communication and technology (ICT)
projects (see Figure 4.2).

he approved projects include national transportation projects in Botswana, Egypt, Gabon,
Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Tanzania, and
Uganda; a multinational Cameroon-RCA-—
Chad transportation facilitation program;
electricity projects in Burundi, Cape Verde,
DRC, Egypt, Ghana, Madagascar, Morocco,
anzania, Uganda, and South Africa; a mulinational Ghana—Togo—Benin power interconnection project; and water supply and
sanitation projects in Angola, Burkina Faso,
Djibouti, DRC, Kenya, Mauritius, Niger, and
Nigeria. The profiles of these and all other
projects approved in 2007 are presented at
he end of Chapter 4.

 

The Water Initiatives

Water resources development and management continues to be one of the Bank’s
core areas of intervention through its key
water sector initiatives—the Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI),
the African Water Facility (AWF), and the
Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program
(MDWPP). Progress during the year on
each of these 3 initiatives is outlined
below.

11/04/08 13:35:15 | |Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
Initiative (RWSSI): The main objective
of the RWSSI is to extend safe water
and basic sanitation coverage to 80
percent of African rural dwellers by
2015, at an estimated overall cost
of US$ 14.2 billion. The Bank's commitment to this initiative has led to
a significant increase in its financial
support, from approximately US$ 70.0
million in 2002 to over US$ 330.0
million in 2007. During 2007, 4 operations totaling US$ 222.2 million were
approved for Burkina Faso, Kenya,
Niger, and Nigeria, which will provide
5.9 million people with safe water and
6.2 million people with sanitation by
the end of 2010. Total financing for
rural water and sanitation since 2003
stands at US$ 1.80 billion—the Bank
has contributed US$ 753.1 million from
ADF resources and leveraged US$ 1.01
billion from other donors and RMCs. In
addition, in order to meet the growing
needs of urban centers, 5 urban water
supply and sanitation projects were
approved in 2007 for Angola, Djibouti,
DRC, Kenya, and Mauritius, amounting
to US$ 217.3 million.

| | 03_Chapter3_UK.indd 19

The African Water Facility (AWF): The
operational focus of the AWF is to mobilize additional funding for Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM)
at the national and transboundary levels as well as for project/program preparation. Since the AWF began its core
activities in January 2006, the level
of pledged donor funds has reached
€ 67.1 million (UA 62.5 million), with
€ 23.5 million (UA 21.9 million) already
paid (as at end November 2007).
During the same period, a total of 29
operational activities were approved
at a cost of € 24.1 million (UA 22.5
million). In 2007, AWF supported
projects and programs in Botswana,
Central African Republic, Chad,
Republic of Congo, Egypt, Mauritania,
Mozambique, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania,
Uganda, and the IGAD region.

The Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program (MDWPP): This program
was created with the support of
the Dutch, Canadian, and Danish
Governments for the promotion of
IWRM practices in the RMCs. To date,
the program has received € 5.4 mil

lion (UA 5.0 million) and has disbursed approximately € 3.0 million
(UA 2.8 million). MDWPP has also
financed 22 activities including several
studies, the preparation of guidelines
and strategy papers, a Handbook on
Water Harvesting, and a strategy paper
on “Scaling-up Agricultural Water
Development in Africa.”

SUPPORTING ECONOMIC
AND GOVERNANCE
REFORMS

Good governance is crucial for long-term
economic growth and its promotion is a
key element in the Bank Group's strategy
to alleviate poverty in RMCs. To mainstream this focus into its operations in
a more systematic way, the Bank Group
created a Governance, Economic and
Financial Reforms Department in its 2006
institutional reforms.

During 2007, the Bank Group continued
to support RMCs' efforts to improve their
systems of governance by helping them
to strengthen their institutional capacities
and design and implement policy reforms

Box 3.1: The Gambia—Institutional Support for Economic and

Financial Governance

 

Background: In November 2007, the Bank Group approved a UA 1.4 million grant to finance the
Institutional Support for Economic and Financial Governance Project in The Gambia. The project is cofinanced by the Government of Gambia for the amount of UA 0.07 million.

Objectives: The project is designed to respond to major institutional capacity problems in The Gambia
and to assist the Government to attain its strategic medium-term development objectives. The aim is to
build the capacity of institutions involved in economic and financial management both in the executive
branch of government (Ministry of Finance) and beyond, in particular the Gambian National Audit Office.
It will provide targeted training, technical assistance, and information technology equipment to improve
economic management, public budgeting, and financial accountability.

Expected impact and outputs:

(i) Improved debt and macroeconomic management, particularly in the areas of financial planning and
budgeting;

(ii) Enhanced national capabilities in auditing;

(iii), Improved access to the Integrated Financial Management System.

(see Box 3.1). Five policy-based and budget
support programs and 4 institutional support projects were approved in 2007 for a
total cost of UA 102.1 million. The programs
were for the Central African Republic, Kenya,
Malawi, Mauritius, and Rwanda; while
the institutional support projects were for
Angola, Gambia, Kenya and Madagascar.

Nonlending activities also form an integral
part of the Bank Group's efforts to foster
good governance in RMCs. The preparation
of Country Governance Profiles (CGPs)
constitutes one such instrument. In 2007, 3
new CGPs (Botswana, Egypt, and Gambia)
were completed and 4 others were under
preparation. A moratorium was put on CGPs
during the year in order to review the Bank's
approach to country governance assessments.
The aim is to achieve better alignment
with country-own systems and to enhance
coordination with development partners.

he Bank continued to provide support
0 the African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM) through technical and financial
assistance. Two new country assessments
or Benin and Algeria were conducted in
2007 with the technical support and effecive participation of the AfDB. During the
year, the Bank Group further supported the
implementation of the Extractive Industries
ransparency Initiative (EITI) in 5 countries
(Botswana, Central African Republic, Chad,
Liberia, and Madagascar). It plans to scale
up its involvement in this subsector to promote efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the management of El resources,
articularly in fragile states.

Also during the year, a “Bank Group Strategy
or the Prevention of Money Laundering and
errorism Financing in Africa” was drawn
up. This strategy will guide the Bank's
engagement in key selected areas, including

 

Box 3.2: The Making Finance Work for Africa (MFW4A) Partnership

 

Background: The Making Finance Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4A) was officially launched
in October 2007. It is a joint initiative of development partners, including the Bank Group, to
support the efforts of RMCs to develop their financial sectors and so accelerate economic growth
and reduce poverty. The Partnership acknowledges that the financial sector is a key driver of
private investments, employment generation, and economic growth. From 2008 the Partnership's

Secretariat will be hosted by the Bank.

 

facilitating the formulation and implementation by RMCs of laws and regulations to
combat money laundering.

In 2007, initiatives were undertaken by the
Bank Group to enhance its partnership and
cooperation with development partners.
Joint activities and programs were
implemented, including the Making Finance
Work for Africa Partnership (MFW4), a
new initiative launched in October 2007 to
support the efforts of RMCs to accelerate
economic growth and reduce poverty
hrough financial sector reforms (see Box
3.2). The Bank Group also participated
actively in donor harmonization efforts in
governance diagnostic work, notably under
he auspices of the OECD DAC as well as in
he Special Partnership with Africa (SPA), a
joint initiative of African governments and
development partners dedicated to making
aid more effective in reducing poverty.

During the year, new “Governance Strategic
Directions for 2008-2010" were formulated to sharpen the focus and enhance
he selectivity of the Bank Group's governance operations. Operationally, the Bank
Group's new approach in governance will
‘ocus on strengthening transparency and
accountability in the management of pubic resources. The Bank Group will also
support RMCs' efforts to improve the environment for private sector activity.

 

 

Objectives: The MFW4A initiative aims to scale up resources and knowledge for the development
of the financial sector and enhance its contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in
Africa. The Partnership is intended to: (i) increase awareness of the importance of the financial
sector and support RMCs’ efforts to develop the sector; (ii) create momentum for increased donor
support for the sector; (iii) make donors’ support more effective and efficient by fostering greater
cooperation, coordination, and harmonization among development partners.

PROMOTING REGIONAL
INTEGRATION

Most RMC economies are small, undiversified, and face physical, political, and
policy-induced constraints to deeper economic integration with their neighbors and
the global economy. However, economic
cooperation and regional integration are
crucial if Africa is to overcome trade and
other barriers and take its rightful place in
the global market.

For more than 40 years, the Bank has

Expected outcomes:

© Increased support for financial sector development in RMCs;

© Enhanced knowledge of financial sector issues and increased awareness of the importance of
the sector for the sustainable economic development;

© Improved depth and efficiency of the financial sector and enhanced contribution of the sector
to economic growth in RMCs.

Partners: The Partnership is widely supported by, among others, the AfDB, International Monetary
Fund (IMF), World Bank Group, Agence Francaise de Développement (AFD), Germany (BMZ), UK
(DFID), Sweden (SIDA), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), UNCDF, and USAID.

New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD) programs. The Bank also actively
collaborates with national governments
and pan-African organizations, particularly
the African Union (AU) and United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA),
to rationalize and streamline REC structures. The rationalization process is expected to contribute to more effective Free
Trade Areas (FTAs) and Customs Unions
(CUs) to accelerate progress toward the
creation of larger and open regional markets and ultimately the attainment of the
African Economic Community.

Other integration measures fostered by
he Bank include the development of subregional Assistance Strategies to complement its Country Strategy Papers (CSPs).
he Bank is actively involved also in many
multilateral and bilateral initiatives to
joost Africa's trade capacity and global
integration (see Box 3.3).

During 2007 the Bank approved a
number of operations in support of economic cooperation and regional integraion in Africa, including the RASCOM
elecommunications Satellite Project;
he Cameroon—Chad-CAR Transportation
Facilitation Program; the East African
Submarine Cable System (EASSy) Project;
and the Electrical Interconnection Project
or Ghana, Togo, and Benin.

New Partnership for Africa
Development (NEPAD) and the IPPF
n 2007, the African Development Bank
approved 5 regional infrastructure projects
under the NEPAD initiative for a total of
US$ 290 million (UA 183.5 million). This
rings the total number of NEPAD Short
erm Action Plan (STAP) projects financed
y the Bank since 2002 to 38, for a total
amount of US$ 1.3 billion (UA 0.82 bil
 

ion); this is in addition to US$ 1.6 bilion (UA 1.01 billion) mobilized through
cofinanciers.

Under the NEPAD Infrastructure Project
Preparation Facility (NEPAD-IPPF), US$ 4.2
million was approved in 2007 to finance
7 (UA 2.66 million) project preparatory
activities in the energy, transportation, and
CT sectors. The facility is currently financed
y Canada (C$ 10 million/UA 6.4 million)
and Denmark (DKK 3 million/UA 0.37 milion). The Bank has intensified its resource
mobilization efforts resulting in 3 new
donors (Norway, the UK, and Germany)
who have made pledges to the Fund. The
UK has pledged GBP 6 million (UA 7.6
million), Norway NOK 45 million (UA 5.3
million), and Germany € 2 million (UA 1.9
million) to support capacity-building efforts
‘or the RECs in infrastructure projects. In
December 2007, a formal agreement was
signed between Norway and the Bank.

Connect Africa Initiative

The Connect Africa Initiative is a global
partnership launched in October 2007 to
mobilize the human, financial, and technical
resources needed to bridge major gaps in
ICT infrastructure across the continent. A
total of US$ 55 billion (UA 34.08 billion) has
so far been pledged for the development
of infrastructure and services necessary to
achieve both the ICT-related MDGs and the
World Summit on Information Society Action
Plan. The Bank Group will play a leading role
in the coordination of this initiative.

A regional conference was organized by the AfDB in collaboration with the WTO, UNECA, and the
Tanzanian Government, in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania in October 2007. The meeting was attended
by more than 400 delegates, including African ministers and government officials, donors, IGOs,
NGOs, RECs, and private sector organizations. This was the last of 3 high-level regional reviews
(Asia, Latin America, and Caribbean) held as part of the WTO's Aid for Trade (Aff) initiative
launched at the 2005 Hong Kong Ministerial Conference.

This conference aimed at developing a clear plan of action and a shared political commitment to
implementing the initiative. For African countries, the rationale for the conference was straightforward: Globalization is fundamentally changing the development dynamic, creating a huge potential for developing countries to harness international trade as an engine of growth.

The conference focused on the challenges facing subregions in Africa, with a particular emphasis
on the regional and transnational dimensions of trade capacity-building. Many of the capacity and
infrastructure constraints facing African countries are regional or cross-border in nature—and the
benefits of greater regional integration can be high. The discussions paid particular attention to
the adequacy of regional planning mechanisms and financing instruments.

A follow-up meeting was the Global Aft Review held in Geneva, Switzerland in November 2007. It
provided an overview of progress in the delivery of Aid-for-Trade, including current flows, existing
gaps, and areas for improvement. It highlighted the need to deliver more and better AfT and to
strengthen mutual accountability between partner countries and donors.

prises; (ii) strengthening financial systems;
(iii) building competitive infrastructure; (iv)
promoting regional integration and trade;
and (v) improving the investment climate.
To this end, the Bank finances reform
programs in RMCs in addition to specific
activities with private sector entrepreneurs
and organizations.

From 2004-2007 there was a sevenfold
increase in the ADB's non-sovereign lending operations. Private sector financing
operations in 2007 exceeded UA 1.00
billion compared to UA 166.0 million in
2004. The geographical distribution of
the 2007 approvals reflects a shift toward
middle-income countries (MICs) and multinational projects. Approvals for MICs represented 61 percent of total approvals in
2007, compared with 26 percent in 2006.
Similarly, there was a rise in the level of
multinational projects for 2007 (UA 112.3
million) compared with 2006 (UA 72.6 million). However, the share of approvals for
low-income countries (LICs) fell from 72
percent in 2006 to 26 percent in 2007.

AGRICULTURE AND
RURAL DEVELOPMENT

The vast majority of the continent's
population who live in extreme poverty
are in the rural areas. The enhancement
of sustainable agricultural and rural
development is therefore fundamental to the
attainment of the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) in Africa, particularly the
eradication of hunger and poverty. In
2007, the Bank Group's intervention in
this sector focused on the provision of rural
agriculture infrastructure, natural resources
management, adaptation to climate change,
and the provision of technical assistance
for the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Program (CAADP).

During 2007, total Bank Group approvals for

the sector amounted to UA 178.8 million,
accounting for about 6.9 percent of the total

Box 3.4: Enhancing Private Sector Assistance for Africa

The Enhanced Private Sector Assistance (EPSA) Initiative is an innovative, multi-component, multi-donor
framework for resource mobilization and development partnership to support implementation of the
AfDB's Strategy for Private Sector Development. Drawing on successful development experience in Asia
and around the globe, EPSA was conceived in partnership with the Government of Japan (GOJ), which
provided generous financial support for its launch in 2005. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation
(JBIC) has committed a total of US$ 1 billion in concessional loans over the period 2006-2010 through a
combination of direct lending to the Bank under the EPSA Non-sovereign Loan component and cofinancing under the Accelerated Cofinancing Facility (ACFA). In addition, Japan made an initial contribution of
US$ 20 million to launch the multi-donor Trust Fund for African Private Sector Assistance (FAPA), which
provides grant funding for technical assistance and capacity building to support implementation of the
Bank's Private Sector Development Strategy.

During 2007, JBIC provided US$ 100 million through direct financing to the Bank for non-sovereign operations, plus US$ 120 million in new cofinancing under ACFA, bringing total commitments under all EPSA
components to approximately US$ 250 million. Approvals during 2007 included support for the Bujagali
Interconnection Project in Uganda, SME credit lines in Nigeria, and the development of the East Africa
Submarine Cable System (EASSy).

loan and grant approvals. The approvals include
projects in community agricultural infrastructure, irrigation, horticulture, and sector budget
support in Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya,
Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique,
Tanzania, and Uganda, as detailed in the
project profiles at the end of Chapter 4.

Nonlending activities carried out by the Bank
Group to improve the development effectiveness of agricultural operations included: (i)

the simplification and harmonization of loan
conditionality with the best practices of other
MDBs; (ii) the enhancement of portfolio management in collaboration with field offices;
and (iii) an improvement in financial management of agricultural operations through the
regular follow-up of external audit submissions by RMCs and the implementation of the
Bank internal audit recommendations. These
measures led to a 38 percent reduction of
problem projects in 2007.

 

 

11/04/08 13:35:46 | |The Bank Group also organized a number
of strategic partnership meetings focusing
on the agricultural sector. These included
(i) the 7th Donor Partnership Meeting on
Agriculture and Rural Development in
West and Central Africa, with the participation of the major MDBs, bilateral and
international organizations; (ii) ADB/FAO/
IFAD technical partnership meeting; (iii)
the AfDB/FAO/IFAD technical and partnership meeting; (iv) a seminar on Integrated
Water Resources Management (IWRM) to
select operations for possible cofinancing
with the Global Environment Fund (GEF);
and (v) a cooperation meeting with the
World Bank in Agricultural Water Use.

PROMOTING SOCIAL AND
HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

The Bank Group supports human capital
development in RMCs through strengthened
and effective education, health, and social
systems (see Box 3.5). Approvals by the
Bank Group for the social sector in 2007
amounted to UA 119.7 million, or 4.6 percent of total loans and grants. The decrease
in the social sector's share of approvals
since 2006 can be attributed to the Bank
Group's enhanced selectivity toward projects
and programs that will have the maximum
impact on poverty reduction.

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

Box 3.5: Implementation of the Bank's Policy on Poverty Reduction

 

In 2007, the Bank continued the implementation of its Policy on Poverty Reduction which is designed to:

e Facilitate a strong linkage between country-owned Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and
corresponding Results-Based Country Strategy Papers (RB-CSPs);

e Articulate the poverty reduction potential (including contributions to the achievements of MDGs) of
Bank-financed lending and nonlending operations to maximize improvements in the welfare of the
poor; and

@ — Enhance the poverty-related capacity building for its staff and in its RMCs.

The implementation strategy guided the review process of documents relating to Bank operations at all
levels, especially RB-CSPs, budget support programs and sector projects, capacity-building operations,
Economic and Sector Work, and the expanded program of applied socioeconomic research. For instance,
the review process was used to ensure that the MDGs are mainstreamed in RB-CSPs and the linkage
between RB-CSPs and PRSPs is strengthened. In addition, efforts were made to improve the quality and
depth of the poverty diagnostics, the analysis of the sources of pro-poor growth, and the viability and
sustainability of Monitoring and Evaluation systems in RB-CSPs.

In 2007, the Bank also organized training in the Economics of Poverty for approximately 30 Bank staff. The training was based on 4 modules, which included sessions on the development of tools for poverty measurement,
the analysis of sources of pro-poor growth, the assessment of pro-poor public expenditures, and examination
of data requirements for PRSP-MDG relevant monitoring and evaluation systems. The objective of the training
program is to sharpen the skills of Bank staff in the analysis of poverty in its lending and nonlending operations

so that its contribution to poverty reduction and the achievement of the MDGs are maximized.

In the primary and secondary education sector, the Bank Group provided sector budget
support to Lesotho and Tanzania to enable
both countries to implement their primary
and secondary education strategic plans.
Three operations were approved for the

 

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Céte
d'Ivoire, and Liberia to provide employment and income-generating opportunities
to former combatants and youth, and rehabilitate social infrastructure in the regions
that were worst affected by the conflict. In
the health sector, the Bank Group focused
on portfolio management to decrease the
number of problematic projects, identify
areas of comparative advantage, and so
increase its effectiveness on the ground.

In support of poverty alleviation programs
in RMCs, the Bank Group approved a
microfinance project in Mauritania in 2007
aimed at improving access to financial
services, particularly for women entrepreneurs. Also, a Community Empowerment
and Institutional Support project was
approved for Kenya to build capacity and
improve utilization of development resources. Nonlending operations in social and
human development by the Bank Group in

and Ghana and studies on the maintenance
of social infrastructure in Mozambique.

During the year, the Bank participated
in the Telemedicine Task Force (TTF) for
Sub-Saharan Africa; a high-level forum on
HIV/AIDS and infrastructure; and a conference on technical and vocational education,
amongst others. The Bank is also actively engaged with the Association for the
Development of Education in Africa (ADEA)
and will be hosting the ADEA Secretariat at
he TRA in Tunis.

addition, a grant of UA 0.33 million was
extended from the Special Relief Fund to
victims of the floods in Ethiopia.

 

 

 

CROSSCUTTING
ACTIVITIES

Gender Mainstreaming

Gender mainstreaming continues to be a
priority crosscutting issue and an integral
component in Bank Group lending and
nonlending activities. In 2007, training was

| | 03_Chapter3_UK.indd 24

 

given to various members of staff in infrastructure, to enhance competence to integrate gender in projects and programs. The
Gender Guidelines for agriculture, education, health and infrastructure are now at an
advanced stage of development to provide
a practical tool for Bank staff in identifying
and mainstreaming gender issues through
all stages of the program/project cycle. Work
is also at an advanced stage on a midterm
review of the Gender Plan of Action, to generate lessons and best practice that can be
replicated across the Bank's field of operations. Furthermore, a Gender Resources
and Results Tracking System (GRARTS) is

currently under development to enable the
tracking of resources allocated to gender
equality and to help monitor results over
time. The main objective is to strengthen
the linkage between policy objectives and
resource allocations.

Although some progress is being made
to promote the Bank's gender agenda,
several areas requiring further attention
need to be addressed. These include:
(i) enhancing the use of gender profiles; (ii)
increasing the sensitization of Bank staff
on gender issues; (iii) scaling up capacitybuilding for data collection on gender-related
issues; and (iv) more effective incorporation
of gender components and monitorable
indicators into project design.

The Environment

and Climate Change

Africa has contributed the least to climate
change but, experts agree, will be the worst
affected globally. The Bank seeks to develop
policies and frameworks to address this
new global challenge, within the Nairobi
Framework. During 2007 work continued
on the development of a Clean Energy
Investment Framework (CEIF), which is now
at an advanced stage. The framework is
articulated around 3 main pillars: (i) energy

 

11/04/08 13:36:25 | |access, (ii) mitigation, and (iii) adaptation.
Energy access includes electrification programs; enhancing generation capacity of
power grids; provision of energy services to
key public facilities; promotion of standalone
projects for households without electricity;
and a push for cleaner fuels. Mitigation
aims at mainstreaming renewable energy
and energy efficiency. Adaptation is the component of the CEIF that involves climate risk
management (CRM). The Bank Group is also
working closely with other bilateral, multilateral, and UN agencies on climate change in
Africa, within the Nairobi Framework.

Under the Financing Energy Services for
Small-Scale Energy Users Program (FINESSE),
the Bank Group provided technical assistance
and knowledge management services in the
preparation of a wind powerplant project in
Kenya, a micro-hydro power in Madagascar,
and a renewable energy for agro-processing project in Uganda. The Bank Group is
currently working on its new Strategy on
Climate Risk Management and Adaptation,
which will mainstream environmental issues
into the Bank's portfolio of operations to
support RMCs' efforts in addressing climate
change impacts.

In the area of natural resources management, the Bank's emphasis has been on
improved conservation, utilization, governance and management regimes for land,
water, fish and forest resources as well as to
conserve biodiversity.

SUPPORT FOR MIDDLE
INCOME COUNTRIES
(MICs)

The increasing liquidity and declining cost
of borrowing in the international financial markets have broadened the financing
options open to middle-income countries
(MICs). In the context of the rapidly changing financial architecture, MDBs need to
develop innovative policies and strategies to
meet this new challenge. The Bank Group is

| | 03_Chapter3_UK.indd 25

at an advanced stage in developing a new
strategy to enhance support to MICs, which
will emphasize country ownership, selectivity and complementarity, partnership, and a
results focus.

This new approach, which is being aligned
with the Bank's private sector strategy, sets
out the following objectives:

(i) To build the competitiveness of MICs by
supporting infrastructure development;

(ii) To deepen private sector investment
and catalytic transactions by providing
an interface between public and private
investment through direct investment,
equity participation, and by engaging
private corporations, financial institutions, and state-owned enterprises;

(iii) To boost regional investment and trade
by supporting partnerships between
MICs and neighboring ADF countries
through public/private (PPP) operations;

 

 

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

(iv) To enhance capacity building and
knowledge by investing in productive
sectors; and

(v) To disseminate best practices among
development stakeholders to strengthen their institutional management and
capacity.

The Bank has commenced the preparatory process to co-organize with the World
Bank an MIC Conference in March 2008
to enhance competitiveness in delivering
lending and nonlending services in support
of MICs.

SUPPORT FOR
FRAGILE STATES

The Bank has developed an operational
strategy for enhancing its engagement
in fragile regional member states to be
approved by the Board during the first
quarter 2008. Such states continue to pose
serious challenges in Africa by undermin
Box 3.6: The Fragile States Facility (FSF)

 

The FSF provides a broad and well integrated operational framework through which the Bank can be
more effectively engaged in countries experiencing fragility. Specifically, the FSF will provide scaled-up

support to eligible fragile states, under 3 pillars:

© Supplementary Financing: On top of the regular PBA-based country allocation, supplementary
financing will be provided to eligible post-crisis/transitional countries. The support will be for a
limited period of time, with clear and strict criteria to be met for eligibility, a specific allocation, and
phasing-out mechanism and monitoring, delivery and exit provisions.

e Arrears Clearance: Supplementary support will be closely coordinated with arrears clearance
operations to ensure the highest impact to the eligible post-crisis/transitional countries. Accordingly,
the Bank's Post-Conflict Country Facility (PCCF), which provided arrears clearance to eligible countries, will be folded into an Arrears Clearance Window (ACW) of the FSF; and

¢ Targeted Support: A limited pool of resources will be set aside to allow the Bank to provide supplementary targeted support for capacity building, knowledge management, etc. in all categories

of fragile states.

Financing the FSF: The amount of resources allocated to the FSF under the ADF-XI cycle, 2008-2010,
is UA 407.1 million or 7.5 per cent of the total ADF-XI resources available for allocation (i.e. the total
replenishment level minus contingencies). Funding can be supplemented by additional voluntary contri
bution from donors.

ing the development prospects of individual countries and adversely affecting
regional stability, security, and economic
growth. The Bank's strategy, developed to
meet specific priorities and expectations
expressed by partner countries, has two
interrelated objectives:

(i) to more effectively assist fragile states,
including the post-crisis/transitional
countries to move toward more stable
political and economic development;
and

(ii) to assist countries at risk of slipping
into fragility.

The strategy is informed by the Bank's
past operational experiences, grounded
on the OECD-DAC Principles of Good
International Engagement, and will be
implemented in close collaboration with
other multilateral and bilateral partners,
including UN agencies and the African
Union (AU). A new financing instrument,
the Fragile States Facility (FSF), has been
created to operationalize the strategy, as
outlined in Box 3.6.

DEVELOPMENT
EFFECTIVENESS AND
MANAGING FOR RESULTS

Harmonization and Alignment

The Bank Group, within the framework of
the Paris Declaration commitments on Aid
Effectiveness, deepened its harmonization
and alignment activities at the institutional,
country, and global levels. Institutionallevel activities focused on developing
additional harmonization programming
instruments, implementation and monitoring tools, improving operations business
processes, and enhancing internal capacity.
Harmonization and alignment-friendly business process reforms have been at the center
of the Bank's ongoing institutional reforms
including: operational programming; decentralization; delegation of authority; procure

ment and financial management services;
and aligning the Technical Cooperation Fund
with the Bank's strategic priorities. These
reforms will further enhance the Bank's
effectiveness by improving quality at entry,
efficiency, accountability, portfolio management, and coordination.

At the country level, the Bank is helping
RMCs to meet the Paris Declaration commitments in 3 major areas: in implementing national harmonization and alignment
action plans; improving coordination and
use of common arrangements; and providing
capacity-building assistance, for example
in country statistical collection and utilization. During 2007, the Bank has continued
collaboration with other donors in joint
country analysis and country analytic work,
including the joint Assistance Strategy for
Zambia. Such collaborative activities are
further strengthening national ownership,
improving predictability of development
partners’ support, and maximizing the use
of donor resources.

At the global level, the Bank has deepened its participation in the MDB technical working group and OECD-DAC joint
venture workstreams, which play a key
facilitation role in the implementation of
the Paris Declaration commitments at the
country level. Moreover, the Bank Group
in partnership with other MDBs and the
OECD-DAC is organizing the Accra HighLevel Forum (HLF) on Aid Effectiveness,
scheduled for September 2-4, 2008. The
Bank is representing regional development
banks on the Steering Committee and is
providing support to African countries for
effective participation in Accra.

One of the key objectives of the Accra HLF
is to take stock of progress in the implementation of the Paris Declaration specific
commitments. In this regard, the Bank's
own assessment shows that it is making
progress overall. While strong to moderate progress has been achieved on tar
 

gets related to alignment of Bank support
to national priorities, joint analytic work,
coordinated technical cooperation, use of
country systems, and common arrangements, the Bank will strive to achieve better results in the predictability of resource
flows, avoidance of parallel implementation arrangements, and joint missions.
Steps taken by the Bank to scale up its performance include: introducing an incentive
system to improve staff buy-in; strengthening the Bank's own capacity; introducing greater flexibility in Bank procedures
and rules; and enhancing country institutional capacity. The Bank has also put in
place specific quantitative targets that will
be used as a benchmark for measuring
progress over the next 3 years.

Managing for Results: the Results
Measurement Framework

The Bank Group uses the Results
Measurement Framework to assess aggregate progress toward selected development
goals by ADF-eligible RMCs. The framework
focuses on: (i) development effectiveness in
terms of country progress on key outcomes
(see Box 3.7); and (ii) institutional effectiveness in terms of program outputs and
outcomes, and business processes.

© Outcomes at the Country Level: These
indicate that RMCs have made significant progress on growth, poverty
reduction and human development in
recent years. Communications across
the continent and with the rest of the
world have also improved through ICT.

© Operational Effectiveness: An assessment of outputs and outcomes of operations exiting the Bank Group's portfolio shows a significant contribution to
country-level progress in recent years.

e Institutional Effectiveness: The Bank
Group has made steady progress in
enhancing its institutional effectiveness. Measures already taken include:

11/04/08 13:36:26 | |Box 3.7: Assessment of Progress of Key Outcomes: ADF Results

Measurement Framework and Project Outputs

 

Up to 39 of the 40 ADF-eligible RMCs made progress in the 18 indicators in the areas of governance, regional integration, private sector development, agriculture, and information technology.
Project results shown below are an aggregation of only some of the outputs from 140 operations,
representing UA 1.40 billion in disbursements.

Growth and Poverty Reduction

© Real per capita income in ADF-eligible RMCs rose by more than 3 percent per annum over the
2002-2006 period, which is the fastest growth rate for more than two decades. As a result,
the share of the population living in extreme poverty declined.

Infrastructure

© Estimated population with improved access to transportation: 31.8 million.

e@ 75 percent of the ADF-eligible RMCs made positive progress on access to improved water
sources.
6 projects improved access to water resources and sanitation for 1.6 million people.
23 transportation sector projects upgraded 2,440 km of paved roads and constructed
marketplaces, boreholes, and school yards in the areas served by the roads.

e

Regional Integration and Trade

Governance and Transparency

More than 700,000 households were provided with new or improved access to electricity.

The value of trading among ADF-eligible RMCs within Africa increased by more than 30
percent per year in the 2005-2007 period.

Modest improvements in government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of
corruption, were offset by marginal declines in voice and accountability, and political stability.

 

Private Sector and Agriculture

10 million farmers benefited from the projects including the training of 350,000 people.

The staple crops index shows a 15 percent increase in average cereal yield per hectare during
the 2005-2007 period.

3,300 kilometers of feeder roads were built or rehabilitated to link 1,427 agricultural production and marketing facilities.

47 irrigation dams, 11,545 kilometers of dikes, 2,761 wells and boreholes, and 11,537 other
water and sanitation units were constructed or rehabilitated.

36,000 hectares of land were reforested and 373,660 hectares of natural forests brought
under sustainable use and management techniques.

Social Sector Development

| | 03_Chapter3_UK.indd 27

Access to basic health for about 5-8 million people was improved.

32 hospitals and 260 primary health centers were constructed or rehabilitated.

600 health facilities were provided with equipment; 52,000 health workers, including doctors,
nurses, and midwives, were trained.

8,480 classrooms and 461 education support facilities were constructed or rehabilitated.
6,074 schools were provided with water and sanitation facilities; 81,436 teachers were
trained, 12,553 new teachers recruited and 6.9 million textbooks supplied.

769 social fund and microfinance (Mf) institutions established, micro-credits granted to
334,990 people;.

131,000 micro-enterprises were established.

1.3 million people benefited from the Mf projects and 41,000 jobs were created through
poverty reduction operations.

 

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

(i) achieving operations staffing targets and enhancing staff diversity; (ii)
establishing 23 fully functioning field
offices; (iii) introducing results-based
Country Strategy Papers; (iv) speeding
up procurement processes; (v) increasing supervision ratios; (vi) reducing
aging and non-performing projects;
and (vii) lowering the share of problem/ at risk projects.

Despite the progress made in these areas,
the Bank believes that much work remains
to be done to improve the measurement of
outcomes and effectiveness in Bank Group
operations.

Decentralization: Increasing the
Country-Level Focus

During 2007, significant progress was
made in staffing the 23 operational field
offices; as a result, the 21 percent vacancy
rate will be filled in early 2008. Installation
of the essential ICT infrastructure was completed for these 23 field offices, including
the Sudan office which opened in 2007.
Staffing and installation of ICT equipment
in the 2 remaining field offices (Algeria and
Angola) will be finalized once their Host
Country Agreements have been signed.

The field offices have increased the Bank
Group's focus on results at the country level
and accelerated the pace of project and program implementation. Portfolio quality in these
countries is now improving through the Bank's
intensified supervision and engagement in the
procurement and disbursement approval processes. The Bank's proximity to RMCs has also
enhanced its knowledge and intelligence of
client countries’ sectoral and macro positions.
Collaboration frameworks with governments
and other development partners have led to
enhanced harmonization and alignment of
strategies, procedures, and policies.

The establishment of field offices has

therefore generated positive results, and
performance is expected to be further

enhanced by increased delegation of
authority for those activities that could
be more cost-effectively managed at the
country level with all the necessary fiduciary safeguards.

The Bank's oversight functions will be
strengthened through an enhanced monitoring and reporting framework on various
key performance indicators, or KPIs (see
Box 2.2) for which the field offices will be
held accountable.

debt relief of UA 60.2 million and UA 58.4
million were approved for Sierra Leone
and Sao Tomé and Principe, respectively,
and UA 34.6 million for Central African
Republic. The Gambia reached its completion point in December 2007 and debt
relief of UA 14.9 million is expected to
be approved in early 2008. At the end of
December 2007, 19 RMCs had reached
their completion point, 7 were in the interim stage between decision and completion
points, and 7 were at their pre-decision
point (see map below).

Four decision-point countries (Burundi,
Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, and
Guinea) are expected to reach their completion point in 2008; while 5 pre-decision
point countries (Liberia, Comoros, Céte
d'Ivoire, Sudan, and Togo) are expected to
reach their decision point.

The total cost of the HIPC Initiative for the 33
RMCs is estimated at US$ 3.64 billion in NPV
terms, equivalent to about US$ 5.63 billion
in nominal terms. The breakdown of the cost
by HIPC status is shown in Figure 3.1. As of
end-December 2007, 26 out of the 33 RMCs
classified as HIPCs in Africa were receiving
debt relief from the Bank Group under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative. Figure 3.1 also
shows the amounts that have been delivered
to these RMCs by HIPC status.

 

As shown in Table 3.1, as at end-December
2007, the total resources mobilized for the
Bank Group under the HIPC Trust Fund
amounted to US$ 2.47 billion. The total
cost of commitments for decision and
completion point RMCs under the HIPC
initiative as at end-December 2007 is estimated at US$ 4.81 billion. The financing
gap in terms of resources needed to fund
the commitments is estimated at US$ 2.34
billion. Based on current estimates, the
HIPC Trust Fund will need about US$ 86.2
million of new cash inflows to cover its
contribution to the 4 RMCs that will reach
their completion point in 2008.

Operational Priorities Chapter 003

The Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI)

The MDRI provides additional debt relief
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to the
MDRI-eligible RMCs after completion point.
Under the MDRI, donors are committed
to cancel debts for loans disbursed and
outstanding under ADF, as at December 31,
2004, for the eligible RMCs, and to compensate the Bank “dollar for dollar” for the
MDRI-related foregone reflows over a 50-year
period. The estimated cost of the Initiative
is UA 5.57 billion, equivalent to US$ 8.80
billion. MDRI debt relief of UA 129.0 million
and UA 65.3 million were approved for Sierra
Leone, and Sao Tomé and Principe respectively
in 2007, which will be spread over a 50-year
period. UA 107.6 million is expected to be
approved for The Gambia in early 2008 to
be spread over the same timeframe. The total
debt relief provided to the 19 MDRI-eligible
RMCs in 2007 is estimated at UA 36.6 million, equivalent to US$ 57.8 million (see also
Annexes II-15 and II-16).

2007 ADF-X Country Allocations

As at end-December 2007, a total of UA
2.71 billion, representing 95.4 percent of
the available resources, had been committed to programs and projects in RMCs,
leaving a balance of UA 131.0 million.
Of the amount committed, 72.5 percent
was allocated to performing countries. The
grants portion of the committed ADF-X
resources is estimated at UA 857.4 million.

The enhanced Performance-Based Allocation
(PBA) formula is used to determine the country allocations and the Debt Sustainability
Analysis/Debt Sustainability Framework
(DSA/DSF) for determining the countryspecific financing terms, i.e. loan, grant, or
loan/grant combination. Table 3.2 sets out
the 2007 DSA/DSF classification.

Chapter 003 Operational Priorities

Box 3.8: ADF-X! Replenishment—Main Features

Replenishment level

 

The Deputies agreed to a record level of support for the ADF with a replenishment of UA 5.76 billion for
the ADF-XI cycle (2008-2010). This includes UA 3.70 billion of donor contribution and UA 2.06 billion
of advance commitment capacity, and represents a 52 percent increase over the resources under the

ADF-X cycle (2005-2007).

Focal areas of ADF support

The Deputies endorsed the focus of the ADF on 3 core operational priorities: infrastructure, governance,
and regional integration. They also highlighted the need to integrate agriculture and human development, gender, environmental sustainability and climate change, and clean energy into the focal areas.

Financial allocations

The ADF-XI resources available for allocation after netting out contingencies amount to UA 5.427 billion.
From this allocable amount, the distribution of resources was agreed as follows:

@ = The ADF will enhance its engagement in fragile states, including post-conflict countries, and will
allocate 7.5 percent of the total allocable resources (UA 407.1 million) to a Fragile States Facility
(FSF) to provide targeted support to specific countries, including debt relief.

@ = The ADF will assist Africa to become more competitive and overcome the limitations of many small
separate domestic markets through greater economic integration. It will allocate 17.5 percent of
the total allocable resources (UA 949.7 million) to multinational operations.

@ The remaining 75 percent of the resources (UA 4.07 billion), will be allocated to the ADF regional
member countries using the revised PBA formula.

XI) in 2007. The first meeting was held in
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, on March 14-15,
2007; the second in Tunis, Tunisia, on June
11-12, 2007; the third in Bamako, Mali,
on September 20-21, 2007; and the final
meeting in London, UK on December 1112, 2007. All Board members participated
as observers at these meetings.

The Deputies discussed the progress on the
institutional reforms aimed at improving
the operational capability and effectiveness of the ADF. These included corporate performance measurement; improved
portfolio management; strengthening of
procurement and financial services; decentralization; and business and budget process reforms. The Deputies welcomed the
reforms and urged Management and the
Board to implement them more quickly.

On lending scenarios and the financing
framework, participants reconfirmed the

Annual Report 2007

| | 03_Chapter3_UK.indd 30

importance of the PBA system in the
allocation of ADF resources, and proposed
several process changes. Participants reiterated the need for the Fund to better
demonstrate results and urged the Fund
to audit and quantify results in a more
systematic and analytical way. The main
features of the ADF-XI replenishment consultations are outlined in Box 3.8.

Post-Conflict Countries Facility
(PCCF)—Progress Report

The Bank Group’s Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF), approved during the ADF-X
replenishment negotiations in 2004, provides grant financing for arrears clearance in
post-conflict countries. This is to enable the
PCCs to progress quickly to HIPC decision
point. PCCF grants count toward the Bank
Group's HIPC debt relief for RMCs.

As at end 2007, the total contribution from
ADB and ADF-X resources to the PCCF

 

amounted to UA 350 million (equivalent to
about US$ 553.1 million). Of this amount:

S$ 64.0 million was used to finance
5 percent of the arrears clearance of
urundi and 33 percent of the arrears
learance of Congo Republic in 2004;

Q0we

e US$ 23.3 million to finance 49.5 percent of the arrears of Central African

During the ADF-XI negotiations, the PCCF
was incorporated into the new Fragile
States Facility (see Box 3.6). UA 407.1 million (representing 7.5% of the total ADF-XI
allocable resources), was earmarked for
the FSF to provide targeted support to
specific countries, including debt relief.

PARTNERSHIPS
AND COOPERATION
ACTIVITIES

In 2007, the Bank Group continued to
promote and strengthen cooperative relations
with multilateral and bilateral development
partners. The main objective of these strategic
partnerships is to mobilize financial resources,
share knowledge and information, and build
technical skills in the RMCs. In 2007, the
Bank reinforced its strategic partnerships with
the World Bank, European Commission, and
UN Agencies. All partnerships endorse the
principles of the Paris Declaration, in seeking
harmonization of procedures and instruments,
collaboration based on comparative
advantages, and results management for
maximum impact on poverty reduction. The
activities undertaken by the Bank in this
context can be grouped into cofinancing
operations, bilateral technical cooperation,
and multilateral technical cooperation.

Cofinancing Operations

During 2007, the Bank Group, in collaboration with other development partners,
cofinanced projects amounting to UA 7.47
billion compared with UA 11.7 billion in
2006—a decrease of 36.2 percent. The
Bank's contribution amounted to UA 1.29
billion compared with UA 1.32 billion in
2006, while the contribution of external
development partners decreased to UA
4.20 billion, from the 2006 figure of UA
4.24 billion. The share of beneficiary RMCs
declined sharply from UA 6.10 billion
in 2006 to UA 1.98 billion in 2007. The
top 4 sectors to benefit from cofinancing
operations were power supply, followed by
industry, mining and quarrying; transportation; and social (see Table 3.3).

 

Bilateral Technical

Cooperation Activities

The Bank's bilateral development partners
provide grant resources to support institution-building reforms and project-cycle
operations. Bilateral technical cooperation
activities focus on mobilizing, managing,
and administering these grant resources for

maximum impact and results. In 2007, UA
7.76 million was committed from existing
bilateral resources to finance 56 activities.
New bilateral resources, amounting to UA
29.0 million, were mobilized from donor
countries. Korea approved US$ 5 million
(UA 3.2 million) and the UK provided GBP
13 million (UA 16.5 million) under bilateral
trust funds. Canada has committed to provide C$ 5 million (UA 3.2 million) in early
2008. Portugal has committed € 2 million
(UA 1.9 million) to replenish the bilateral
trust fund in early 2008.

During the year, the Bank Group simplified
and standardized its Technical Cooperation
Fund (TCF) programs to align with those
of other MDBs. The TCF Reform Program,
approved by the Board in September 2006,
allows the Bank more efficiency and flexibility in the utilization of such funds, for
example: to negotiate fully untied TCFs,
promote multi-donor thematic funds, levy
a standard minimum administrative fee of
5 percent of the committed amount, and
establish minimum amounts for single and
multi-donor funds. Standard templates of

agreements for single-donor trust funds
and multi-donor thematic trust funds have
respectively been formulated. In mid-2007,
preparatory work started on operationalizing |T-based, real-time trust funds management system in early 2008.

Bilateral cooperation covers a broad spectrum of activities, including policy formulation, sector studies, capacity building
for RMCs and Bank staff, donor-funded
secondments and technical assistance,
business opportunities seminars, and conferences.

Chapter 004 Bank Group Operations

 

The focus of this chapter is firmly on the operational side of Bank Group activities. First, a brief overview of the performance of Africa's economies during the year is presented. Next, Bank Group operations for 2007 are analyzed, for the Bank
Group as a whole, the ADB, ADF, and NTF. The analysis covers approvals by financing instrument, sector, and subregion and
provides cumulative figures since 1967 for each of the 3 windows. There follows an analysis of Bank approvals for each of
the 5 subregions of the continent in 2007, with a particular emphasis on sectoral allocations to demonstrate the Bank's new
focus on selectivity in its operations. The chapter ends by presenting comprehensive Profiles of all the projects and programs

approved by the ADB and ADF during the year, including multinational operations.

MACROECONOMIC
CONTEXT

The performance of Africa's economies
continued to be robust in 2007, marking
the longest period of economic expansion in the continent for two decades.
The annual real GDP growth rate has averaged 5.2 percent for the last 6 consecutive
years, and over 5.7 percent during the last
3 years. Real GDP growth rates of 5.9 and
5.7 percent were recorded for 2006 and
2007 respectively (see Table 4.1). A total of
14 countries recorded growth rates of 3 to
5 percent in 2007, while those with higher
growth rates increased to 25. During the
year only 3 countries recorded a negative
growth rate.

he continent's GDP per capita rose from
US$ 1,161 in 2006 to US$ 1,291 in 2007
(see Table 4.1), while real GDP per capita
growth improved marginally from 3.5 percent to 3.7 percent over the same period.
However, this favorable trend still falls short
of the 7-8 percent GDP growth required
‘0 achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), in particular that of halving
he proportion of people living in extreme
poverty by 2015.

For the continent as a whole, average inflaion rose from 6.6 percent in 2006 to 8.2
percent in 2007. This is partly explained by
he improved economic performance and
sustained oil price increases, which exert
 

Table 4.1: Africa — Macroeconomic Indicators, 1990-2007

 

ed upward pressure on consumer prices.
However, Africa's fiscal balance declined
from a surplus of 4.2 percent of GDP in
2006 to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2007.

The performance of Africa's external position in 2007 was mixed, with higher export
volumes and negative terms of trade; the
latter declining from 8.6 percent in 2006
to a negative 1.7 percent in 2007. Debt
relief measures under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative and the MDRI contributed to the
decline of Africa’s external debt from 26.2
percent of GDP in 2006 to 22.7 percent of
GDP in 2007. Similarly, its debt-service as a
percentage of exports fell from 9.9 percent
in 2006 to 6.3 percent in 2007.

The average current account balance as
a proportion of GDP has been positive

ighest in East Africa (8.0 percent), followed by Southern Africa (7.0 percent) and
North Africa (5.3 percent). The real GDP of
Central Africa and West Africa grew by 4.1
ercent and 3.5 percent respectively, which
is below the continental average of 5.7
ercent. Inflation in all subregions except
Southern Africa and East Africa was below
he continental average of 8.2 percent in
2007. The inflation rate for Southern Africa,
at 11.5 percent, was 40.2 percent more
han the continental average, although
his masks considerable variations across
he subregion. For example, Zimbabwe sufered from hyperinflation (6,724 percent)
in 2006/2007, whereas the rate of inflation for most other RMCs in the subregion
was in single digits.

 

OVERVIEW OF BANK
GROUP OPERATIONS

Bank Group loan, grant, and other
approvals in 2007 amounted to UA 3.10
billion, compared to UA 2.60 billion in
2006—an increase of 19.2 percent. Of
the total approvals for 2007, UA 2.58
billion was allocated to financing operations, while UA 515.4 million went to

pation, and special fund allocations. The
ADB accounted for UA 1.67 billion (53.9
percent) of total Bank Group approvals), the ADF for UA 1.38 billion (44.6
percent), and special funds for UA 45.8
million (1.5 percent). There was no lending from the Nigeria Trust Fund during
2007.

Approvals for public and publicly-guaranteed loans in 2007 amounted to UA
1.46 billion, representing 56.5 percent
of total operations. Private non-publicly
guaranteed loans totaled UA 816.1 million, representing 31.6 percent of Bank
Group operations.

Bank Group Loans and

Grant Approvals by

Financing Instrument

Project and policy-based loans and grants
are 2 principal Bank Group financing instruments. Project lending is specific in nature
while policy-based lending is designed
for macroeconomic policy, and structural,
sectoral, and institutional reforms. Project
lending (including private sector project
loans) rose to UA 2.22 billion in 2007 from
UA 1.20 billion in 2006, which represents
an increase of 85.0 percent. Project lending accounted for 71.6 percent of the total

 

Bank Group Operations Chapter 004

approvals in 2007 (see Table 4.3). With
regard to policy-based lending, there was
a very significant decline from UA 618.4
million in 2006 to just UA 51.8 million in
2007.

Grant approvals declined from UA 492.4
million in 2006 to UA 307.1 million in
2007. The bulk of the grant resources
in 2007 were allocated for 15 projects,
1 budget support grant and 1 structural
adjustment grant. In addition, UA 153.2
million was approved for 3 operations
under HIPC arrears clearance, UA 131.0
million as assistance to 2 countries under
the PCCF, and UA 185.4 million for 6 private sector equity participations.

 

Bank Group Operations by Sector
Bank Group operations during 2007 continued to reflect the country strategies
and development priorities of RMCs. Total
approvals for 2007 far exceeded the previous year's level; this was the result of the
Bank's policy of selectivity, project focus
and effectiveness, and the rising demand
for infrastructure financing in RMCs. Table
4.4 shows that the top 4 sectors to benefit from loan and grant approvals were:
infrastructure (comprising power supply,
transportation, water supply & sanitation,
and communication); agriculture and rural
development; industry, mining and quarrying; and social.

Approvals for infrastructure projects rose
sharply from UA 857.7 million in 2006
(37.2 percent of total loan and grant
approvals) to UA 1.93 billion (74.8 percent
of the total) in 2007. The remaining 25.2
percent of Bank Group commitments was
shared among the other sectors: agriculture and rural development; industry, mining and quarrying; social sector; multisector; finance; and environment (see Figure
4.1). The partial decline in Bank Group
approvals for these other sectors was
partly compensated by increased funding
from bilateral and multilateral development partners.

Approvals by Sector and Subregion
During the period 1967 to 2007, the Bank
Group approved 3,174 loans and grants,
totaling UA 41.58 billion. Of the total
cumulative approvals, the nonconcessionary ADB window accounted for 57.2 percent, the concessionary ADF window for
42.1 percent, and the NTF resources for
0.7 percent respectively. The dominance of
infrastructure projects in Bank Group operations for 2007 is also manifested in Bank

Multinational Projects and Programs
Regional integration is essential to increase
competitiveness and productivity, expand
trade, pool resources for investment, enlarge
local markets, and take advantage of the
scale of production afforded by large markets. Regional projects and programs therefore constituted key elements in Bank Group
loan and grant approvals during the year.

In 2007, loan and grant approvals for multinational operations stood at UA 193.3 million,
which is less than half the 2006 level. This
can be attributed to a retargeting of resources to infrastructure and private sector development in RMCs. Figure 4.5 shows that the
largest share of multinational projects went to
transportation, followed by communications,
power supply, and environment (see also
Annex |I-7).

 

Cumulatively, Bank Group support for multinational projects amounted to UA 1.75
billion in 2007.

Private Sector Operations

The private sector is increasingly recognized
as the engine of growth for African economies in the drive to reduce poverty and attain
the MDGs. Accordingly, private sector approvals in 2007 rose to UA 1.00 billion, compared
with UA 278.5 million in 2006. In 2007, 17

private sector operations were financed, 6
of which were to support regional integration. Figure 4.6 presents the composition of
private sector operations between loans and
equity investments.

The sectoral distribution of private sector
operations shows the dominance of infrastructure, followed by finance, industry,
and agriculture. The 5 major private sector
operations during the year were: the Eskom
Holdings Expansion Project in South Africa
(UA 333.0 million), the Ambatovy Nickel and
Cobalt Project in Madagascar (UA 100.0 million), the Damietta Port Container Terminal in
Egypt (UA 94.3 million), the equity investment
in NEDBANK Housing Finance of South Africa
(UA 92.1 million), and the Line of Credit to
STB in Tunisia (UA 87.8 million). Cumulative
approvals for private sector projects and
programs at year-end 2007 exceeded those
at year-end 2006 by some 20 percent. A
brief description of the Eskom power supply
project is presented in Box 4.1.

In terms of the sectoral distribution of ADB
total loans and grants, Table 4.6 shows
that infrastructure received the largest
share (80.4 percent); followed by indus

try, mining and quarrying, (11.0 percent);
finance (5.9 percent); multisector (1.4 percent); agriculture and rural development
(0.7 percent); and environment (0.7 percent). The targeting of financial resources
to infrastructure reflects the Bank's new
selectivity toward high-impact projects that
will enhance the climate for private sector
investment, increase competitiveness and
productivity, and so boost trade, socioeconomic development, and employment.

Among the components of infrastructure,
the share of power supply in loan and
grants rose from 5.5 percent in 2006 to
52.1 percent in 2007. Similarly, that of
transportation rose from 11 percent to
25.2 percent during the same period.
These increases were offset by decreases
in approvals to other subsectors.

 

 

Box 4.1: Eskom Holdings Ltd. Expansion Project

Background: After two decades of power surplus, South Africa is experiencing for the first time significant
power outages. This unprecedented situation reveals the huge investment needed to sustain the country's
economic growth rate and reach 6 percent growth by 2010, as well as to attain the Government's objective
of universal electricity access by 2012. Eskom is the largest power company in South Africa and has the
remit for implementing the country's Electrification Program, mainly targeting poor communities. Eskom is
state-owned, operates as an independent commercial entity, and ranks among the top ten power companies in the world in terms of sales and capacity.

Amount: A non-sovereign guaranteed long-term loan in the amount of UA 333.04 million (US$ 500 million) was granted to Eskom by the Bank, with a repayment period of 20 years including a grace period of
5 years. The Bank's comparative advantage is its ability to provide funding at longer tenors, which Eskom
would be unlikely to procure through other investors.

Objectives: The Bank’s loan is intended to (i) assist the Government in achieving the GDP growth target
of 6 percent per annum from 2010, within the framework of the Accelerated Shared Growth Initiative
of South Africa (ASGISA); (ii) ensure the security of the supply of electricity; (iii) improve the operational
efficiency of the power utility company; and (iv) enhance the rate of access to electricity services from 72
percent to 100 percent by 2012.

Expected Outcomes: (a) Short-Term: Commissioning of various power generation projects over the
period 2007-2014; (b) Medium-Term: (i) Fulfilling the electricity demands of various industries in the
country through the implementation of electricity generation projects, involving a total capacity of 11850
megawatts over the 2007-2014 period; (ii) Attainment of universal access to electricity by 2012; (c) LongTerm: Helping to meet the Government's twin objectives under ASGISA of halving the level of poverty and
unemployment by 2014 and achieving high and sustained economic growth rates of 4.5 percent for the
period 2004-2009 and 6.0 percent for the period 2010-2014.

General Remarks: As a member of the Southern African Power Pool, Eskom intends to source 15 percent
of its power from neighboring countries through the construction of transnational high-voltage transmission lines. The program is therefore strongly aligned with the Bank's focus on fostering regional cooperation and integration, particularly in infrastructure.

decreased from UA 1.37 billion in 2006
for 80 operations in 32 countries to UA
1.1 billion in 2007 for 49 operations in
24 countries. This was due mainly to the
diminishment in resources at the end of
the ADF-X cycle, prior to the Eleventh
Replenishment of the Fund. Project and
policy-based loans, approved by the
Fund, including one loan for institutional capacity building, amounted to UA
793.0 million, while grants totaled UA

projects were allocated the bulk of the
approvals—UA 737.7 million, consisting of UA 548.5 million in loans and UA
189.1 million in grants. Of this allocation,
transportation procured the lion’s share at
34.9 percent; water supply and sanitation
received 18.0 percent; and power supply
14.3 percent (Figure 4.10). Agriculture
and rural development was allocated 15.4
percent, followed by social sector at 10.9
percent, and multisector at 6.5 percent.
The increase in approvals for infrastructure
projects in 2007 over the 2006 level was
offset by a sharp reduction in the share of
multisector and the social sector and by a
slight decrease in agricultural operations.
The decline in these sectors was compensated to a large extent by increased financial support from the Bank Group's bilateral
and multilateral development partners.

Figure 4.12 presents the cumulative (19742007) ADF loan and grant approvals by
subregion. Central Africa, East Africa, and
West Africa, which mostly comprise ADF
countries, accounted for 72.5 percent of
cumulative total loans and grants. North
Africa and Southern Africa, which principally comprise ADB countries, accounted
or 20.6 percent, while multinational
operations received 6.9 percent. This is
consistent with the Bank Group's operaional policy, whereby ADF resources are
used mainly for financing operations in
ow-income and blend countries.

Disbursements

n 2007, the disbursement of loans and
grants on Fund operations amounted
‘0 UA 725.0 million, compared with UA
685.2 million in 2006, an increase of 5.8
percent. Cumulative disbursements as at
December 31, 2007 stood at UA 10.68

THE NIGERIA
TRUST FUND (NTF)

Under the terms of Agreement establishing the NTF, which was signed between the
Federal Government of Nigeria and the African
Development Bank, the operations of the Fund
were envisaged to come to an end 30 years
after the Agreement came into force. Although
he Bank and the Nigerian authorities agreed
‘0 2 one-year extensions of the Agreement
rom its original expiry date of April 25, 2006,
no new loans or grants have been approved
rom the NTF window since that date. In
November 2006 an evaluation of activities of
he Fund was commissioned and the exercise
was completed in July 2007. On the basis of
he evaluation exercise, findings and recommendations, and subsequent to the meetings
eld between the Bank and the Nigerian
Authorities in November 2007, the latter have
agreed to extend the life of the NTF for a furher 10 years. Approvals from this window are
expected to recommence in 2008.

Approvals, 1976-2007

The cumulative loan and grant approvals from

in 30 RMCs. The sectoral allocation therefore
also remained unchanged post April 2006.
Figure 4.13 shows that the majority allocation
was for infrastructure operations, followed by
agriculture, social sector, finance, and industry.

The cumulative subregional distribution of
NTF approvals were concentrated in West
Africa, followed by East Africa, Southern
Africa, and North Africa. Multiregional
projects accounted for just 4.6 percent of NTF
cumulative total approvals (see Figure 4.14).

Disbursements

Disbursements increased by 9.4 percent from
UA 5.4 million in 2006 to UA 5.9 million in
2007. Cumulative disbursements at December
31, 2007 amounted to UA 194.4 million. In
sum, 58 loans were fully disbursed for a total
amount of UA 188.8 million, representing 97.1
percent of cumulative disbursements.

Southern Africa, and West Africa. In 2007,
total Bank Group approvals for all 5 subregions (excluding multinational projects
and programs) amounted to UA 2.39 billion, allocated as follows: North Africa,
UA 591.9 million; East Africa, UA 576.3
million; Southern Africa, UA 539.6 million; Central Africa, UA 429.5 million; and
West Africa, UA 251.6 million. Approvals
for multinational projects and programs
amounted to UA 193.0 million. The cumulative (1967-2007) loan and grant approvals for the 5 subregions amounted to UA
39.82 billion, while that of multinational
operations stood at UA 1.76 billion (see
Annex |I-7 and Figure 4.4).

North Africa
The North Africa subregion is made up of 6
countries: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania,
Morocco, and Tunisia. Mauritania is an
ADF country and the others are classified

Chapter 005 African Development Bank Group

 

Management's Report Regarding the Effectiveness Date: April 2,-2008

of Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting

The Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall
integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, while
those of the African Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

The financial statements have been audited by the independent accounting firm of KPMG, who were given unrestricted access to all financial
records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes that
all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ report accompanies the
audited financial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal controls over external financial reporting in conformity with the
basis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies identified.
Internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to ongoing scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit and are revised
as considered necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance with
respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances.

The Boards of Directors of the Bank Group have established an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other things, in
their oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group's accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of internal controls.
AUFI, which is comprised entirely of selected members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection of external auditors and
makes a recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors, which in turn makes a recommendation for the approval of the Board
of Governors. AUFI meets periodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance. The
external auditors and the internal auditors regularly meet with AUFI to discuss the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting and any
other matter that may require AUFI's attention.

The Bank's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that the Bank Group maintained effective
internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the Financial Statements for 2007. Management is not aware of any material control
weakness that could affect the reliability of the 2007 financial statements.

 

In addition to providing an audit opinion on the fairness of the financial statements for 2007, the external auditors of the Bank Group conducted an
independent assessment of the Bank Group's internal control framework and their opinion thereon is presented separately in this annual report.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank Group
regarding the effectiveness of internal control over external financial reporting
Year ended 31 December 2007

Scope

We have examined the African Development Bank Group’s internal controls over external financial reporting for the year ended 31
December 2007, based on criteria established in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Management’s responsibilities

The management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for implementing and maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting and for assessment of the effectiveness of such controls. Management has asserted the
effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting for 2007.

Independent Auditors’ responsibilities

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bank Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on our procedures.

We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, issued by the International
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. That standard requires that we plan and perform our procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects, effective internal controls are maintained over financial reporting.

An assurance engagement includes obtaining an understanding of internal controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls, based on the assessed
risk. It also includes performing such other procedures as considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that the evidence we
have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Inherent limitation

A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s system of internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)

Chapter 005 African Development Bank Group

African Development Bank Group

KPMG. Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors
of the African Development Bank Group regarding

the effectiveness of internal control over external financial reporting

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Further, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, the Bank Group, in all material respects, maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting during the year

ended 31 December 2007, based on criteria established in Jnternal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited the financial statements of the African Development Bank, the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Trust
Fund for 2007, in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing, and we have expressed unqualified opinions.

African Development Bank Chapter 005,

This chapter discusses the management of the financial resources of the Bank Group's windows—the African Development
Bank (ADB), the African Development Fund (ADF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)—during the year. It also presents the
Audited Financial Statements for 2007 for the three windows, as well as the ADB and ADF Administrative Budgets for the

Financial Management

Capital Subscription

The authorized capital stock of the Bank
stood at UA 21.87 billion as of December
31, 2007, and has been allocated to regional
and non-regional members in such proportion
so that, when fully subscribed, the regional
group holds 60 percent of the total capital
stock and the non-regional group 40 percent.
At December 31, 2007, members’ subscriptions reached UA 21.69 billion, that is 99.18
percent of the capital stock.

The capital stock is composed of paid-up
and callable capital. The paid-up capital is
the amount of capital payable over a period
determined by the Board of Governors’
resolution for the relevant General Capital
Increase (10 years for the fourth General
Capital Increase and 8 years for the fifth
General Capital Increase). The paid-in capital,
which represents the portion of paid-up capital that has been actually paid, reached UA
2.34 billion. As of December 31, 2007, the
Bank's callable capital was UA 19.34 billion
of which UA 6.66 billion was from countries
rated double-A and higher. The callable
capital is subject to payment as and when
required by the Bank to meet its incurred
obligations, (a) by making or participating
in direct loans out of funds borrowed or
otherwise acquired by the Bank for inclusion
in its ordinary capital resources or in special
resources; or (b) by guaranteeing in whole
or in part, loans made by other entities. It

hat it is not able to meet its financial obligations. There has never been a call on the
callable capital of the Bank.

n accordance with the Shares Transfer Rules,
shares for which payment have become due
and remain outstanding are forfeited after a
rescribed period and offered for subscription

he position of capital subscriptions at
December 31, 2007 is shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital
Stock and Voting Power, which forms part of
he Financial Statements in this Report.

Bank Rating

he rating agencies Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+
rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debt respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
he Bank's strong membership support,
its preferred creditor status, sound capital
adequacy and prudent financial management
and policies.

 

Borrowings

The Bank strives to raise funds from the
capital markets at the lowest possible cost
to support its lending activities. The top
notch credit ratings enjoyed by the Bank
enable it to issue securities at low interest
rates. Its borrowing activities are guided by
client and cashflow requirements, assets
and liability management goals, and risk
management policies.

As at December 31, 2007, the borrowing
portfolio of the Bank stood at UA 6.20 billion.
The Bank is well within its debt policy limits.
The key debt ratios are as follows:

¢ Total debt/total callable capital (max 80
percent): 32.05 percent

¢ Senior debt/non-borrowing members’
callable capital (max 80 percent): 65.04
percent

n December 2006, the ADB Board of
Directors approved for the year 2007, a borrowing program of up to UA 1,015 million
including a UA 140 million component for
he Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for
Africa Initiative (EPSA). In 2007, the Bank
raised UA 724 million from the capital markets at a weighted average cost of 6-month
US Dollar LIBOR minus 32 basis points. In
addition, the Bank raised UA 55 million
under the EPSA initiative.

he highlight of the year was the Bank's first
ransaction in the domestic bond market of
any African country with the raising of ZAR 1.2
illion for a five-year maturity in the domestic
ond market of South Africa. The transaction
is also the first by any supranational in that
market and is listed on the Bond Exchange
of South Africa. The listing enables the Bank

documentation framework that has now been
created by the Bank which is in line with local
financial regulations in South Africa.

During 2007, the Bank also raised funds
through transactions in the public market,
the private placement market, the Uridashi
market and through African currency-linked
bonds.

The Bank maintained its presence in the
public market through a highly successful
five-year maturity inaugural transaction for
an amount of Canadian Dollar 400 million
in the Canadian domestic bond market in
July 2007.

The Bank continues to focus its efforts on the
possibility of issuance in African currencies.
Following the successes of the earlier years,
the Bank concluded offshore transactions
linked to Nigerian Naira, Kenyan Shilling,
Tanzanian Shilling and Ghanaian Cedi in
2007 in addition to the domestic South
African Rand transaction.

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments (net
of repurchase agreements) as of December
31, 2007 totaled UA 5.40 billion, compared
to UA 5.34 billion at the end of 2006.
Investment income for 2007 amounted to UA
238.40 million, or a return of 4.59 percent
on an average liquidity of UA 5.20 billion,
compared to UA 213.82 million in 2006,
or a return of 4.22 percent, on an average
liquidity of UA 5.06 billion.

Effective January 1, 2001, the ADB's liquid
assets were tranched into 3 portfolios,
namely operational portfolio, prudential
portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio, each
with a different benchmark that reflects the
cashflow and risk profile of its assets and
funding sources. These benchmarks are onemonth LIBID for the operational portfolio,
and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR,
resetting on February 1 and August 1 for
the prudential portfolio. The equity-backed

Annual Report 2007

| | 05_Chapter5_UK.indd 72

portfolio is managed against a re-pricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the
Bank's net assets re-pricing uniformly over
a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2007 amounted to UA
18.83 billion. Total outstanding loans, as at
December 31, 2007, was UA 5.54 billion,
UA 249 million higher than the UA 5.29 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2006. This
increase was in spite of prepayments during
the year amounting to UA 199.06 million.
Undisbursed balances at December 31, 2007
otaled UA 1.62 billion, a decrease of UA
408.93 million from December 31, 2006. The
number of active signed loans stood at 276
or a total amount of UA 5.54 billion. Also, at
December 31, 2007, 547 loans amounting
to UA 8.27 billion had been fully repaid. A

Financial Products

Loans. The Bank offers 3 loan products:
variable, floating, and fixed interest rate
loans with a selection of loan currencies,
currently, US Dollars, Euro, Japanese Yen,
and South Africa Rand. To suit the longterm financing needs of borrowers, loans
have a maximum maturity of 20 years,
including a grace period on the repayment
of the principal amount, generally not
exceeding 5 years. For the single currency
variable interest rate loan, the base rate is
determined twice a year, on January 1 and
July 1, and is based on the Bank's average
cost of a designated pool of borrowings
funding the loans in the specific currency.
The base rate for the floating interest rate
loan is derived from the 6-month market
reference rate in the specific currency, for
example, LIBOR, EURIBOR or JIBAR. The
base rate is reset on February 1 and August
1 each year and applies to the 6-month
period following the reset date. For the
fixed interest rate loan, the lending rate in

 

11/04/08 13:39:32 | |each currency is the fixed amortizing swap
rate derived from the 6-month market
reference rates. Borrowers may select from
a number of rate-fixing alternatives, including fixing at each disbursement or after
all disbursements have been completed.
Prior to rate fixing, the currency-specific
floating interest rate applies. The pricing
formula applicable to all 3 loan products
is the same. The applicable rate of interest
is the sum of the chosen base rate plus a
lending spread. Loans to sovereign and
sovereign-guaranteed borrowers enjoy a
lending spread of 40 basis points above
the 6-month market reference rate. For nonsovereign guaranteed borrowers in both
the private and public sector, the lending
spread is computed based on the Bank's
risk-based pricing framework.

 

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector
enterprises can be extended directly or
through a private financial institution (PFI).
In an agency line (AL), the credit risk of the
borrower is borne by the Bank. In addition,
the PFI acts as an agent for the Bank, to
carry out a variety of activities, including,
but not limited to, identifying projects within
certain parameters; appraising such projects
on behalf of the Bank; when approved,
undertaking all of the administrative steps
related to disbursement (billing, collection
of Bank's funds, filing of security); supervising projects, monitoring the performance of
the borrower, submitting reports thereon;
and transmitting amounts related to the
repayment of the loan to the Bank.

 

Guarantees. Through the guarantee
product, the Bank seeks to leverage its
preferred creditor status to assist eligible
borrowers to obtain financing from third
party lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees will also enable borrowers to
obtain financing in their own local currency
where the Bank is not able to provide such
financing directly from its own resources.

| | 05_Chapter5_UK.indd 73

Risk Management Products are
offered to enable borrowers to manage
the market risks associated with their loans
from the Bank, including interest rate, currency, and commodity price risks. These
products assist borrowers to manage their
balance sheets and their changing needs
more efficiently over time. Risk management products such as interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, interest rate caps and collars are available to borrowers at any time
during the life of the loan.

Equity Participation or Quasi
Equity Products. The Bank's ability to
provide risk capital through equity investments is a key element of its resource mobilization role. Even though the Bank cannot
be a majority shareholder in a company,
it can participate in a project by acquiring ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred
stocks, or debentures.

Other Financial Services. |n addition
to the products described above, the Bank
may offer loan syndication and underwriting services through its private sector
window.

Risk Management Policies
and Processes

As a development finance institution, the
African Development Bank seeks to reduce
its exposure to risks that are not essential to
its core business of providing development
finance and related assistance. To this end,
the Bank has adapted its risk management
policies, guidelines and processes to reduce
exposure to interest rate, currency, liquidity,
counterparty, legal and other operational
risks, while maximizing its capacity to assume
credit risks to public and private sector clients,
within approved risk limits.

Note D of the Financial Statements provides
the details regarding the Risk Management
policies and processes applied by the Bank
to manage these risks.

 

African Development Bank Chapter 005,

Financial Results

Since 2006, the Bank has accounted for
distributions to organizations, funds or
institutions for purposes complementary
with the Bank’s mission as grant expenses
in the period such distributions are approved
by the Board of Governors. Prior to 2006,
such distributions were presented as direct
reductions of equity. Due to current expense
treatment of distributions approved by
the Board of Governors, “Income before
transfer of income approved by the Board
of Governors” is separately disclosed on the
income statement, to highlight income from
normal or ordinary operations of the Bank.

The highlights of the Bank's financial performance in 2007 include the following:

e Income before transfers approved by
the Board of Governors increased by
66.81 percent from UA 194.03 million
in 2006 to UA 323.67 million in 2007.
The increase is mainly attributable to
the following factors: a) net write-back
of provision for impairment on loans
and related charges receivable of UA
69.96 million in 2007 compared to a
net charge for provision of UA 51.69
million in 2006, b) an increase of UA
21.24 million in 2007 in the unrealized
gains on derivatives and borrowings for
which fair value option was elected,
and c) a reduction of UA 27.52 million
in the amount of impairment for equity
investments and other receivables.

e Loan income increased by UA 12.92
million, or 3.93 percent, in 2007. The
increase in loan income was mainly
due to a higher average loan balance
during 2007. Investment income also
increased in 2007 by UA 24.57 million,
or 11.49 percent, as a result of higher
average investment balances and higher
yields, but the increase was more than
offset by a UA 50.18 million increase
in borrowing-related charges. In 2007,

Annual Report 2007

73

11/04/08 13:39:33 | |Chapter 005 African Development Bank

the Bank earned income of UA 4.97
million on investments in debt instruments issued by entities in its regional
member countries.

As a result of the arrears clearance
mechanism approved by the Board of
Directors during 2007, the number of
sovereign borrowers in arrears for six
months or more decreased from 6 at
December 31, 2006 to 4 at December
31, 2007. Consequently, there was a
write-back of impairment for losses on
loans and related charges receivable in
2007 compared to a charge for impairment in 2006. At December 31, 2007
total accumulated provision for losses
on principal and charges was UA 364.72
million, which was 6.10 percent of gross
principal and charges receivable at that
date, compared to UA 436.77 million,
or 7.60 percent of gross principal and
charges receivable at December 31,
2006.

Total Bank Group administrative expenses
increased from UA 154.34 million in 2006
to UA 180.65 million in 2007. The Bank's
share of the Bank Group administrative
expenses amounted to UA 42.22 million
for 2007, compared to UA 36.86 million
for 2006. Bank Group administrative
expenses are allocated between the
Bank, the ADF and the NTF based on
a predetermined cost-sharing formula
driven primarily by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators.

For the past several years, the Bank has
earned levels of net income sufficient to
enable not only the further strengthening
of the Bank's reserves position, but also
contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other development initiatives for
Africa. Total reserves plus accumulated

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

NOTE A - OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social
progress of its regional member states. The Bank finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically
in cooperation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in
the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance.
The Bank also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and
social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Development Fund
(ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. Notably, the ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing to the
economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, to promote cooperation and increased international trade particularly
among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the
International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

he significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding and held by
he Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial
asset to the asset's net carrying amount.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.
Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank’s right to receive payment is established.

Functional and Presentation Currencies

he Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries. As a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The Effects of
Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its member counties to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to
one Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency Translation

ncome and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
ranslated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2007
and 2006 are reported in Note V-1. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates. Translation differences
are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing at the time of receipt.
he translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements as the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount at the predetermined rate and the
UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other currencies, the resulting gains or losses are
included in the determination of net income.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever withdrawn
its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. The stability in the membership reflects the fact
that the members are independent African and non-African countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional member countries individually and jointly. Accordingly, as of December
31, 2007, the Bank did not expect to distribute any portion of its net assets due to member country withdrawals.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares. The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter referred
to as “the termination date.” The Bank may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against the member's liabilities
on loans and guarantees due to the Bank. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to
the Bank for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date are outstanding. If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently taken into account when the repurchase
price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price of the shares
would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition, the former
member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would have been
required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price of its shares
was determined.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying a former
member would have adverse consequences for the Bank's financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the risk had passed,
and indefinitely if appropriate. Furthermore, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered by the Bank for purchase
by eligible member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be
made until six months after the termination date.

If the Bank were to terminate its operations, all liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and then, if
necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before any distribution could be made to any member country. Such distribution is subject
to the prior decision of the Board of Governors of the Bank and would be based on the pro-rata share of each member country.

Employee Benefits

1) Pension Obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit
payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An
actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching
retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension
is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year they
occur. Past service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, otherwise, amortized on a straight-line
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts payable in
the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank’s defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of plan assets
and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

2) Post-Employment Medical Benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to eligible
former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to the post-retirement healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a
minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and
are accrued over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and
included in the statement of income and expenses. The MBP Board, an independent body created by the Bank, determines the adequacy
of the contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual rights
or obligations.

1) Financial Assets
The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its investments
at initial recognition.

i) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement and gains and losses are reported in the income statement
in the period in which they arise. The investments in the trading portfolio are acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the
short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ii) Loans and Receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. Loans and receivables are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank's management has the positive intention and
ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments
are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

iv) Available-for-Sale Financial Assets
The Bank has classified equity investments over which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future. Gains
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized directly in equity, until the
financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in equity is recognized
in profit or loss.

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when
cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value
plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or
where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are reported at market rates. The Bank
receives securities purchased under resale agreements, monitors the fair value of the securities and if necessary may require additional
collateral.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily

convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon acquisition
of three months or less.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

2) Financial Liabilities

i) Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity purposes. The
Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest rates. The Bank's
borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and
liability management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding. In addition to
long and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes only.
Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost with interest expense
determined using the effective interest method. Borrowing expenses are recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of
issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using the effective interest method. Certain of the Bank's borrowings
have been obtained from the governments of some member countries of the Bank and are interest/free. In accordance with IAS 20
— "Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance”, the benefit of borrowing at subsidized rates from
member countries’ governments has not been recognized through the imputation of interest expense in the financial statements.

ii) Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at
inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank primarily applies fair value designation to borrowings which have
been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the borrowing at fair value through
profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch which would otherwise have arisen if the borrowings
were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair value.

 

iii) Other Liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost. The
amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or cancelled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging
purposes. These instruments include cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the
interest rate or currency characteristics or both of the debt the Bank issues. This economic relationship is established on the date the
debt is issued, and maintained throughout the terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is reported as part of
borrowing expenses.

Although IAS 39 allows hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the Bank has elected not to apply hedge accounting to any qualifying hedging relationship, but rather classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all changes in fair
value recognized in the income statement. When the criteria for the application of the fair value option are met, then the related debt
is also carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and measured at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Impairment of Financial Assets

1) Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets

with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005,

which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset or
a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has an
impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated.

f the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the
inancial asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment arises from delays that may be
experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the
non-collectibility, in whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

he carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment
oss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

nterest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.

2) Available-for-Sale Assets

he Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
below its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair
value, net of any impairment loss previously recognized in profit or loss, is reclassified from equity to the income statement. Impairment
losses recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value are reversed through equity.

 

if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an available-for-sale equity instrument that is carried at cost
because its fair value cannot be reliably measured, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying
amount of the impaired equity instrument and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the current market
rate of return for a similar equity instrument. Once recognized, impairment losses on these equity instruments carried at cost are not
reversed.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and reported on a net basis when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For financial assets with inactive markets or
unlisted securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs.
These include the use of recent arm's length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been
valued using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at
which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily
determinable. Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realized in
a sale might be different from the fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.
Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank's borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques based on
discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread. Credit spreads are
obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank's new public bond issues.
The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated
derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation
models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews.

Equity Investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments carried at fair value are periodically
fair valued both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed
enterprises is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's equity participations is estimated as the Bank's percentage
ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative Financial Instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible
or valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses valuation tools based on industry
standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use market-sourced inputs such
as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank's financial instruments
are subject to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. For
multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end
variable lending rate in that currency, adjusted for impairment. For all loans not impaired, fair value adjustments are made to reflect
expected loan losses. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note |.

Day One Profit and Loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consideration
given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that instrument is
evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging)
or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition, a gain or loss may not
be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate data solely from observable markets. The Bank only recognizes
gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time) that market participants would
consider in setting a price. The gain or loss is amortized over the life of the applicable borrowing on a straight-line basis.

Investment in Associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF is considered an associate of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank
has significant influence, but not control, over the entity's financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and
the ADF is described in more detail in Note J. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased
to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's share of the profit or
loss of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred
between 1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2007, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1% of the economic interest
in the capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation
in 1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank's investment in the ADF. Furthermore,
in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity
method are limited to the investment's original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can
be measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference between
cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Buildings: 15-20 years

- Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years
Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
Motor vehicles: 5 years

The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs
to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between proceeds and the asset's carrying
amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets
is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

Leases
The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain other regional
member countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made
under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and
receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an
operating lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is
recognized as an expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

 

Transfers Approved by the Board of Governors

In accordance with the Agreement establishing the Bank, the Board of Governors is the sole authority for approving allocations from
income to surplus account or distributions to other entities for development purposes. Surplus consists of earnings from prior years which
are retained by the Bank until further decision is made on their disposition or the conditions of transfer for specified uses have been
met. Distributions for development purposes, referred to as “Board of Governors’ Approved Transfers”, are reported as expenses on the
Income Statement in the year of approval. Transfers for development purposes may be funded from amounts previously transferred to
surplus account or from the current year's income.

Retained Earnings

Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior year's income, balance of amounts allocated to surplus
after deducting transfers approved by the Board of Governors, unallocated current year net income, and expenses recognized directly in
equity as required by IFRS.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

In the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS, management makes certain estimates, assumptions and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual
results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant
judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Significant Judgments
The Bank's accounting policies require that assets and liabilities be designated at inception into different accounting categories. Such
decisions require significant judgment and relate to the following circumstances:

Held-for-Trading - \n classifying financial assets or liabilities as “trading”, the Bank has determined that such assets or liabilities meet its
description and set criteria for classification as such.

Fair Value through Profit and Loss - \n designating financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank has determined that such assets or liabilities meet the criteria for this classification.

Held-to-Maturity - The Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable
payments and fixed maturity as held-to-maturity. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention and ability to hold such
investments to maturity.

2) Significant estimates
The Bank also uses estimates for its financial statements in the following circumstances:

Impairment Losses on Loans and Advances - At each financial reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment. The
Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is
determined by discounting expected future cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the
loan’s net carrying amount. Determining the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If
the Bank determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a group
of loans with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of
loans may include observable data indicating that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or
national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when
scheduling its future cash flows. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows
are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined by using
valuation techniques. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All valuation models are calibrated to ensure that
outputs reflect actual data and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, valuation models use only observable data; however,
areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in
assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

 

Impairment of Available-for-Sale Equity Investments - The Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when
there has been a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below the carrying amount. The determination of what is significant or
prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates any evidence of deterioration in the financial health of the
investee, industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flows.

NOTE C - THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
REPORTING STANDARDS

In 2007, the Bank adopted International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and related amendments to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, Presentation of Financial Statements — Capital Disclosures. IFRS 7 supersedes IAS
30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institution and |AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and
introduces new and enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures about exposures to risks arising from financial instruments and
how the Bank manages those risks. The amendments to IAS 1 require new disclosures on the Bank’s objectives, policies and processes
for managing capital. The new disclosures are presented in Note D.

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations have been issued and will become effective for periods after December 31, 2007. IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which
becomes effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009, replaces the segmental reporting requirements of
IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements with those used internally by management in the allocation of resources and assessing performance. The amendments to IAS 1 require the Bank to present in separate
statements, changes in equity related to its shareholders and those related to comprehensive income (i.e., non-shareholder-related
components), including related reclassification adjustments of those components. It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as
at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial statements when the Bank applies an accounting policy
retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement. None of these new standards or amendments is expected to have a significant
impact on the Bank's financial statements.

On February 14, 2008, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1. The amendments
require an entity to classify as part of its equity those financial instruments that it issues that are either (a) puttable financial instruments,
or (b) financial instruments or components of financial instruments that impose an obligation to deliver to another party a pro-rata share
of its net assets only on liquidation, if certain criteria are met. Prior to these amendments, such financial instruments were to be classified
as liabilities. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2009, with early adoption permitted.

Subscriptions by the member countries to the Bank's capital described in Note B are puttable financial instruments that meet the requirements for equity classification under the amended standards. While the standards prior to the amendments required liability classification
by the issuer of puttable financial instruments, the Bank has always reported the subscriptions by the member countries to its capital as
equity. Under the Agreement establishing the Bank, such instruments provide an equal and residual right to its member countries that are
subordinate to the rights of its creditors. The equity classification requirements under the amended standards are fully consistent with and
confirm the Bank’s prior classification of these instruments as equity. The amendments to IAS 32 and IAS 1 relating to puttable financial
instruments were issued after the balance sheet date but before the approval of the financial statements. The Bank has opted to early
adopt the amendments. The application of these amended standards had no effects on the Bank’s financial statements.

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

In carrying out its development mandate, the Bank seeks to maximize its capacity to assume core business risks resulting from its lending
and investing operations while at the same time minimizing its non-core business risks (market risk, counterparty risk, and operational
risk) that are incidental but nevertheless critical to the execution of its mandate.

The degree of risk the Bank is willing to assume to achieve its development mandate is limited by its risk-bearing capacity. This institutional risk appetite is embodied in the Bank's capital adequacy policy and its commitment to maintain a prudent risk profile consistent

with the highest credit rating.

The policies, processes and procedures by which the Bank manages its risk profile continually evolve in response to market, credit,
product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management oversight is assured by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors,

Annual Report 2007

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

which is chaired by the President. In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors regularly review trends
in the Bank's risk profiles and performance to ensure compliance with the underlying policies.

The guiding principles by which the Bank manages its core and non-core risks are governed by the General Authority on the Bank's
Financial Products and Services (the FPS Authority) and the General Authority on Asset Liability Management (the ALM Authority).

The FPS Authority provides the framework under which the Bank develops and implements financial products and services for its borrowers’ and separate guidelines which prescribe the rules governing the management of credit and operational risk for the Bank's sovereign
and non-sovereign loan and equity investment portfolios.

The ALM Authority is the overarching framework through which Management has been vested with the authority to manage the Bank's
financial assets and liabilities within defined parameters. The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Bank's
interest rate risk, currency exchange rate risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk. The ALM Authority covers the
Bank's entire array of ALM activities such as debt-funding operations and investment of liquid resources. It also includes the interest rate
and currency risk management aspects of the Bank's lending and equity investment operations.

Under the umbrella of the FPS Authority and the ALM Authority, the President is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the other
oversight and control organ of the Bank’s risk management activities. It is the Bank's most senior management forum on risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. Among ALCO’s key functions, it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and
risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms country and project credit risk
ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups that report on specific issues
including country risk, non-sovereign credit risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appropriate business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those
policies and guidelines.

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Bank.

Credit Risk
Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the
Bank arising essentially from its lending and treasury operations.

The Bank manages three principal sources of credit risk: (i) sovereign credit risk on its public sector portfolio; (ii) non-sovereign credit risk
on its portfolio of private sector, non-sovereign and enclave projects; and (iii) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury investments and derivative transactions. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes,
which are described in more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. In extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Bank. The Bank manages country credit risk through financial policies and
lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessments. These include the assessment
of the country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its sociopolitical conditions and future growth prospects.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The foundation of the Bank's credit risk management framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal credit
risk rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the Bank's statistical loss expectations as shown in the following table.

Risk Rating Description Risk Class International Equivalent
| Excellent Very Low Risk A - BBB
2 Very Good Low Risk BB
3 oad Moderate Risk B
4 Fair
5 Acceptable eB
6 Marginal High Risk GEG
Z Special Attention
8 Substandard ie
5 areal Very High Risk CEG
10 Known Loss

These sovereign risk credit ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance,
debt sustainability, sociopolitical factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive
a composite sovereign country risk index and a composite non-sovereign country risk index which in turn are converted into separate
country risk rating for the sovereign and non-sovereign portfolios. These country risk ratings are validated against the average country
tisk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized international bodies. The ALCO reviews the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and to approve changes in loss
provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

In 2007, the overall risk profile of the Bank's sovereign guaranteed portfolio improved slightly, mainly due to the combined effect of
improvement in the weighted average credit rating of certain regional member countries and the Bank's increased exposure to high
graded countries.

The portfolio's weighted-average risk rating showed a marginal strengthening from 2.93 at the end of 2006 to 2.67 at the end of 2007.
The distribution of the sovereign portfolio across the Bank’s five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

Risk Profile of the Outstanding Sovereign-Guaranteed Loan Portfolio

Very Low Risk Low Risk Moderate Risk High Risk Very High Risk
2007 37% 31% 8% 15% 9%
2006 28% 35% 10% 17% 10%
2005 26% 26% 18% 17% 13%
2004 28% 28% 21% 11% 12%
2003 25% 32% 21% 16% 6%

It is the Bank's policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges with respect to any Bank Group credit becomes 30
days overdue, no new loans to that member country, or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board
of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries,
disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid. These
countries also become ineligible in the subsequent billing period for a waiver of 0.50% on the commitment fees charged on qualifying
undisbursed loans.

Annual Report 2007

11/04/08 13:40:49 | |African Development Bank Chapter 005,

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of preferred creditor status and rigorously monitors the exposure on non-performing
sovereign borrowers, some countries have experienced difficulties to service their debts to the Bank on a timely basis. As previously
described, the Bank makes provisions for impairment in its sovereign loan portfolio commensurate with the assessment of the incurred
loss in such portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk
capital cushion for sovereign credit risks. The Bank's capital adequacy policy articulates differentiated risk capital requirements for all
credit-sensitive assets (loans and equity investments) plus contingent liabilities (guarantees and client risk management products) in
each risk class'. At the end of 2007, the Bank's public sector loan portfolio used up 37% of the Bank's total risk capital based on the
Bank's capital adequacy framework. This compares with 45% at the end of 2006 and reflects the improvement in the composition of the
sovereign portfolio. The Bank defines risk capital as the sum of paid-in capital plus accumulated reserves net of translation adjustments.
Callable capital is not included in the computation of risk capital.

2) Non-Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to enclave projects it does not benefit from full sovereign guarantees. The Bank may
also provide financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee.

To assess the credit risk of non-sovereign projects or facilities, the Bank uses a similar uniform internal credit risk rating as for sovereign
projects. However, these internal credit ratings are derived on the basis of four major groups of factors.

The first factor involves the overall evaluation and assessment of the project company’s financial strength. This assessment looks at: 1)
capacity of the project to generate sufficient cash flow to service its debt; 2) the company's operating performance and profitability; 3)
the project company’s capital structure, financial flexibility and liquidity positions.

Secondly, the following, four main non-financial parameters are analyzed: 1) the outlook of the industry in which the project company
operates; 2) the competitive position of the project company within the industry; 3) the strength of the project company’s management
with particular emphasis on its ability to deal with adverse conditions; 4) the quality of the information on which the analysis is based.

Thirdly, the risk factors that consider the structure of the facility in terms of maturity, the existence of third party guarantee, the value of
any assigned collateral, and other credit enchancement are extensively examined.

Finally, the project company’s risk rating is adjusted to reflect the overall host country risk rating.

All new non-sovereign projects require a minimum initial credit rating and undergo rigorous project approval. The ALCO reviews the
non-sovereign credit rating of each project on a quarterly basis and may recommend changes if justified by evolving country and project
conditions.

In 2007, the Bank increased its investments in the non-sovereign loan and equity portfolios. The weighted-average risk rating had detetiorated marginally from 3.52 at the end of 2006 to 3.82 at year-end 2007. The distribution of the non-sovereign portfolio across the
Bank's five credit risk classes is shown in the table below.

 

' Reflecting its higher risk operating environment and unavoidable portfolio concentrations, the Bank requires risk capital backing that is three to ten times more
conservative than BiS commercial banking standards. Very low risk = 25%, low risk = 28%, moderate risk = 35%, high risk = 50%, very high risk = 75%, and equity
investments = 100%.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

 

In compliance with the revised IFRS, the Bank no longer makes general provisions to cover the expected losses in the performing nonsovereign portfolio. For the non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment, or incurred loss, on each loan. At the end of 2007, the impairment allowance to cover the incurred loss on impaired loans in the
non-sovereign portfolio decreased marginally to UA 12.13 million as a comparison to UA 15.40 million in 2006 because of the reduction
in the size of the portfolio of impaired non-sovereign loans.

In addition to private sector lending, the Bank makes equity investments in private sector projects, either directly or through investment
funds. To the extent possible, equity investments are carried at fair value. In the event that the fair value of an equity investment cannot
be reliably determined, it is carried at amortized cost, and periodically assessed for impairment. The Bank recognizes loss provision based
on accepted impairment tests measured against the carrying cost of the equity investment. At the end of 2007, the provision for impairment on equity investment was equivalent to 6.58% of the outstanding equity portfolio.

To cover potential unexpected credit related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital cushion for non-sovereign credit risks. At the end of 2007, the Bank's non-sovereign portfolio required as risk capital approximately
5.3% of the Bank’s total on-balance sheet risk capital sources, slightly above the level at the end of 2006. This was still well below the
limit of 20% determined by the Bank for total non-sovereign operations.

Credit Exposure Limits

The Bank operates a system of exposure limits to ensure the development of an adequately diversified portfolio. The Bank manages credit
tisk at the global level (combined sovereign guaranteed and non-sovereign guaranteed portfolios) by ensuring that in the aggregate, the
total country exposure limit does not exceed 15% of the maximum sustainable portfolio. The maximum sustainable portfolio is determined as the largest outstanding portfolio (outstanding loans plus potential new lending) that can be supported by the current level of
risk capital applying the Bank's capital adequacy policy. Each specific country limit is based on the economic potential of the country and
perceived risk level. Country exposure limits are reviewed annually and are used as a risk-based benchmark to plan the Bank's mediumterm country assistance strategies.

The credit exposure on the non-sovereign portfolio is further managed by limiting exposures to certain industry sectors, equity investments and single obligor. In addition, the Bank generally requires a range of securities and guarantees from project sponsors to partially
mitigate the credit risk for direct private sector loans.

3) Counterparty Credit Risk

In the normal course of business, the Bank utilizes various financial instruments to meet the needs of its borrowers, manage its exposure
to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to temporarily invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these
financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable to meet its obligation
to the Bank.

Given the nature of the Bank’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Bank minimizes

this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005,

Counterparties must meet the Bank's minimum credit rating requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For
local currency operations, less stringent minimum credit rating limits are permitted in order to provide adequate availability of investment
opportunities and derivative counterparties for implementing appropriate risk management strategies. ALCO approves counterparties that
are rated below the minimum rating requirements.

Counterparties are classified as investment counterparties, derivative counterparties, and trading counterparties. Their ratings are closely
monitored.

Trading counterparties are generally rated A/A2.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

   

The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa; money market mutual funds.
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3; and enters into collateralized securities repurchase agreements.

As arule, the Bank executes an ISDA master agreement and netting agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any
transactions. Derivative counterparties are required to be rated AA-/Aa3 by at least two approved rating agencies or A- for counterparties
with whom the Bank has entered into a collateral exchange agreement. Approved transactions with derivative counterparties include
swaps, forwards, options and other over-the-counter derivatives.

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Bank operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 8% of the Bank’s total risk capital for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty
credit exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure
methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment and derivative portfolios continues to be predominantly AA or higher rated.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

To cover potential unexpected credit losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital
cushion for counterparty credit risks in line with the current BIS standards. At the end of 2007, the Bank's counterparty credit portfolio
including all investments and derivative instruments required as risk capital just over 2.0% of the Bank's total on-balance sheet risk
capital sources. This is a minor change from 2.2% in 2006.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. The Bank's principal
iquidity risk management objective is to hold sufficient liquid resources to enable it to meet all probable cash flow needs for a rolling
1-year horizon without additional financing from the capital markets for an extended period. In order to minimize this risk, the Bank
maintains a prudential minimum level of liquidity (PML) based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling one-year period. The
PML is updated quarterly and computed as the sum of four components: 1) 1-year debt service payments; 2) 1-year projected net loan
disbursements (loans disbursed less repayments) if greater than zero; 3) loan equivalent value of committed guarantees; and 4) undisbursed equity investments.

0 strike an optimal balance between generating adequate investment returns and holding securities that can be easily sold for cash
if required, the Bank divides its investment portfolio into tranches with different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank's core
iquidity portfolio is invested in relatively liquid securities that can be readily sold if required. In addition to the core portfolio, the Bank
maintains a second tranche of liquidity that is always invested in the most highly liquid securities to cover its expected operational cash
low needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and borrowings with embedded options are included in the computation of the size of the
operational tranche of liquidity. A third tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the Bank's equity resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed
income securities designated as “held-to-maturity” investments (HTM). Only HTM investments with a remaining maturity of one year or
less are considered as liquid investments in the determination of the Bank's minimum liquidity requirements.

Currency Risk

Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. To promote stable growth in its risk bearing capacity, the Bank's principal currency risk management objective is to protect its risk capital from translation risk due to fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates by matching the currency composition of its net assets to the currency composition of the SDR (UA).
The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency exchange exposures by requiring liabilities in any
one currency to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds of its borrowings (after swap activities) in the same currencies in which they were borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid creating new currency
mismatches, the Bank requires its borrowers to service their loans in the currencies disbursed.

Because a large part of its balance sheet is funded by equity resources, which are denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to the
SDR), the Bank has a net asset position that is potentially exposed to translation risk when currency exchange rates fluctuate. The Bank's
policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of the value of its net worth measured in Units of Account by matching, to the extent
possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR (the Unit of Account). In line with this policy,
throughout 2007 the Bank's currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band of the risk-neutral position in each of the currencies
making up the SDR composition. In keeping with the Bank's currency risk management policy, spot currency transactions are carried out
to realign the net assets to the SDR basket each time there is a revision to the SDR currency composition. As result of these policies and
practices, despite sharp movements in the values of the major currencies during the year, the Bank experienced translation adjustments
of less than 0.20% of net assets (2006: gain less than 0.10%).

The Bank also hedges its exposure to adverse movements on currency exchange rates on its administrative expenses. The distribution of
the currencies of the Bank's recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of expenses in Euros, USD and Tunisian
Dinar. For 2007, the Bank's strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to cover the estimated currency composition of
expenses mitigated the unfavorable impact of those currencies movements during the year.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis

As described in the previous section, the Bank manages its currency risk exposure by matching, to the extent possible, the currency
composition of its net assets with the currency basket of the SDR. The SDR is composed of a basket of four currencies, namely the US
dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and Pound sterling. The weight of each currency in the basket is reviewed by the International Monetary Fund
every five years and the last revision became effective on January 1, 2006. The SDR rate represents the sum of the interest rate of each
currency that is determined based on the weight and the representative exchange rate and interest rate of each currency.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the Bank's net assets to currency fluctuations due to movements in the exchange rate of
the currencies in the SDR basket as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The sensitivity analysis shown assumes a separate
10% appreciation/depreciation for each currency in the basket against the US dollar. Due to a moderate change in the African currency
holdings from 2006 to 2007, the 2007 table also includes the effect of a 10% appreciation/depreciation of each African currency against
the SDR. Under the different scenarios, the currency risk management strategy of the Bank shows a minimal change in net assets as a
result of currency mismatches.

Annual Report 2007Interest Rate Risk

African Development Bank Chapter 005,

The Bank’s interest rate risk sensitivity is comprised of two elements: 1) the sensitivity of the interest margin between the rate the Bank
earns on its assets and the cost of the borrowings funding such assets; and 2) the sensitivity of the income on assets funded by equity
resources to changes in interest rates. The Bank’s principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net
interest margin that is not overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates, but yet adequately responsive to general market

trends.

Interest Rate Risk on Assets Funded by Debt
Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank seeks to generate a stable net interest margin on assets
funded by debt by matching the interest rate characteristics of each class of assets with those of the corresponding liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “variable rate loans”. The interest rate on these loans resets semi-annually based on the average cost
of a dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings. These pools are funded with a mix of fixed rate and floating rate borrowings to provide borrowers with broadly stable interest rates that gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds pass-through formulation
incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank's pool-based loans has traditionally helped to minimize the interest rate sensitivity
of the net interest margin on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of declining demand for this product in favor of market-based loans,
the Bank is carefully managing the gradual winding down of the designated funding pools.

Since 1997, the Bank offers fixed and floating rate loans whose interest rate is directly linked to market interest rates (market-based
loans). For the market-based loan products, the Bank's net interest margin is preserved by using swaps to align the interest rate sensitivity
of the loans with that of the Bank's underlying funding reference (six-month Libor floating rate). The Bank may also provide borrowers
with risk management products such as swaps to modify the currency and interest rate terms of its market-based loan products. Although
it retains the credit risks of the borrower, the Bank eliminates the associated market risk on these risk management products by simultaneously laying off market risks with an approved derivative counterparty.

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments within
limits around benchmarks that replicate the interest rate characteristics of the underlying funding for each portfolio tranche. The portfolio
of liquid assets funded by borrowings is currently divided into two tranches to reflect the different business purposes and underlying

funding. The core part of the investment

ortfolio is held to comply with the Bank's liquidity policy and uses a six-month Libor floating

rate benchmark. The operational liquidity portfolio is managed to meet projected operational cash flow needs and uses a one-month

Libor floating rate benchmark.

The Bank diversifies the sources of its fun
for one of its pool-based loan products,
floating rate in one of the Bank’s active c

ing by issuing debt in a variety of markets and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding is required
e Bank protects its net interest margin by simultaneously swapping all new borrowings into
urrencies on a standard six-month Libor rate reference. Where the Bank issues structured debt,

the Bank simultaneously enters into a swap with matching terms to synthetically create the desired six-month Libor-based floating
rate funding. For risk management purposes, callable funding is considered as one alternative to issuing short-term debt such as Euro

Commercial Paper. The Bank manages re

inancing risk by limiting the amount of debt that will mature or is potentially callable within

one year to 25% of the outstanding debt portfolio.

le of the assets funded by equity resources with the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the

net interest margin to fluctuations in market interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the assets
funded by the Bank's equity resources (fixed rate loans and investments) to match a repricing profile benchmark. The Bank's repricing
profile benchmark is a 10-year ladder whereby a uniform 10% of the Bank’s assets funded by equity reprice in each year. Using this
benchmark, the Bank's net interest margin on assets funded by equity tends to track a ten-year moving average of 10-year maturity SDR
interest rates. At the end of 2007 and 2006, the Bank’s overall repricing profile was closely aligned to the benchmark in almost all annual
buckets. For net assets repricing within one year, the Bank had a manageable gap relative to the benchmark.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

Net Interest Margin Sensitivity

The table below details the repricing gap by currency as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A parallel upward shift in the
SDR curve of 100 bps would have generated a maximum loss of UA 8.0 million and UA 4.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

 

(UA millions) 2006
USD 209
EUR 156
GBP 70
JPY 44
Total repricing gap 479
Loss due to a 100bps upwards shift in the SDR curve 4.80

 

Fair Value Sensitivity

Movements in interest rates also have an impact on the values of assets and liabilities that are reported in the financial statements
at fair value through profit or loss. The table below shows the effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/- 100bps of each of the
currencies in the trading investment portfolio and the borrowings and derivative portfolios as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. However, due to the low level of interest rates across the Japanese Yen yield curve, the sensitivity analysis for assets and liabilities
denominated in Japanese Yen reflect a parallel movement in the yield curve of +/- 20 bps.

Prepayment Risk

In addition to the two principal sources of interest rate risk described above, the Bank is exposed to prepayment risk on loans committed
before 1997. Although the Bank is unable to charge a prepayment penalty on such older loans, in practice the level of prepayments has
generally been within acceptable levels. In 2003 and 2004, however, driven by low market interest rates, contracting credit spreads for
emerging market borrowers and enhanced debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total loan prepayments increased sharply
to UA 471 million and UA 542 million, respectively. In 2005, prepayments of pre-1997 loans declined sharply to UA 70 million, due in
large part to increased market interest rates. For all market-based loans issued since 1997, the Bank protects itself from prepayment risk
by linking the prepayment penalty to the cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates. In 2006, total prepayments of UA 298
million included an amount of UA 192 million in respect of market-based floating rate loans, while in 2007, total prepayment amounted
to UA 199 million, of which 98% related to market-based loans.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005

Operational Risk

he Bank defines operational risks to include all aspects of risk-related exposure other than those falling within the scope of credit,
market and liquidity risks including specifically the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems
or from external events and reputational risk.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is also exposed to controls and operational risks arising from its systems, functions and interdependencies among its departments, which could impact broadly its activities with a possible consequence of operational losses. There
are also many interdependencies among risk factors that may result in an operational risk loss.

n the past, the Bank Group has relied almost exclusively upon internal controls within departments, although not necessarily identified as
managing operational risk, for its internal controls and operational risk management. The evolving best practice is for specific structures
and methods to be dedicated for managing and coordinating operational risks. Following approval by the Board of Directors in 2004,
he Bank established an Internal Control Unit (ICU) to develop assessments and measure areas of operational risk in the Bank in line
with the evolving best practices. The Bank also adopted and commenced in 2005, the implementation of the COSO control framework
to regularly evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls in all significant business operations.

 

he implementation of Operational Risk Management is being done in phases: the first phase focused on the documentation and testing
of controls around financial reporting. Management attestation on the adequacy of internal controls was published in the annual reports
or the first time in 2006. Phase two of the implementation commenced in 2007 and is extending the COSO framework to other areas
of operational risk management.

 

here are other initiatives or activities in the other areas of the Bank Group that are complementing the work on operational risk management and controls including:

Effects of Recent Developments in the Financial Markets

As a result of its prudent risk management policies and practices, the impact on the Bank of the recent turbulence in the world financial
markets related in large part to losses on sub-prime mortgage loans and related derivatives have been insignificant. With regard to the
funding activities, there has been no adverse effect on the Bank's ability to borrow at very attractive rates, consistent with the Bank's solid
financial position as evidenced by the continued uniform top rating by all the major rating agencies. Consequently, the Bank continues
to be well placed to play its intermediation role in support of the development financing needs of its member countries. With regard to
investing activities, the Bank's investment guidelines and practices have helped to ensure a very limited exposure to financial instruments
backed by sub-prime mortgages and other risky asset classes. At December 31, 2007, the Bank held an asset-backed commercial paper
issued by a SIV-lite with exposure to sub-prime mortgages. This investment amounted to USD 50 million or UA 31.64 million, representing
0.26% of the Bank’s total assets or 0.67% of total equity. The estimated loss to the Bank on such asset-backed commercial paper has
been provided for in these financial statements.

NOTE F - TREASURY INVESTMENTS

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, crosscurrency swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money
market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum credit rating of A. Overthe-counter (OTC) options on government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does
not exceed 1 year, and such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Cross-currency and
interest rate swaps including asset swap transactions are only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with
minimum credit ratings of AA-/Aa3 at the time of the transaction.

The Bank uses external managers in the management of certain of its liquid assets, in accordance with the Bank’s Asset and Liability
Management Guidelines. At December 31, 2007, investments under external management were UA 154.85 million (2006: UA 120.39
million). These amounts were included in the held-for-trading portfolio below.

At December 31, 2007, the Bank had no securities sold under repurchase agreements (Repos). At December 31, 2006, Repos with a nominal
value of UA 877.83 million and a market value including accrued interest of UA 879.41 million were outstanding on the balance sheet date.
Securities pledged as collateral outstanding at December 31, 2006 had a carrying value of UA 757.49 million. The nominal value of securities
sold under repurchase agreements, but not yet settled and therefore not requiring collateral to be pledged at December 31, 2006 was UA 117.64

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure ie. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no open positions with respect to the
forward exchange transactions.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases
authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making
their payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local currency;
or

2) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable, non
interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth

anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the Fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional members — five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual
installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to the eighth installments shall
be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

NOTE | - LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other freely
convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount
disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically
the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended
for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank's own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis
points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency variable terms or retain the terms of
their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other
terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1, 1997, the Bank
has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum of two components,
namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on
January 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank's selected reference interest
rate in each market. The Bank’s standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR
and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset
date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization
schedule.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate
to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains
unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank's assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be
financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2007, irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks
on undisbursed loans amounted to UA 1.27 million (2006: UA 8.09 million).

Also, the Bank may provide guarantees for securities issued by an entity eligible for the Bank's loans. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the borrower incurs the underlying financial obligation and are called when a guaranteed party demands payment under
the guarantee. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Bank had no outstanding guarantee to any entity.

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in Associate: ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African countries, and to
provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the
original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date.
Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected
by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share of
the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a
cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December
31, 2007 amounted to UA 135.85 million (2006: UA 114.56 million), representing 73.06 percent (2006: 71.39 percent) of the shareable
administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
provides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants
in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the
participants. At December 31, 2007, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.86% (2006: 0.93%).

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in note V-2, the net asset value of ADF which
is the basis for determining the value of the Banks investment in the Fund continue to decline resulting in impairment loss on the Bank's
investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations plus disbursed and
outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points and are therefore due for MDRI
loan cancellation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies
that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is
to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The
Bank's equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role
in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which
also have significant economic merit.

Although the Bank is allowed to take equity positions of up to twenty five percent (25%) the Bank currently holds less than 20% of the
total equity capital of each institution in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies
in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’
Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29, 2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up capital and reserves and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building.
The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005

owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments

are included in the income statement.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank’s owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for
the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third
party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.
At December 31, 2007, the book value of such assets is not significant.

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

It is the Bank's policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital resources to 80 percent of
the callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both senior and subordinated
debt to 80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries. At December 31, 2007, total borrowings amounted to UA
6,198.87 million (2006: UA 5,870.47 million) comprising senior debt and subordinated debt amounting to UA 5,530.59 million (2006:
UA 5,178.74 million) and UA 668.28 million (2006: UA 691.73 million), respectively. As of the same date, the ratio of senior debt to
the non-borrowing members’ callable capital of UA 8,503.17 million (2006: UA 8,533.51 million) was 65.04 percent (2006: 60.69 percent). Also at December 31, 2007, the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital of UA 19,341.63 million (2006:
UA 19,436.76 million) was 32.05 percent (2006: 30.20 percent). At December 31, 2007, borrowings with embedded callable options
amounted to UA 316.50 million (2006: UA 381.05 million). The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities
to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities and to lower its funding costs.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings
are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the two currencies
in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate payment
obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2007 was UA 5,226.28 million
(2006: UA 4,823.65 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December
31, 2007 was UA 5,106.32 million (2006: UA 4,748.81 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional
amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net gain of UA 21.24 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December
31, 2007 (2006: UA 10.67 million). This included a gain of UA 3.00 million which was attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk
during the year ended December 31, 2007. Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank's credit spread versus
LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2007, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses to date
were UA 119.96 million (2006: losses of UA 74.64 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY
Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The Bank is
not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May
29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million
shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into
paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were
allocated to the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the
total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the
authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005

The Bank's capital as at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows:

(UA thousands) 2006
Capital Authorized (in shares of UA 10 000 each) 21,870,000
Less: Unsubscribed (75,463)
Subscribed Capital 21,794,537
Less: Callable Capital (19,436,756)
Paid-up Capital 2,357,781
Shares to be issued upon payment of future installments (51,879)
Add: Amounts paid in advance 328
2,306,230
Less: Amounts in arrears (3,168)
Capital at December 31 2,303,062

 

 

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 176.84 million at December 31, 2007, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing
the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 41.93 million callable,
and UA 5.99 million paid-up shares) were held as treasury shares of the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply
for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption
pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state
declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have
been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with
the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore,
pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia
to interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state's Official Development
Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries
were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed
at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies
to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

NOTE Q - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself. The ADF
and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is
driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance sheet sizes for non-operational
expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF's gross income.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

(UA thousands) 2006
Personnel expenses 123,234

Included in general administrative expenses is an amount of UA 4.65 million (2006: UA 3.91 million) incurred under operating lease
agreements for offices in Tunisia and in certain other regional member countries.

At the balance sheet date, the Bank had outstanding commitments under operating leases which fall due as follows:

(UA thousands) 2006
Within one year 3,941
In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,285
Total 6,226

 

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to three (3) years and rentals are fixed for an average of one (1) year.
Leases may be extended for periods that are no longer than the original term of the leases.

NOTE R - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on
a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of 6 months service
without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November
2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee
contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child
benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost
associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and has been recorded in 2004. Also, new members from the local field
offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million were reported in the 2007 financial
statements. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the
determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution,
but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the
provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s liabilities. At December
31, 2007, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the
following objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World

Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17, 2002
and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute a percentage of
their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing of the MBP. Contribution
rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children, range between 0.70 percent to a
maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees
and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are
deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are
eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependants.

In accordance with IAS 19, and based on actuarial valuations, the pension and post employment medical benefit expenses for 2007 and
2006 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined (the Bank Group) comprised the following:

Staff Retirement Plan Medical Benefit Plan
(UA millions) 2006
Current service cost — gross 3.87
Less: estimated employee contributions (0.97)
Net current service cost 2.90
Interest cost 2.07
Expected return on plan assets (0.27)
Past service cost Expense for the year 4.70

 

At December 31, 2007, the Bank group’s liability to the SRP and the post-employment aspect of the MBP amounted to UA 7.37 million
and UA 40.76 million respectively (2006: UA 34.40 million and UA 35.86 million respectively).

Assumptions used in the latest available actuarial valuations at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Staff Retirement Plan Medical Benefit Plan

(Percentages) 2006
Discount rate 5.000
Expected return on plan assets 5.000
Rate of salary increase 4.000
Future pension increase

Health care cost growth rate

-at end of fiscal year 8.000
-ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.000
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2009

 

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity
securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking
expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and
expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk
premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA
corporate bonds.

For measurement purposes, the annual growth rate in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to decrease ratably
between the current period and 2010, with the growth rate assumed to remain at that level thereafter.

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the
Bank.

Equity securities 99,742
Others 19,948
Total 199,484

  

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the assets of the MBP were invested primarily in time deposits.

The Bank's estimate of contributions it expects to make to the SRP and the MBP for the year ended December 31, 2008, are UA 13.56
million and UA 2.58 million respectively.

The health care cost growth rate can significantly affect the reported post-retirement benefit income or costs and benefit obligations for
the MBP.

NOTE V-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

(i)

(ii)

(iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally co-coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World
Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions
received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount
of DRC's arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present
value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The
new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors
considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC;
b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created
extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package
would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there
was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the
consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan.
Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from time to time make
to the special account, representing the Bank's contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation
is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank.
Consequently, income received on the consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves to
the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance
The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts towards
re- engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations from the ADB's net income, and
contributions from the ADF and other private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine
post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its
arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established
the Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the
2003 net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional
allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank's contribution to the facility and by
its resolution B/BG/2006/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank's
allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF are not used to clear the
debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary post-conflict countries.

 

 

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this initiative,
creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their
debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off
by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or their nominal values, as calculated
using the methodology agreed under the initiatives.

 

 

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying
value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net
present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original
framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt
service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt
relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief
is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon. At December 31, 2007, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 26
ADB borrowing countries, of which 19 had reached the completion point.

(iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on
countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs' repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same
amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match
“dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and
outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in the ADF's net
assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund. Subsequent write-down
of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI
loan cancellation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have
not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

 

NOTE V-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the following funds were hel

separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

(i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development Bank

and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date
the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However, the
30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. The terms of the current agreement
which terminated on April 25, 2006 have been extended twice with the latest one-year extension up to April 25, 2008. Following
an independent review of the operations of the Fund over the current Agreement period, both the Government of Nigeria and the
Bank have agreed in principle to renew the NTF Agreement for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008. The initial capital
of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first
installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment,
equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment
of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was
received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.
Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.74 million) was made
to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund.

20-74 to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in 1991 to
include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields are likely to
facilitate the Bank's objective of meeting the needs of regional member countries in those fields. The resources of this Fund consist
of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

NOTE V-4: TRUST FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These funds,
held separately from those of the ordinary resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are
translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

(i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby Mr.
Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members
who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

(ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of Algeria
to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975,
an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans
refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2007, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2006: US$ 13.45 million) had
been so repaid.

(iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance
to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended 31 December 2007

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (‘the Bank”) which comprise the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2007 and the income statement, the statement of recognized income and expense and cash flow statement for
the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out in notes A to V.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report
is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December
2007, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to Note C which highlights the effect of new and revised international financial reporting standards. For the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2006 the independent auditor issued a qualified opinion for the financial
statements because International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”, required
that the Bank’s, member countries’ capital subscriptions be reclassified in the Bank’s financial statements as financial liabilities instead
of equity.

On 14 February 2008 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued amendments to IAS1 and IAS32. The Bank’s
member countries’ capital subscriptions are puttable financial instruments that meet the requirements for equity classification under
the amended standards. Prior to the amendments, the Bank also classified these financial instruments as equity. The amendments were
issued after the balance sheet date, but before the approval of the financial statements. The Bank has opted to early adopt the amended
standards which had no effects on the Bank’s financial statements.

Operational Risk

he Bank defines operational risks to include all aspects of risk-related exposure other than those falling within the scope of credit,
market and liquidity risks including specifically the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems
or from external events and reputational risk.

Like all financial institutions, the Bank is also exposed to controls and operational risks arising from its systems, functions and interdeendencies among its departments, which could impact broadly its activities with a possible consequence of operational losses. There
are also many interdependencies among risk factors that may result in an operational risk loss.

n the past, the Bank Group has relied almost exclusively upon internal controls within departments, although not necessarily identified as
managing operational risk, for its internal controls and operational risk management. The evolving best practice is for specific structures
and methods to be dedicated for managing and coordinating operational risks. Following approval by the Board of Directors in 2004,
he Bank established an Internal Control Unit (ICU) to develop assessments and measure areas of operational risk in the Bank in line
with the evolving best practices. The Bank also adopted and commenced in 2005, the implementation of the COSO control framework
‘0 regularly evaluate the effectiveness of its internal controls in all significant business operations.

he implementation of Operational Risk Management is being done in phases: the first phase focused on the documentation and testing
of controls around financial reporting. Management attestation on the adequacy of internal controls was published in the annual reports
or the first time in 2006. Phase two of the implementation commenced in 2007 and is extending the COSO framework to other areas
of operational risk management.

 

here are other initiatives or activities in the other areas of the Bank Group that are complementing the work on operational risk management and controls including:

Effects of Recent Developments in the Financial Markets

As a result of its prudent risk management policies and practices, the impact on the Bank of the recent turbulence in the world financial
markets related in large part to losses on sub-prime mortgage loans and related derivatives have been insignificant. With regard to the
funding activities, there has been no adverse effect on the Bank’s ability to borrow at very attractive rates, consistent with the Bank's solid
financial position as evidenced by the continued uniform top rating by all the major rating agencies. Consequently, the Bank continues
to be well placed to play its intermediation role in support of the development financing needs of its member countries. With regard to
investing activities, the Bank’s investment guidelines and practices have helped to ensure a very limited exposure to financial instruments
backed by sub-prime mortgages and other risky asset classes. At December 31, 2007, the Bank held an asset-backed commercial paper
issued by a SIV-lite with exposure to sub-prime mortgages. This investment amounted to USD 50 million or UA 31.64 million, representing
0.26% of the Bank’s total assets or 0.67% of total equity. The estimated loss to the Bank on such asset-backed commercial paper has
been provided for in these financial statements.

NOTE F - TREASURY INVESTMENTS

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related derivative instruments including futures, forward contracts, crosscurrency swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year and less than 15 years, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or
other official entities. For asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money
market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum credit rating of A. Overthe-counter (OTC) options on government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does
not exceed 1 year, and such transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Cross-currency and
interest rate swaps including asset swap transactions are only permitted with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with
minimum credit ratings of AA-/Aa3 at the time of the transaction.

The Bank uses external managers in the management of certain of its liquid assets, in accordance with the Bank’s Asset and Liability
Management Guidelines. At December 31, 2007, investments under external management were UA 154.85 million (2006: UA 120.39
million). These amounts were included in the held-for-trading portfolio below.

At December 31, 2007, the Bank had no securities sold under repurchase agreements (Repos). At December 31, 2006, Repos with a nominal
value of UA 877.83 million and a market value including accrued interest of UA 879.41 million were outstanding on the balance sheet date.
Securities pledged as collateral outstanding at December 31, 2006 had a carrying value of UA 757.49 million. The nominal value of securities
sold under repurchase agreements, but not yet settled and therefore not requiring collateral to be pledged at December 31, 2006 was UA 117.64

Administrative Expenses Hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure ie. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2007 and 2006, there were no open positions with respect to the

forward exchange transactions.

NOTE H - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases
authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making
their payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local currency;
or

2) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable, non
interest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth

anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the Fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional Members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-Regional members — five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual
installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to the eighth installments shall
be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

African Development Bank Chapter 005,

NOTE |-LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other freely
convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount
disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically
the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended
for sale. Furthermore, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:
Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank's own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis
points, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency variable terms or retain the terms of
their existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other
terms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1, 1997, the Bank
has provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum of two components,
namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

& Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The vari- &
able base rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on
January 1 and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank's selected reference interest
rate in each market. The Bank's standard floating base rate is the six (6)-month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR
and JIBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset
date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency fixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization
schedule.

Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate
to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains
unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank's assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, outstanding loans were as follows:

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be
financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2007, irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks
on undisbursed loans amounted to UA 1.27 million (2006: UA 8.09 million).

Also, the Bank may provide guarantees for securities issued by an entity eligible for the Bank's loans. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the borrower incurs the underlying financial obligation and are called when a guaranteed party demands payment under
the guarantee. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31,
2007 and 2006, the Bank had no outstanding guarantee to any entity.

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

NOTE J - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in Associate: ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African countries, and to
provide financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the
original State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date.
Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected
by State Participants. The Fund's Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share of
the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a
cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December
31, 2007 amounted to UA 135.85 million (2006: UA 114.56 million), representing 73.06 percent (2006: 71.39 percent) of the shareable
administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
provides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants
in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the
participants. At December 31, 2007, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.86% (2006: 0.93%).

As a result of the implementation in 2006 of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in note V-2, the net asset value of ADF which
is the basis for determining the value of the Banks investment in the Fund continue to decline resulting in impairment loss on the Bank's
investment. The net assets of ADF is made up of its net development resources less outstanding demand obligations plus disbursed and
outstanding loans excluding balances due from countries that have reached their HIPC completion points and are therefore due for MDRI
loan cancellation at the balance sheet date.

Other Equity Participations

The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies
that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is
to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The
Bank's equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role
in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which
also have significant economic merit.

Although the Bank is allowed to take equity positions of up to twenty five percent (25%) the Bank currently holds less than 20% of the
total equity capital of each institution in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies
in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’
Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29, 2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up capital and reserves and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building.
The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions

Chapter 005 African Development Bank

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank’s owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for
the purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third
party. If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.
At December 31, 2007, the book value of such assets is not significant.

NOTE M - BORROWINGS

It is the Bank's policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank's ordinary capital resources to 80 percent of
the callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both senior and subordinated
debt to 80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries. At December 31, 2007, total borrowings amounted to UA
6,198.87 million (2006: UA 5,870.47 million) comprising senior debt and subordinated debt amounting to UA 5,530.59 million (2006:
UA 5,178.74 million) and UA 668.28 million (2006: UA 691.73 million), respectively. As of the same date, the ratio of senior debt to
the non-borrowing members’ callable capital of UA 8,503.17 million (2006: UA 8,533.51 million) was 65.04 percent (2006: 60.69 percent). Also at December 31, 2007, the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital of UA 19,341.63 million (2006:
UA 19,436.76 million) was 32.05 percent (2006: 30.20 percent). At December 31, 2007, borrowings with embedded callable options
amounted to UA 316.50 million (2006: UA 381.05 million). The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management activities
to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities and to lower its funding costs.

The Bank has entered into cross-currency swap agreements with major international banks through which proceeds from borrowings
are converted into a different currency and include a forward exchange contract providing for the future exchange of the two currencies
in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate payment
obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31,2007 was UA 5,226.28 million
(2006: UA 4,823.65 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December
31, 2007 was UA 5,106.32 million (2006: UA 4,748.81 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional
amount plus accrued finance charges.

As per Note P, there was a net gain of UA 21.24 million on fair-valued borrowings and related derivatives for the year ended December

31, 2007 (2006: UA 10.67 million). This included a gain of UA 3.00 million which was attributable to changes in the Bank’s credit risk

during the year ended December 31, 2007. Fair value changes attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are determined by com
paring the discounted cash flows for the borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss using the Bank's credit spread versus
& LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2007, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses to date
were UA 119.96 million (2006: losses of UA 74.64 million).

NOTE N - EQUITY
Equity is composed of capital and reserves. These are further detailed as follows:

Capital
Capital includes subscriptions paid-in by member countries and cumulative exchange adjustments on subscriptions (CEAS). The Bank is
not exposed to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Subscriptions Paid In

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
General Capital Increases (GCI). The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May
29, 1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments to the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million
shares to 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into
paid-up and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were
allocated to the regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the
total stock of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the

authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

The Bank's capital as at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was as follows:

(UA thousands) 2006
Capital Authorized (in shares of UA 10 000 each) 21,870,000
Less: Unsubscribed (75,463)

Add: Amounts paid in advance 328

2,306,230

Capital at December 31 2,303,062

 

 

Included in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 176.84 million at December 31, 2007, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing
the balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 41.93 million callable,
and UA 5.99 million paid-up shares) were held as treasury shares of the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply
for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption
pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state
declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have
been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with
the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore,
pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia
to interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state's Official Development
Assistance its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank accepted the offer.

Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries
were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in US dollars were fixed
at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies

to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

NOTE Q - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself. The ADF
and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is
driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance sheet sizes for non-operational
expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF's gross income.

NOTE R - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on
a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of 6 months service
without interruption of more than 30 days.

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November
2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee
contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child
benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost
associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and has been recorded in 2004. Also, new members from the local field
offices of the Bank joined the Plan in 2007 and the associated past service cost of UA 1.07 million were reported in the 2007 financial
statements. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute at a rate of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the
determination of contribution in the previous SRP has been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution,
but may vary such contribution based on the results of annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the
provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s liabilities. At December
31, 2007, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the
following objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World

Index as well as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future
liabilities.

Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17, 2002
and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, all plan members including existing staff or retirees contribute a percentage of
their salary or pension while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing of the MBP. Contribution
rates by staff members and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children, range between 0.70 percent to a
maximum of 3.10 percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees
and the staff association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are
deposited in a trust account. In accordance with the directive establishing the Plan, all Plan members including staff and retirees are
eligible as beneficiaries for making claims for medical services provided to them and their recognized dependants.

In accordance with IAS 19, and based on actuarial valuations, the pension and post employment medical benefit expenses for 2007 and
2006 for the Bank, the ADF and the NTF combined (the Bank Group) comprised the following:

At December 31, 2007, the Bank group’s liability to the SRP and the post-employment aspect of the MBP amounted to UA 7.37 million
and UA 40.76 million respectively (2006: UA 34.40 million and UA 35.86 million respectively).

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity
securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking
expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and
expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk
premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA

corporate bonds.

For measurement purposes, the annual growth rate in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to decrease ratably

between the current period and 2010, with the growth rate assumed to remain at that level thereafter.

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by the

Bank.

NOTE V-2: OTHER DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES

(i)

(ii)

(iii) Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally co-coordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World
Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions
received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount
of DRC's arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present
value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The
new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors
considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC;
b) the magnitude of DRC’s arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created
extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package
would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there
was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the
consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan.
Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from time to time make
to the special account, representing the Bank's contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation
is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank.
Consequently, income received on the consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves to
the special account only after the formal approval of such transfer, in whole or in part, by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance
The Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts towards
re- engagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations from the ADB's net income, and
contributions from the ADF and other private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine
post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its
arrears to the Bank Group. In this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established
the Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the
2003 net income of the Bank. The Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional
allocation of UA 30 million from the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank's contribution to the facility and by
its resolution B/BG/2006/04 of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank's
allocation of UA 25 million from the 2005 net income. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF are not used to clear the
debt owed to the Bank by beneficiary post-conflict countries.

 

 

The Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this initiative,
creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring their
debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were paid off
by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans or their nominal values, as calculated
using the methodology agreed under the initiatives.

 

 

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or their carrying
value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied and therefore the net
present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

Annual Report 2007African Development Bank Chapter 005,

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original
framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 33 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt
service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt
relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief
is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon. At December 31, 2007, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 26
ADB borrowing countries, of which 19 had reached the completion point.

(iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on
countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same
amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match
“dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and
outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in the ADF's net
assets. Reduction in ADF net assets results in a decrease in the value of the Bank's investment in the Fund. Subsequent write-down
of loan balances is effected as and when other countries reach their HIPC completion point and are declared beneficiaries of MDRI
loan cancellation. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF does not include loans outstanding to MDRI countries that have
not reached their HIPC completion points at the end of the year.

 

NOTE V-3: SPECIAL FUNDS

Under Article 8 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.
At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

(i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development Bank
and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date
the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However, the
30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. The terms of the current agreement
which terminated on April 25, 2006 have been extended twice with the latest one-year extension up to April 25, 2008. Following
an independent review of the operations of the Fund over the current Agreement period, both the Government of Nigeria and the
Bank have agreed in principle to renew the NTF Agreement for a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008. The initial capital
of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in freely convertible currencies. The first
installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976, and payment of the second installment,
equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment
of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was
received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.
Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.74 million) was made
to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund.

NOTE V-4: TRUST FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These funds,
held separately from those of the ordinary resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are
translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

(i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby Mr.
Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members
who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

(ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of Algeria
to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975,
an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans
refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2007, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2006: US$ 13.45 million) had
been so repaid.

(iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance
to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
Year ended 31 December 2007

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the African Development Bank (‘the Bank”) which comprise the balance
sheet as at 31 December 2007 and the income statement, the statement of recognized income and expense and cash flow statement for
the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out in notes A to V.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report
is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank

whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December

2007, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

Emphasis of Matter

Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to Note C which highlights the effect of new and revised international financial reporting standards. For the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2006 the independent auditor issued a qualified opinion for the financial
statements because International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation”, required
that the Bank’s, member countries’ capital subscriptions be reclassified in the Bank’s financial statements as financial liabilities instead
of equity.

On 14 February 2008 the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued amendments to IAS! and IAS32. The Bank’s
member countries’ capital subscriptions are puttable financial instruments that meet the requirements for equity classification under
the amended standards. Prior to the amendments, the Bank also classified these financial instruments as equity. The amendments were
issued after the balance sheet date, but before the approval of the financial statements. The Bank has opted to early adopt the amended
standards which had no effects on the Bank’s financial statements.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

he resources of ADF mainly consist of
subscriptions by the Bank and State
Participants, as well as other resources
received by the Fund. The cumulative subscription to ADF increased from UA 15.26
billion in 2006 to UA 15.32 billion in
2007.

he replenishment level for the Tenth
General Replenishment of the resources
of the Fund (ADF-X) was set at UA 3.40
illion, and covers the 2005-2007 operaional period. ADF-X became effective in
September 2005, and, as of December 31,
2007, State Participants subscribed to an
amount of UA 2.35 billion, representing 69
ercent of the ADF-X target replenishment
evel.

Negotiations for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund (ADF-XI), which covers the
hree-year operational period 2008 — 2010,
were concluded on December 11, 2007
when ADF deputies agreed to a UA 5.76
illion level of resources, of which UA
3.70 billion represents contributions from
donors, and UA 2.06 billion represents
internally generated resources.

 

Commitments under the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI
or Initiative) became effective on September
1, 2006', and covers the period 20062054. To preserve the financial integrity
and the financing capacity of the African

Development Fund, the terms of the MDR
require donors to fully compensate the
Fund for debts cancelled.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund ha
received from donors aggregate commitments of UA 4.24 billion, representing 76
percent of the MDRI cost for the perio
2006-2054 (UA 5.59 billion).

Investments

ADF cash and liquid investments amounte
to UA 3.39 billion at December 31, 2007,
compared to UA 2.94 billion in 2006.
Investment income for the year amounte:
to UA 147.25 million, representing a return
of 4.55 percent, on an average liquidity
level of UA 3.24 billion, compared with
an income of UA 102.50 million in 2006,
representing a return of 4.37 percent on an
average liquidity of UA 2.35 billion.

 

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancellations, at December 31, 2007,
amounted to UA 15.47 billion compared
with UA 14.17 billion at the end of 2006.
Total outstanding loans, as at December
31, 2007 were UA 4.16 billion, UA 329
million higher than the UA 3.83 billion
outstanding as at the end of 2006. This
increase was in spite of debt cancellation
under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
for 2 additional completion-point countries
during the year amounting to UA 195 million. At the end of 2007, there were 1,624
active signed loans and grants amounting
to UA 4.16 billion. Also at December 31,
2007, a total of 511 loans amounting to
UA 4,376 million had been fully repaid.

Disbursements
Disbursements of loans and grants increased

African Development Fund Chapter 005

from UA 685.16 million in 2006 to UA 725
million in 2007, representing an increase
of 5.80 percent. As at December 31, 2007,
cumulative disbursements on loans and
grants amounted to UA 10.68 billion. A
total of 1,429 loans and grants were fully
disbursed for an amount of UA 8.64 billion,
representing 80.90 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

Financial Results

The Fund earned a surplus of UA 31.61
million in 2007, compared to UA 40.42
million in 2006. The decrease in the Fund's
surplus was mainly due to an increase in
administrative expenses and the absence in
2007 of a one-time recovery from liquidation proceeds received in 2006.

Administrative expenses, which represent
the Fund's share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB Group, increased by
UA 21.29 million, from UA 114.56 million
in 2006 to UA 135.85 million in 2007. The
Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB group is based on a predetermined cost-sharing formula, which is driven
primarily by the relative levels of certain
operational volume indicators. The increase
in administrative expenses largely offset the
increase in net investment income.

The Fund enjoyed higher levels of liquidity
in 2007 largely due to accelerated encashment of demand obligations. Accordingly,
the increase in 2007 of UA 44.75 million
in investment income was accompanied
by a substantial increase in the discount
on accelerated encashment of demand
obligations, resulting in an increase of UA
24.68 million in net investment income
over 2006.

 

' The effectiveness of the MDRI was triggered when the Fund received Instrument of Commitments representing at least 70% of the total cost of debt relief for 14 postcompletion countries, of which not less than amounts equivalent to at least 75% of the cost of debt relief incurred during the ADF-X period, were unqualified commit
ments for payments due in 2007.

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy,
service charges on loans made to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from
loan income if principal repayment and
service charges are in arrears for 6 months
or more. As a result of this policy, UA 3.57
million of non-accrued loan income was
excluded from 2007 income compared to
UA 4.53 million in 2006. In addition, UA

Annual Report 2007

| | 08_ADF_UK.indd 148

4.71 million of loan income previously
not accrued was recovered and recognized in income in 2007 compared to UA
8.17 million in 2006. As a result of the
arrears clearance mechanism approved by
the Board of Directors during 2007, the
number of borrowers in non-accrual status
decreased from 7 at December 31, 2006 to
5 at December 31, 2007.

The Fund continues to cancel qualifying
debts under MDRI as the relevant countries reach their HIPC completion points.
In 2007, Sierra Leone and Sao-Tome &
Principe reached their HIPC completion
points. A summary of the cumulative loan
cancellations under MDRI and HIPC is
presented in Note E to the Special Purpose
Financial Statements.

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

NOTE A - PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, promote
cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms
for such purposes.

The ADF's Board of Directors has twelve (12) members, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio
President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund administered by the ADB, and the ADF are collectively referred to as the
Bank Group. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF
is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow. The principal purpose
of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB finances development projects and
programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the
development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries,
particularly the lesser-developed countries.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other resources
received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of the Fund consisted
of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund (the Agreement). Thereafter, the
resources have been replenished through Special and General increases of subscriptions and contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to its nature and organization, the Fund presents its financial statements on a special purpose basis. The Special Purpose Financial
Statements are prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are not intended to be a
presentation in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources represent resources available
to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and demand obligations of State Participants.
These special purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article 35(1) of the Agreement establishing the Fund,
which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund's special purpose financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of the Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of Account
as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

 

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of

Annual Report 2007

| | 08_ADF_UK.indd 154 &

11/04/08 13:44:34 | |African Development Fund Chapter 005

IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles
of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This
was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s Unit of Account
to be equivalent to the UA of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this
Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect of the Resolution,
and the Fund's UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank's UA.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the Statement of Net
Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment. Translation
gains and losses on subscriptions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions and contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA at December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

2006
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentinian Peso 4.454380
Brazilian Real 3.215210

United States Dollar 1.504400

 

No representation Is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting trom the rates
indicated above.

Participants’ Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by State Participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants
upon submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the ADF receives instruments of subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the replenishment resolution.
The portion of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become
due throughout the replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of
subscriptions when they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant's budgetary appropriation
process,

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

The subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing demand notes. The
notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

For the ADF-IX and ADF-X replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent to the
net present value of their entire subscriptions and contributions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with the
full face value of their entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income
generated thereon is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the
cash amount received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on the cash received from State Participants
who opted for the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the
effective contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors of the
Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in
that regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and timely compensation for
the debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

1) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of
the total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs); and

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five
percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-X period.

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with effect
from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the Initiative. Donors will contribute
additional resources to ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for each replenishment period, by
submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in
the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing ADF. The contributions received from State
Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment
period in which such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions
are separately disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its foreign
exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant
shall pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription,
of the amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another
currency.

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within that participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's
holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09 and 2005-01, which in turn
stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth general replenishments,
subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities
ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into

Annual Report 2007

UA are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions
(CEAS).

Investments

The Fund's investment securities are classified based on the Fund's intention on the date of purchase. Securities which the Fund has the
intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. All other investment securities are classified as held-for-trading and measured at market
value. Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed
securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with an AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates
of deposit and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other
inancial institutions with a minimum rating of A.

ncome on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading portfolio. Purchases and sales of
investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Loans

he Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans are not
included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a
jorrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are
overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund’s management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate
uture. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts and
circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a borrower's loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are deducted
rom income on loans for that period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent that payment of
such charges has been received by the Fund.

Grants

n addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the
resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth replenishment, grants
may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations of development resources and
are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources of the Fund.

 

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under
this initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to
bring their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted
by funds from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt, including those debts
owing to the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary
country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net
present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received
and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it falls due
with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Chapter 005 African Development Fund

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are cancelled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC framework.
The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans cancelled under MDRI by additional contributions to be made by donors over the
previously scheduled repayment periods of the cancelled loans. When MDRI becomes effective for a country, certain amounts previously
disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effectively take on the character of grants made by the
Fund. Accordingly, loans cancelled under the MDRI are included in “Net Debt Relief” and reported in the Statement of Net Development
Resources as allocation of development resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current period's presentation.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the form of
non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years after a 10-year grace period commencing from the
date of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per annum and from
years 21 through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount
disbursed and outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans and lines of credit approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5
percent per annum commitment charge on the undisbursed portion. Such a commitment charge commences to accrue 90 days from the
date of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a period of 10
years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers

or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2007, outstanding
irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 1.90 million (2006: UA 2.26 million).

11/04/08 13:44:35 | |Chapter 005 African Development Fund

As at December 31, 2007, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of UA
534.46 million (2006: UA 568.02 million) of which UA 68.89 million (2006: UA 70.29 million) that was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2007, would have been
higher by UA 3.57 million (2006: UA 4.53 million). At December 31, 2007, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual
loans amounted to UA 38.28 million, compared to UA 39.52 million at December 31, 2006.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund’s lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10.00 percent
under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.50 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments were allocated
as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified
member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the ninth replenishment were set
aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share
of grants under the tenth general replenishment is based on a country-by-country analysis of debt sustainability. Under the seventh,
eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

Technical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period, from the
date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

(i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not possible, the
grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

(ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ cooperation or for the improvement of the operations of
existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment period of 5
years thereafter.

Technical assistance loans do not carry charges.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative

At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the International
Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that have
reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development Committee Communiqué of
September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed
with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

he main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries
worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation is delivered by relieving post-compleion-point HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the
inancial integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone
principal and service charge payments.

he MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006, following the attainment of the intended thresholds. Since disbursed and
outstanding loans are already excluded from net development resources, the debt cancellation did not have an impact on the Fund's
balance of net development resources. Further cancellation of debts will be effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

At December 31, 2007, a gross amount of UA 4.51 billion (2006: UA 4.32 billion) of outstanding loans had been cancelled under MDRI
or 18 (2006: 16) HIPC completion point countries. Of this amount, UA 905.77 million (2006: UA 806.27 million) in nominal terms were
converted by the HIPC Trust Fund. The present value of the converted loans was UA 595.19 million (2006: UA 478.59 million). As of
December 31, 2007, the present value amounts have been transferred from the HIPC Trust Fund to ADF. A summary of debt relief granted
under HIPC and MDRI as at December 31, 2007 and 2006 follows:

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002
approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants
(the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF
(ADF-IX) to clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-VIII as a partial payment against the DRC's arrears
on charges to the ADB.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance

The Post Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their
arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities in order to reactivate development assistance and help these

countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework
entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF and other private donors and
allocations from the ADB's net income. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank
Group. Contributions made by ADF to the PCCF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary post-conflict countries.
Contributions by the Fund to PCCF are included in the amount reported for “Grants and Technical Assistance Activities” in the Statement
of Net Development Resources.

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to
the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of a special
general increase and ten general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions and Voting
Power in Note O.

The tenth replenishment, approved by the Board of Governors resolution F/BG/2005/01 adopted on May 4, 2005, covered the 3-year
operational period to 2007.

Negotiations for the eleventh replenishment of the Fund were concluded on December 11, 2007 when the deputies agreed to a replenishment level of UA 5.76 billion, of which UA 2.06 billion represents internally generated resources, for the 3-year operational period
2008 to 2010. The eleventh replenishment shall come into effect on the date when State Participants shall have deposited with the Fund,
instruments of subscription amounting to at least thirty percent (30%) of the total intended subscriptions. This date shall not be later
than March 31, 2008 or such later date as the Board of Directors may determine.

At December 31, 2007 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 4.37 billion of which UA 109.37 &
million had been paid and included in total subscriptions. Consistent with the resolution approving MDRI, the contributions paid entitle
the State Participants to voting rights, as reflected in Note O.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are recorded in the Cumulative Exchange
Adjustment on Subscriptions account in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund or a member of
the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of
the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources
in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 158.30 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 156.30 million, and by the
Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of
the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the Bank.
While the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed and outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of
administering the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding
loans.

NOTE | - RESERVES

Reserves as at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

 

 

(UA thousands) 2006
Reserves at January 1 96,237
Surplus for the year 40,418
Reserves at December 31 136,655

 

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

he Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund
‘0 receive other resources including grants from state participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or
jodies.

At December 31, 2007, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 4.31 million (2006: UA 3.86 million), representing the
balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.
NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's offices, staff,
organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing
ormula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund's relative share of the number of programs and projects executed during the year
by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 135.85 million (2006: UA 114.56
million).

 

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 12-member Board of Directors, of which 6 members are selected by the Bank. The
Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF's voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. In accordance
with the Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the ADB (the Bank) to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund
also administers trust funds entrusted to it by some of its State Participants.

we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.

Independent Auditors’ Report on the Special Purpose

Financial Statements of the African Development Fund
to the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund

ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the Special Purpose Financial Statements are
free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the Auditors’ judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement
of the special purpose financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of the Special Purpose Financial Statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall Special Purpose Financial Statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Special Purpose Financial Statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the

accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in Note B of the Special Purpose Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007.

Chapter 005 Nigeria Trust Fund

NIGERIA TRUST FUND
Financial Management

Investments

NTF cash and liquid investments, which are
denominated in US Dollars, amounted to
UA 196.68 million at December 31, 2007,
compared to UA 194.16 million in 2006.
Investment income for 2007 amounted to
UA 10.34 million, representing a return of
5.36 percent, on an average liquidity level
of UA 192.97 million, compared with an
income of UA 12.02 million in 2006, representing a return of 5.80 percent on an
average liquidity of UA 207.37 million.

Loan Portfolio

Loans signed, net of cancellations, as at
December 31, 2007, remained unchanged
at UA 240.88 million, the level recorded
as at December 31, 2006. As at end 2007,
there were 39 active signed loans amounting to UA 64.54 million. There were 31
fully repaid loans for a total amount of UA
75.02 million.

Disbursements

Disbursements increased from UA 5.43
million in 2006, to UA 5.94 million representing an increase of 9.4 percent. As at
December 31, 2007, cumulative disbursements amounted to UA 194.41 million.
A total of 58 loans were fully disbursed
for a total amount of UA 188.84 million,
representing 97.1 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

Risk Management

Policies and Processes

Similar to the African Development Bank,
the Nigeria Trust Fund seeks to reduce its
exposure to risks that are not essential
to its core business of providing development assistance, such as liquidity, currency and interest rate risks. Note D to the
Financial Statements describes the Risk
Management policies and processes used
to manage these risks.

Annual Report 2007

Financial Results

The Fund continued to apply the accounting policy which it introduced in 2006 for
the treatment of transfers from income
approved by the Board of Governors of the
Bank. These transfers, which are authorized by the Government of Nigeria and
made to HIPC, were previously presented
as direct reductions of equity. Under the
new accounting treatment, these transfers
are reported as expenses in the income
statement.

The NTF's income before transfers approved
by the Board of Governors increased from
UA 13.80 million in 2006 to UA 19.84
million in 2007, due mainly to a net
write-back of provision for impairment on
loans and related charges receivable. The
net write-back of provisions for losses on
loans and interest and charges receivable
increased by UA 9.40 million, from UA
0.10 million in 2006 to UA 9.50 million
in 2007. Investment and loan income in
2007 decreased by UA 1.68 million and
UA 0.77 million, respectively, mainly as
a result of the fall during the year, in the
exchange rate of the dollar against the
Unit of Account. Administrative expenses,
which represent the Fund's share of the
total shareable expenses of the ADB group,
decreased by UA 0.33 million from UA
2.92 million in 2006 to UA 2.59 million in
2007. The Fund's share of the total shareable expenses of the ADB group is based
on a predetermined cost-sharing formula,
which is driven primarily by the relative
levels of certain operational volume indicators. The Fund's reserves net of cumulative
currency translation adjustments increased
from UA 139.54 million at December 31,
2006 to UA 144.88 million in 2007.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between
the African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank, which is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund
is to assist in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in
effect for a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such a sunset date may be extended by mutual
agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement expired on April 25, 2006 and has been extended
twice for 1-year periods, to allow for the completion of an independent review of the operation of the Fund. Following the completion
of the independent review, both the Government of Nigeria and the Bank have agreed in principle to a renewal of the NTF Agreement
or a period of ten years starting from April 26, 2008.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by
he International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. The significant accounting policies of the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue Recognition

nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest method during the time an investment or
loan is outstanding and held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through
he expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued in arrears for unutilized loan
acilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading investments.

Functional and Presentation Currencies
he Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In accordance with
Article Vil, section 7.3, of the Agreement, the financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA).

he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one Special Drawing
Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF. At December 31, 2007,
UA was equivalent to 1.58025 United States dollars (2006: 1.50440 United States dollars).

Chapter 005 Nigeria Trust Fund

Currency Translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated from U.S. dollars to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity. Capital replenishments
are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses on conversion of currencies into
UA are included in the determination of net income.

Financial Instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1) Financial Assets

The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: held-for-trading financial assets, loans and receivables, and held-tomaturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments upon initial recognition.

(i) Held-for-Trading Financial Assets
All held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio are
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Held-for-trading financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains
and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

(ii) Loans and Receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified accrued
income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Fund provides
money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables are subsequently
measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

(iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund’s management has the positive intention
and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest
method.

 

Purchases and sales of held-for-trading and held-to-maturity investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the
Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Cash and cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon

acquisition of 3 months or less.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

| | 09_NTF_UK.indd 178 &

11/04/08 13:45:28 | |Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005,

2) Financial Liabilities

Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized
upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of Financial Assets
he Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be
reliably estimated.

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or held-to-maturity
investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial
asset's original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

 

 

he impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and recognized in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring
any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans,
including those in arrears.

Offsetting Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair Value Disclosure

The fair values of investments that are quoted in active markets are based on current bid prices. Fair values of financial assets listed in
inactive markets or unlisted securities, are determined by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data
inputs. These valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing
models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

Fair values for financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been determined using methodologies
and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction, or whether they are exchangeable at all, is not readily determinable. Management
believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might differ from
the fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Chapter 005 Nigeria Trust Fund

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash flows. Fair values
are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end market equivalent lending rate in that currency, adjusted for
estimated credit risk.

Retained Earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year net
income.

Critical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual
results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant
judgments and estimates are summarized below:

(i) Impairment Losses on Assets Carried at Amortized Cost

The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines that
no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial
assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A
financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence
of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss
event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets and can be
reliably estimated.

If the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred)
discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.

The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in
the income statement.

(ii) Fair Values of Financial Instruments
The fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques. Valuation
techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and
comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own
and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors
could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

(iii) Held-to-Maturity Investments
The Fund follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying certain financial assets as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgment. In making the judgment to designate an asset as held-to-maturity, the Fund makes a positive determination as to its
intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

Annual Report 2007Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005,

NOTE C- NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

n 2007, the Fund adopted International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and related amendments to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, Presentation of Financial Statements — Capital Disclosures. |FRS 7 supersedes IAS
30, Disclosures in the Financial Statements of Banks and Similar Financial Institution and |AS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, and
introduces new and enhanced qualitative and quantitative disclosures about exposures to risks arising from financial instruments and
ow the Bank manages those risks. The amendments to IAS 1 require new disclosures about the Fund's objectives, policies and processes
or managing capital. The new disclosures are presented in Note D.

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, certain new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
nterpretations have been issued but become effective for periods after December 31, 2007 and for which the Fund has elected not to
early adopt. IFRS 8, Operating Segments, which becomes effective for financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009
replaces the segmental reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting, and requires alignment of the segments in the financial
statements with those used internally by management in the allocation of resources and assessing performance. IFRS 8 is not expected
0 have a significant impact on the Fund's financial statements. The amendments to IAS 1 require the Fund to present in separate statements, changes in equity related to its shareholders and those related to comprehensive income (i.e., non-shareholder related components), including related reclassification adjustments of those components. It also requires the presentation of a balance sheet as at
he beginning of the earliest comparative period in a complete set of financial statements when the Fund applies an accounting policy
retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement. None of these new standards and amendments is expected to have a significant
impact on the Fund's financial statements.

 

 

NOTE D - RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

As described in Note A, the African Development Bank (the Bank) manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of
Nigeria. The resources of the Fund comprise funds provided by the Government of Nigeria as described in Note G. The Fund is not exposed
to any externally imposed capital requirement. In the course of exercising its fiduciary duties, the Bank applies specific risk management
policies designed to protect the resources of the Fund through the Bank's General Authority on Asset and Liability Management (the
ALM Authority). The ALM Authority sets out the guiding principles for managing the Fund's risks, including interest rate risk, currency risk,
liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and operational risk.

Under the ALM Authority, the President of the Bank is authorized to approve and amend more detailed operational guidelines as necessary, upon the recommendations of the Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO). ALCO is the Bank's most senior management
forum on finance and risk management issues and is chaired by the Vice President for Finance of the Bank.

ALCO meets on a regular basis to perform its oversight role. As part of ALCO’s key functions pertinent to the administration of the Fund,
it reviews regular and ad-hoc finance and risk management reports and projections, approves strategies to adjust the balance sheet, and
confirms country credit risk ratings and the associated incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by several standing working groups
that report on specific issues including country risk, counterparty credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, operational risk, financial
projections, and financial products and services.

Day-to-day operational responsibility for implementing the Bank’s risk management policies and guidelines is delegated to the appro
priate business units, and the Financial Management Department is responsible for monitoring the day-to-day compliance with those
policies and guidelines.

Chapter 005 Nigeria Trust Fund

The following sections describe in detail the manner in which the individual sources of risk are managed by the Fund.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss due to default of one or more debtors/obligors. Credit risk is the largest source of risk for the Fund
arising from its lending and treasury operations, essentially, and it includes sovereign credit risk from lending operations, and counterparty
credit risk. These risks are managed within an integrated framework of credit policies, guidelines and processes, which are described in
more detail in the following sections.

1) Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Fund lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing
member state. Also, in extending credit to sovereign entities, it is exposed to country risk which includes potential losses arising from a
country’s inability or unwillingness to service its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit risk through financial policies
and lending strategies, including individual country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessment. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its sociopolitical conditions and future growth prospects.

Country Exposure
The Fund's loans outstanding at December 31, 2007 were to the following countries:

Systematic Credit Risk Assessment
The Fund currently lends only to public sector borrowers, and its loans generally carry full sovereign guarantee or the equivalent from
the borrowing member state.

The Fund's credit risk management framework is based on a systematic credit risk assessment using a uniform internal credit risk rating
scale that is calibrated to reflect the Fund's statistical loss expectations as shown in the table below.

These sovereign credit risk ratings are derived from a risk assessment on five risk indices that include macroeconomic performance, debt
sustainability, sociopolitical factors, business environment and portfolio performance. These five risk indices are combined to derive a
composite sovereign country risk index and then converted into separate country risk ratings. These country risk ratings are validated
against the average country risk ratings from accredited rating agencies and other specialized international bodies. The ALCO reviews
the country ratings on a quarterly basis to ensure compliance with country exposure limits, changes in country credit risk conditions, and
to approve changes in loss provisioning, if any.

Portfolio Risk Monitoring

It is the Fund’s policy that if the payment of principal, interest or other charges becomes 30 days overdue, no new loans to that country,
or to any public sector borrower in that country, will be presented to the Board of Directors for approval, nor will any previously approved
loan be signed, until all arrears are cleared. Furthermore, for such countries, disbursements on all loans to or guaranteed by that member
country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been paid.

2) Counterparty Credit Risk

Counterparty credit risk is the potential for loss due to failure of a counterparty to honor its obligation. The Fund utilizes various financial
instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in market interest and currency rates, and to invest its liquid resources prior to disbursement. All of these financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may be unable
to meet its obligation to the Fund.

Chapter 005 Nigeria Trust Fund

Given the nature of the Fund’s business, it is not possible to completely eliminate counterparty credit risk, however, the Fund minimizes
this risk by executing transactions within a prudential framework of approved counterparties, minimum credit rating standards, counterparty exposure limits, and counterparty credit risk mitigation measures. Counterparties must meet the Fund's minimum credit rating
requirements and are approved by the Bank's Vice President for Finance. For counterparties that are rated below the minimum rating
requirements, approval is required by ALCO.

The following table details the minimum credit ratings for authorized investment counterparties:

The Fund invests in mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities with a minimum rating of AAA/Aaa; and money market mutual funds
with a minimum rating of AA-/Aa3.

 

In addition to these minimum rating requirements, the Fund operates within a framework of exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10% of the Fund's total liquidity for any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit
exposures are aggregated across all instruments using the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) potential future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Fund's credit limits after considering the benefits of any collateral.

As shown in the following table, the estimated potential counterparty credit exposure of the investment portfolio continues to be predominantly AA or higher rated.

 

Annual Report 2007Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 005

Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk is the potential for loss resulting from insufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs in a timely manner. In order to mitigate
liquidity risk, the Fund's investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its disbursement obligations.

Currency Risk
Currency risk is the potential loss due to adverse movements in market foreign exchange rates. The Fund manages its currency risk by
holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the Fund's resources are denominated.

Interest Rate Risk

The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments. All of the Fund’s loans have fixed interest rates. Investments are managed against the monthly average of three-months LIBOR in order to manage prudently the available
resources. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to the Fund's equity resources, and is accordingly not hedged.

At December 31, 2007, the Fund had UA 32.43 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2006: UA 38.36 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2% to 4% per annum.

Interest rate risk positions as at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

Currency and Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis

The Fund holds all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars and therefore is exposed only to translation adjustment as the Fund's assets
are reported in UA for financial statements purposes. Any change in the UA/USD exchange rate would have an impact of approximately
40% on these reported values.

Movements in interest rates have an impact on the reported fair value of the trading investment portfolio. The table below shows the
effect of a parallel yield curve movement of +/-100bps on the portfolio as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(UA thousands)

  

(Loss)/gain on held-for-trading investments

  

The loan portfolio comprises fixed rate loans only and is carried at amortized cost, thus not affected by movements in interest rates.

NOTE E - INVESTMENTS

As part of its portfolio management strategy, the Fund invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, and asset-backed
securities.

For government and agency obligations with final maturities longer than 1 year, the Fund may only invest in obligations with counterparties having a minimum credit rating of AA- issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official
entities. For asset-backed securities, the Fund may only invest in securities with AAA credit rating. Investments in money market instruments are restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum rating of A.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank
in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund
Year ended 31 December 2007

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (“the Fund’’) which comprise the balance sheet as at
31 December 2007 and the income statement, the statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes as set out in notes A to K.

The financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and
audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement Establishing the Fund. This report is
made solely to the Board of Governors of the Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement establishing the Fund.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in
an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Fund and the Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing,
implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting
estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditors’ Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements and plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

Nigeria Trust Fund
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Board of Governors

of the African Development Bank in respect of the Nigeria Trust Fund

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December

2007, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

* Origin of Supply (00S) for Bank Group procurement and disbursenment purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied originated as evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car
purchased from a local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire would be classified under the code for France.

** The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures have been reported to the Bank
However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant invoices are received and processed.

2018 ANNUAL REPORTMessage from the President

It is my pleasure to submit the
Bank Group's Annual Report
for 2018. The year has been
wonderful for the African continent. And let me say, the future is
getting brighter. The continent's
general economic performance
continued to recover in 2018,
with real GDP growth estimated
at 3.5 percent. Growth's pace is
expected to be maintained at 4

 

percent in 2019 and 4.1 percent
in 2020. This momentum is strong, up from a mere 2.1 percent
as recently as 2016.

Looking back to 2018, approvals by the Bank Group reached
UA 7.28 billion, with disbursements reaching UA 4.37 billion.
The Bank's efforts contributed greatly to the Bank’s High 5
priority areas. To Light Up and Power Africa, 2,430 km of new
or improved power distribution lines and 480 km of new or
improved power transmission lines were connected—and 447
MW in new total power capacity was installed, 197 MW of it
renewable. To Feed Africa, about 19 million people gained
access to improved agricultural technologies. To Industrialize
Africa, 1.2 million people are benefiting from private sector
investment projects. To Integrate Africa, about 14 million people
gained access to better transport services. And to Improve the
Quality of Life, 8 million people now benefit from improved
access to water and sanitation. By any measure, these numbers
and impacts are impressive.

But the needs in Africa are enormous. That's why the Bank
is engaged in discussions with its shareholders for a
General Capital Increase to do much more for Africa—toward
Agenda 2063. A stronger and substantially capitalized African
Development Bank is good for the overall effectiveness of the
multilateral development finance system. And it is good for
stronger convening powers and partnerships to deliver more
for Africa—together. The first Governors Consultative Committee
meeting in Rome in November 2018 was a success. | look
forward to more such meetings in 2019. The Medium-Term
Review of ADF-14 was very successful. The Deputies approved our
moving forward with the ADF market borrowing option and initiating
the process for changing the ADF articles accordingly. | am
hopeful for a higher ADF-15 replenishment.

The Bank gained global acclaim with the launch of its USD
1 billion synthetic securitization, which allows us to sell off
some of our portfolio’s risk to the private sector and to free up
more than USD 700 million in lending room for private sector
financing. As the first of such achievement by any multilateral
development bank, we are spearheading innovation globally.
We also launched our Portfolio Credit Insurance with USD 500

ii 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

million, freeing up even more lending room for the Bank.
Again, the Bank is the first multilateral development bank to
launch such an initiative.

Africa will develop not through aid but through the discipline
of investments. That’s why the African Development Bank,
together with its partners, launched the Africa Investment
Forum in 2018. The forum was an incredible success, with deals
for a record USD 38.7 billion in investment identified in less than
72 hours. Indeed, the Bank is now the leader in mobilizing
private sector financing for the continent.

The Bank posted impressive financial results, maintaining our
triple-A rating with a stable outlook from all four global financial rating agencies. But we also want Africa to get a “triple-A
development impact rating.” We need universal access to
electricity. We must help make Africa self-sufficient in food.
We must fully integrate the continent. We must industrialize

 

the continent. And we must improve the quality of life for the
people of Africa.

Being that kind of Bank depends on the work environment we
create for our staff—to unleash their collective and individual
potentials and to attract and retain top-notch talent. We are
making great progress on this. The Bank was ranked the 4th
best company to work for in Africa in 2018, a big jump from
82nd in 2015. So, our reforms are paying off nicely, as the Bank
is now a very attractive place to work. Also in 2018, we recruited
staff for 677 positions, about 300 internal, the highest ever for
the Bank. The gross vacancy rate of the Bank Group dropped
from 24 percent in 2017 to 14 percent in 2018.

We continue to implement the Development and Business
Delivery Model. Our results on the ground and our income
growth trajectories show that the model is working. We will
not relent on our commitment to improve weak areas, even
as we continue strengthening strong areas. The Delegation of
Authority Matrix was revised and approved to devolve more
authority for decision making to the Regional and Country
Offices. The change enables the Bank Group to respond faster
to its clients. With 41 country offices being staffed with the right
mix of skills, the Bank Group has a greater presence in Regional
Member Countries.

A special word of thanks to the dedicated Boards of Directors,
Management, and Staff for steering the Bank in 2018. | am
optimistic about Africa's future. | am confident in our capacity as a
Bank to make a greater impact on the lives of millions of people
across this beloved continent we have been called to serve!

Container Terminal, South Africa1| THE DRIVE FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT

Global growth has stabilized,
with world output estimated

to have grown by 3.7 percent

in 2018 and projected to grow
by the same magnitude in

2019. With the volatility of
commodity prices and the rise
of trade tensions between the
United States and its main
trading partners, the external
environment has created
increasingly adverse conditions
for Africa’s growth. Higher
interest rates in the United
States and the strengthening of
the US dollar have put pressure
on the currencies of developing
countries and increased the costs
of borrowing. While the increase
in energy prices gave relief for oil
producers, it also worsened the
terms of trade for oil importers.

2 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

In 2018, Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth reached an estimated 3.5 percent, roughly
the same as in 2017 and up by 1.4 percentage point
from 2.1 percent in 2016. In the short term, growth
is projected to accelerate to 4 percent in 2019 and
4.1 percent in 2020. These projections are higher
than those of other emerging and developing
regions. However, domestic risks, in addition to
external constraints, could limit the continent's
growth. These include climate change, security
and migration concerns, increasing vulnerability to
debt distress in some countries, and uncertainties
associated with elections and political transitions.

In 2018, while East Africa remained the
fastest growing region (at 5.7 percent),
North Africa contributed the most to
overall African GDP growth, accounting
for 37 percent. The general drivers of Africa's
economic growth have been gradually rebalancing,
moving from consumption to investment and
exports. The recent commodity price rebound and
particularly the increase in oil prices, supported
the recovery of commodity exporters. Overall, 17
African countries achieved real GDP growth higher
than 5 percent in 2018, and 21 between 3 and 5
percent. Only five African countries recorded a
recession in 2018, down from eight in the two
previous years. Six of the world’s ten-fastest
growing economies (Burkina Faso, Céte d'Ivoire,
Ethiopia, Libya, Rwanda, and Senegal) are African
countries. Some non-resource-rich countries had
high growth rates in 2018, including Céte d'Ivoire
(7.4 percent), Rwanda (7.2 percent), and Senegal
(7 percent), supported by agricultural production,

consumer demand, and public investment.Economic fundamentals in most African countries
continuedtoimprove, thanks to fiscal consolidation
along with massive investments in infrastructure,
major inroads in financial innovation, increased
domestic demand, and substantial improvements
in the investment climate (more than a third of
global reforms). On average, Africa's fiscal deficit
declined from 5.8 percent in 2017 to an estimated
4.5 percent in 2018, while inflation fell from
12.6 percent in 2017 to 10.9 percent in 2018.
However, growth rates remain insufficient
to address the persistent challenges of high
unemployment, low agricultural productivity,
inadequate infrastructure, and fiscal and current
deficits as well as debt vulnerabilities. Although tax
revenues and spending efficiency have improved,
domestic resource mobilization has generally
remained well short of potential. For instance,
16 African countries were classified as being in
debt distress or at high risk of debt distress at the

end of 2018.

Debt in Africa has risen steadily in recent years
after having declined and stabilized under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Africa's public
debt represented 58 percent of GDP in 2017, up
from 36 percent in 2008. The drivers of the rise
in debt include low commodity prices, higher
infrastructure spending, depreciating exchange
rates, rising costs of foreign currency borrowing,
and greater defense and security spending.
There is, however, significant heterogeneity
across countries and regions. At the end of 2017,
the government debt-to-GDP ratio was below
40 percent for 16 of 52 countries with data and

above 100 percent for six.

THE DRIVE FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT | 1

To ensure a high social return on debt-financed
public investment, it is important to strengthen
the debt-investment link. In this regard, the Bank's
multidimensional approach to mitigating the
risk of debt distress in Africa will include tapping
new sources of funding to lower the cost of debt;
engaging in policy dialogue to raise awareness of
debt sustainability at the highest political level;
laying the foundation for efficient use of existing
resources to limit recourse to additional debt;
strengthening country capability to manage debt;
supporting efficient and productive use of debt;
and building fiscal capacity for increased domestic
resource mobilization.

On average,
Africa’s fiscal deficit declined

to 10.9 percent in 2018.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT 31| THE DRIVE FOR AFRICA'S DEVELOPMENT

Africa has the world’s fastest growing
population. The continent's young labor force is
projected to grow at an average rate of 2.75 percent
a year between 2016 and 2030, so an inclusive and
pro-employment growth path is crucial to creating
enough jobs. In addition, the adverse impacts of
climate change, now pronounced, are projected to
become even starker by 2050, undermining Africa's
agricultural performance and water and energy
security.

These challenges call for significant investment
and external funding, involving the private sector,
particularly in regional infrastructure development
and financing. The continent faces a large annual
gap of between USD 68 billion and 108 billion
in meeting its infrastructure investment needs,
estimated at USD 130 to 170 billion a year. African
countries must therefore fast-track economic
transformation and structural reforms and continue
to tap into identified opportunities.

Fostering regional integration would increase
trade and economic cooperation, and enhance
the delivery of regional public goods, but also
enable countries to move up the ladder through
specialization and reverse external imbalances.
The African Continental Free Trade Agreement
(AfCFTA), upon entry into force, will contribute to
the creation of the world’s biggest free trade area
in terms of the number countries involved, and
will be an important driver of sustained economic
growth.

4 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

 

A view of Kigali in Rwanda

In line with its High 5 priorities, the African
Development Bank is ideally placed to enhance
social and economic inclusiveness in Regional
Member Countries (RMCs) through infrastructure
development, agro-industrialization, improved
access to finance, and support for regional
integration. As a knowledge institution with an
overview of Africa, the Bank helps to produce
and manage knowledge, build capacity and
provide sound policy advice to RMCs’ decisionmakers. It also aims at boosting blended finance
for attracting private investment at scale. In this
context, the results of the first Africa Investment
Forum, organized by the Bank in Johannesburg in
November 2018, exceeded expectations, resulting

in 49 deals totaling USD 38.7 billion.Bank Group y ii

Approvals

The Bank performed well in 2018, despite challenges such as
high indebtedness by RMCs and other operational constraints.
Bank Group approvals for 2018 picked up, amounting to
UA 7.28 billion (Figure 2.1). This includes UA 6.21 billion in
approvals across the Bank Group's two entities—the African
Development Bank and the African Development Fund—as
well as UA 1.07 billion in approvals under the Nigeria Trust
Fund, the Private Sector Credit Enhancement Facility, the
Transition Support Facility, and the Special Funds.

Approvals through the African Development Bank totaled
UA 5.13 billion, up 14 percent from 2017 (Table 2.1). In
2018, the share of non-sovereign operations in the African
Development Bank was 32 percent, compared with
37 percent in 2017, largely attributable to a sharp drop in
lines of credit to financial institutions, which represented
19 percent of non-sovereign operations, compared with 35
percent in 2017. African Development Fund approvals in
2018 totaled UA 1.09 billion. Approvals under the Nigeria
Trust Fund amounted to UA 13.3 million—up from zero in
2017. The agreement between the Bank and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria, establishing the NTF, expired on 25 April
2018. The Agreement was extended for an additional period
of five years starting from 25 April 2018 until 25 April 2023.
The combined approvals for the Nigeria Trust Fund, Private
Sector Credit Enhancement Facility (PSF), the Transition
Support Facility (TSF), and Special Funds increased by
45 percentfrom the levelin 2017. Loans and grants represented
the largest share (81 percent) of African Development Bank

Co-Financing

The Bank continued its resource mobilization through
co-financing, with the objective of crowding in additional
financing for implementing the High 5s. The Bank’s approved
operations generated a combined UA 7.4 billion in additional
co-financing investments from partners such as Agence
Frangaise de Développement, the European Union, the
European Investment Bank, and the World Bank. The volume
of co-financing resources leveraged on Bank-financed public
sector projects stood at UA 5.0 billion.

Bank Group Portfolio

The health of the portfolio improved during 2018, as the
overall proportion of flagged operations fell in every region,
and fell overall from 36 percent at the end of 2017 to
23 percent at the end of 2018. Delays in project
implementation continue to be the dominant flag. With its
enhanced proximity to RMCs, the Bank is addressing this
issue by accelerating the signing of loan protocols with
governments, closer follow-up to satisfy the conditions of first
disbursement, and training the staff of executing agencies.

As of 31 December 2018, the Bank Group's active portfolio
was led by transport (25 percent), power (22 percent), finance
(19 percent), agriculture (10 percent), and water and sanitation
(9 percent). The financial sector loans benefited many different
sectors (Figure 2.4).

million from its own resources to leverage USD 1.9 billion
from commercial banks through private sector syndication,
for a leverage ratio of 1:3.5.

For public sector co-financing, the Bank mobilized USD 160
million through the Accelerated Co-financing Facility for
Africa, EUR 531 million through the Africa Investment Platform
under the European Union, and USD 295 million through the
Africa Growing Together Fund. Together, they contributed
to the Bank's efforts to scale up its investment in agriculture,
energy, transport, and water and sanitation, reflecting an
estimated 33 percent increase over amounts mobilized in
2017 from these three co-financing facilities.

Among other initiatives, the Bank approved a EUR 470 million
partial credit guarantee to cover the obligations of Senegal
under currency-risk hedging arrangements with commercial
banks, to hedge its USD 1.4 billion exposure on its two
Eurobonds maturing in 2021 and 2033.

The European Fund for Sustainable Development approved
EUR 12.5 million in a guarantee and EUR 1 million in technical
assistance in 2018 to enhance the Bank's local currency loans,
and provide a blended pricing mechanism. The Bank also
co-guaranteed a EUR 24 million project, financed in CFA
francs, to back a receivables-based financing structure to
scale up pay-as-you-go off-grid home solar power systems in
Céte d'Ivoire.

Operations by High 5 Priority

Light Up and Power Africa

With strong and mutually supportive lending and knowledge
services, approvals for Light Up and Power Africa amounted
to UA 1.39 billion, 23 percent more than in 2017. Close
to 90 percent of Bank lending focused on infrastructure
investments, similar to the 91 percent of 2017. UA 220 million
were mobilized from various co-financing facilities, including
the Green Climate Fund, Climate Investment Funds, Global
Environmental Facility, China’s Africa Growing Together
Fund, the European Union External Investment Plan, UK's
Department for International Development, and the Bank's
Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa. The Bank's operations
made it possible to leverage an additional UA 1.2 billion in
indirect co-financing, and private sector lending increasedBox 2.1: Quantum PowerMenengai 35 Megawatt

to UA 290 million, up 18 percent over 2017. Sixty percent
of the power capacity to be installed under the operations
approved in 2018 will draw on renewable sources, including
geothermal energy (Box 2.1).

The year 2018 was one of several innovative “firsts”:

The Bank's first stand-alone private sector off-grid
investment, the Zola Energy Pay-as-you-go Solar Home
Systems Project in Céte d'Ivoire, will facilitate deployment
of 100,000 solar home systems.

The Bank's first results-based financing, the Scaling-up
Electricity Access Project in Rwanda, will provide 285,000
additional connections.

The Bank's first large-scale green mini-grid development
project, the Nigeria Rural Electrification Project, will crowd
in USD 250 million in private sector financing and provide
125,000 decentralized solar powered connections in
remote areas (Box 2.8).

The Bank's first project under the desert-to-power
initiative, the off-grid component of the Yeleen Solar
Program in Burkina Faso, will provide decentralized
energy solutions to 150,000 households in rural areas.

The Bank's first project to support an independent
power producer using concentrated solar power
technology combined with molten salt energy storage,
the 100-megawatt Redstone plant in South Africa, will
provide baseload power equal to the annual electricity
consumption of around 210,000 households.

identify areas for improvement. The Africa Energy Portal is a
one-stop shop for energy data, information, and knowledge.
The African Financial Alliance for Climate Change encourages
financial providers to shift their portfolios toward climateresilient and low-carbon investments. The Bank also rolled
out the Africa Energy Market Place, a collaborative platform
for public-private dialogue that endorsed Joint Energy
Action Plans for Céte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Zambia.

Feed Africa

The Bank's Feed Africa operations seek to transform
African agriculture into a globally competitive, inclusive,
and business-oriented sector—creating wealth, generating
gainful employment, and improving the quality of life.

Total approvals in 2018 amounted to UA 1.13 billion. The
projects approved included two investments to support
fertilizer production and distribution in Morocco and Nigeria,
some Program-based Operations that address policy
constraints in the sector, direct investments to increase
agricultural productivity and production and to support
agribusiness, and development of agricultural value chains.
This reflects the true nature of the Bank-wide Feed Africa
program with investments that cut across many sectors in
the Bank. The Bank also leveraged additional investments
through various financial instruments such as equity, quasiequity, and debt to catalyze investment at scale from the
private sector and with co-financing of about UA 950 million.

10 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

Workingwith RMCs, the Bank has maintainedstrongleadership
and partnerships in support of continental and global efforts
on food and nutritional security. For example, the Program for
Integrated Development and Adaptation to Climate Change
in the Niger Basin covers Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon,
Chad, Céte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria. The
Bank's investment in the Basin strengthens the resilience of the
Niger River's ecosystems and population through sustainable
natural resource management. Sixteen agricultural value
chain operations were approved in 2018 to improve the
competitiveness of key commodities.

Non-sovereign operations fostered much-needed dynamism
in the agribusiness sector, which tends to be relatively
underserved. The Bank’s investments in agro-allied corporates
such as DAL Group in Sudan and Flour Mills in Nigeria will
generate large employment impacts, promote backward
integration with outgrowers, and support processing to feed
Africa's growing internal and export market.

¢ The Bank's investment in DAL Group is the first NonSovereign Transaction in Sudan.

¢ The Bank’s investment in Ghana's Cocoa Board will
enhance productivity and transform the cocoa value
chain sector in Ghana. The Bank continued mobilizing
additional financing mainly from commercial lenders and
development finance institutions.

Industrialize Africa

Approvals for Industrialize Africa reached UA 1.61 billion in
2018, up 15 percent from the level in 2017. Approvals for the
financial sector amounted to UA 1.17 billion, with UA 756
million for non-sovereign operations, and disbursements
of UA 626 million. These loans supported activities across
a wide range of manufacturing and services in the private
sector. The Bank also mobilized concessional and nonconcessional resources to support the financial sector. The
European Commission provided EUR 65 million for first-loss
guarantees and EUR 10.7 million as grants to support
financial sector development. In addition, the Bank mobilized
EUR 117 million from other development finance institutions
and private sector entities. Additionally, it approved a USD 20
million trade finance package to support Liberian small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) (Box 2.3).

The Bank is partnering with the European Commission (EC)
in arrangements that will widen the mix of products the Bank
offers, increase the Bank's investments in SMEs, and support
African SME access to capital markets:

¢ SME Program. The EC approved a blended finance
proposal for the Africa SME program, with the Bank
to receive partial first-loss guarantees up to EUR 20
million. The first-loss guarantee is expected to reduce
the risk profile of the Bank’s investments in Tier 2 and
Tier 3 financial intermediaries, which should lower the

building of fund managers and social entrepreneurs. The
program will complement the Boost Africa Fund by targeting
non-venture capital funds.

e One Platform for Africa. The EC also approved a
proposal to promote access to capital markets by African
SMEs through the Archipelagos-One Platform for Africa
(ONE4A) Initiative, which is jointly led and coordinated
by the Bank and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP). ONE4A
is structured in 2 pillars: (i) a technical assistance pillar
to build capacity for selected SMEs to access capital
markets and to boost capital markets ecosystem readiness
for SME financing; and (ii) a guarantee pillar to crowd in local
and private sector investors. The EC supports both pillars
of ONE4A with EUR 5 million in grant funding and a EUR
30 million first-loss guarantee from the European Fund for
Sustainable Development (EFSD).

The Industrialize Africa priority was also supported by other
operations in industrial and trade development including
a North Africa multinational operation, Maghreb Invest IV,
and a West Africa multinational project, the Verod Capital
Management Fund. On the sovereign front, the Rwanda
Innovation Fund will support SMEs in the innovation and
information and communication technology sectors.

The Bank's Board approved the Non-Sovereign Operations
(NSO) Policy in September 2018. The NSO policy provides
the framework for the Bank, through its private sector lending
window, to provide financing or investments without sovereign
guarantees to private and public entities that meet specific
eligibility requirements on non-concessional terms. The
objective is to help accelerate the continent's transformation
by offering various financial support mechanisms and products,
including loans, lines of credit, guarantees, blended finance,
equity investments, and trade finance. The Bank’s engagement
in selected NSOs will help scale up financing for the Bank's High
5 priorities, with the aim of maximizing the catalytic impact of
its limited resources, while seeking to promote inclusive growth
and the gradual transition to “green growth” in its RMCs.Marrakesh-Menara airport, Morocco

Integrate Africa

Approvals for Integrate Africa totaled UA 783 million in 2018,
an increase of 11 percent over 2017. To accelerate trade
facilitation, the Bank has invested more than USD 20 million
over the past five years in trade agreement support and in
cross-border transport, and energy soft infrastructure. In 2018,
the Bank provided robust support to the progress of the
African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), which
has the potential to create new markets for African companies
(particularly SMEs), boost efficiency and sales, increase foreign
direct investment, reduce input costs, and spur economic
growth. The Bank is also committing itself to build the
institutional and human capacities of the AfCFTA Secretariat.

In collaboration with the African Union Commission, the Bank
developed the Africa Visa Openness Index, which measures
how open African countries are to travel by citizens from other
African countries. The index tracks changes in country scores
over time and is intended to encourage countries to facilitate
the free movement of people across Africa. Some progress
has been made on visa openness in the last few years, with
travel on the continent becoming easier and Africans needing
visas to travel to fewer countries.

In March 2018, the Boards of Directors approved the
Regional Integration Strategic Framework covering 2018-25.
The Framework is anchored on three pillars: infrastructure
connectivity, trade and investment, and financial integration.

In its knowledge work, the Bank released key publications,
including the annual Africa Visa Openness Index and
Africa to Africa Investment: A First Look. It also supported
industrial policy initiatives and studies with a focus on
regional integration, such as a study on the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, and a feasibility study for the Central Africa
Backbone ICT connectivity project.Multinational Transport

Multinational transport projects amounted to UA 619
million and represented 79 percent of 2018 Integrate Africa
approvals. The African Infrastructure Investment Fund, a
multinational, multisector investment fund (UA 28.9 million),
will invest in core and core-plus infrastructure opportunities—
notably in transport, logistics, and power—and pursue equity
and equity-like investments along the project lifecycle. The
Fund will focus on acquiring a significant position in roads,
airports, rail links, bridges, ports, logistics, power generation,
utility distribution, and telecommunication. The project has a
13+2-year term and is expected to make 10-14 investments
during its 5+2-year investment period, following a
geographical and sectoral diversification strategy. The
expected social and environmental impacts will be achieved
by supporting energy and transport access, while reducing
carbon dioxide emissions and supporting job creation,
capacity building, and skill transfers.

Among the multinational transport projects, it is worth noting
the Kampala—Jinja Expressway Phase | project lies on a section
of the Northern Corridor in Uganda. Given its location, this
road section is a key driver of not only national development
but also regional integration, providing core transport
linkages to landlocked neighbors Burundi, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and South Sudan and access to
the sea through the port of Mombasa in Kenya.

932-meter road and rail bridge over the Zambezi River and
10 kilometers of approach and access roads. Other projects
with multinational impacts are the Mauritania-Senegal Rosso
bridge and the Trans-Gambia Bridge (Box 2.5).

As part of its knowledge work, the Bank produced the Traffic
Impact Assessment guidelines for African cities, to meet safe
and inclusive urban mobility needs. And it carried out a study
of the socioeconomic benefits of side-constructions of major
road projects—for medical centers, boreholes, swing bridges,
and equipment for women and children—and an impact

Budget support received the second largest share of approvals
(18 percent), less than half its 2017 share, because of the sharper
focus on water and sanitation. The Bank Group strengthened
its collaboration with water sector partners, and it launched the
Africa Urban Sanitation Investment Fund with the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation and other development banks to fund urban
sanitation projects in 19 countries over the next four years.

Water and Sanitation

In 2018, the Bank Group approved 17 water and sanitation
projects in 13 countries for UA 691.8 million, more than twice
the approvals in 2017 (UA 337 million).

Urban Development

Urban transport represented 22 percent of all transport
approvals in 2018, including the Abidjan Urban Transport
Project in Céte d'Ivoire, which will build the fourth
bridge over the Ebrié lagoon, 89 intersections, and 88
kilometers of expressways. The project directly links the
business and administrative centers to the country’s most
densely populated suburb. It is expected that 2 million
commuters will benefit yearly from the improved infrastructure.

Information and Communication Technology

In 2018, the Bank continued to refine its approach toward
ICT operations with greater emphasis on lending support
for e-government and innovation to build African content
and services. Moving forward, the Bank expects to support
targeted interventions in broadband deployment and data
infrastructure through its non-sovereign operations. Technical
assistance to governments will prioritize digital identification
and regional policy frameworks for data privacy and security.

In 2018, the Bank extended a loan of USD 30 million to the
Government of Rwanda for the creation of the Rwanda
Innovation Fund. The fund will invest in growth technologyenabled ventures across Africa, and the Government will
invest a further USD 8 million in a technical assistance pool
to develop new businesses. In addition, the Bank concluded
funding arrangements totaling EUR 30 million with the
European Union to support connectivity projects in Chad
and Niger.

Technical assistance funding was provided for the preparation
of feasibility studies for e-government infrastructure projects
in Gabon and Lesotho, for a technology park in Ethiopia,
and for agriculture hackathons in Céte d'Ivoire and Rwanda.
The Bank also convened an Economic Community of West
African States regulatory workshop in Abidjan and provided
e-procurement training in collaboration with the Korean

 

Public Procurement Service.

The Bank launched a study on the Fourth Industrial Revolution
(4IR) in Africa funded by Korea—Africa Economic Cooperation
resources. The study will identify bankable business cases
for the use of 4IR technologies, such as blockchain, artificial
intelligence, and big data analytics.

Human Capital, Youth, and Skill Development

The Bank Group continued to implement the Jobs for Youth in
Africa Strategy (2016-25) and to emphasize skills development
and jobs—especially for Africa’s youth. The new Rockefeller
Trust Fund (USD 2 million) started a Bank partnership with
Microsoft philanthropy and Facebook to provide technical
collaboration for the Bank’s new Coding for Employment

flagship. The target is to create 130 coding centers in Africa
by 2023 to benefit more than 243,000 youth by 2025.

The Bank is strengthening efforts to integrate and mainstream
the Jobs Strategy through all the other High 5s. In 2018, the
Bank approved 112 projects (63 percent of total projects)
amounting to investments of approximately UA 5 billion, with
components that will directly support the creation of more
than 1.5 million jobs over the next five years. Fragile and lower
income countries will generate 72 percent of the total direct
jobs expected. Most of these results will be from agriculture
(33 percent), multisectoral (32 percent), and transport
(18 percent) projects. The projects will also support more
than 237,000 SMEs and develop the skills of more than
655,000 youth.

To promote human development outcomes, the Bank
approved 14 standalone operations amounting to
UA 288.6 million in 2018. The UA 70 million Morocco
Results-Based Program will provide market-based skills for
495,000 vocational school students, link 180,000 job seekers
to placement interviews, facilitate workplace internships for
165,000 trainees, and improve the insertion rate of vocational
training graduates into the job market within six months
of graduation from 63 percent in 2018 to 68 percent by
2021. The UA 49.8 million Senegal Emergency Community
Development Program Support Project will improve access
to health infrastructure for 300,000 vulnerable people
(51 percent of them women), and create 30,000 direct jobs by
2025. The project will also reduce chronic malnutrition rates
from 21 percent to 8 percent over the next decade.

The Bank increased its efforts in convening partnerships
to strengthen entrepreneurship ecosystems in Africa. The
Youth Entrepreneurship and Innovation Multi-Donor Trust
Fund increased from USD 4.4 million in 2017 to almost USD
40 million in commitments in 2018. By providing technical
assistance through enterprise support organizations and
financial institutions in Africa, the fund is expected to reach
more than 480 youth-led startups in Ghana, Mali, Nigeria,
Togo, and Zimbabwe. The Fund for African Private Sector
Assistance (the Government of Japan, the Government of
Austria, and the Development Bank of Austria) has initiated
support to develop an innovation lab e-platform as a one-stop
continent-wide marketplace for entrepreneurs, incubators,
accelerators, business mentors, and investors across Africa.

 

The Bank conducted a study on the status of science,
technology, and innovation in Africa to help policy formulation
in RMCs. Additionally, it published Youth Entrepreneurship

18 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

and Africa's Sustainable Industrialization with support from
the Japan Trust Fund, a document examining the relationship
between education and skill development of entrepreneurs.

Health, Nutrition, and Social Protection

The Bank Group approved four projects in health, nutrition,
and social protection for a total of UA 116 million in 2018. An
African Development Fund grant of UA 88.7 million provided
supplementary financing to the Basic Services Transformation
Program in Ethiopia. Over its 10 years, the program has
increased net school enrollments from 77.5 percent to
99 percent, reduced child mortality from 72 per 1,000 to 20,
and improved rural water supply coverage from 46 percent
to 74 percent. The supplementary financing will allow the
Government to expand basic services, mainly in pastoral and
underserved regions.

As part of its knowledge brokering, the Bank hosted the
African Leaders for Nutrition Initiative to engage decision
makers in the fight to end malnutrition in Africa, which the
African Union endorsed. Supporting the African Union's
commitment to end hunger in Africa by 2025, the initiative
aims to stimulate accountability and financial commitments
for nutrition. The Bank also launched the Multi-Sectoral
Nutrition Action Plan, which acts as a “how-to guide” for
implementing the nutrition aspects of the Bank's Feed Africa
and Human Capital Strategies. The plan will contribute to
building a continent-wide grey matter infrastructure through
its contribution to a 40 percent reduction in stunting on the
continent by 2025.

Results by High 5 Priority

The High 5s remain highly relevant to Africa’s development
agenda and the progress of the SDGs. A United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) analysis concluded that
there is close to a 90 percent overlap in the coverage of
Agenda 2063, the SDGs, and the High 5s. Table 2.2 presents

Cross-Cutting Areas

Countries in Situations of Fragility

The Bank fulfills its mandate in fragile situations by increasing
the resources devoted to responding to the growing
challenges of fragility in Africa and assisting countries in
transition to build peaceful, resilient economies and to lay
the foundations for inclusive growth. In 2018, the Transition
Support Facility, the main vehicle for financing interventions
in countries in fragile situations, approved UA 215.7 million
from Pillar | (supplemental resources for national, regional,
and private sector operations to support countries in their
state-building efforts) for 22 operations. The Bank also
approved UA 8.8 million from Pillar Ill (support to critical
capacity-building interventions and technical assistance that
cannot be adequately addressed through traditional projects
and instruments) for eight operations. More than half the
approvals supported agriculture (27.8 percent) and transport
operations (25.6 percent).

The Bank financed a project to build a pipeline of bankable
projects in transition states. The project's final aim was to
attract and facilitate Korean foreign direct investment into
countries in transition by identifying investment opportunities,
providing investment advisory services to selected project
sponsors, and providing them with a platform to secure
financing from Korean, African, and international investors.
To this end, five projects were featured during the Africa
Investment Forum in Johannesburg in November, and initial
expressions of interest were secured for two of them.

The Country Resilience and Fragility Assessment, piloted in
2017, became fully operational in 2018. It allows the Bank to
use several indicators to systematically and objectively assess
fragility risks and resilience sources for all RMCs. The assessment
is a high-quality benchmark, that informs the Bank’s country
strategy papers, policy papers, and project and program
development to ensure maximum effectiveness in fighting
fragility and building resilience. Five fragility assessments were
conducted in 2018.

Promoting Gender Equality and
Civil Society Engagement

In 2018, the Bank rolled out its Gender Marker System to
systematize, monitor, and promote gender mainstreaming in
its operations, with gender specialists as part of project teams
and more Bank operations, including gender analysis and
action plans. By the end of 2018, 40 percent of public sector
Bank operations had been organized under the Gender

In 2018, the Bank developed a pan-African gender data
aggregator website as a prototype that will be launched in
2019. The Bank also developed an Africa Gender Index in
partnership with the United Nations Economic Commission
for Africa. The gender index measures parity between women
and men across three dimensions—economic, social, and
representation—to inform Bank policy dialogue at the national
level. Each dimension includes multiple indicators.

The Bank joined the Global Partnership for Gender Equality in
the Digital Age to help increase access to science and digital
technology for women and girls. To further promote innovations
in agricultural technology that help close the gender gap, it
also partnered with African Women in Agricultural Research
and Development to launch a new program, Gender in
Agribusiness Investments for Africa.

To support the High 5s and the objectives of the Ten-Year
Strategy, the Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa
(AFAWA) will extend financing through commercial banks
and financial intermediaries, provide technical assistance to
women and banks, and engage policy and regulatory bodies
to enhance the enabling environment. In a second phase,
the Bank will publish ratings of banks, based on the quality
of lending to women, to incentivize good lending practices.

The Bank organized a series of internal awareness consultations
on civil society and community engagement to raise awareness
among, and obtain feedback from Bank staff. The Civil Society
Forum 2018 on engaging civil society in accelerating Africa’s
industrialization, brought together more than 350 participants
from civil society, international organizations, the private sector,
and social entrepreneurs. The forum provided an opportunity
for enhanced multistakeholder dialogue as well as the
strengthening of engagement with civil society in the Bank's
policies and operations.Supporting Governance and Accountability

Program-based operations are the Bank's main instrument
to support reforms and policies strengthening economic
and financial governance. During 2018, the Bank approved
16 such operations for total approvals of UA 1.13 billion.
It also supported strengthening institutional capacity for
enhanced governance and accountability through nine new
institutional support projects for a total of UA 113 million,
bringing total approvals for governance (multisectoral)
operations to UA 1.25 billion.

The Bank's governance work focused on strengthening
macroeconomicmanagementandpublicfinancial management
at the country level. It gave particular priority to domestic
revenue mobilization, especially in African Development Fund
countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where
the Bank approved a project to strengthen tax administration
and enhance the national audit office’s capacity. The project is
expected to enhance capacity of revenue collection authorities,
with the aim of tripling the volume of taxes collected.

For Egypt, the Bank approved the third and final phase of the
Economic Governance and Energy Support Program-Based
Operation (PBO), to support fiscal consolidation, reduction of
energy subsidies, containment of the public wage bill, budget
transparency, and energy sector governance. For Namibia, the
Bank approved the second and final phase of the Economic
Governance and Competitiveness Support Program, which
aims to support Namibia's business environment efforts.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS THROUGH A HIGH 5 LENS | 2

In 2018, the Bank approved a UA 2 million grant to support
the African Peer Review Mechanism from the Regional
Public Goods Window. The project will enable the review
mechanism’s Secretariat to support Regional Member
Countries implementing its recommendations while
maximizing opportunities for sharing experiences and best
practice. The two phases of a PBO approved for Niger in
2018 exemplify Bank support for good governance. Phase II,
with a UA 20 million approval, aims to support accelerated
economic growth, with a focus on building the country’s
resilienwce to climate shocks. The program's contribution
includes greater tax revenue mobilization and improved
transparency and efficiency in the procurement system.

Climate Change

The Bank Group enhanced its capacity to mainstream climate
change into its operations, mobilize climate finance at scale,
and increase its support to African countries on implementing
their climate commitments. In 2018, it significantly increased
its share of climate finance to 32 percent of approvals, from
28 percent in 2017 (Figure 2.5). It is on track to meet its 2020
target of 40 percent, the most ambitious of any multilateral
development bank, in line with the Climate Change Action
Plan Il. The Bank mobilized USD 337 million from global
climate finance facilities—USD 55 million from the Global
Environment Facility, USD 169 million from the Green Climate
Fund, and USD 113 million from the Climate Investment Funds—
to co-finance projects in energy, agriculture, and forestry.

Other achievements include the Bank’s investment in 14
national climate centers to generate and use high-quality
climate data for severe weather forecasts and disaster risk
management. The investments provide early warning systems
to cover weather-related disasters and benefit at least 300
million people living in vulnerable areas. The Bank also
supported the establishment of a Regional Climate Centre
for the Economic Community of Central African States in
Cameroon. The Africa Nationally Determined Contributions
Hub, launched by the Bank in 2017, provides technical
assistance to RMCs. To encourage African financial institutions
to shift their portfolios toward climate-resilient and low-carbon
investments, the Bank launched the African Financial Alliance
for Climate. At the Conference of the Parties (COP) 24 Climate
Change Conference in Katowice, Poland, the Bank deepened
its engagement with partners and positioned itself to attract
more resources for RMCs.

Regional Portfolio and Approvals

The Bank Group's active portfolio as of 31 December 2018
stood at UA 38.07 billion (Table 2.3). The Bank Group's
approvals for 2018 amounted to UA 7.28 billion. Figure 2.6
shows the share of approvals by region.

Central Africa

Bank Group approvals for Central Africa in 2018 totaled UA
688 million, confirming steady growth of 57 percent since
2013 (with an exceptional spike in 2017 for large multinational
projects and budget support for Gabon). Cameroon's
debt ceiling constrained lending in 2018 and hindered
multinational projects between Cameroon and Chad.
Even so, projects in Cameroon and Gabon accounted for

represented 36 percent of approvals, transport 23 percent,
and economic and financial reforms 20 percent.

Even though processing delays affected a few operations,
South Africa still had three times its 2017 approvals at UA 383

borrowing, and substantial private sector financing explain
the doubling of approvals over 2017. Approvals went up for
all 15 RMCs but one (Guinea). The largest shares of approvals
were for transport operations (34 percent) and finance (23
percent). Approvals in support of economic and financial
reforms accounted for only 8 percent, the lowest in any region.

Strengthening
Institutional _
ManagementThe Management continued to implement the Development
and Business Delivery Model (DBDM) and _ associated
improvements in business processes, organization, and
institutional capacity. As part of the adoption of the DBDM, the
Bankhasrenewedeffortstowardseamless delivery ofoperations,
based on improved collaboration among sector complexes,
between complexes and regions, and between public
sector and non-sovereign operations—across Headquarters,
Regional, and Country Offices. The first African Investment
Forum was a good demonstration of the “One Bank” model
in the way that it brought together many parts of the Bank—
both operational and corporate services—thus contributing
to its great success.

Business Process Reforms

The Delivery, Accountability and Process Efficiency Committee
completed its work proposing process and systemic reforms
to Management to improve the Bank's effectiveness and
efficiency. The budget process was improved, the Delegation
of Authority Matrix was aligned with the objectives of the
DBDM, and the Bank continued to implement its Digital
Strategy for 2017-20.

Several initiatives were implemented in 2018 to improve resource
planning and allocation. These support the Bank’s commitment
to accountable and efficient resource planning, allocation,
and utilization to achieve effective delivery and results. The
Bank revamped its work program planning and budgeting
tool (Strategic Resources Assessment Software—SRAS) with a
user-friendly web-based interface. Its integration with the Bankwide Program Processing Schedule (BPPS) system facilitates
continuous planning by the Bank's organizational units.

In addition, to serve as the basis for the 2019 budget planning
exercise, budget coefficients (unit costs for each deliverable)
are being computed from the cost accounting system. The
revised Delegation of Authority Matrix, which increases
accountability, has also improved flexibility during budget
implementation. To further enhance data quality and improve
decision making, the Bank continued to emphasize adequate
control, monitoring, and reporting. The Bank benchmarked
these initiatives against development partner practices.
Bank-wide dissemination and capacity building initiatives
supported these changes.

In line with implementing the DBDM, the Delegation of
Authority Matrix was revised and approved to devolve greater
decision making to the Regional and Country Offices. The
change enables the Bank Group to respond faster to its clients.
With 41 country offices, the Bank Group now has a greater
presence in Regional Member Countries (RMCs). Management
developed the Country Manager Exchange Training Program

STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT | 3

to respond to challenges in Regional and Country Offices,
some identified through evaluations, and office and portfolio
audits. The program will support exchanges of experiences
on challenges faced and communications on past solutions.
The various reforms and improvements presented above will
strengthen the Bank's fitness for purpose.

The implementation of the Bank Group's Digital Strategy
continued in 2018 to build an information technology
infrastructure that supports the DBDM, the realization of the
High 5s, and the digitization of the Bank:

¢ Digital networks were implemented at Headquarters,
in the regions, and in 32 country offices in readiness for
digitizing the Bank and improving Bank network routing,
availability, and reliability.

e An information technology operations center has been
set up to increase active monitoring of all information
technology infrastructure in the Bank’s offices and improve
its availability and performance.

e A secondary satellite hub set up in South Africa is
expected to improve the connectivity resilience of the
Bank's network infrastructure.

e The Bank's applications platform and systems are being
upgraded. The Bank Group is in the process of upgrading
SAP, its backbone Information Technology system, to
a more powerful and user-friendly version called the
SAP4/Hana, as part of a Bank-wide business process
re-engineering and improvement project code-named
Project WAKANDA.

With 41 country offices, the Bank
Group now has a greater presence
in Regional Member Countries.
Country Offices are being staffed

with the right mix of skill sets.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT 273 | STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT

¢ Improved decision-making tools and dashboards, “on
demand" websites and cross-functional applications, and an
improved environment for collaboration (including external
users) support the Corporate, Finance, and Operations
Complexes.

¢ Mobile applications now support events, such as the
Annual Meetings, Conference of Parties (COP 24) climate
conference participation, and the Africa Investment Forum.

These strategic changes allow the Bank to improve
communications and outreach, and present its financial and
knowledge services through an enhanced digital service on the
web. They leverage the capacity of the staff of the Corporate,
Finance, and Operations Complexes towards the vision of a
smart, efficient, and digital Bank.

Sharpening the Focus
on Development Impact

The Bank's Results Measurement Framework (RMF) underpins
its principles and approach to development as both an
accountability tool—with metrics aligned to the High 5s and
the DBDM—and a blueprint for strengthening impact. The
2018 Annual Development Effectiveness Review, focused
on Industrialize Africa, showed the Bank delivering on its
commitment to help Africa develop and progress toward
its development and operational targets. The Framework
continues to reinforce the Bank's organizational effectiveness
as it scales up its operations.

The Bank delivered Country Results Briefs on Egypt and
Mozambique in 2018, grounded on the RMF. The briefs analyzed
the development impact of Bank-supported interventions. The
development impact approach traces how Bank investments
flow through an economy and measures the corresponding
development impacts, particularly on job creation. Scaling up
an East African pilot, the Bank is developing an approach with
improved methods and rigor for reporting on jobs, which will
include all RMCs, and be applied to studies for priority sectors.
Another innovative approach piloted for infrastructure operations
relies on high-resolution mapping to assess the changes in
people's lives before and after project implementation.

The Bank continued to enhance transparency and disclosure.
The 2018 Aid Transparency Index Report ranked the Bank
Ath of 45 development organizations. The ranking, up from
10th in 2016, reflects the Bank's operational capabilities
and the efficacy of its systems and processes, including a
strict adherence to best-in-class reporting and disclosure
of its programs, projects, aid, and financial interventions.
Building on its work with the International Aid Transparency
Initiative, the Bank launched the data projects portal, a new

28 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

web platform designed to support the Bank's development
effectiveness, and enhance transparency.

In 2018, the Bank launched MapAfrica 3.0, an interactive
platform that maps the Bank's investments in Africa (https://
mapafrica.afdb.org/). It enables users to navigate through
Bank-funded projects by country, sector, and approval year
or simply to zoom in on a specific region or country. More
than 160 project results briefs are also available, providing a
snapshot of development results for specific interventions.

Management and the Bank's Independent Evaluation
Department are implementing a management action record
system that tracks management actions to implement
recommendations made in independent evaluations.
Since introducing the system in 2017, the Bank has steadily
increased its rate of actions completed in response to
recommendations from 32 percent to 58 percent (Figure
3.1). In doing so, Management pays particular attention to
the stock of actions that are delayed and conducts proactive

To optimize the impact of the Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022
on Africa's transition toward sustainable development,
the Bank's integrated safeguards system mainstreams
sustainability considerations into its operations. The system
supports RMC progress toward environmentally sustainable
and socially inclusive economic growth.

STRENGTHENING INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT | 3

In 2018, the Bank performed environmental and social due
diligence for 168 projects approved in 2018 and 80 projects in
its ongoing portfolio. Environmental and social assessment
procedures are being updated to align with the DBDM and
assure consistency between new and streamlined business
processes and accountability mechanisms.

Replenishment and Partnerships

The informal ADF-15 Working Group met twice in 2018 on
the 15th replenishment of the African Development Fund
and presented its conclusions in October 2018. In line with
the billions-to-trillions agenda, the group studied options
to leverage African Development Fund equity. Participants
emphasized the importance of maintaining the African
Development Fund's core mandate as a concessional fund
focused on the poorest countries, and countries in situations
of fragility while preserving recipients’ debt sustainability and
protecting the fund's long-term financial sustainability.

Representatives from the African Development Fund and
donor countries met in October with Management in Kigali,
Rwanda, for the Mid-Term Review of the 14th replenishment
of the fund (ADF-14). President Adesina thanked donors

In 2018, the Bank in close collaboration with key
partners held the inaugural edition of the Africa
Investment Forum, demonstrating the Bank’s
leadership and vision. The Forum is dedicated

to advancing projects to bankable stage, raising
capital and accelerating the financial closure of
deals. As an innovative multistakeholder regional
investment platform, the Forum aligns with the
Bank Group’s High 5s to accelerate achievement of
the Africa Union's Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable
Development Goals by mobilizing resources to close
Africa's infrastructure investment gap, estimated
at USD 68-108 billion annually.

for their continued support and confirmed that ADF-14
commitments are on track, with the agreed strategic and
operational objectives being met. The discussions emphasized
the African Development Fund's continuing relevance in support
of low-income African countries, especially those in situations of
fragility.

The Bank continues to intensify its efforts to diversify and expand
its partnerships and to mobilize additional resources. In 2018, it
deepened its engagement with partners on the management
of the trust fund portfolio and enhanced reporting on the use of
partner resources, with specific attention to impact and results.
Within the Bank, awareness campaigns for user departments
addressed leveraging trust funds for higher impact in RMCs
and actively managing the portfolio. The Bank moved to
finalize the accreditation policy to train trust fund managers.

In 2018, the Bank mobilized UA 168.6 million through bilateral,
thematic, and multi-donor trust funds (Table 3.1).

Under the Africa Growing Together Fund, USD 293 million
was approved in 2018 to enable the Bank Group to scale up
its operations in energy, transport, and water and sanitation
in Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Kenya, and Morocco, bringing
total financing from the fund to USD 685 million.

Africa Investment Forum

The Bank also championed the inaugural Africa Investment
Forum, a collaborative platform for the economic and social
development of the continent (Box 3.1). The forum is a
transactional marketplace for advancing projects to bankable
stages, raising capital, and accelerating the financial closure of
deals. The first forum was a success: 49 deals secured USD 38.7
billion of investor interest (compared with total foreign direct
investment in Africa of USD 42 billion in 2017).

External Representation

The External Representation Office for Asia initiated a pilot
project on the use of drones in agricultural development
projects in Tunisia, with funding from Korea—Africa Economic
Cooperation. The project will focus on agricultural operations
in Sidi Bouzid in central Tunisia, and use drones to collect data
and monitor agricultural production, along with biodiversity,
the effects of climate change, and the management of natural
resources.

Human Resources

The Bank group was ranked as the 4th best company to work
for in Africa out of 100 corporate and multilateral organizations
in the 2018 Careers in Africa Employer of Choice Survey. Thiswas a considerable improvement from 82nd in 2015, and a
notch higher than Sth place in 2017.

The Bank's ambitious agenda requires attracting and retaining
a strong workforce with the right skills mix and a new way of
working. To this end, 329 staff were added through external
recruitment, reducing the executive and professional level
vacancy rate from 27 percent to 15 percent and the overall
gross vacancy rate from 24 percent to 14 percent over 2018
(Table 3.2). The number of consultants in December 2018 was
683. A cohort of 30 young professionals were onboarded in
2018 to start a three-year program at the Bank.

To implement the DBDM and decentralization plans, the
Bank continues its efforts to grow regional and country office
capacity. Staff in the field increased from 657 in 2015 to 754 in
2018, and country-based staff now account for 39 percent of
the total Bank staff.

Diversity through gender, language, andregional representation
continued as important considerations in recruitment. Some 38
percent of new hires were women. The proportion of women
in management roles stood at 26 percent, against a target of
28 percent. The proportion of women in professional roles
reached the target of 30 percent in 2018. To improve further,
management will increase efforts to attract female candidates.
As part of its recruitment drive, the Bank conducted 12 career
fairs in RMCs and in Non-Regional Countries.

Bank-wide workshops familiarized managers and staff with
the refreshed high-performance management system and
process, and reinforced the Bank's delivery culture. Several
corporate training programs, including in-house programs,

were delivered across all Complexes. The Bank implemented
automated processes for education grants,
management, and staff advancement to improve efficiency.
The roadmap for an integrated human resources system is
currently being implemented.

leave

Other measures included the 2018 performance-based merit
increase for all staff and the market adjustment for locally
recruited staff. The Board approved these measures, which
were designed to differentiate and reward top performance,
while keeping Bank compensation competitive in attracting
and retaining the best talent.

The Bank as a Knowledge Broker

In 2018, the Bank strengthened its knowledge activities
and services by generating analytical and policy-relevant
research; gathering statistics and building statistical capacity;
and developing policy dialogue and capacity. Knowledge
work, disseminated through publications, workshops, and
capacity-building activities, supports effective policy making
in RMCs.

Research Activities

Research activities in 2018 supported the Bank's operations
with analytical input and fulfilled a broader role of knowledge
and advisory services for RMCs, policy makers, and the
knowledge community. The African Economic Outlook
2018, the Bank's flagship knowledge product, focused on
macroeconomic developments and tools for infrastructure
financing. Available in English, French, and Portuguese, the
report was supplemented by five regional outlooks, with

highlights available in three of the most widely read and
spoken languages in Africa—Arabic, Hausa, and Swahili. The
African Economic Outlook was launched in January 2018 at
the Bank's Headquarters and was among the first to provide
headline numbers on Africa’s macroeconomic performance
and outlook.

The Bank supported RMCs with macroeconomic models to
provide the analytical groundwork for programs. In collaboration
with International Monetary Fund counterparts, the Bank is
building a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model,
customized for African economies to account for the structural
peculiarities affecting the region's economies. It continued
implementing the project on the structural transformation of
African agriculture and rural spaces. Additionally, the Bank's
economic reports on Sudan and Zimbabwe provided analysis
to support post-sanctions policy frameworks.

Cutting-edge research outputs included such reports as
Unleashing the Potential of Institutional Investors in Africa,
and Strategic Approach for Climate Finance by Strengthening
Sustainable Financial Systems in Africa.

Overall, the Bank's knowledge products have had a major
impact. RePEc (Research Papers in Economics), a reputable
global depository of economic knowledge, ranked the Bank 7th
among almost 300 Africa-based economic and development
research institutions in 2018, far better than 28th in 2014. In the

of the African Development Review—the Bank's academic
journal—improved from 1.0 in 2017 to 1.6 in 2018.

Statistical Knowledge Products and Activities

The Bank remained committed to improving statistics and
statistical capacity in RMCs in 2018, focusing especiallyon progress on the High 5s. Through the Action Plan for
Improving Agricultural and Rural Statistics, the Bank helped 50
RMCs compile the minimum core agricultural data needed to
inform agricultural policies. In addition, the Africa Infrastructure
Knowledge Program projected energy investment
requirements for RMCs to achieve universal access by 2025.
Similar projections for the other infrastructure sectors—
transport, information and communications technology,
and water and sanitation—show that Africa needs about
USD 130-170 billion a year in investments for infrastructure
development. As part of Africa Information Highway (AIH)
activities, the Statistics Department undertook technical
assistance missions to Angola, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde,
Egypt, Gambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Togo, Rwanda, and Zambia
and organized similar training for Bank staff.

Complementary activities on national accounts and statistical
business registers in Botswana, Eswatini, Malawi, Namibia,
and Zambia were crucial to improving the measurement of
economic activities. Moreover, the Strategy for Harmonization
of Statistics in Africa (SHaSA.2) developed under the Bank’s
leadership is now the official pan-African strategy for statistical
development.

Capacity Development

In 2018, the Bank's African Development Institute, a key
knowledge broker for policy dialogue with RMCs, gathered
an impressive audience of academics, development
practitioners, diplomats, and other stakeholders for its Kofi
Annan Eminent Speaker Lecture Series. His Royal Highness
Muhammadu Sanusi Il, the Emir of Kano, Nigeria; Nobel
Laureates Ouided Bouchamaoui and Leymah Roberta
Gbowee, and Her Excellency Graga Machel delivered the
year’s speeches. Landmark lectures on development thinking
in Africa by leading speakers addressed such topics as girl
child education, the empowerment of women, and regional
integration. More generally, the institute addressed the topics
of mobilizing financial resources, enhancing the effectiveness
of a medium-term expenditure framework, and designing an
integrated financial information system for managing public
revenue and expenditure.

Natural Resources Management

The African Natural Resources Center, established to catalyze
growth and development in RMCs through effectively
managing natural resources, has cemented its position
as a center of excellence supporting African countries. In
2018, it provided technical support for implementing the
Mozambique Natural Capital Program, identifying key
ecological infrastructure and establishing an inter-agency
natural capital working group.

The center also mobilized USD 1.95 million in 2018,
including a USD 1.4 million multi-year grant from the African
Development Fund for strengthening domestic resource
mobilization in resource-rich fragile states through financial
modeling for the extractive sector.

AfDB Reports and PublicationsBoards of Governors

The Boards of Governors are the highest decisionmaking organs of the African Development Bank and African
Development Fund, with representation from each of the
80 member countries. The Boards of Governors elect the 20
members of the Board of Directors and the President of the
Bank Group to oversee the management of the institution.
Governors execute their mandate with the support of five
subsidiary organs: The Bureau, the Joint Steering Committee,
the Steering Committee on the Election of the President
of the Bank, the Standing Committee on the Conditions of
Service of Elected Officers, and the Governors’ Consultative
Committee (GCC).

The activities of the Boards of Governors in 2018 included
Annual Meetings of the Bank Group, the Consultative
Meetings of Governors of each of the five regions of the Bank,
and the 16th meeting of the GCC.

Highlights of the 2018 Annual Meetings

The 53rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the
African Development Bank and the 44th Annual Meetings of
the Board of Governors of the African Development Fund were
held jointly on 21-25 May 2018 in Busan, Korea. The theme of
the meetings was “Accelerating Africa's Industrialization.”

In exercising their statutory duties, the Boards of Governors
adopted the Annual Report and audited financial statements
for the financial year ended 31 December 2017. In addition,
they adopted resolutions on:

e The by-election of the Executive Directors of the African
Development Bank.

e The selection of the Executive Directors of the African
Development Fund.

e Allocation and distribution of the allocable income of the
African Development Bank for the financial year ended
31 December 2017.

BOARDS’ OVERSIGHT | 4

Following the request of the Boards of Governors, the Bank
in late 2018 launched an independent evaluation of the
implementation of the DBDM in order to evaluate the model's
contributions to the Bank’s efficiency and effectiveness.

Governors’ Dialogue: Forward Look
for the Bank Group

The Governors’ Dialogue at the Annual Meetings gave the
President an opportunity to discuss the Bank Group's future role
in the global development agenda, the Bank’s performance,
and approaches to ensure improvements. The Governors
reiterated their commitment to the economic development
and social transformation of the African continent and, in that
connection, underscored the need for:

e An adequately capitalized, effective, and efficient African
Development Bank.

e An independent review of the recent institutional reforms
and the results achieved—to inform the GCC discussions
ona possible GCI-VII.

e Accelerated implementation of the ongoing institutional
reforms. The Governors urged Management to build a
stronger performance culture, enhance accountability
and efficiency, strengthen risk management, fill vacancies
in priority positions, consolidate the Bank’s capacity to
develop a robust projects pipeline, deliver high quality
operations that have an impact on the ground, and
provide value for money in the Bank's work.

¢ Continued use of renewable energy for achieving inclusive
economic growth and transformative industrialization.

¢ Sustained focus on the climate agenda and a stronger
commitment to gender equality.

¢ Sustained support to the private sector in RMCs, primarily
through lending and support for policy and regulatory
reforms that foster a business-friendly environment.

¢ Greater support to RMCs to improve domestic resource
mobilization and public financial management and stem
the tide of illicit financial flows.

¢ Speedy implementation of the Bank Group’s Jobs for
Youth initiative to help stem migration from the continent.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT 354| BOARDS’ OVERSIGHT

Possible Capital Increase for the African
Development Bank

The GCC convened for its 16th meeting on 5 December 2018
in Rome, where it began discussions on a possible GCI-VII for
the African Development Bank. It noted the Bank’s successful
implementation of all 36 reform commitments made to
shareholders in 2010 in the context of the Sixth General Capital
Increase (GCI-VI). It also noted the Bank's role in mobilizing
development assistance, through financial and non-financial
interventions, to support RMCs in building and enhancing
infrastructure, strengthening the private sector, diversifying
economies, and enabling economic growth.

The GCC acknowledged that the Bank was approaching the
limits of its current resources and needed strengthening to
fulfill its mandate in partnership with other public and private
institutions. The GCC agreed to hold further discussions on
the margins of the World Bank-IMF spring meetings in April
2019 in Washington, DC.

Shareholder Support for a Capital Increase
for the African Development Bank

In the first half of 2018, the President and Senior Management
of the Bank Group held five separate consultative meetings
with Governors from the five African regions—Central, East,
North, Southern, and West. The Governors of the Bank's
African Member Countries agreed on the need for a positive
response to the call for a GCI-VIl. The President held similar
bilateral meetings with Governors of the Bank’s Non-Regional
Countries.

Boards of Directors

The resident Boards of Directors of the African Development
Bank and African Development Fund provide oversight to
Management and are responsible for the general operations
of the Bank Group, including preparing the work of the
Boards of Governors and acting on functions delegated by
the Governors. In addition to their primary oversight function,
members of the Boards of Directors perform critical advocacy
and representation roles for the Bank Group. The Bank Board
comprises 20 members, 13 representing the 54 RMCs and
seven, the 26 Non-Regional Member Countries. The Fund
Board comprises 14 members, with the Bank and the state
participants of the Fund each designating seven members.

In 2018, the Boards continued to build on 2017's achievements
by providing strategic and institutional direction to ensure
delivery of the High 5s and effective implementation of
ongoing reforms. These included strengthening the Bank's

36 2018 ANNUAL REPORT

human resource capacity, improving efficiency, and enhancing
development effectiveness. The Boards approved strategies,
policies, loans, grants, equity investments, guarantees, the
2019 work program and administrative budget, and the
2019 lending program. The Boards approved 179 projects,
totaling UA 7,255.6 million. In addition, Senior Management
approved technical assistance and other activities amounting to
UA 23.2 million.

Of the projects, 51 percent (16 percent by amount) were
approved through the lapse-of-time procedure, and the
remainder in plenary sessions.

To ensure the effectiveness of their operations, the Boards work
through seven standing committees to which they delegate
certain responsibilities (Figure 4.1 and Appendix 9). The Boards
approved the Strategic Framework for Regional Integration
revised to support the African Union's Vision 2063 through the
Bank's High 5s, strengthen infrastructure connectivity, increase
linkages and market connectivity, and support financial
integration and inclusion.

The Boards, through the Committee on Operations and
Development Effectiveness, oversaw two independent
evaluations of program-based operations and of quality
assurance, which provided a basis for the ADF-14 mid-term
review meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, on 24-26 October 2018.
ADF deputies welcomed the evaluation findings and noted
their critical importance for effectively using ADF resources.
They also welcomed the frank and open discussions on
achievements, challenges, and proposals to better define and
implement ADF strategic priorities. The Deputies agreed that
consultations on the 15th ADF replenishment (ADF-15) could
commence in March 2019.

 

Executive Directors undertook consultative missions to
Chad, Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia to engage governments,
development partners, the business community, and civil
society on the quality and relevance of the Bank's country
strategies; the socioeconomic and political challenges facing
the countries, as well as the efforts made by the respective
Governments to tackle them; the condition and status of
Bank Group's operations; and the Bank Group's contribution
to donor coordination and implementation of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Similarly, the Senior
Advisers and Advisers to Executive Directors undertook
study tours to Angola, Congo, Gambia, and Mauritania to
assess the progress of Bank Group-financed projects.BOARDS’ OVERSIGHT | 4

Evaluation at the Bank Group

The Independent Development Evaluation Department
(BDEV) at the African Development Bank is an independent
entity that enhances the Bank’s development effectiveness. By
conducting evaluations and proactively sharing best practices
(Figure 4.2), and by sharing knowledge through partnerships
across Africa, BDEV ensures that the Bank and its stakeholders learn from experience to plan and deliver development
activities to the highest possible standards.

In 2018, BDEV completed 15 evaluations, of which 10 were
also presented to the Boards: four project cluster evaluations
on Program Based Operations in energy and private sector
environment and the Bank's work on urban and rural water
supply and sanitation; three corporate evaluations on quality

Monitoring and Evaluation systems that improve government
performance.

Compliance, Accountability, and
Intermediate Recourse Mechanisms

Compliance

Compliance Review and Mediation

The Compliance Review and Mediation Unit (BCRM)
administers the Bank Group's Independent Review Mechanism
(IRM). The BCRM handled 12 complaints, submitted by
Non-Governmental Organizations and affected persons and
related to different Bank-financed public and private sector
operations. Three of these complaints were closed to the
satisfaction of the requestors. To enhance institutional learning,
the BCRM facilitated the IRM spot check advisory reviews that
investigated two high-risk private sector operations investing in
the forestry and gas industries. The IRM recommendations led
Management to adopt and implement rigorous action plans to
remedy harm inflicted on people, and to address problematic
systemic issues to avoid recurrence of non-compliance by
similar operations in future.

Ethics

In 2018, the Ethics Office undertook a Bank-wide sensitization
on the Code of Ethics, promulgated in April 2018, through
regular induction and outreach programs. The awareness on
expected ethical conduct targets officials and staff working
in the Bank and those involved in implementing its projects
in RMCs. In promoting a speak-up culture, the Office
encourages the reporting of incidents of unethical behavior.
Ethics advice was provided for 151 ethical dilemma cases
handled in 2018. In addition, the Office, in coordination with
Regional and Country Offices sensitized the Bank's project
management teams in 27 RMCs, to highlight their role in
uplifting the name, image, and reputation of the Bank. The
Office also developed Ethics Guidelines for Regional and
Country Offices and produced a booklet providing examples
of ethics dilemmas.Accountability and Control
Audit

In 2018, the Office of the Auditor General's work program
covered 22 activities in the Operations Complexes comprising
14 Country and Regional Offices’ audits, and eight projectrelated activities. It also carried out 20 assignments in the
Board, Presidency, Finance, and Corporate Complexes—and
provided client assistance (such as advisory assignments),
followed up on the implementation of past recommendations,
and pursued other program management activities.

Integrity and Anti-Corruption

In 2018, investigations by the Integrity and Anti-Corruption
(PIAC) Department in 44 cases were completed and closed,
compared with the target of 30 cases. The department
participated in 23 training and outreach activities in 13
countries involving 684 staff focused on the prevention of
fraud and corruption in Bank-financed activities. To enhance
integrity matters within the Bank, PIAC will continue to
engage in outreach and awareness creation with staff.

Recourse Mechanisms

Office of the Ombudsman

In 2018, 110 cases were brought to the attention of the Office
of the Ombudsman. Of those, 20 percent originated from
Headquarters, while the rest were from Regional and Country
Offices. All matters were closed within four weeks in line with
the agreed key performance indicators.

Administrative Tribunal

The Administrative Tribunal held one plenary session and two
judicial sessions. During the two judicial sessions, 11 applications
were determined and 13 judgments delivered.

BOARDS’ OVERSIGHT | 4

Staff Appeals Committee

The Staff Appeals Committee is part of the Bank's internal
recourse mechanism to resolve employment disputes
between staff and the Bank. The Committee comprises 12
members, including a Chairperson, an Alternate Chairperson,
five members nominated by the President, and five members
nominated by the Staff Representative Council. The Committee
received 22 appeals in 2018. The Committee heard nine
appeals and dismissed one as incompetent. Three appeals
were negotiated and withdrawn, and one was abandoned. The
remaining eight active appeals will be heard in 2019.

Sanctions Commissioner’s Office

In 2018, the Sanctions Commissioner's Office examined 11
sanctions cases, four were carried over from the previous
year. Eight of these cases involved allegations of fraudulent
practices in connection with the procurement of works and
services for Bank Group-financed operations in RMCs. Two
concerned allegations of collusion in connection with a bid,
and one involved an obstruction to the exercise of the Bank’s
inspection and audit right. Six cases were concluded, of which
three resulted in sanctions decisions.

Sanctions Appeals Board

The Sanctions Appeals Board ensures that the funds in projects
financed by the Bank are used for their intended purposes
and that businesses or individuals who practice corruption,
fraud, collusion, coercion, or obstruction are punished. The
Board rules on appeals against sanctions decisions issued
by the Sanctions Commissioner and reviews all appeals from
the beginning—and its decisions are final and binding. In
June 2018, Sanctions Appeals Board members organized
two sessions for the adoption of rules and procedures for the
Board's internal work.

Re] Reikovaaloy alas

African currency and trading operationsFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ABRIDGED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | 5

The overall financial performance of the Bank Group in 2018
remained strong. The Bank maintained its triple-A rating with
a stable outlook from all four global rating agencies. The
deficit for the African Development Fund (ADF), which had
widened in the previous year, came down sharply in 2018.
Income revenues for the Group's three lending windows were
higher than in 2017. These were, however, hit by the first-time
application of new impairment requirements and the effects
of volatile fair valuations.

Financial Results

While the African Development Bank (ADB) realized lower
income before distributions in 2018 compared with 2017, the
performance of NTF and the ADF continued to improve with
the deficit for the latter decreasing further during 2018 (Table
5.1). Apart from transfers to reserves, the Bank continued to

make distributions out of its net income and surplus account
to support development financing in low-income countries.
Detailed information and analysis on the audited financial
results of each of the Bank Group entities are presented in a
separate companion Financial Report 2018.

African Development Bank

ADB revenue increased to UA 854.47 million in 2018 from UA
671.66 million in 2017. However, this was adversely impacted
by the higher impairment provisions following the adoption
of the new International Financial Reporting Standard
(IFRS 9) and the effect of unfavorable market valuations on
borrowings and derivatives. The net effect of these charges
on revenue was a UA 133.75 million reduction in the income
before distributions approved by the Board of Governors,
which stood at UA 124.68 million at year end.

Net income/(loss) for the year

A summary of selected financial metrics for the Bank for the
five years ended 31 December 2018 is shown in Table 5.2.

Interest income from loans increased by 29.96 percent due
to higher levels of lending activity. The treasury portfolio
continued to perform above its benchmarks. Overall, net
interest income increased by 2.26 percent, driven mainly by
the higher returns realized on liquid funds and the US dollars
treasury investment portfolio.

Bank Group administrative expenses increased by 6.73 percent
from UA 377 million in 2017 to UA 402 million in 2018 primarily
due to higher consultancy and Bank business meetings related
expenses. The Bank's share of administrative expenses,
inclusive of charges for depreciation and sundry expenses in
2018 increased from UA 168 million in 2017 to UA 192 million,
due to higher operational expenses.

The Bank's reserves, plus accumulated loan loss provisions on
outstanding loan principal and charges, increased to UA 3.49
billion at the end of 2018, up from UA 3.42 billion at the end
of 2017, an increase of 2.05 percent.

Distributions Approved by the
ADB Board of Governors

In 2018, the Board of Governors approved distributions of UA83
million from 2017 income and surplus to various development
initiatives, compared with UA 82 million distributed in 2017.
The beneficiaries of these distributions are listed in note M
to the financial statements in the Financial Report 2018. The
ADB Board of Directors agreed to recommend to the Board
of Governors, at its forthcoming Annual Meeting in June 2019,
distributions of UA 74 million from 2018 net income and surplus
account to various development initiatives.

Risk Management Policies and Processes

The Bank has strengthened the monitoring of its current loan
portfolio and continues to undertake the necessary portfolio
restructuring measures to free up capital for new lending.

As part of its Balance Sheet Optimization (BSO) strategy, the
Bank undertakes risk transfer transactions to manage risks
in its loan portfolio, reduce sovereign and non-sovereign
concentration risk, and increase lending headroom in order
to optimize its balance sheet. In this regard, the Bank entered
into Exposure Exchange Agreements (EEAs) with other
multilateral development banks in 2015. The EEAs involve a
simultaneous exchange of equivalent credit risk on defined
portfolios of sovereign exposures. On 31 December 2018,
the total outstanding notional credit protection purchased or
sold on the relevant underlying single reference entities, which
remained unchanged from the previous year, was USD 4.47
billion (UA 3.21 billion).

In 2018, the Bank completed two new commercial credit risk
transfer mechanisms as part of its “Room to Run” balance
sheet optimization in line with G20 calls to multilateral
development banks to optimize their balance sheets while
mobilizing additional financial resources. The transactions
involved synthetic securitization and credit insurance on its nonsovereign portfolio in Africa aimed at reducing concentration
risk and creating additional lending headroom. The two
transactions with a total notional value of USD 1.5 billion freed
up more than USD 1 billion in headroom. Like the EEAs, these
transactions are accounted for as financial guarantees.

No default events have occurred on any of the exposures
covered under the above BSO transactions and the Bank
continues to expect its sovereign, sovereign-guaranteed andFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ABRIDGED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | 5

non-sovereign exposures to be serviced in accordance with
loan agreements.

The risks to the Bank's balance sheet are actively monitored
on a risk dashboard that is regularly updated to reflect the
evolving risk profile of the Bank's operations. The policies and
practices deployed by the Bank to manage these risks are
described in more detail in note D to the financial statements
in the Financial Report 2018.

Bank Rating

The four leading international rating agencies—Standard &
Poor's, Fitch, Moody's, and Japan Credit Rating Agency—
reaffirmed their ratings of the Bank's senior debt (AAA/Aaa)
and subordinated debt (AA+/Aa1) with a stable outlook.
The high credit ratings attained underline the Bank's strong
financial position (as reflected in its capital and liquidity) and
business profile.

Accessing Capital Markets

The Bank leveraged its balance sheet to raise UA 5.6 billion
(equal to 99.2 percent of the approved borrowing program)
from the international capital markets in 2018. This included
two benchmark issues in US dollars and a EUR 1.25 billion
ten-year benchmark transaction, marking the Bank's largest
social bond and its largest ever euro transaction (Box 5.1).

African Development Fund

The overarching financial objective of the Fund is to protect its
commitment capacity which drives its development financing
interventions.

The Fund's revenue increased by 24 percent from UA 147.59
million in 2017, to UA 183.25 million, driven largely by higher
investment and loan income, contributing to a significantly
improved deficit of UA 74.07 million—a 38 percent reduction
over the previous year. The Fund's share of the total administrative
expenses of the Bank Group fell marginally to 58.38 percent in
2018, from 60.95 percent in 2017.

It is noteworthy that the persistent deficits experienced by the
Fund in recent years are due primarily to structural changes,
including the cancellation of loans to certain beneficiaries under
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the increased grant
component included in the recent ADF resource allocations,
and the impact of low interest rates on subscriptions encashed
early, leaving the Fund with a negative income gap. Although
these structural changes affect the reported income of the Fund,
their impact does not adversely affect the commitment capacity
or the financial sustainability of the Fund because the Fund is
expected to be ultimately compensated through additional
donor subscriptions payable over the life of the cancelled loans.
The impact of the MDRI initiative is included in note F to the
special purpose financial statements in the Financial Report
2018. No new country reached the completion point in 2018.

Nigeria Trust Fund

The NTF’s income before distributions approved by the
ADB Board of Governors increased by UA 0.48 million from
UA 2.18 million in 2017 to UA 2.66 million in 2018, mainly
due to an increase in investment income, which drove the
NTF's revenue up from UA 2.75 million in 2017 to UA 3.52
million in 2018.

The NTF's share of administrative expenses incurred by the
Bank Group increased by UA 0.15 million from UA 0.55 million

in 2017 to UA 0.70 million in 2018. The NTF's reserves, net
of cumulative currency translation adjustments, increased by
13.76 percent from UA 40.47 million at the end of 2017 to
UA 46.04 million on 31 December 2018.

2018 ANNUAL REPORT 59APPENDICES

Appendix 9:
Standing Committees of the Boards

Board effectiveness and welfare: The Committee on Administrative Matters Concerning the Board (AMBD)

In 2018, the AMBD considered reports from consultation missions and study tours, with outcomes providing strategic input into
the development of the new Regional and Country Strategy Frameworks and an evaluation of the development impact of the
ongoing decentralization. In addition, the AMBD reviewed a number of instruments designed to enhance Board effectiveness,
including a Board handbook and manual. Under the guidance of the committee, the 2018 Board Retreat convened under two
themes: "Private Sector Engagement” and “The Positioning of the Bank Relative to Other Multilateral Development Banks.” The
retreat aimed to prioritize areas for greater private sector involvement in the Bank Group's interventions and identify ways that
the multilateral development bank system can act as a catalyst for change.

Accountability and risk management: The Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI)

In 2018, AUFI provided oversight and monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations, the administrative budget,
the 2018 Lending Program, Special Operations Unit Portfolio, Group Risk Management, Capital Adequacy and Exposure reports,
and market risks. AUFI also reviewed and cleared the work plans of independent accountability units reporting to it, including the
Office of the Auditor General and the Office of Integrity and Anti-Corruption.

Staff welfare and corporate efficiency: The Committee on Administrative and Human Resource Policy Issues (CAHR)

In 2018, CAHR provided strategic guidance on internal administration of justice to enhance the rule of law and accountability, and
advised the Boards on a long-term strategy for acquiring and managing real estate for Regional and Country Offices. CAHR also
oversaw a review of the Staff Pension Scheme in order to enhance its long-term sustainability. Further, it reviewed a new draft of
the Bank Group’s People Strategy and provided considerable input.

Focus on results and impact: The Committee on Operations and Development Effectiveness (CODE)

In 2018, CODE reviewed and provided input into draft Country Strategy Papers for Congo, Céte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea,
Guinea, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Niger, Sao Tomé and Principe, and South Africa, as well as an updated Country Strategy
Paper for Nigeria. CODE sought to align these instruments with each country’s socioeconomic development priorities, emphasized inclusion as well as selectivity, and addressed climate change, fragility, gender mainstreaming, regional integration,
economic diversification, and engagement with the private sector. In addition, it reviewed and cleared the work plans of independent accountability units reporting to it, including independent development evaluation and compliance review and mediation.

Client orientation and stakeholder management: The Committee on External Communications and Preparation of
the Bank Group Annual Meetings (ECAM)

In 2018, ECAM provided strategic guidance that led to the successful convening of the Annual Meetings of the Bank Group in
Busan, Korea. Further, ECAM provided direction toward preparing the Bank Group Annual Report 2018 and the African Economic
Outlook 2018.

Fostering an ethical culture: The Committee for the Enforcement of the Code of Conduct for Executive Directors
(ECBD)

In 2018, ECBD successfully resolved one matter referred to it.

Cost effectiveness and efficiency: The Committee of the Whole on the Budget (CWHOLE)

In 2018, CWHOLE conducted mid-term and end-of-year reviews of the performance reports on implementing the budget and
the work program. It also reviewed and shaped the strategic orientations for the three-year budget framework paper and work
program for 2019-21, for consideration by the Boards.

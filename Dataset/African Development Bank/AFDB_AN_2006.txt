The overarching objective of the African Development Bank Group is to spur sustainable economic development
and social progress in its regional member countries, thus contributing to poverty reduction. The Bank Group
achieves this objective by (i) mobilizing and allocating resources—for investment in RMCs; and (ii) providing policy advice
and technical assistance—to support development efforts.

The African Development Bank

The ADB is a multilateral development bank
whose shareholders comprise 53 African
countries (RMCs) and 24 non-African countries (non-regional member countries—nonRMCs). It was established in 1964 and officially began operations in 1967. It is headquartered in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire; however, because of political instability in Cote
d'Ivoire, the ADB Governors’ Consultative
Committee (GCC), at a meeting in February
2003 in Accra, Ghana, decided to move the
Bank to its current temporary location in
Tunis, Tunisia.

The Bank Group's primary objective is to
promote sustainable economic growth
to reduce poverty in Africa. It achieves
this objective by financing a broad range
of development projects and programs
through (i) public sector loans (including
policy-based loans), private sector loans,
and equity investments; (ii) technical assistance for institutional support projects and
programs; (iii) public and private capital
investment; (iv) assistance in coordinating
RMC development policies and plans; and
(v) grants of up to US$500,000 in emergency support. The Bank prioritizes national
and multinational projects and programs
that promote regional economic cooperation and integration.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Bank (the Agreement) des
Annual Report 2006

ignates the Board of Governors as the
institution's highest policy-making organ,
with one representative from each member
country. The Board of Governors issues
general directives on the Bank's operations and approves amendments to the
Agreement, the admission of new members, and increases to the Bank's capital.
The Board elects an 18-member Board of
Directors to which it delegates its powers, with the exception of those expressly
reserved to it in the Agreement. Twelve
Directors are elected from RMCs and 6 from
non-RMCs for a 3-year term, renewable for
one term. The Board of Directors oversees
all Bank operations.

The Boards of Governors elect the president of the Bank Group for a 5-year term,
renewable for one term. The president, who
must be from a RMC, chairs the Board of
Directors, appoints vice-presidents—in consultation with the Boards—and manages
the Bank's daily operations.

The ADB provides loans to its clients on nonconcessional terms. In 1997, it introduced 3
new loan products to meet the needs of its
clients: a single-currency variable-rate loan,
a single-currency floating-rate loan, and a
single-currency fixed rate loan. The interest
rate for the single-currency variable-rate
loan is based on the semi-annual average
cost of all outstanding Bank borrowings
specifically allocated to fund these loans.
The interest rate for the floating-rate loan is

based on the 6 month LIBOR in the basket
of currencies offered by the Bank. The rate
for fixed-rate loans is based on the Bank's
cost of borrowing to fund them. The repayment terms for Bank loans are as follows:

e Repayment period of up to 20 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
5 years for public sector loans;

e Repayment period of up to 14 years,
including a grace period not exceeding
4 years for publicly guaranteed lines of
credit; and

e Repayment period of 5 to 20 years,
including a grace period of 1 to 3 years
for private sector loans.

 

The African Development Fund

The ADF, which comprises the ADB and
State Participants, was created in 1973
and became operational in 1974. Its main
objective is to reduce poverty in RMCs by
providing low-income RMCs with concessional loans and grants for projects and
programs, and with technical assistance for
studies and capacity-building activities.

The Agreement Establishing the African
Development Fund (ADF) designates the
Board of Governors as the Fund's highest policy-making organ. The Board of
Governors meets at least once a year.
The ADF Board of Directors includes 6Executive Directors from non-RMCs—
nominated by their constituencies—and 6
Executive Directors representing the ADB;
the Board oversees the general operations
of the Fund.

The Fund's resources come from contributions and periodic replenishments by
participants, usually on a 3-year basis.
For ADF-X, which covers the 2005-2007
period, ADF Deputies agreed on a replenishment level of UA 3.7 billion.

No interest is charged on ADF loans; however, the loans carry a service charge of
0.75 percent per annum on outstanding
balances, and a commitment fee of 0.50
percent per annum on undisbursed commitments. Project loans have a 50-year
repayment period, including a 10-year
grace period. Lines of credit have a 20year repayment period with a 5-year grace
period.

The Nigeria Trust Fund

he NTF is a special ADB fund created in
976 by agreement between the Bank
Group and the Government of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. Its objective is to assist
he development efforts of low-income
RMCs whose economic and social condiions and prospects require concessional
inancing. The NTF became operational
in April 1976 following approval of the
Agreement Establishing the Nigeria Trust
Fund by the Board of Governors. Its initial
capital of US$80.0 million was replenished
in 1981 with US$71.0 million.

n April 2003, the ADB Board of Governors
considered and approved a number of projosals aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the NTF. These proposals included
(i) adjusting the interest rate for NTF loans
rom 4 percent to a 2-4 percent range,

 

 

to increase concessionality; (ii) allocating
10 percent of NTF annual net income
as contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund;
(iii) appropriating NTF corpus resources
to finance activities under the Technical
Cooperation Agreement with the Ban
Group to support programs benefiting its
RMCs; and (iv) introducing more flexibility
in the investment of NTF resources, pending their use in financing projects.

In 2006, operations were suspended pending the findings of an in-depth assessment
of the NTF, which started on November
28, 2006. The main objectives of the
evaluation are to (i) review the use of NTI
resources, (ii) assess the performance o
the Bank and Nigeria in managing the NT
and (iii) examine the terms of NTF financ:
ing in relation to the sustainability of NT
as a Fund. The first report will be available
during the first quarter of 2007.

xvMessage From the President of the African Development Bank Group

and Chairman of the Boards of Directors

 

Donald Kaberuka
President of the African Development Bank Group

The year 2006 was one of progress for the
African Development Bank Group, as it
sought to consolidate its financial soundness
and achievements and to scale up efforts to
enhance the effectiveness of its development operations.

For Africa, it was a year of unprecedented
stability and continued impressive economic
performance. Its real GDP grew at 5.5
percent, allowing the continent to record
its longest period of economic growth
in the past two decades. Although this
growth is encouraging, it still fell short of
what is required to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal of halving the incidence
of extreme poverty by 2015. We must therefore redouble our efforts and seize the
opportunities provided by favorable internal
and external factors. The outlook is positive
in the light of peace, stability, stronger institutions, improved governance, debt cancella
Annual Report 2006

tion, macroeconomic stability, and favorable
trends in the global economy.

In mid-2006, the Boards approved phase one
of institutional reforms aimed at strengthening the Bank Group's operational capacity
to stimulate sustained economic growth in
Africa. The new organizational structure will
enhance country focus, progressively shift
more resources to operations, and improve
strategic selectivity in areas in which the
Bank should seek excellence, such as water,
infrastructure, governance, and knowledge
Management.

The structure will also increase delegation
of authority to country offices and enhance
dialogue with RMCs while strengthening
fiduciary controls. The opening of 22 of
the 25 field offices in 2006 increased the
Bank's visibility and its ability to work better with partners. We will empower these
offices, tailor them to particular country
needs, ensure that they are accountable,
and that they produce results. The Office of
the Chief Economist is laying the foundation for a “Knowledge Bank to strengthen
analytical work in support of our member
countries and build the Bank's capacity to
be Africa's voice in the international development arena.

During the year, we consolidated our human
resources capacity, recruiting increasingly
diverse, high quality staff, with the right skills
mix and cross cutting expertise. We are in
the process of filling all professional vacancies and hiring local staff in field offices.
During the year, | also visited a cross section
of our RMCs, 18 countries in total, to deepen
my understanding of the Bank's work on the
ground and to hear from the authorities and
stakeholders about their expectations from

the Bank. These visits further underscored
the need for (i) effective field presence; (ii)
selectivity in our operations; (iii) greater
efforts at effective portfolio management;
and (iv) strengthened partnerships with
other donors on the ground. African leaders
reiterated the essential role of the AfDB in
heir development efforts and their expectaions for the Bank Group to grow as the
referred channel of external assistance and
champion of African development.

n the spirit of pursuing enhanced regional
integration, we deepened our relationship
with other African institutions: the African
Union, NEPAD, and ECA, regional economic
blocks, and development partners. We also
continued to build strategic partnerships
with multilateral and bilateral institutions,
‘© maximize complementarity of our development efforts in the spirit of the Paris
Declaration on Harmonization, Alignment
and Managing for Development Results.
n 2006, the Bank took measures to mainstream the principles of this agenda into all
its operations, issuing a revised Action Plan
hat incorporates monitorable actions at the
institutional and country levels.

 

he sustained record of operations in 2006,
notwithstanding institutional and_ staffing
constraints, is a tribute to the hard work
and dedication of our staff. Total financing approvals for Bank Group operations
reached a record high of UA 2.59 billion, a
13.1 per cent increase from UA 2.29 billion
in 2005. Approvals from the ADB window
increased from UA 868.7 million in 2005
to UA 1.05 billion in 2006, a 20.9 per cent
increase, while approvals from the ADF
window increased from UA 1.42 billion in
2005 to UA 1.54 billion in 2006, a 8.5 per
cent increase. Approvals from the NTF weresuspended in 2006 pending finalization of
consultations with the Nigerian Government
on the future of the NTF, whose life has been
extended for another year for the purpose.

Out of the UA 3.42 billion total allocations
under ADF-X, UA 2.22 billion had been committed by the end of 2006. The remaining
UA 1.2 billion will be used to finance operations under the Bank's indicative program
in 2007. The Bank Group also continued
to mobilize resources for debt relief and
co-financing from development partners. By
the end of the year, it had mobilized US$
2.37 billion under the HIPC Trust Fund to
help reduce the debt obligations of 17 RMCs
that had reached completion point and 8
that were in the interim period. | am glad to
report progress made to clear arrears for the
Central African Republic and the sustained
efforts underway, among partners, to find
a solution for Liberia's debt. Overall, with
other development partners, the Bank Group
co-financed projects amounting to UA 11.7
billion — more than triple the UA 3.19 billion
allocated in 2005. The Bank contributed
UA 1.32 billion, while external development
partners contributed UA 4.24 billion.

 

| am pleased to report that the Bank Group
continued to maintain its strong financial position with income before transfers
approved by the Board of Governors at UA
248.25 million. The confidence of the capital
markets was further confirmed by the Bank’s
successful launch of its fifth global bond
issue. Our balance sheet remains strong
with the AAA rating of the Bank senior
debt reaffirmed. This reflects the Bank's
sound capital adequacy and prudent financial management and policies. The medium
term financial position of the Bank remains
solid and its risk bearing capacity sound. We
will continue to implement financial policies
designed to ensure that the Bank’s financial
assets remain strong and are deployed
optimally.

We took steps in 2006 to continue to remain
accountable to stakeholders: We established
an Independent Review Mechanism, which
will ensure that the Bank Group complies
with its own policies and procedures; we
adopted a proposal to “Establish an Anticorruption and Fraud Investigation Function”
as a core part of our policy on good governance; we set up a new Anti-corruption and
Fraud Division in the Office of the AuditorGeneral to reinforce institutional and operational integrity; and we created a new
Governance and Economic Management
Department that will strengthen the capacity
and framework of RMCs to build institutions
that are transparent, accountable, and have
adequate capacity to deliver services to the
population.

The Bank continued to seek support for its
prioritization process by increasing resources
allocated to water, infrastructure, and multinational operations. We will continue to be
selective and to focus on areas where we
can add value, in complementarity with our
partners. | am glad to report progress in the
water sector, in line with the ambitions of the
Bank and with its ongoing water initiatives.
We will step up our efforts in this area.

The Bank continued to make progress in private sector development. Total private sector
approvals rose significantly to UA 278.5 million by December 2006, up from UA 180.1
million in 2005. | expect this upward trend
to continue in 2007 with an increase in non
sovereign operations. This is in addition to
specific measures and reforms that target
the private sector enabling environment.

We held the Mid-Term Review of ADF-X at
The Hague, followed by initial discussions
on ADF-XI in Dar es Salaam. We were able
to assess achievements made, identify gaps,
and lay the foundation for further progress.
We are aware of the large window of opportunity for Africa and the Bank Group and |

look forward to a successful replenishment
of ADF-XI.

In view of the changes in Africa and internationally, and of the increased demands made
on the Bank, | established a High Level Panel
of eminent persons to advise on a long-term
vision, in conformity with our pledge to
deliver more within the emerging global aid
architecture. The panel, co-chaired by former
President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique
and former Prime Minister Paul Martin of
Canada, will present its recommendations
in 2007.

The year 2006 started with a clear resolve
by all of us to consolidate the Bank's gains,
expedite reforms, and pursue the delivery
and results agenda. Our determination was
reinforced by the unique period of optimism
and opportunity for Africa, manifested by
sustained growth for the sixth year, and the
extent of the exceptional consensus on what
needs to be done by Africa itself and its partners. This Annual Report is a record of what
we achieved in the past year and an indication of where we want to be at the end of
2007. Although it outlines challenges, we
remain determined to achieve results. We
are certain that with the continued support
of our shareholders, the Year 2007 will see
the Bank make further progress as a solid
financial institution, a channel of choice of
support for Africa. | commend the Report
to you.

Executive Summary

In 2006, the African Development Bank Group—the AfDB or the Bank Group—reached a critical milestone in scaling up and
re-invigorating its activities to achieve concrete development results in its regional member countries (RMCs). In mid-2006,
the Boards of Directors approved a long-term agenda designed to enhance the effectiveness of Bank Group operations,
implement its far-reaching decentralization strategy, and finalize its budget process enhancement blueprint. The Bank
Group's efforts to deepen operational focus and strengthen resource allocation and institutional reforms are on track. These
measures will help reduce the constraints hindering RMCs from achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and
stimulate strong economic growth in RMCs.

Africa’s Economic Performance

For the sixth consecutive year, Africa
achieved positive annual real GDP growth
rates owing to favorable external conditions
and to improvements in domestic economic
policies—in particular, a recovery in the
world economy, rising commodity prices,
improved macro-economic stability, and
country-specific developments. The continent recorded an average real GDP growth
rate of 5.5 percent in 2006. However, this
average masks considerable differences
among African countries.

Despite the track record of buoyant and
resilient growth at the continental level,
some RMCs, in particular low-income and
fragile states, still lag behind other developing countries. Improving the situation
in these RMCs is a priority, with particular
emphasis on reducing extreme poverty
and combating diseases such as HIV/AIDS
and malaria, which had a huge economic
impact in southern, central, and western
Africa in 2006. Against this backdrop,
targeted reforms and increased development financing are needed to firmly place
the region on a path of higher sustainable
growth (7-8 percent) for the achievement
of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The outlook remains positive given
the increasing number of RMCs recording
annual growth rates above 5 percent owing
to sound economic policies and political
transformation.

Annual Report 2006

Mobilization and Allocation of
Financial Resources

The Bank Group mobilizes concessional
resources through periodic ADF replenishment negotiations and allocates the
resources using the enhanced performance-based allocation (PBA) system. Out of
the UA 3.42 billion total allocations under
ADF-X, UA 2.2 billion had been committed by the end of 2006. The remaining
UA 1.2 billion will be used to finance
operations under the Bank's indicative
program in 2007. During the ADF-X MidTerm Review meeting at The Hague, The
Netherlands, in December 2006, ADF
Deputies discussed the Bank's performance under ADF-X and agreed on a road
map for consultations under the ADF-XI
replenishment exercise in 2007.

In 2006, the Bank Group continued to
mobilize resources for the Enhanced
HIPC Initiative and for the MDRI.
Bank Group approvals for HIPCs have
been declining since 2004, as most of the
16 RMCs at interim or pre-decision points,
most of which are fragile states, continue
to face serious hurdles in meeting their
decision or completion point triggers. As
a result, the Bank Group’s total approvals
for HIPCs in 2006 dropped by more than
46 percent to UA 273.05 million (including
arrears clearance for the Central African
Republic (CAR)), compared with UA 508.68
million in 2005. Current estimates show

donors in 2007 to cover the anticipated
payment of about US$500.0 million (including
US$210.0 million from the Bank Group).
These resources will be needed when Liberia,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
and 14 other RMCs reach their decision or
completion points.

ADF debt cancellation under the MDRI,
which was approved by the Board of
Directors on April 19, 2006, became
effective on September 1, 2006. Over
he 50-year implementation period of the
enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI,
he Bank will provide about US$14.0
illion in debt relief, including US$8.3
illion under the MDRI and more than
US$5.6 billion in nominal terms under
he enhanced HIPC Initiative. This is
equivalent to about 15 percent of the
US$98.5 billion cost in nominal terms of
DA, IMF, and AfDB debt relief. Under the
approved financing package, donors have
committed to compensating the costs of
MDRI to the ADF and IDA on a ‘dollaror-dollar’ basis. Debt relief under the
MDRI is provided in addition to existing
debt relief commitments by ADF and

 

 

other creditors under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. Contribution to the MDRI will be
recorded and monitored separately from
regular ADF replenishment contributions,
beginning with ADF-XI, and will provide
state participants with additional voting
rights. Beneficiary RMCs are required to
use HIPC and MDRI resources for poverty
reduction programs and projects.

Cofinancing operations. The Bank
Group enjoyed strong support from donors
in carrying out its lending and non-lending
activities. Every dollar of AfDB development
assistance to its RMCs was matched by
more than US$4.2 from donors. In 2006, UA
11.7 billion was allocated in cofinancing for
34 projects, about four times the UA 3.19
billion allocated for 19 projects in 2005.
This enhanced partnership significantly
helped improve the lives of millions of
people in RMCs, most importantly in fragile
states and in RMCs that have reached the
decision point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative.

In West and Central Africa, the Bank's
joint assistance programs with other
development partners created conducive

conditions for the mobilization of
resources to build more than 2725 km of
all-weather permanent roads and feeder
roads, including multinational corridors.
Similar joint initiatives resulted in the
design of entrepreneurship and microfinance development programs targeted at
more than 12,600 rural poor (70 percent
women) in the Republic of Congo, the
Gambia, Malawi, and Mali.As well, through
rural electrification projects in Ethiopia
and Mozambique, the Bank Group will
facilitate access to electricity for millions
of the poor in more than 500 rural towns
and villages.

Donor support also allowed the Bank
Group to pool UA 15.6 million (about
US$23.3 million) in resources to clear the
arrears of the Central African Republic, thus
increasing the Bank's capacity to support
critical and sustainable economic and
governance reforms in this post-conflict
RMC and to share its knowledge and
expertise. Central African countries and
South Africa demonstrated unprecedented
solidarity with CAR by contributing UA 3.61
million to the debt clearance package.

Through private sector activities, the Bank
Group's revamped partnership with donors
allowed the institution to expand into
difficult markets and integrate technical
assistance and advisory services in all
its operations. In particular, multi-sector
activities, which soared to UA 414.3
million in 2006, almost 57 percent higher
than 2005 levels, enabled the Bank Group
to advance some of its core priorities, such
as improving access to regional financial
markets, developing small businesses,
promoting sustainable business practices,
and enhancing the investment climate
in a growing number of its RMCs. This
was done through institutional support to

Annual Report 2006Executive Summary

Operational Activities

To sustain the growth momentum
observed in its RMCs in recent years, the
Bank Group substantially increased its
financing activities during the year. The
Boards approved lending and non-lending
operations, including project and program
loans, debt relief operations, as well as
grants for technical assistance, emergency
assistance, post conflict assistance,
in addition to private guarantees for
private sector activities. Total financing
approvals for Bank Group operations
reached a record high, rising 13.1 percent
from UA 2.29 billion in 2005 to UA 2.59
billion in 2006. This increase is attributable
to the volume of loan and grant approvals,
which rose to UA 2.31 billion in 2006,
from UA 1.74 billion in 2005.

With respect to ADB operations, the
Bank Group's investment commitments
rose to UA 1.05 billion in 2006, well above
the UA 868.7 million committed in 2005.
This unprecedented 21-percent increase
was largely due to the UA 338.0 million
(equivalent to US$500.0 million) approved
for the Financial Sector Reform Program
in Egypt—the largest single program ever
approved by the Bank Group since its
inception. This surge in non-concessional
lending also stemmed from a sharp rise
in private sector operations—to UA 278.5
million—and to HIPC debt relief—UA
102.2 million.

In 2006, approvals under the ADF
concessional window rose about
8.5 percent—from UA 1.42 billion in
2005 to UA 1.54 billion (including UA
484.2 million in grants). ADB and ADF
accounted for nearly 40 percent and 60
percent, respectively, of total Bank Group
operations, compared with 38 percent and
62 percent in 2005.

For the first time in its 30-year life span,
no loans or grants were approved under

Annual Report 2006

the NTF in 2006. In November 2006, an
evaluation was launched to review the use
of NTF resources, assess the performance
of the Bank and Nigeria in managing the
NTF, identify possible niches for future
NTF use, and determine the NTF extension
period and changes that should be made in
relation to its governance structure going
forward. This evaluation is well advanced
and a first report is expected during the
first quarter of 2007. In the interim, the
Nigerian authorities granted the Bank
Group a one (1) year additional extension
of the NTF till April 25, 2008.

Loan and Grant Approvals by Sector
In line with the Bank Group's new strategic
orientations, the bulk of the UA 2.31
billion approved for sectoral projects and
programs in 2006 was allocated to selected
priority areas that are critical for economic

growth and poverty reduction in RMCs.
Infrastructure (transport, water supply and
sanitation, power supply), finance, and
multisector activites accounted for about
77 percent of lending activities. This reflects
a major shift towards increased selectivity
and sharper focus on high development
impact areas.

Overall, 37 RMCs—more than 71 percent
of the Bank Group's borrowing RMCs—
benefited from new approvals in 2006.
Project lending, including sector investment
operations and lines of credit, accounted for
52 percent of total operational approvals,
compared with 27 percent for policy-based
lending, and 21 percent for grants and
project preparation facilities. Most of these

and Results

The Bank Group introduced in-depth
changes in 2006 to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency of its lending
and non-lending activities in its RMCs.
The entry into force of the Bank Group's
new organizational structure on July
1, 2006, empowered the institution to
launch a series of major initiatives to
restructure its programs for better country
focus and dialogue. The new structure
will also enhance focus on business lines
to improve project design and quality at
entry, ensure active portfolio supervision
and management, and strengthen delivery
and impact in support of the Bank Group’s
managing for development effectiveness
and results agenda. As well, the new
position of chief economist will
strengthen the Bank Group's capacity
for economic and social analysis, thus
providing the foundation needed to develop
real intellectual leadership. Through the
emerging AfDB Economic Conference
initiative, the Chief Economist's Office will
reinforce the Bank Group's capacity to
participate in strategic partnerships with
other donors and to have a real voice in
key development and poverty reduction
issues.

The Bank Group is stepping up actions to
increase its capacity and shift the bulk of
its human and financial resources to its
country programs and operations, including
field offices, to enhance the monitoring and
evaluation of its lending and non-lending
activities. To better achieve this strategic
objective, the Bank Group launched a
comprehensive budget reform program in
2006. When fully implemented, this reform
will allow the institution to assess and
demonstrate the relevance and impact of
its activities as well as of its contributions
to Managing for Development Results
(MfDR).

In 2006, the Bank Group sought to
strengthen its presence in its RMCs, and

21 of its targeted 25 regional and country
offices were fully operational by the end
of the year. These field offices will make
the Bank Group more visible, strengthen
its voice among donors and help RMCs
promote good financial and corporate
governance in support of national and
institutional capacity building. The field
offices will also help improve the private
investment climate and lay the foundation
required to deepen implementation of the
harmonization and alignment agenda.

The Boards of Directors approved a
number of program and policy documents
aimed at strengthening the development
effectiveness of Bank Group operations.
These include (i) 8 Results-Based Country
Strategy Papers; (ii) 4 Country Dialogue
Papers; (iii) 3 HIPC documents, (iv) 11
Humanitarian Emergency Assistance
programs to RMCs; and (v) a Proposal for
Clearing the Arrears of the Central African
Republic. In addition, 23 key policies,
strategies, guidelines, and initiatives were
also adopted.

Human Resources

Successful implementation of the Bank
Group's strategic orientations required
concerted effort from Bank staff, estimated
at 1,044 at end-2006 (including elected
officers and staff attached to the Boards),
compared with 1,072 in 2005 and 1,064
in 2004. Eighty (80) percent of professional
and management staff members at post
were from RMCs, compared with 20
percent from non-RMCs.

Knowledge and Capacity Building
Activities

To ensure maximum development
effectiveness and results, the Bank
Group will place even greater emphasis
on technical assistance and advisory
services going forward. In 2006, about
750 officials from RMCs benefited from
capacity building activities. Roughly 950
Board Members, managers, and staff also
recieved training on implementation of the

Executive Summary

Bank Group's development effectiveness
and results agenda, and on an executive
and management development program.
During 2006 as well, the Bank Group
launched the Eminent Speakers’ Program,
under which 5 renowned personalities,
including the former Heads of States of
Zambia and Tanzania, adressed issues such
as governance, the fight against HIV/
AIDS in Africa, global public goods, Africa’s
access to water and sanitation, and the
role of innovation in Africa's economic
revival. This program will be held 4 times
a year.

The 2007 Administrative Expenses
and Capital Expenditure Budget.

In December 2006, the ADB Board of
Directors approved an administrative
expenses budget of UA 193.7 million,
a capital expenditure budget of UA 6.9
million, and a contingency budget of UA 1.9
million for 2007. The ADF Board of Directors
approved an indicative administrative
budget of UA 145.8 million for the Fund
for the financial year ending December
31, 2007. The Bank Group's 2007 budget
was anchored on prior strategic decisions
taken by the Boards of Governors and
Directors, on the Bank's Action Plan, and
on policy decisions already taken by the
Boards under the 2003-2007 Strategic
Plan. The budget was also prepared within
the framework of the institutional reforms
and the enhanced decentralization strategy
approved by the Boards to strengthen
internal organizational effectiveness and
maximize development impact.

Net Income Allocation.

The 2006 financial statements underscore
the Bank Group’s strong financial position,
with a combined net income, after
allocation, of UA 107.98 million in 2006,
almost at par with the UA 107.16 million
in 2005. Its balance sheet also remains
robust, with the AAA rating on the Bank's
senior debt reaffirmed. This reflects the
Bank's sound capital adequacy and prudent
financial management and policies.

Executive Summary

Challenges and Strategic Vision

he review of the Bank Group's activities in
2006 shows that the institution faces the
ollowing challenges: (i) ensuring effective
and efficient implementation of the Bank
Group's human resources reform program,
with special emphasis on reducing the
high level of professional vacancies; (ii)
completing the budget reform program
aunched in 2006; (iii) promoting longerm financial sustainability of the ADF
within the framework of the enhanced
HIPC Initiative and MDRI implementation;
(iv) defining an appropriate strategy
or fragile states, and harnessing donor
support to meet the special needs of
hese states; and (v) mainstreaming the
Managing for Development Results (MfDR)
initiative into all Bank Group activities to
elp RMCs, especially the 40 low-income

 

Annual Report 2006

ADF countries, meet the Partnership
Commitments on MfDR under the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

Other key issues include defining
a strategy for financing multinational
operations; designing options to simplify
performance-based allocation and reduce
its built-in volatility; implementing the
technical assistance trust fund reform
program, with special focus on untying
development assistance; delegating
authority to country offices with sound
fiduciary controls; and defining incentives
to ensure the quality of operations and
results in RMCs.

Partnership activities played a
fundamental role in the successful
implementation of the Bank Group's

work program in 2006. The Bank Group
will continue to take action to remain
the partner of choice for the donor
community as it embarks on consultations
or the ADF-XI replenishment in 2007.
n support of this strategic goal, in
2006 the President of the Bank Group
established an independent high-level
anel to advice the Bank Group on its
strategic vision and on the medium- to
ong-term operational strategy needed to
implement the vision. The panel started
work in October 2006. It is expected
© present its final report during the
second half of 2007. Final proposals and
recommendations on how to implement
he panel's conclusions will be presented
to the Boards of Directors and Governors
efore the end of 2007.Table O.

The Board of Governors issues general directives on Bank Group operations. It delegates powers to the Board of Directors,
who set policies and guidelines and oversee all Bank Group operations and financial and administrative activities.
This chapter reviews the Boards’ activities during 2006, with particular emphasis on the 2006 Annual Meetings and on key
approvals and resolutions taken during the year.

BOARDS OF GOVERNORS

The 2006 Annual Meetings

The Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the African Development Bank
Group—the AfDB or the Bank Group—were
held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on May
17 and 18, 2006. During the meetings, Governors approved the Annual Report and audited
financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2005. They also participated
in the Joint African Development Bank Group
/ Economic Commission for Africa (AfDB/ECA)
Ministerial Roundtable, in high-level seminars,
and in the Governors’ Forum.

Annual Meetings Seminars

The AfDB Annual Meetings have traditionally
been preceded by a symposium on economic
and social development challenges facing
Africa. During the 2006 Annual Meetings, the
symposium was transformed into an AfDB-ECA
ministerial roundtable discussion, followed by
high-level seminars on contemporary development issues that are relevant for policy makers,
civil society organizations, and development
practitioners in Africa. These events were
attended by more than 1,400 participants,
comprising Governors and their delegations,
Board members, senior management and
staff, representatives of international finance
institutions, civil society leaders, private sector
operators, and other development partners.

The Ministerial Roundtable discussion focused on Infrastructure Development and Re
Annual Report 2006

gional Integration: Issues, Opportunities, and
Challenges. It was opened by His Excellency
Paramanga Ernest Yonli, Prime Minister of
Burkina Faso, and co-chaired by Mr. Abdoulie
Janneh, Executive Secretary of the UN-ECA,
and Mr. Donald Kaberuka, President of the
AfDB. The 3 high-level seminars were on (i)
Infrastructure Development and Regional
Integration: Getting the Policy Framework
Right; (ii) Infrastructure Development and
Regional Integration: Meeting Investment
Needs; and (iii) Transparency, Accountability,
and Combating Corruption: Implications for
Good Governance in Africa and the Role of
the AfDB.

Seminar participants exchanged views
on infrastructure needs, challenges facing Africa, and development effectiveness
in the light of the scaling up of international aid. There was broad consensus that

because infrastructure development and
regional integration are the foundations
of accelerated growth, African countries
should endeavor to address the attendant
critical challenges: improving policies, building institutional capacities, aligning donor
practices, enhancing domestic resource
mobilization, improving governance, accelerating regional integration, and strengthening the capacities of regional economic
communities.

The seminars also underscored the large
investment—about US$20.0_billion—
needed to bridge the infrastructure gap
and suggested ways to raise the requisite
resources. Suggestions included increasing
official development assistance; deepening
debt relief; and using innovative financing
mechanisms in regional member countries
(RMCs).

 

2006 Annual MeetingsAt the macroeconomic level, participants
stressed the need for African countries to
improve their domestic environments to
significantly accelerate growth and reduce
poverty. They called on RMCs to deepen
reform efforts and avoid policy reversals
in order to promote stable macroeconomic
conditions. RMCs were also encouraged to
(i) pursue structural reforms by speeding
up privatization and enhancing privatepublic partnerships for greater private sector participation; (ii) invest in human capital development to maintain infrastructure;
(iii) establish adequate policies for private
sector involvement in infrastructure, and;
(iv) develop domestic financial markets to
sustain infrastructure development.

At the regional level, participants concluded that scaling up infrastructure financing
and development required further harmonization of cross-border infrastructure
development policies. It also required
the promotion of regional approaches to
resource mobilization, the development of
legal and regulatory frameworks, and the
strengthening of the human and financial
capacities of regional economic communities, including their rationalization, to
formulate regional policies and implement
regional initiatives.

 

Boards of Governors’ Forum

Bank Group actions aimed at enhancing
development effectiveness in RMCs were
presented to the Boards of Governors during the 2006 Annual Meeting. The presentation provided a forum for Governors and
senior management to discuss key issues
affecting the quality of the Bank Group's
portfolio. These include (i) scaling up the
development effectiveness and impact of
Bank Group operations in RMCs; (ii) taking
action (by Bank Group management, in
partnership with RMCs and other donors)
to improve the quality and impact of interventions; (iii) raising RMCs’ awareness
about the increasing leadership role they
should play to enhance development effec
iveness and results and build consensus
on actions, and (iv) the way forward.

he presentation also highlighted a range
of new poverty reduction policy instruments developed by the AfDB in response
‘0 the demands of its shareholders and to
he development challenges facing Africa.
t also covered issues such as improving
stakeholder participation in policy and
roject design, promoting good governance and transparency, improving development effectiveness and results in portfolio
management, and strengthening donor
armonization in support of the Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

he presentation was well received by
Governors, who expressed satisfaction at
he Bank's new focus on results—which,
hey stressed, should be measurable and
monitorable. Governors underscored the
need to give priority to quality rather than
‘© quantity in Bank Group operations and
urged the Bank to enhance its capacity to
meet RMC needs—a capacity currently
constrained by staff shortages. They also
encouraged the Bank to strengthen SouthSouth cooperation, especially in trade; to
become more involved in fragile states;
and to support middle-income countries’
(MIC) efforts to reduce pockets of poverty and enhance access to international
capital markets. They welcomed ongoing
efforts to harmonize donor interventions
at the country level and align them with
country systems within the framework
of the Paris Declaration on Development
Effectiveness—reiterating their expectation that this would lead to unified project
management units and reduced transaction costs. They also noted the Bank's performance-based allocation (PBA) system
for concessional resources to RMCs.

 

Governors expressed appreciation for the
presentation and recommended that such
dialogue on Bank Group operations, with
the attendant transparency and information

Activities of the Boards Chapter OO1

disclosure by management, become standard practice in future annual meetings.

Boards of Governors’ Meeting

In his welcome address, the Honorable
Seydou Bouda, Governor for Burkina
Faso and Chairman of the Boards
of Governors, extended his country's
appreciation to Bank Group Governors,
Executive Directors, and management for
giving Burkina Faso the privilege of hosting
he 2006 Annual Meetings. He thanked the
Heads of State and Government in attendance for honoring Burkina Faso and the Bank
Group with their presence, an indication of
heir profound attachment to the institution
and to the continent's development efforts.
n particular, Mr. Bouda acknowledged the
presence of His Excellency Paul Kagame,
President of the Republic of Rwanda and
His Excellency Emilo Armando Guebuza,
President of the Republic of Mozambique.
He offered special words of encouragement
o Her Excellency Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf,
President of the Republic of Liberia—the
irst democratically elected female president
in Africa—and to His Excellency Charles
Konan Banny, in his dual capacity as Prime
Minister of the Republic of Céte d'Ivoire and
Bank Group Governor for his country. As
well, he expressed gratitude to His Excellency

 

 

 

Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf,

President of the Republic of Liberia, at the
2006 Annual Meetings

Annual Report 2006Chapter O01 Activities of the Boards

Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso,
for his unrelentless support during the preparation of the meetings.

Mr. Bouda commended the Boards of
Directors, senior management, and Bank
staff for helping the AfDB pursue and
consolidate its development mission. He
noted that the performance of the AfDB
in 2005 and the quality of its products
and services to RMCs confirm its solidity and resourcefulness. In concluding his
statement, Mr. Bouda applauded the introduction of the Governors’ Forum during
the 2006 Annual Meetings, noting that
the Forum would facilitate dialogue on
Bank Group and international community
initiatives and guide senior management
on issues relating to these initiatives. He
wished all participants success in their
deliberations.

In his opening statement, the President
of Burkina Faso, His Excellency Blaise
Compaoré, welcomed delegates to his
country and expressed the hope that
they would have useful discussions and
a memorable stay in Ouagadougou. He
noted that the meetings were taking place
against a backdrop of substantial increases
in the cost of petroleum products. Given
the impact of such high costs on the daily
lives of Africans, he suggested that Africa
and its partners design and implement
programs that provide practical solutions
to the legitimate concerns of Africans. He
stressed that through good governance
RMCs could meet the expectations of their
citizens while competing effectively with
other nations.

 

In conclusion, President Compaoré outlined
the challenges that African countries and
institutions must address to give hope to
future generations. These include reducing poverty; fostering a corruption-free
and stable socio-political environment to
encourage domestic and foreign investment;
accelerating economic growth and pursuing

Annual Report 2006

fair multilateral trade, and promoting regional integration. He commended President
Kaberuka's efforts to consolidate the Bank’s
achievements, and G8 countries for their
multilateral debt cancellation initiative.

n his speech, AfDB President, Donald
Kaberuka, acknowledged the presence
of 4 distinguished African Heads of State
and Government as a historic occurrence
hat indicated their collective support
and commitment to the institution. He
expressed gratitude to the government
and the people of Burkina Faso, and to
President Blaise Compaoré, in particular,
for hosting the 2006 Annual Meetings.
He also thanked the government and the
people of Tunisia for continuing to host
he AfDB Temporary Relocation Agency,
hus enabling the Bank Group to consolidate and deepen its normal operations.
He wished the people of Céte d'Ivoire,
he host country of the Bank's headquarers, success in their quest for peace and
national reconciliation. As well, he paid
tribute to his 6 predecessors for their
dedication and invaluable service to the
AfDB and to Africa.

 

President Kaberuka expressed optimism
about Africa's capacity to significantly reduce
poverty within a decade in light of easing

conflicts, increasing restoration of peace and
democracy, and good governance in a growing number of countries. In this context, he
welcomed development partners’ growing
support to Africa and, observing that the
next decade would be a crucial one, calle
on the continent's development partners to
double official development assistance an\
reduce trade barriers.

On the financial front, Mr. Kaberuka note
that the sound financial standing of the
AfDB reflected its strong shareholder support, sound capital adequacy, and pruden
financial management and policies. He
assured shareholders that he would consolidate the Bank's financial position and ensure
that it utilizes its ever-growing riskbearing
capacity to better support its borrowing
RMCs. In addition, the institution woul
Strategically refocus its lending on low- ani
middle-income countries and scale up support to post-conflict and fragile states.

 

Mr. Kaberuka underscored management's
determination to step up efforts to improve
the Bank Group's structure, policies and
procedures, and to maintain rigorous institutional standards. He commended Bank
Group staff for their commitment and
reiterated his determination to nurture
staff and make the institution a magnet for

 

 

2006 Annual Meetingsmore talent and a center of excellence. This
would involve sharpening the Bank Group's
focus and selectivity in specific areas.

On operational priorities, President
Kaberuka reiterated that the AfDB would
strengthen selectivity and focus primarily on infrastructure (roads, transportation,
energy, water supply and sanitation) and
on the financial sector. In particular, the
Bank Group would give priority to regional
highways and corridors that open up highpotential areas and diversify vulnerable
local economies, thus helping unleash the
potential of RMCs to create private sector
jobs, which are the foundation of greater
prosperity and sustainable growth.

The President stressed that the AfDB would
also enhance development effectiveness
and results by helping its 53 RMCs fight
corruption. He called for prompt and timely
delivery of assistance to post-conflict and
fragile countries, underscoring that for
the AfDB to become a reliable partner in
resolving urgent needs, it must make the
requisite commitments and better assume
and manage risks.

Mr. Kaberuka underscored that the AfDB
could provide support to help MICs integrate
the global economy, unleash the potential

 

of their private sectors, and strengthen
heir efforts to enhance competitiveness. He
reviewed the on-going institutional reforms
aimed at improving effectiveness by bringing
he Bank closer to its clients, enhancing its
‘ocus on RMCs and its responsiveness to
heir diversified needs. Finally the President
acknowledged the potential role of regional
integration in strengthening growth and
development in Africa and called on African
leaders to eliminate visa requirements as a
commitment to regional integration.

n their respective statements, the 4 Heads
of State and Government in attendance
commended the President, the government, and the people of Burkina Faso for
osting the meetings and for the hospitality
extended to them and to their delegations.
hey congratulated the AfDB President for
jaunching institutional reforms that will
strategically reposition the Bank to better
meet the development challenges facing
its RMCs. They called on the AfDB to seize
he historic opportunity provided by its
current rejuvenating process, a favorable
international environment, and the continent's determination to chart a democratic
ath—with more and more countries pursuing inclusive and competitive politics
hat provide the basis for peace—to fulfill
and deepen its development mandate.

 

Heads of State and Government at the 2006 Annual Meetings

Activities of the Boards Chapter 001

The Heads of State and Government also
encouraged the Bank to help its RMCs
fight corruption and foster good governance; build robust and resilient national
institutions in order to pursue effective
and coherent national development strategies; improve economic management and
consolidate the rule of law; and develop a
strong private sector and credible media.
Finally, the Heads of State and Government
urged the AfDB to take action to mainstream governance-based evaluations and
reporting into its programs and projects.

Governors’ Statements

Governors thanked the government and
people of Burkina Faso for hosting the 2006
Meetings and for the warm hospitality and
generous facilities provided. They stressed
that the slightly favorable economic and
social conditions and positive economic
growth in African countries would not
suffice, especially in sub-Saharan Africa,
to achieve the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Consequently, they urged
RMCs to deepen reforms to promote sustainable growth—which should be less
dependent on commodity prices and on
the weather. They highlighted the challenges facing the continent: poverty and
related problems (in particular food security and malnutrition), the HIV/AIDS pandemic, development challenges, including
good governance, and conflict prevention
and resolution.

In the light of these challenges, Governors
urged the international community to
support national efforts by honoring its
promise to assist the development efforts
of RMCs and to provide market access for
their exports. However, they also called upon
African countries to improve development
planning to ensure rational use of scarce
aid resources and encouraged the AfDB to
provide RMCs with the requisite support.
Governors welcomed the attendant reforms
undertaken under President Kaberuka’s
leadership.

Annual Report 2006Chapter O01 Activities of the Boards

Measures taken by the Bank Group to
implement NEPAD programs—of crucial
importance to Africa—were deemed encouraging by Governors, who were also pleased
with actions taken to deliver on the Bank's
mandate as leader in infrastructure development. In this regard, they welcomed the
establishment of a special fund for the preparation of NEPAD infrastructure projects. The
Infrastructure Consortium for Africa, the Africa
Water Facility, the Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation Initiative were among the initiatives applauded by Governors as an indication
of the Bank's support for RMCs' efforts to
reduce poverty and attain the MDGs.

Governors approved of the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and the special
modalities for the contribution of US$8.54 billion under this initiative. They thanked donors
for supporting the initiative, which will allow
beneficiary countries to secure the additional
resources needed to attain the MDGs. They
encouraged the AfDB to deepen its support to
borrowing RMCs, focusing on priorities such
as the development of an enhanced culture
of efficiency, to consolidate institutional and
operational achievements and results. This
will require rigorous, results-based management, complemented by enhanced qualityat-entry of projects. Governors underscored
that timely implementation of an enhanced
decentralization strategy would strengthen
AfDB's responsiveness to its clients and
increase its development impact.

 

 

 

 

Several Governors reiterated the need to
(i) strengthen the Bank’s alliances with other
regional, international, and multilateral partners; (ii) focus efforts on comparative advantage, to better manage limited resources, in
conformity with the NEPAD mandate and
with the principles of aid harmonization
and efficiency; (iii) ensure greater selectivity
and complementarity with other donors; and
(iv) promote better economic and regional
integration.

 

Other Governers called upon the Bank to focus
on the situation of fragile states; support RMCs

Annual Report 2006

in creating an enabling environment for the
effective development of the private sector;
and reinforce borrowing member countries’
capacity to fight corruption, promote good
governance, transparency, and a strong culture
of responsibility and accountability. Most
Governors therefore noted with great interest
the proposal to establish within the Bank a
framework to prevent fraud and corruption.
They encouraged the AfDB to mainstream
gender issues into development programming,
as these issues are critical for development.
In this regard, they applauded the appointment of 2 women as vice-presidents—out
of 5 vice presidents—and encouraged the
President to pursue efforts to ensure gender
balance at all levels.

Finally, Governors underscored the need to
promote activities that also favor middleincome countries, reiterating that actions
should be underpinned by the need to
strengthen the analytical capacities of
human resources. Governors considered the
Bank’s agenda challenging, but expressed
broad support for it, given the Bank's
track record of reforms since 1995. They
encouraged the Bank to adapt to the new
exigencies of development objectives by
building on the diversity and strengths of
its new management team and dedicated
staff. In closing, Governors reiterated their
firm support for the institution and urged
it to implement its agenda without delay to
reaffirm its position as a first-class development bank for African countries.

Governors’ Resolutions

During the Annual Meetings, the Boards of
Governors considered and adopted resolutions on the ADB and the ADF (Appendixes
\l-1 and Ill-1). They endorsed a report

Annual Report 2006Chapter O01 Activities of the Boards

as highlighted in Table 1.1. Through its 8
country portfolio review missions, the Bank
Group scaled up active management of its
portfolio and identified projects less likely
0 achieve their development outcomes and
impact. Most of the problem projects identiied were partly or fully cancelled, thereby
teeing up UA 302.7 million, which will be
used to finance new projects in 2007, before
he end of the ADF-X cycle.

The 2007 Administrative Expenses
and Capital Expenditure Budgets

in December 2006, the ADB Board of Directors
approved an administrative expenses budget
of UA 193.7 million, a capital expenditure
udget of UA 6.9 million, and a contingency
udget of UA 1.9 million for 2007. The ADF
Board of Directors approved an indicative
administrative budget of UA 145.8 million
‘or the Fund for the financial year ending
December 31, 2007. The Bank Group's 2007
udget was anchored on prior strategic
decisions taken by the Boards of Governors
and Directors, the Action Plan, and policy
decisions endorsed by the Boards under
he 2003-2007 Strategic Plan. The budget
was also prepared within the framework of
institutional reforms and of the proposed
decentralization strategy aimed at strengthening internal organizational effectiveness
and maximizing development impact.

 

Other Activities of the Boards of
Directors

The Boards of Directors also considered
several operational, financial, and administrative issues within the framework of its
6 established advisory committees. Major
committee activities during 2006 are highlighted below.

Committee of the Whole

This committee is chaired by the President of
the Bank Group and comprises all Executive
Directors. During the year, it reviewed the
Bank Group's annual budget proposals and
other matters referred to it by the Boards
on an ad hoc basis.

In 2006, the Bank Group implemented far-reaching reforms designed to deepen development effectiveness in its RMCs. This chapter reviews the main activities of the Bank Group's organizational units in
the light of these institutional reforms.

INSTITUTIONAL
REFORMS

In recent years, the AfDB has often been
called upon to lead continent-wide initiatives such as the New Partnership
for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), the
Rural Water and Sanitation Initiative, the
African Water Facility, the Infrastructure
Consortium for Africa, and regional integration. As well, bilateral donors have
been relying increasingly on the Bank as
a key partner for delivering assistance and
maximizing development impact in the
continent. To strengthen the Bank Group's
institutional capacity to meet these challenges and opportunities, the Boards of
Directors approved, in April 2006, a proposal to strengthen the Bank Group's
organizational structure. The reforms
centered on the Operations Complexes
and on the Office of the Chief Economist.
With the added impetus provided by the
increasing international focus on Africa,
these changes will strengthen the institution's role as a key development partner.

The ongoing institutional reforms will reinforce the Bank Group's capacity to deliver
on its poverty reduction and sustainable
economic development mandates, with
emphasis on attaining the MDGs. The
reforms are underpinned by the need to (i)
consolidate the Bank's achievements and
reposition it for greater effectiveness and
efficiency; (ii) meet the evolving development challenges of RMCs; and (iii) provide
leadership in areas where the Bank Group
has developed, or can develop, a compara
Annual Report 2006

tive advantage, and in those mandated by
RMCs, the NEPAD, and the international
community.

The new structure, which entered into
force on July 1, 2006, will allow the Bank
Group to strengthen its resource base, shift
resources to operations, reinforce its knowledge capacity, improve its response to key
institutional priorities, and build capacity for greater decentralization in order
‘0 improve country focus. Furthermore, it
will increase the Bank's capacity to deliver
core financial and knowledge services to
RMCs while meeting growing demands
or infrastructure development, regional
integration, good governance, and sound
economic management.

n the wake of the organizational reforms,
he Bank Group also introduced policy and
usiness process changes—in particular
human resources management and
budget reforms—to ensure the effecive implementation of the reforms and the
achievement of development objectives.
hese changes, coupled with the ongoing
decentralization, will play a critical role in
uilding a more results-oriented instituion, as recommended by the Boards of
Governors, and will better position the
Bank Group to scale up the development
impact of its operations in its RMCs.

 

 

he priority of the Bank Group's decentralization strategy is wider and more
effective country presence, with due
attention to the quality, effectiveness, and
cost-efficiency of country offices. Thus, the

main pillars of the strategy are (i) greater
empowerment of, and delegation of, authority to field offices; (ii) optimization of field
office staffing levels and skills mix—based
on country strategy, priorities, portfolio size
and nature; (iii) effective field office contribution to portfolio management and project
implementation; and (iv) strong monitoring
and auditing mechanisms to ensure the
integrity of procedures and processes. The
strategy also envisages fiduciary safeguards
to mitigate risks associated with increased
delegation of authority.

During the ADF-X Mid-Term Review meeting
at The Hague, The Netherlands, in December
2006, the Bank Group was urged to step up
action to ensure timely and effective implementation of its decentralization program.
By end-2006 the decentralization program
was on track: 21 of the 25 country offices
had been opened—excluding Tunisia; and
13 of the 21 offices were fully operational
with resident representatives. The remaining
8 were being managed by officers-in-charge,
pending the appointment of permanent representatives, and are slated to become fully
operational before the end of 2007. The
opening of 3 country offices (Angola, Algeria,
and Sudan) was still contingent on the
signing of home country agreements. These
offices are expected to open and become
fully operational before the end of the ADF-X
cycle (see Table 2.1). A Bank Group National
Program Office was also opened in Guinea
Bissau and is now operational.

In July 2006, President Kaberuka and
his senior staff—vice-presidents, chief ofcabinet and senior advisers—met during a retreat in Tunis to reflect on the
Bank Group’s institutional strategy and
on change management issues. The senior management team focused on critical
gaps and key priorities and agreed on
the way forward as well as on a progress
monitoring mechanism. They also reached
consensus on the vision and aspirations of
the AfDB: The Bank can, and should, play a
greater and more visible role in delivering
results in Africa in order to become the
premier voice on African development, a
trusted and respected partner of choice for
RMCs. During 2006 as well, the President
of the Bank Group established a panel
of eminent persons tasked with making
recommendations on the future strategic
role and interventions of the AfDB (see
Box 2.1).

KNOWLEDGE
MANAGEMENT AND
RESEARCH

One of the objectives of the new organiZational structure is to unleash the Bank
Group's potential as a knowledge institution. To this end, the Office of the Chief
Economist was strengthened and a new
Chief Economist appointed to revamp,
guide, and coordinate all knowledge-related activities across the institution. The
Bank's research program was divided into 5
research clusters: (i) Poverty Reduction and
the MDGs; (ii) Macroeconomic Dynamics
and Growth; (iii) Governance, Institutions,
and Public Sector Management; (iv)
Investment Climate and Competitiveness
of African Economies; and (v) Regional
Integration and Trade.

Development Research

Research activities during 2006 focused on
aid, debt relief, and development in Africa;
debt relief and service delivery in African
countries; the impact of oil prices on African
economies; a prospective analysis of oil and
gas resources in Africa; the performance and

Box 2.1: High Level Advisory Panel on Strategic Role of AfDB

In 2006, President Kaberuka established an independent High Level Advisory Panel to advise the Bank on
its strategic vision and on the medium- to long-term operational strategies needed to achieve the vision.
The establishment of this panel reflects the AfDB’s commitment to strengthen support for the continental
development agenda and comes at a time of new opportunities and challenges for Africa.

The panel is co-chaired by H.E. Joachim CHISSANO, former President of Mozambique, and the Right
Honorable Paul Martin, former Prime Minister of Canada. The members of the panel include: Professor
Chedly AYARI; Mr. Soumaila CISSE; Mr. Francois-Xavier DE DONNEA; Sir Timothy LANKESTER; Mr. E.
Tumusiime MUTEBILE; Professor Wiseman NHKULU; Mr. Poul NIELSON; Dr. Ndi Onyiuke OKEREKE; Dr.
Judith RODIN; Mr. Jean-Michel SEVERINO; Professor Joseph STIGLITZ; and Mr. Morisho YUMA.

The panel will consult with internal and external stakeholders, particularly in Africa, to gather views and
ideas on key challenges facing the Bank Group. The major issues under consideration include (i) the
Bank Group's ambition; (ii) operational priorities and choices, including knowledge management; (iii)
relevant and well-adapted Bank support to all RMCs; (iv) resources, instruments and modalities; and
(v) partnerships.

The panel started work in October 2006 and is expected to present its preliminary findings to the AfDB
President in time for the May 2007 Annual Meetings. It will submit its final report by September 2007.
In addition to making recommendations, the panel will play an advocacy role, building consensus for the
vision and a long-term strategy for its implementation.

Initiatives undertaken in 2006 include
the organization of the inaugural AfDB
Economic Conference (AEC) in Tunis, from
November 22 to 24, 2006. The conference sought to provide the Bank Group
with a proactive mechanism for generating
research products from Bank investments
and from collaboration with other development networks and research institutions
(see Box 2.2). Other initiatives included
the establishment of networking groups of
economists and researchers.

Statistical Services

The Bank Group continued to scale up its
statistical capacity building activities within
the framework of the Reference Regional
Strategic Framework for Statistical Capacity
Building in Africa, prepared in collaboration
with the Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA), the World Bank, and OECD-Paris
21. Activities were motivated by the need
for reliable and up-to-date data to improve
measurement, monitoring, and managing
for development results. Activities focused
primarily on improving data availability and
quality and on strengthening the institutional capacity of RMCs to produce data.

Major achievements during 2006
included a Bank-led international effort

Annual Report 2006

aimed at providing financial and technical support to help RMCs develop or
update their National Strategies for the
Development of Statistics. The initiative
will help RMCs align their statistical
systems with international standards. It
will also enhance the capacity of RMCs
to provide effective statistical support
for development policy-making, including the monitoring of Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and MDGs. To
this end, in collaboration with the UNDP,

the AfDB launched the MDG Monitoring
and Statistical Literacy Project to help
its member countries build capacity for
monitoring progress in the MDGs and in
national development policies.

The Bank Group continued to support
International Comparison Program (ICP)

|={0) ar e AfDB Economic Conference

The objective of the AfDB's first economic conference was to assess the situation in Africa 5 years
into the 21st Century and examine prospects for
the years ahead. The conference sought to foster
collaboration between national policy makers and
researchers—to ensure the achievement of mutually satisfying outcomes—and to provide the Bank
Group with a mechanism for generating research
products. Over 150 leading experts, national policy
makers, and a number of RMC ambassadors and
diplomats resident in Tunis, as well as Bank management and staff were in attendance.

In his opening remarks, Bank Group President
Donald Kaberuka underscored the institution's
role as a channel for development financing and
a source of advice on best practices, economic
reforms, private sector development, and ownership issues. He reiterated that the Bank Group
had no monopoly on, nor was it a depository of,
capacities, and that its aim was to offer African
researchers a platform that would allow their
voices to be heard. In his remarks, Mr. Kasekende,
the Bank's Chief Economist, stressed the importance of bringing together leading researchers
and policymakers to discuss issues of common
interest and expressed the hope that the outcomes would be mutually beneficial.

In his statement, Professor Olu Ajakaiye, who
delivered an address on behalf of Professor
William Lyakurwa, Executive Director of the
African Economic Research Consortium, recalled
the conditions that led to the creation of the
Consortium, notably the policy choices and challenges facing governments in an ever-changing
environment. Other eminent speakers included
Mr. Cheick Modibo Diarra, Chairman for Microsoft

Africa, who called for infrastructure development across the continent; and the Honorable
Slaheddine Jemmali, Tunisian Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs, who urged Africa to assume
responsibility for its own destiny and underscored
the importance of intra-African dialogue for
sharing experiences. Also in attendance were
Professor Patrick Guillaumont of the Centre
d'études et de recherches sur le Developpment
International (CERDI), France; Professor Ji Hong
Kim of the Korean Development Institute; Dr. Alan
Gelb of the World Bank; and Professor Paul Collier
from the University of Oxford. These and other
renowned experts presented discussion papers
aimed at sharing insights about the current situation in Africa and generating recommendations
for policy analysts and policy makers.

The plenary session of the conference covered
3 main topics: (a) enhancing Africa's economic
growth; (b) the private sector as an engine of
growth in Africa, and (c) trade issues in Africa.
The concurrent thematic sessions focused on 4
current policy issues that are relevant for Africa’s
growth and development: (a) wealth creation and
equity in Africa; (b) trade and regional integration;
(c) finance and investment; and (d) growth and
sectoral policy issues.

Papers presented at the conference will be published for the widest possible dissemination
among policy makers in RMCs, international
organizations, donor organizations, and other
stakeholders in Africa's development. The AfDB
Economic Conference will become an annual
Bank Group event. Follow-up activities to actualize key conference recommendations are planned
for 2007 and 2008.to RMCs—throughout the implementation
phase of ICP data collection activities—
to improve consumer price indices (CPI).
Financial and technical support was also
made available to statistical training centers
in Africa to (i) enhance their curricula, and
(ii) provide appropriate statistical training of
immediate relevance to the African environment. The AfDB also published 2 volumes
of the bi-annual African Statistical Journal
in 2006.

Capacity Building and Training

The AfDB supports capacity building—
within the institution and in RMCs—
through training, assistance to national
institutions, and knowledge dissemination. In 2006, the Bank Group’s African
Development Institute and the Joint Africa
Institute (JAI) conducted complementary
workshops, seminars, and symposia aimed
at building capacity in RMCs. In cooperation with other institutions, the Bank Group
also organized development management
seminars and conferences, such as the
2006 Annual Meetings seminars and the
joint AfDB/ECA roundtable discussion on
Infrastructure Development and Regional
Integration (see Chapter 1). A number
of training activities, some of which will
continue in 2007, were also organized for
Bank staff (see Table 2.2).

With financial support from the Dutch
Trust Fund, the AfDB also prepared a
comprehensive capacity-building program on stakeholder consultation and
participation. It organized a training
session in Burkina Faso, in October
2006, for Bank staff and 60 practitioners
from Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal. A
similar workshop will be held in Uganda
in January 2007 for practitioners from
Uganda, Rwanda, and Tanzania. The
Bank also prepared a training manual
to guide the continuous mainstreaming
of stakeholder participation into policy
and project work. In collaboration with
sister institutions, it completed a data

base designed to provide information
on development NGOs in Africa and to
promote partnerships.

Within the context of the Bank's partnership and staff exchange arrangements
with the Bretton Woods Institutions, 3
Bank staff spent 3 months at the World
Bank and the IMF, as part of a knowledge
sharing exercise. As well, 60 staff members
were sent abroad for training, and 5 staff
members were awarded scholarships to
deepen their knowledge in areas that are
relevant to the Bank’s priorities. The Bank
Group plans to increase the number of
scholarships to cover strategic areas in
which it seeks to deepen its comparative
advantage. Through a competitive process,
the Japan Fellowship program, funded by
the Japanese government and managed by
the Bank, also awarded 12 scholarships to
young African scholars to pursue master’s
degree programs in fields related to Africa's
social and economic development.

Under the Eminent Speakers’ Program,
launched in 2006, 5 renowned personalities were invited to share their knowledge
of contemporary development issues facing
Africa with Bank management and staff
(see Table 2.3). Henceforth, the Eminent
Speakers’ Program will be held 4 times
per year.

OPERATIONAL POLICY
DEVELOPMENT AND
REVIEW

Policy and review activities in 2006 continued to serve as a critical foundation for
strengthening the development effectiveness of AfDB support to RMCs. Activities
focused on promoting quality assurance in
operations, ensuring compliance with policies and procedures, monitoring portfolio
performance and management, contributing to the preparation of operational
policies and guidelines, and promoting
development effectiveness.

Annual Report 2006

Major achievements included the assessment of the effectiveness of the Bank group
ines of credit as tools for promoting development and reducing poverty; the producion of new generations of Results-Based
Country Strategy Papers (RB-CSPs), with an
enhanced poverty focus; and the mid-term
review of the Bank's Gender Plan of Action
‘or 2004-2005 to determine progress, gaps,
challenges, and the way forward. The Bank
Group also implemented innovative operational initiatives—to strengthen its instituional capacity and that of RMCs—to mainstream environmental and social issues into
he policy dialogue and project cycles.

 

n further developments, the Bank Group
prepared a paper on lessons learned from
implementing Budget Support and Sectorwide Approaches (SWAps) in operations
and drafted a Framework for Project Risk
Analysis and Management—to guide the

preparation of project appraisal reports by
Operations staff. It also launched a number
of initiatives that will be concluded in 2007,
in particular, the preparation of strategies on
fragile states and middle-income countries
and of an urban development policy. By
end-2006, considerable progress had also
been made in the preparation of a number
of operational policies and guidelines. These
included the elaboration of the “ResultsBased Management Implementation Plan”,
the revision of business processes, including “Eligible Expenditures for Bank Group
Financing: Issues and Proposals”; the “Policy
Framework for Enhancing the Use of Country
Systems in Bank Group Operations”; “Size
of Operations and Approval Authority”.
Most of these policy documents are on
track to be finalized in 2007.

In 2006, the Bank Group focused on preparing Quality of Supervision Assessment

Appraisal Review Checklist, preparation of
Results-Based Logframe training documents (for training in 2007), and approval
by the Boards of a Microfinance Policy
and Strategy.

EVALUATION OF
OPERATIONS

Considerable progress was made in enhancing the accountability and learning dimension of the Bank Group's development
effectiveness efforts and the independent
operations evaluation function in 2006.
The number of evaluations undertaken
increased substantially, and the evaluation
reporting process was improved. The application of relevant evaluation findings, lessons, and recommendations in the design
of new operations was also enhanced, and
significant improvements made in project
and program monitoring and evaluation,
and in responsiveness to RMCs.

Other major achievements in 2006
included the completion or implementation of country assistance evaluations
and country sector reviews in Ghana,
Tanzania, Morocco, and Ethiopia; the completion of the “Review of Assistance in the
Health Sector”; and harmonization and
joint assistance strategies’ assessment in
Ethiopia, Mozambique, Uganda, Tanzania,
and Zambia. These assessments revealed
that the Bank Group was broadly in line
with alignment and harmonization principles and was moving in the right direction
in its quest for greater decentralization, an
improved poverty reduction strategy process, and selectivity to enhance comparative
advantage. In 2006, the Bank Group also

initiated new evaluations in agriculture and
rural development, infrastructure, regional
integration, and transportation.

HUMAN RESOURCES
MANAGEMENT

The Bank Group's staffing complement at
December 31, 2006, was 1,044 (including
52 elected officers and staff attached to the
Boards), compared with 1,072 in 2005 and
1,043 in 2004. Staff in 2006 comprised
5 vice presidents, 1 secretary general, 1
chief economist, 22 directors, 41 managers (including 11 resident representatives),

Corporate and Financial Management Chapter 002

583 professionals, and 339 general services staff members. Eighty (80) percent of
professional and management staff at post
was from RMCs while 20 percent was from
non-RMCs. Of the 68 management staff,
21 percent was from non-RMCs. In all, 78
percent of regular management and professional staff members at post were male,
and 22 percent female. The female/male
ratio at the management level was 10/90
percent in 2006. The Bank's objective is to
bring this ratio to 20/80 percent by end of
2007. The distribution of staff at post is
presented in Table 2.4.

Staff Planning and Recruitment
With the implementation of the Bank
Group’s institutional reforms in 2006, the
priority, from a human resources management perspective, was to retain or reassign
highly skilled personnel to support the new
organizational structure. In pursuit of this
objective, Staff Planning and Recruitme
implemented a number of measures, including (i) reassigning 450 staff members, based
on their skills-mix and the needs of the
departments; (ii) managing the enhance
recruitment process to fill 43 vacancies
at the levels of directors, unit heads, an
managers; (iii) developing a diversity policy
to reflect the Bank's commitment, and; (iv)
recruiting adequate and experienced sta
with relevant skills-mix for field and existing
offices.

Ss =

 

Interviews for vacant director and heads o
unit positions were concluded in December
2006. Interviews for managers and lea
economists are expected to be conclude
by the end of January 2007. Managemen
plans to accelerate the recruitment process in 2007 in order to fill most of the
vacancies before the end of the year. This
is crucial if the institution is to reduce
its current vacancy rate during 2007—to
about 5 percent, from its current level of
over 20 percent—taking into account positions arising out of attrition, owing to both
normal and voluntary retirements, as well
as to unforeseen departures. Recruitment
for field offices was completed for Rwanda,
Burkina Faso and Morocco, and interviews
were concluded to fill vacancies in the
Uganda, Egypt, and Mozambique country
offices. These actions will strengthen the
Bank Group's capacity to respond effectively to country dialogue and portfolio
management challenges.

 

The far-reaching reforms launched in July
2006 created dual career path positions,
which will provide opportunities and incentives for staff to build technical skills. These
positions will also support the enhance

were underpinned by management's commitment to create a more diverse and balanced
workforce in terms of geographical represenation, gender, age, and language, as well as
‘0 mainstream crosscutting experts. To this
end, an institutional diversity and inclusion
initiative was launched during 2006. The
initiative entailed establishing a compreensive policy framework to address related
issues, adopting relevant policies and pracices, and implementing related reform measures. During the third quarter of 2006, the
“Diversity and Inclusion Policy, the Action
Plan” and the “Terms of Reference for a
Senior Advisor on Diversity” were completed
and presented to the Boards of Directors.

 

FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT

The overriding objective of the financial
management function is to ensure efficient use of the Bank Group's financial
resources and risk-bearing capacity. In
pursuit of this objective, the Bank Group
focuses on 2 activity areas: the formulation of financial and risk management
policies, guidelines, and procedures; and
the monitoring and reporting on compliance thereof. Financial management
operations are divided into 3 thematic
groups: (i) asset and liability management, (ii) credit risk management, and (iii)
treasury risk management.

Asset and Liability Management

In 2006, the Bank Group continued to focus
its asset and liability management (ALM)
activities on the implementation of its financial reform program, launched in 1996. The
Bank's ALM Guidelines were updated to
enable a wider range of counter parties for
treasury activities while continuing to keep

the counter party credit risk under control.
A pilot program in credit derivatives was
carried out to increase efficiency in counter
party credit risk management.

Credit Risk Management

Given the risks associated with the growing
emphasis on non-sovereign projects in its
lending operations, the Bank Group continued to adjust its credit risk management
instruments accordingly. Credit opinions
were submitted to the Board for new commercial projects with innovative structuring
features. The Bank Group also continued
to focus on developing and implementing
the Showcase Projects Initiative (SPI) to significantly improve project quality at entry.
The SPI aims to provide staff with the tools
needed to perform state-of-the-art project
appraisals, including pertinent risk and
stakeholder impact assessments. The SPI
was implemented through practical training
in 2006, and resulted in the development
of relevant pedagogical materials that will
be used for future project appraisals across
the Bank Group during the ADF-X period
and beyond.

 

Treasury Risk Management

In 2006, the Bank Group focused its
treasury risk management activities on
strengthening straight-through processing of treasury transactions and building
decision support tools for performance
analysis, risk analysis, and control of treasury activities. Following the adoption of
the fair value option, a methodology was
implemented for the valuation of the borrowing portfolio in order to ensure compliance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.

INTERNAL AUDIT

The Bank Group's internal audit function
continued to provide independent and
objective assurance, advisory, and consulting services aimed at improving Bank
Group operations. Since the systematicevaluation of control, risk management,
and governance processes adds value to
he Bank's activities, the 2006 Internal
Audit Annual Work Program was based
on a risk-based, long-term coverage plan
centered on operations, finance, and cororate administrative activities. Overall,
60 percent of resources budgeted for
audit activities in 2006 was spent on
operations (including external offices) and
inance audits. The balance was spent
on advisory services, the monitoring of
rior observations, and recommendation
accounts. The Bank Group conducted 9
audits in the Operations Complex and 5
in the Finance and Corporate Complex.
t also received 11 complaints on corruption and fraud allegations; 3 of them
were fully investigated and closed, and
he remaining 8 are still under close
investigation.

 

GENERAL COUNSEL
AND LEGAL SERVICES

he Bank Group's legal function continued
‘0 provide enhanced services to foster the
effectiveness of, and compliance with, the
Bank Group's internal rules and regulaions, as well as with applicable laws
and legal best practices, while providing
he Bank Group with the flexibility to
e innovative, effective, and responsive
‘o the diverse needs of its RMCs. Legal
services and advice were provided on
a number of issues, including (i) the
2006 Annual Meetings; (ii) the adopion and operationalization of the MDRI;
(iii) the negotiation and conclusion of
ost country agreements and other legal
instruments related to the Bank Group’s
decentralization strategy; (iv) the preparaion, with other donors, of Memoranda of
Understanding on coordinating budget
support operations in RMCs; (v) the conclusion and implementation of financing
agreements for Bank Group operations;
and (vi) the design of the legal framework
for the adoption and implementation of

 

 

the revised Bank Group policy on Technical
Cooperation Trust Funds.

A number of legal milestones were also
reached during 2006. A deed of compromise was concluded with the Cayman
Island liquidators of the defunct Bank
of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI). Under this deed, the AfDB received
US$ 16.5 million, about 81 percent of
total ADF and NTF claims of deposits

procurement and financial management
activities in 2006: the combination of
project financial management responsibilities and procurement activities under the
Procurement Unit, and the consolidation of
all Bank Group procurement functions and
responsibilities under the new Procurement
and Project Financial Management Unit.

Key procurement monitoring activities
included the revision of procurement policy
rules; the development of guidelines, guidance notes, and manuals; and the provision of technical assistance to Operations
Departments during the project cycle. Other
activities included the review of 250 complex procurement issues concerning projects
in RMCs; the completion of the “Annual
Procurement Post Review Report for 2005",
and post-review missions for 7 on-going
projects identified in the “Annual Portfolio
Performance Review” as high risk projects

Annual Report 200620

Chapter 002 Corporate and Financial Management

with procurement problems; and the preparation of a 12-monthly procurement brief
summarizing sensitive procurement issues
that were officially reviewed and resolved.

The Bank Group sought to reinforce RMC's
procurement capacity through 14 national
project implementation workshops, jointly
implemented with the Africa Development
Institute. It also delivered 3 training seminars on procurement for Bank staff. To
strengthen policy dialogue, communications, and interaction with clients and
partners, the Bank conducted 11 business
opportunities seminars in RMCs and held
9 other seminars in Tunis for visiting RMC
delegations.

In 2006, the Bank Group took action
to ramp up cooperation with sister institutions in order to meet the
Partnership Commitments on Managing
for Development Results under the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
To this end, it participated in several
activities, including meetings of MDB
heads of procurement, to agree on
“Master Procurement Documents”; it
also continued to participate in the
OECD-DAC/World Bank Joint Venture
on Procurement and in the preparation of Country Procurement Assessment
Reports (CPARs).

CORPORATE
COMMUNICATIONS

The Bank Group's communications strategy is aimed at projecting the Bank Group's
brand identity in order to reposition the

Annual Report 2006

Bank as an agile, transparent, responsive,
and effective development institution that
is strongly committed to transparency and
to disclosure of information. To achieve
these objectives, communications activities
in 2006 focused on the strategic use of different mass communications channels to
reach target audiences in the continent and
around the globe. As a result, by end-2006,
innovative approaches in the use of web,
audiovisual and multimedia technologies,
and print media were becoming standard
practice in the Bank Group. Furthermore,
the range of communications activities
had increased significantly, reflecting the
shift in the corporate culture to a culture of
openness and enhanced communications.

Considerable progress was made in several areas in 2006: the number of media
campaigns around thematic or sectoral
issues increased. A multimedia center
was created and new communications
platforms used to ensure the dissemination of the Bank's message to new audiences around the globe; and the Bank's
Public Information Center was upgraded
and registered a significant increase in
the number of visitors and of requests
for documents. As well, the information
dissemination capacity of field offices
was enhanced to cope with the rising
demand for external communications
and outreach envisioned under the new
Communications Strategy.

To enhance internal communications, the
Bank Group's flagship publication, Bank
in Action, which covers a range of issues,
including progress reports on ongoing

projects and activities in field offices, was
transformed into a more reader-friendly
e-newsletter. An important new feature,
Our Choice Project, was added to the
web homepage and to the e-newsletter

Chapter 003 Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization

In 2006, the Bank Group took action to mainstream managing for development results (MfDRs) principles into its operations and to help its RMCs meet the Partnership Commitments under the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. This
chapter reviews these actions, as well as Bank Group initiatives, resource mobilization and allocation, and partnership and

cooperation activities.

Operational Priorities

The Bank Group’s overarching objective in
2006 was to promote economic growth
to reduce poverty in RMCs. To this end,
the institution stepped up efforts to focus
on its priority areas of intervention at the
country and regional levels. These priority
areas, which are in line with the Bank's
strategic orientations, are as follows:

© Country level: human development;
agriculture and agro-industry; private
sector development; governance,
economic and financial reform; and
infrastructure (transportation, power
support, communications, water
supply, and sanitation).

¢ Subregional level: water initiatives,
integration and trade, and economic
co-operation and regional
development.

© Crosscutting issues: gender
mainstreaming, and environmental
management.

In addition to focusing on these
areas of intervention, the Bank Group
continued to pursue ongoing or new
initiatives (notably those related to
harmonization, water initiatives, NEPAD),
and to support debt relief under the
enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative, the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI), and the Post Conflict

Annual Report 2006

Country Facility (PCCF). It also pursued
bilateral technical cooperation activities,
which focus on mobilizing, managing, and
administering grant resources provided by
donors to support the Bank’s activities in
RMCs.

BANK GROUP INITIATIVES

Harmonization, Alignment and
Managing for Development Results
Fragmentation of donor programs, divergence in donor objectives, and multiplicity
of donor requirements translate into high
transaction costs for aid delivery and strain
on national administrative capacity. The
Harmonization, Alignment and Managing
for Development Results (HA and MfDR)
agenda seeks to address these issues by
strengthening country ownership and government leadership, and aligning development assistance with the development
priorities and results-oriented strategies of
partner countries. The agenda also aims to
align donor policies, procedures, and practices with country processes and systems,
and to strengthen the capacity of national
systems to enhance aid effectiveness to
achieve the MDGs.

The HA and MfDR Action Plan and
Progress in its Implementation

The AfDB continued to work closely with
other development partners and RMCs
to advance the Paris Declaration (March
2005) commitments on ownership, alignment, harmonization, managing for devel
opment results, and mutual accountability.
In 2006, the Bank took measures to mainstream HA and MfDR principles into all its
operations, issuing a revised HA and MfDR
Action Plan that incorporates monitorable actions at the institutional, country,
and global levels. The following sections
highlight major actions undertaken by the
Bank Group to advance the HA and MfDR
agenda.

Joint Assistance Strategy
The Bank Group collaborated with other
donors in preparing 3 joint country assistance strategies (JAS) for Tanzania, Zambia,
and the Central African Republic (CAR).
The JAS for the CAR was finalized in
2006; those for Tanzania and Zambia
are on track for completion in 2007. By
December 2006, such collaborative efforts
had already begun to help focus the Bank's
operational engagement in clearly defined
strategic areas, as demonstrated by the
snapshot of Tanzania's JAS in Box 3.1

 

Managing for Development Results

The Bank Group is determined to take
action to measure, monitor, and manage for development results in order to
become a more results-oriented institution. To this end, it finalized a Results
Measurement Framework and disseminated it to operational staff. This framework will allow the Bank Group to
monitor RMCs' progress in achieving
poverty reduction objectives—and the
Bank's contribution to this progress. TheBank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization Chapter 003

Box 3.1: Scaling up Bank Group Participation in Donor Coordination

— a snapshot of Tanzania’s JAS

 

The Joint Assistance Strategy and Joint Program Document

Donor relations in Tanzania have improved in recent years, notably through the Joint Assistance Strategy
for Tanzania (JAST), adopted in 2006. The JAST guides AfDB programs in Tanzania and is aimed at
achieving international declarations on aid harmonization, alignment and managing for results
objectives through strengthened national ownership, more efficient and effective donor resource use,
avoidance of duplication, and improved predictability of development partners’ support.

To improve aid effectiveness, development partners prepared a results-based Joint Program Document
(PD). To ensure that the joint programming exercise does indeed reduce transaction costs for the
government, development partners are expected to use the JAST and the JPD as the basis for their individual plans. To this end, at end-2006, the Bank Group was developing a cover note to send the 2 documents
to the Boards and to incorporate the Bank Group’s strategy for 2006-2010 within the 2 documents.

Challenges Facing Development Partners

Aid delivery under the JAST requires that development partners re-orient their interventions towards
national ownership of programs and processes. Enhanced selectivity limits the Bank Group's interventions to 2 pillars: growth and poverty reduction and improvement of quality of life and of social
well-being. Increasingly, the Bank Group uses country systems where adequate fiduciary arrangements
exist. Supervision missions will largely concentrate on reviewing progress based on established performance indicators linked to an agreed list of actions for implementation over a specified period. Moreover,
the new system requires a clear and complementary division of labor among development partners,
depending on their orientation and capacity (staffing, skills mix, and financial resources) to take a lead
role in a particular sector or thematic area.

Development Partners Coordination Architecture

The Tanzania Field Office, which became operational in October 2004, has enhanced the visibility of the
Bank Group by participating in donor working groups coordinated by the Development Partner Group.
This continued to facilitate and deepen the alignment of Bank Group interventions in sectors and thematic
priority areas, and complemented the efforts of other development partners. The AfDB and development
partners that support the government through General Budget Support are coordinated through the
Poverty Reduction Budget Support framework that is guided by an agreed Performance Assessment
Framework.

Bank Group also introduced a performance tracking system to measure corporate performance. The system is based
on a set of key indicators that underpin the measurement and reporting of
performance. Furthermore, in 2006 the
Bank Group, in collaboration with other
MDBs, prepared the Second report on
the Common Performance Assessment
System (COMPAS). The report provides
a common source of information on the
contribution of MDBs to development
results in their client countries and how
these contributions can be improved
over time.

Technical and Financial Assistance and
Capacity Building

The Bank Group sought to enhance its
internal capacity in HA and MfDR principles through a series of development
effectiveness seminars. The seminars aimed
to raise the awareness of the Boards as
well as that of Bank management and staff
and to create an opportunity for the sharing of related experiences. Five seminars
were delivered on broad issues relating to
harmonization, alignment and managing
for results; portfolio management; gender;
and utilization of post-evaluation findings,
and recommendations.

Through ongoing initiatives in key priority areas, the Bank Group also continued
to support the implementation of the HA
and MfDR agenda at the country level. It
provided technical and financial assistance
to countries such as Uganda, Mozambique,
and Ethiopia—to reinforce national capacity for the development of country harmonization action plans, strengthen institutions,
and develop human capacity. During 2006,
the Bank's operational strategy shifted
from analytical assessments to implementation of economic and sector work recommendations, including the strengthening
of country public financial management
systems. In this context, the AfDB and
the World Bank jointly supported several
capacity building initiatives in RMCs.

Results-Based Country

Strategy Papers (RB-CSPs)

The Bank Group adopted 8 RB-CSPs—with
improved outcome indicators—in 2006.
RB-CSPs enhance selectivity in operational programming and are expected to
ensure better development impact. The
key enhancements introduced by RB-CSPs
are centered on the inclusion of a results
framework, which shows a country's development outcomes—and the Bank's contribution to these outcomes; and enhanced
selectivity, by limiting the Bank's areas
of interventions from 3 to 1 or a maximum of 2. RB-CSPs also embrace a more
systematic integration of lessons learned
from the Bank's previous interventions in
the country, as well as clear indicators to
monitor progress in the implementation
of the strategy and in the achievement of
results. In total, 27 RB-CSPs were prepared
during 2005-2006, and an additional 8
are planned for 2007.

Results-Based Project

Logical Framework (RB-PLF)

The RB-PLF clearly specifies results expected, timeframes and indicators to monitor them, and beneficiaries. This helps
strengthen the results culture in the design

Annual Report 2006

2324

Chapter 003 Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization

and implementation of Bank operations.
The RB-PLF was introduced in late 2005;
project appraisal reports submitted to the
Boards during 2006 were RB-PLF compliant.

Budget Support and Sector-Wide
Approaches (SWAps)

The Bank Group continued to provide
Development Budget Support and SWAps
to RMCs, in line with guidelines approved
by the Boards of Directors in 2004. Under
ADF-X, the Bank Group approved 3 budget
support operations in 2006, amounting to
UA 115.0 million. Assistance for budget
support and SWAps was provided on a
case-by-case basis to support the implementation of poverty reduction strategies
in RMCs that had reached the HIPC completion point and had reasonably sound
fiduciary standards. Beneficiary countries
were Madagascar, Mozambique and
Zambia.

Harmonizing Approaches to Governance
and Anti-corruption

International development institutions
stepped up efforts to harmonize their governance and anti-corruption approaches.
On February 18, 2006, the AFDB President
joined the heads of other international
financial institutions (IFl) to establish a
Joint IFl Anti-Corruption Task Force. The
task force was mandated to find a consistent and harmonized approach to combat
corruption in the activities and operations
of member institutions.

Development of Good Practices

The Bank Group continued to pursue global efforts to develop good practices that
will expedite the implementation of the
Paris Declaration Commitments at the
country level. To this end, during 2006 the
Bank Group participated in global efforts
to foster HA and MADR in the priority areas
of monitoring, procurement, managing for
development results, and public financial
management. Going forward, this activity

Annual Report 2006

will continue under the auspices of the
MDB Roundtable discussions and their
Technical Working Groups as wells as
under the OECD-DAC Working Party on Aid
Effectiveness.

The Way Forward

Considerable progress was made in advancing the HA and MfDR agenda. Nonetheless,
the Bank Group will take additional measures to enhance its support for the agenda by (i) allocating more resources to
Operations Complexes and field offices; (ii)
changing the Bank's loan approval culture
to one of implementation in support of
development effectiveness and results; (iii)
enhancing decentralization; (iv) delegating
more authority to task managers and field
offices; (v) preparing development indicators; and (vi) improving capacity for project
implementation and supervision in the
Bank Group and at the country level.

The New Partnership for Africa's
Development

The New Partnership for Africa's
Development (NEPAD) initiative is a holistic
approach to the development of the continent. Since its inception, it has advocated a
development paradigm based on collective
responsibility, ownership, development of
new partnerships, and mobilization of local
capacities and resources.

With the entry into force of the Bank
Group's new structure in July 2006, the
NEPAD Support Unit in the Bank was converted into the NEPAD Regional Integration
and Trade Department. The Department is
responsible for coordinating the Bank's
involvement in the NEPAD process, notably
by advancing infrastructure development
and regional integration, facilitating intraAfrican trade, building trade capacity, and
strengthening the institution’s relationship
with its stakeholders and partners.

By December 2006, the Bank Group had
processed 13 regional projects for approv
al, with estimated financing of US$460.4
million. In addition, through the NEPAD
Infrastructure Project Preparation Facility
(NEPAD-IPPF), the Bank approved US$4.0
million from its resources and mobilized an
additional US$3.3 million from its cofinanciers to fund the preparation of 8 regional
infrastructure projects. The following sections highlight activities undertaken under
NEPAD during 2006.

Inga Hydro Electricity Project

At the 10th Meeting of Heads of State and
Government Implementation Committee
(HSGIC) of NEPAD in Mozambique on
May 23, 2004, the AfDB was mandated,
hrough the NEPAD Secretariat, to oversee
he preparation of the Inga Hydropower
Project, one of NEPAD’s energy infrastrucure projects. In 2006, in collaboration
with the government of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the African Union,
he Secretariat of the NEPAD, and the
Development Bank of Southern Africa, the
AfDB organized national and international
roundtable discussions (in Kinshasa and
ohannesburg, respectively) to mobilize
development partners’ support for the
development and exploitation of the Inga
Hydropower Project, estimated at more
han $450.0 million.

The Power Pools

Advances in regional initiatives include
he creation of power pools in most subregions (West African Power Pool, Southern
Africa Power Pool, Central Africa Power
Pool, and Eastern Africa Power Pool) folowing ratification of the related protocols
by the concerned member countries. These
ower pools were created to provide reliable and economical electricity supply to
he consumers of member countries.

 

Southern African Power Pool. \n July/
August 2006, a joint mission, comprising the AfDB, the Development Bank of
South Africa, and the Southern Africa
Development Community, visited theSouth African Power Pool (SAPP) to help
prioritize its investment and development projects and programs. Twelve
power plants (1 coal and 11 hydropower
plants) were identified for rehabilitation. The hydropower plants are located
in Angola, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, Malawi, and Mozambique. In
addition, 12 generation projects (1 coal,
2 natural gas, and 9 hydropower plants)
were identified for implementation
before 2010, and 3 Power Transmission
projects were proposed for congestion
relief and power interconnection. These
were the Malawi-Mozambique Power
Interconnector, the Zambia-TanzaniaKenya Power Interconnector, and the
Westcor Project.

West African Power Pool (WAPP). \n
September 2006, the AfDB, in collaboration with the World Bank, financed a consultation mission to the WAPP to discuss
priority regional energy projects and agree
on actions to accelerate their preparation
and implementation. Discussions focused
on project type, implementation status,
resource mobilization initiatives, identification of technical assistance, and facilitation of measures for delivering the WAPP
infrastructure program. The NEPAD-IPPF
and the AfDB prepared a detailed plan

to support the delivery of WAPP prior
ity projects and provided a platform for
mobilizing resources to support the WAPP
Secretariat.

Central African Power Pool (CAPP).

The CAPP Initiative is a NEPAD flagship infrastructure project. Priority
projects under the CAPP include the
Electricity Market Master Plan Study of
the Economic Community of Central
African States (ECCAS); Study on the
Interconnectivity of Electricity Networks
of ECCAS Member States; Institutional
Support to the Central African Power
Pool; DRC- Grand INGA Integrator Study,
and the pilot program on electrifying

Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization Chapter 003

trans-boundary zones within the ECCAS
region.

The Medium to Long-Term Strategic
Framework Study (MLTSF)

The MLTSF, jointly financed by the AfDB
and the Nigerian Technical Cooperation
Fund, aims to define a framework to guide
the continuous and consistent development of regional infrastructure in Africa
and to propose long-to-medium term strategic goals to guide the development of
NEPAD infrastructure programs.

The Joint MLTSF Steering Committee
held its first meeting in October 2006 in
Johannesburg. During the meeting, the
Committee adopted its Rules of Procedure,
and approved the inception report of the
MLTSF Study, the Progress Reports of the
AICD Study, and the establishment of a
Technical Advisory Committee that will
provide independent technical advice to
the Committee on the major outputs of the
2 studies. The first part of the MLTSF Study
is expected to be completed during the
second semester of 2007 and the second
part by the first semester of 2008.

The NEPAD-IPPF Program

The main objective of the NEPAD-IPPF is
to assist RMCs, regional economic communities, and other infrastructure development institutions with the preparation of
regional infrastructure projects in energy,
trans-boundary water resource management, transportation, and information and
communication technologies. Between
November 2004 and October 2006,
US$3.7 million was approved to finance
8 project preparation works in information and communication technologies, and
energy and transportation sectors. These
activities were progressing as planned by
the end of 2006. During a meeting with
the Kuwait Fund and Arab Fund for Social
and Economic Development in November
2006, discussions focused on the need to
increase the commitment capacity of the

IPPF to allow the AfDB to fulfill its mission
effectively. Follow-up meetings were held
in October-December 2006.

The African Peer Review Mechanism
(APRM)

The Bank Group's support for the APRM
during the past 2 years included financing
for a corporate governance expert at the
APRM Secretariat and direct contribution
to the APRM budget to help finance country assessments in RMCs. The AfDB and
NEPAD also continued to provide technical
support for good governance and country
assessments.

Infrastructure Consortium for Africa
The Infrastructure Consortium for Africa
(ICA) was launched in October 2005 and
aims to strengthen member country’s
effectiveness in supporting infrastructure
development in Africa. This involves pooling efforts in areas such as information
sharing, project development, and dissemination of best practices. The ICA addresses
both national and regional constraints to
infrastructure development, with emphasis
on subregional infrastructure (transportation, water supply and sanitation) information and communication technologies
(ICT), and energy sectors. It serves as a
platform to broker more donor funds for
infrastructure projects and programs in
Africa.

ICA activities during 2006 included the
organization in December of a conference, “Financing Electricity for Growth in
Africa", hosted by the AfDB in Tunis. The
conference sought to inform key energy,
investment, and legal operators of potential electricity infrastructure projects that
require immediate financing in Africa.

Water Initiatives

Africa has abundant water resources, with
an estimated annual renewable capacity of 5,400 billion m? per year. However,
because of the spatial and temporal dis
Annual Report 2006

2526

Chapter 003 Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization

tribution, and the poor development and
utilization of these resources, the majority
of Africans do not benefit from them. The
Bank Group is determined to reverse this
situation and improve living standards in
Africa by focusing on water resource development and management. It does this
primarily through its water initiatives: the
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative
(RWSSI), the African Water Facility (AWF),
and the Multi-Donor Water Partnership
Program.

Rural Water Supply and

Sanitation Initiative (RWSSI)

The RWSSI, the Bank Group's most important water initiative, aims to mobilize
African governments and_ international
donors to scale up investments in rural
water supply and sanitation and raise rural
populations’ access to water supply and
sanitation to 80 percent by 2015. The
RWSSI helps governments develop country
programs and fosters community ownership in the implementation and management of the programs. It also collaborates
with other donors and stakeholders to
achieve its objectives. In 2006, the Bank
approved UA 161.6 million (US$235.0
million) for 5 RWSSI programs.

During 2006 as well, the AfDB completed
arrangements for a multi-donor RWSSI
Trust Fund, with France contributing
UA 35.2 million (EUR 40.0 million) and
Denmark UA 27.6 million (DKK 230.0 million). The Netherlands, the third signatory
to the arrangement, contributed UA 16.5
million (US$25.0 million) at end-December
2006. This brought the contribution to UA
79.3 million (US$112.0 millionN—to be
used to cofinance RWSS programs.

In 2006, the AfDB participated in an informal consultative donor meeting in Brussels
on how to better coordinate the RWSS
agenda. Water was also the key topic of
discussion at meetings between the AfDB
and the U.K. Department for International

Annual Report 2006

Development (DFID) and between the AfDB
and the UN Secretary General's Advisory
Board on Water and Sanitation. Both meetings were held in Tunis in October and
December 2006, respectively. Furthermore,
the Danish International Development
Agency (DANIDA), the Norwegian Agency for
International Development, and the Swedish
International Development Cooperation
Agency conducted a joint review of the
Bank's water initiative in October/November
2006, as part of their contributions to the
Bank's water initiatives.

In line with an agreement to deepen
harmonization and collaboration in the
water sector, the World Bank's Water and
Sanitation Program (WSP) opened a liaison
office at the AfDB in November 2006, and
the 2 institutions intensified collaboration
in 7 RMCs. As well, the AfDB and other
development partners, including the World
Bank/WSP, DFID, the German Technical
Cooperation Agency (GTZ), DANIDA,
UNICEF (United Nations Children’s
Fund), Wateraid, and the Embassy of
The Netherlands carried out joint RWSSI
appraisals in Tanzania, Niger, and Zambia
and participated in joint government/development partners’ water sector reviews
in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The
governments of Austria, Norway, Sweden,

Finland, Denmark, France, and the United
Kingdom made strong commitments to
strengthen the Bank Group's capacity to
implement operational activities under the
RWSSI and the AWF.

The African Water Facility (AWF)

The overarching goal of the AWF is to
contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development in Africa by creating an enabling environment that will
attract investments in the water sector
and strengthen water resource management. The 3 operational focal areas of
the AWF are (i) national water resource
management, (ii) trans-boundary water
resource management, and (iii) capital
investments. By end-2006, donors had
committed UA 52.4 million (EUR 59.7
million) for the facility; of this amount,
UA 13.1 million (EUR 14.9 million) had
been paid up. The Bank Group committed UA 1.6 million (EUR 1.8 million)
to cover permanent staff, management,
and other administrative costs, including
office space. In all, during 2006, the AWF
considered 51 projects for financing at a
cost of UA 38.2 million (EUR 43.4 million). Fourteen (14) of the projects were
approved at a cost of UA 7.9 million
(EUR 9.0 million).

 

AfDB President, Donald Kaberuka, visiting a Bank-financed water supply project

in Ouagadougou, Burkina FasoMulti-Donor Water Partnership Program
The Bank Group / Netherlands Water
Partnership Program (WPP) was created to
support the promotion of Integrated Water
Resource Management (IWRM) practices
and the implementation of the Bank's
IWRM Policy in RMCs. The WPP became
effective in December 2002, with a grant
of US$5.0 million. It evolved into the
Multi-Donor Water Partnership Program
(MDWPP) in March 2006 when Denmark
and Canada joined the program and provided resources amounting to UA 1.8 million (DKK 15.0 million) and UA 2.9 million
(C$ 5.0 million), respectively.

The WPP played a key role in the establishment of the AWF and RWSSI. WPP
funds are used to develop the implementation plans, guidelines, strategies, and
topologies used by Bank staff and RMCs
to prepare and implement water sector
programs and projects. In addition, the
WPP finances studies, including: Studies
on Financial Instruments to Facilitate
Water Sector Investments, Trends and
Opportunities in Agricultural Water Use
Management, and Assessment of Best
Practices and Experiences on Water
Harvesting. The MDWPP also provided
support for workshops and meetings
aimed at raising awareness about the
application of IWRM principles and practices as well as consultations on major
water issues and promotion of partnerships.

Middle Income Country Initiative

Middle-income countries (MIC) in Africa continue to face several development challenges
and need financial and technical assistance
to help them achieve the MDGs. The Bank
Group's objective is to identify a special
operational niche that will establish its identity in MICs and encourage them to consider
the Bank Group a primary source of support.

On March 13, 2006, the Bank Group
and the World Bank jointly organized

Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization Chapter 003

an MIC consultative meeting in Tunis to
(i) discuss recent initiatives undertaken
by both institutions to enhance MDBs
engagement with MICs, (ii) identify constraints MICs face in their relationships
with MDBs and (iii) determine measures
required to remain relevant and help
MICs meet their development challenges.
Some 14 MICs participated in this meeting, including all ADB regional member
countries.

The main recommendation from the meeting
was an urgent call for additional resources,
especially concessional or blend resources,
to address country and sectoral differences,
particularly in sectors such as health and
education. MDBs were urged to explore
relevant proposals. While welcoming the
significant increase in the Bank Group's
MIC Trust Fund to US$ 23 million, MICs
urged the AfDB to (i) simplify its request
format and process, (ii) consider increasing
its total allocation (deemed insufficient for
15 countries), and (iii) raise its ceiling per
project. Periodic replenishments of such
funds should be secured. MICs also requested more assistance from MDBs for private
sector development—where the private
sector is not yet fully developed—including
capacity building for private enterprises and
elping improve the business environment.
he meeting also discussed the AfDB’s decision to significantly reduce its loan pricing,
notably by eliminating the commitment fee
‘or sovereign loans as well as reducing its
ending spread.

 

n 2006, therefore, the Bank Group
jaunched measures to enhance service
quality; strengthen support for private sec‘or development, and other sub-sovereign
and non-sovereign entities; enhance partnerships with bilateral donors, multilateral
agencies, and private financiers to support
he development efforts of MICs, and;
attract concessional and non-concessional
unds, alongside Bank resources, to meet
he needs of MICs.

 

 

The Enhanced Private Sector
Assistance Initiative

This initiative is a special collaborative
effort between the AfDB and the government of Japan to develop the private
sector in Africa. In February 2006, the
AfDB and Japan Bank for International
Cooperation (JBIC) organized a workshop to familiarize Bank Group personnel
with the facility. Under the initiative; the
Japanese authorities approved 2 proposals
for assistance in 2006: the Gambia River
Basin Development Organization and the
Regional Franchising Program in (i) northern Africa and (ii) southern and eastern
Africa. The AfDB also cofinanced 2 road

MOBILIZATION AND
ALLOCATION OF
FINANCIAL RESOURCES

The Bank Group mobilizes concessional
resources through periodic ADF replenishment negotiations and allocates the
resources to 38 ADF and 2 blend countries
using the enhanced performance-based
allocation (PBA) system. It also mobilizes
resources for HIPC debt relief to 33 eligible RMCs, and for the MDRI. This section
reviews the status of implementation of
these debt relief measures. It also highlights measures for post-conflict countries
within the context of the post-conflict
country facility.

Status of ADF-X

Allocation of Resources

Of the UA 3.42 billion total allocated for
operations under ADF-X, UA 2.22 billion
had been committed for projects and programs by end-2006. The remaining commitment capacity of UA 1.20 billion will
be used to finance projects and programs
in the Bank's indicative work program for
2007. See Box 3.2 for more information on
the allocation of ADF-X resources.

Chapter 003 Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization

Box 3.2: Allocation of ADF- X

Resources

 

The enhanced Performance-Based Allocation
(PBA) system is used to determine country allocations. It was modified under ADF-X
with the introduction of a grant allocation
system, which is underpinned by the joint
IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
(DSA) Framework. The framework is based on
countries’ risk of debt distress.

The new grant allocation system was implemented in 2005 and 2006 and the MDRI netting out mechanism was introduced in 2006
for ADF-X country allocations. The estimated
grant share projected for end-2004 was 44.29
percent, against actual grant share of 34.29
percent for 2005, and 28.35 percent for 2006.
About 70 percent of the ADF-X grant allocation went to RMCs with per capita incomes of
less than US$360 at completion and decision
points. Multinational projects were allocated
24.8 percent of all grant commitments.

Emerging empirical results indicate that the
new system has not unduly weakened the
incentives system embedded in the PBA framework. As Figure 3.1 shows, 70 percent of ADFX grants have been allocated to completion
and decision point RMCs, compared with only
3 percent to pre-decision point RMCs.

Financing of the ADF Grant System. To
be sustainable, the new ADF-X grant framework must be appropriately financed against
the primary risk of forgone principal reflows
in order to ensure the availability of such
financing in future ADF replenishments. This
tisk needs to be collectively addressed by the
donor community.

The ADF, like other sister institutions, is taking
steps to increase transparency and accountability through public disclosure of all PBA
system components; namely, the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR),
Governance Factor, Post Conflict Enhancement
Factor (PCEF). Progress on transparency and
disclosure of information on the PBA, including country allocations, will be discussed with
the Boards of Directors and ADF Deputies will
discuss during ADF-XI replenishment consultations in 2007.

The ADF-X Mid-Term Review meeting was held at The Hague, Netherlands, from December
7-8, 2006. Box 3.3 provides a summary of deliberations at the meeting.Box 3.3: The ADF-X Mi

   

Stead teteda nod

The ADF-X Mid-Term Review took place at The Hague, Netherlands, on
December 7 and 8, 2006. About 80 ADF Deputies; representatives from
Burundi, Ethiopia, Mali, and Malawi; observers from IDA, AsDB, IFAD;
some ADF Board members; and 30 AfDB staff participated in the review.
President Donald Kaberuka led the AfDB team, which also included 3 of
the 5 Vice Presidents.

Deliberations during the meeting focused on institutional reforms,
human resources management, resource allocation, decentralization,
regional integration, and the way forward.

Overall, participants expressed satisfaction with progress achieved in
the on-going institutional reforms and in the implementation of the
harmonization and alignment action plan. They underscored that this
was ADF's best growth opportunity in 30 years and urged management
to deepen ongoing reforms and to stand ready to provide a clear report
on the Bank’s development outcomes during ADF XI negotiations—to
make 2007 “A Year of Delivery”. Participants also expressed strong support for ADF’s focus on poverty reduction to support the achievement
of MDGs in all RMCs, but called for more analytical work on the use of
SWAps, the governance structure of the ADF, and the financing modalities of fragile states.

Participants noted that progress had been made in human resources
management, but urged the Bank Group to reduce the high level of
vacancies in the institution, with greater effort on achieving diversity,
gender, and age balance. They stressed that accountability, greater delegation of authority to line managers, and better incentives for staff
would allow the Bank Group to shift from an approvals to an implementation culture, and from a rules-based mentality to a service-oriented
mindset. Management acknowledged these concerns and committed
to addressing them in an enhanced human resources program that will
encourage innovation, develop talent, and reward excellence. Progress
made in implementing human resource reforms will be reviewed during
ADF-XI consultative meetings in 2007.

With respect to resource allocation, participants expressed support
for the enhanced Performance Based Allocation (PBA) framework and
appreciation for the frank discussions on its implementation during the
2006 country allocation exercise with Board members. They urged ADF
to continue to work closely with IDA and with other donors to address
PBA implementation issues and to improve on the enhanced PBA framework, building on the outcomes of the MBD’s technical meeting on the
PBA. Proposals would be discussed during the ADF- XI negotiations in
2007. Participants also endorsed the use by the ADF of the joint IDA/IMF
Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) and the new forward-looking Debt
Sustainability Analyses (FL-DSAs) as the analytical underpinnings of the

Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization Chapter 003

ADF grant eligibility system. They encouraged ADF to participate in joint
FL-DSAs missions with the World Bank and the IMF. This would prevent
any unsustainable build-up of non-concessional borrowing in a post
MDRI environment, and foster greater joint donor community efforts in
the use of the DSF as a common measure of concessionality for all stakeholders, including multilateral, bilateral, and other commercial creditors.
During the meetings, participants expressed support for the Bank
Group's decentralization program, aimed at empowering field offices
with the appropriate staff skills mix, delegation of authority, and appropriate fiduciary safeguards. They noted that decentralization is a major
step towards scaling up country policy dialogue and donor coordination,
portfolio management, and project supervision, as well as designing and
preparing joint assistance strategies. Participants also agreed on the
importance of selectivity for greater focus and delivery on development
effectiveness and results and called for effective partnerships with other
donors to ensure that key areas such as human resources development
and agriculture are taken into account. In light of this, management
emphasized that the Bank Group would concentrate on fewer but larger
projects. This would translate into better project design, preparation, and
supervision, as well as improved portfolio management, thereby improving delivery on development effectiveness and results.

Participants acknowledged ADF's important role in fostering regional
integration through its regional projects, with special attention on
NEPAD and the water initiatives. They stressed the need to define clear
selection criteria for multinational projects without compromising the
core fundamentals of the PBA approach. They also welcomed the work
done on private sector development, as well as senior management's
strong commitment to monitor development activities in the sector while
implementing the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for Africa (EPSA).

A key milestone of the ADF-X Midterm Review was the pledge of an
additional EUR 20.5 million to ADF-X by the Dutch government to
express its strong support for Africa. This reduced the ADF-X subscription gap from 27.99 percent (UA 952,754,357) to 27.45 percent (UA
934,539,432) as at end-December 2006.

Finally, participants discussed the upcoming ADF-XI replenishment and
agreed that the following themes and subjects would be addressed: (i)
delivery and results, harmonization, and development effectiveness; (ii)
the PBA framework; (iii) the debt sustainability (DS) framework; (iv) the
long-term financial integrity of the ADF; (v) selectivity, complementarity
and comparative advantage; (vi) fragile states and multinational / regional programs, particularly as they relate to the PBA and DS frameworks
and to selectivity; and (vii) governance of the ADF. Finally, it was agreed
that Board members could attend future ADF replenishment meetings
as observers.

Progress in Implementing the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative

Of the 42 countries worldwide classified
as HIPC eligible, 33 are RMCs. As Figure
3.3 shows, 17 of the RMCs have reached
completion point, 8 are in the interim
period, and 8 are at pre-decision point,
including Eritrea, a “sunset clause” RMC.
The evolution of RMCs under the enhanced
HIPC Initiative during 2000-2006 is shown
in Figure 3.4. Barring unforeseen circumstances, when Sao Tome and Principe,
Burundi, DRC, the Gambia, and Chad
reach completion point by end-2007, as
expected, the number of RMCs eligible
for MDRI will increase substantially to 22,
from 17 at end-December 2006. This turnaround trend underscores the need for the
Bank Group to scale up resource mobilization—from internal and external—resources
to meet both its HIPC and MDRI financing
requirements, particularly during ADF-XI
and beyond.

The cost of the HIPC Initiative for the 33
RMCs is estimated at US$3.6 billion in
NPV terms, about US$ 5.7 billion in nominal terms. The breakdown of the cost by
HIPC status is shown in Figure 3.5.

As Figure 3.5 shows, of the total cost of
the HIPC Initiative, US$1.2 billion in NPV
terms (US$1.3 billion in nominal terms)
had been delivered to the 25-completion
point and interim period RMCs as of endDecember 2006.

MDRI are presented in Box 3.4.

 

Annual Report 2006Chapter 003 Bank Group Initiatives and Resource Mobilization

Box 3.4: Challenges Faci e HIPC Initiative and the MDRI

The MDRI is separate from, but operationally linked to, the HIPC Initiative.
The long-term nature of MDRI financing commitments continues to represent a challenge for donors that cannot make firm commitments over
a 50-year period because of legislative constraints. Nevertheless, donors
have agreed that ADF-X donor contribution levels of UA 2.45 billion,
measured in real terms, would serve as the baseline for additionality of
donor financing for the MDRI, beginning in the ADF-XI period.

Helping 16 pre-completion point RMCs through the HIPC Initiative process has become increasingly challenging. Progress in 8 pre-decision point
RMCs (such as in Somalia, Comoros, Céte d'Ivoire, Sudan and Togo) (see
Annex |I-17), continues to be hindered by lingering internal conflict,
governance issues, or protracted arrears—over 12 years on average.
For Liberia, which has been in arrears since April 1985, recent positive
developments in good governance and macro economic reforms augur
well for it to benefit from an arrears clearance mechanism in 2007.

Another major challenge is how to prevent the debt burdens of the 33
eligible RMCs from becoming unsustainable again. To this end, debt
and public finance management must be strengthened, with special
emphasis on the most fragile states. Long-term debt sustainability also

hinges on both HIPCs and creditors intensifying their efforts to improve
export diversification and to obtain new financing on more concessional
terms.

The HIPC Initiative remains voluntary in nature, and most commercial
creditors have not yet provided their share of debt relief to HIPCs.
Consequently, creditor litigation has been on the rise in ADF regional
member countries such as Congo Republic and Sao Tomé & Principe,
with litigated debts estimated at about 15 and 13 percent of GDP,
respectively. In this context, greater efforts must be made to prevent further litigation, encourage commercial creditor participation in the HIPC
Initiative, and provide more debt relief. In addition, efforts are needed to
prevent rapid accumulation of unsustainable levels of non-concessional
borrowing in post-MDRI regional member countries. These concerns
could arise if bilateral and multilateral creditors take advantage of the
fiscal and balance of payments space created by HIPC and MDRI debt
relief to increase non-concessional lending to these countries. In close
partnership with sister institutions and bilateral donors, the AfDB will
continue to play a proactive role in raising awareness about the consequences of non-concessional borrowing in the context of its enhanced
policy dialogue on the second generation of RB-CSPs.

Facility (PCCF) has been in existence since — and progress faster towards the enhanced

32

Box 3.5: The Ban

To qualify for arrears clearance under the PCCF, a RMC must (i) be
designated a post conflict country (PCC); (ii) make significant progress in
te-establishing peace, improving good governance structures, re-launching the economy, and promoting resettlement, disarmament and reintegration; (iii) engage in coordinated reform programs with international
financial institutions and the donor community; and (iv) service all new
maturities falling due on Bank Group, IMF, and World Bank debts, with
no discrimination in debt servicing.

Initial funding for the PCCF was set at UA 207.0 million (about
US$300.0 million). New funding of UA 150.0 million (about US$230.0
million) will be approved, if needed, to bring the total to UA 357.0 million (US$530.0 million). Of the total amount, US$64.0 million was used
to finance 35 percent of the arrears of Burundi and 33 percent of the
arrears of Congo Republic in 2004. In addition, US$23.3 million was
mobilized to finance 49.5 percent of the arrears of the Central African
Republic (CAR). Liberia is well on track to benefit from arrears clearance
in 2007 given the satisfactory pace of its socio-economic programs and
governance reforms. As a result, a substantial portion of the new PCCF
financing could be mobilized before the end of the ADF-X cycle.

Annual Report 2006

 

Arrears clearance for the CAR: In December 2006, the Boards of
Directors approved an exceptionally favorable arrears clearance package for CAR. The package is based on tripartite burden sharing among
the CAR (1 percent of all arrears); donors (49.5 percent); and the PCCF
(49.5 percent). The PCCF portion amounted to UA 15.6 million, or
US$23.3 million. The Economic and Monetary Community of Central
African Countries (CEMAC) contributed over UA 3.3 million (US$5.0 million) to the Bank's proposed arrears clearance program, demonstrating
unprecedented solidarity with the CAR. As well, South Africa pledged
UA 0.3 million (US$0.5 million) for the settlement of the arrears of the
CAR. Such financial support from RMCs is the first of its kind since the
start of HIPC Initiative implementation in 1996 and the launching of the
PCCF in 2004.

The Bank's efforts to help settle complex arrears cases for all pre-decision
point RMCs will continue to take place within a framework of concerted
international action. This will limit moral hazard, protect the Bank's financial integrity, and ensure that the overall arrears clearance strategy is
consistent with a country’s financing constraints as well as with the HIPC
and MDRI objectives, in order to avoid a re-accumulation of arrears.Reconstruction in Post-Conflict

PARTNERSHIP AND
COOPERATION
ACTIVITIES

The Bank Group’s partnership and cooperation activities are aimed at promoting
and coordinating non-statutory cooperation relations and strategic partnerships
with bilateral aid agencies, multilateral
development institutions, African organizations and institutions, and other aid agencies. The primary purpose of such cooperation and partnership is to mobilize financial
resources and technical skills and inputs
through cofinancing, technical cooperation
arrangements and partnership agreements
that can supplement Bank Group lending and administrative resources. Such
partnership and cooperation activities can
be grouped into cofinancing operations,
bilateral technical cooperation, multilateral
technical cooperation, and collaboration
with regional economic communities.

Cofinancing Operations

The Bank Group continued to expand
its cofinancing activities during 2006.
Together with other development partners,
it cofinanced 34 projects amounting to UA
11.7 billion, compared with UA 3.19 billion
for 19 projects in 2005. The Bank's conttribution was UA 1.32 billion, compared with
UA 577.6 million in 2005 (Table 3.3); its
external development partners contributed UA 4.24 billion, against UA 1.89
billion in 2005. The share of beneficiary
RMCs rose significantly—from UA 723.5
million a year earlier to UA 6.10 billion.
This substantial increase reflects contributions for large operations in Egypt and in
Ethiopia, where beneficiaries’ contributions
amounted to UA 4.39 billion and UA 1.37
billion, respectively (see Table 3.2).

its RMCs. Bilateral technical cooperation
activities focus on mobilizing, managing,
and administering these grant resources.
In 2006, UA 11.16 million was committed
from existing bilateral resources to finance
82 activities, compared with UA 7.2 million for 87 activities in 2005. New bilateral
resources, amounting to UA 3.8 million, were
mobilized from donor countries. Activities
financed centered on gender, governance,
the environment, human resources development, private sector development, capacity
building and knowledge transfer, agriculture
and rural development, and regional integration and economic cooperation.

During 2006 as well, the AfDB sought

esses to ensure better service delivery.
In line with the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness, it adopted a Technical
Cooperation Fund (TCF) reform program
to standardize, simplify, and align its TCF
programs with those of other MDBs. The
program will allow the AfDB to negotiate fully untied TCFs as of January 2007,
promote multi-donor thematic funds,
introduce a standard administrative fee
of 5 percent, and establish a minimum
threshold of UA 660,000 (US$1.0 million) and UA 1.32 million (US$2.0 million) for both single and multi-donors,
respectively. Furthermore, the program
will allow the Bank to approve up to UA
66,000 (US$100,000) and UA 330,000
(US$500,000) for single and multi-donor
funds, respectively, without prior approval
by the donors concerned.

A key feature of institutional partnership
is the promotion of a consistent approach
between the AfDB and multilateral and
bilateral donors, including regional and
subregional development banks and IFls.
In 2006, this was particularly important in
reinforcing cooperation and partnership on

of NEPAD priorities in agriculture and food
security in Africa.

International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD)

The development goal of the IFAD's
Rehabilitation and Community-based
Poverty Reduction Project in Sierra Leone
is to (i) reduce post-conflict poverty and
food insecurity and (ii) improve the livelihoods and living conditions of rural communities. The project, with an estimated
cost of US$10 million, was administered
by the Bank Group. In June 2006, the

select areas. Plans are also underway for
collaboration in a Bank project on communicable diseases in the SADC region.
UNICEF will implement the medical comonent on children living with HIV.

World Food Program (WFP)

During 2006, AfDB collaboration with the
WEP intensified because of the increased
number of emergencies in Africa. This led
he AfDB to soften procedures for accessing
its emergency funds. In all, the Bank Group
approved 11 Emergency Relief Assistance
grants for 17 RMCs, as highlighted in Table
.1. As well, the WFP Executive Director
visited the Bank Group in April 2006. It

key priority projects, particularly in the agricultural and industrial sectors. COMESA officials
requested that the Bank Group provide (i)
technical and financial resources for the formulation and implementation of projects—
to enhance the pace of industrialization in
the sub-region and increase the value of
its exports; and (ii) finance the preparation
of common guidelines for the Sub-Saharan
Africa Transport Policy Program (SSATP).
This would involve building the capacities
of COMESA member states through training and equipment procurement. Finally, the
officials invited the Bank Group to participate
in the COMESA Fund to support infrastructure
development projects in the sub-region; and
to provide assistance and support—in the
form of grants and loans—under the AfDB/
Japan Enhanced Private Sector Assistance for
Africa (EPSA) Initiative.

 

Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CENSAD)

TheAfDB and the Sahel-Saharan Investment
and Trade Bank (BSIC), the financial arm of
the Community of Sahel-Saharan States
(CEN-SAD), signed a Memorandum of
Understanding in 2006, in a bid to intensify cooperation and contribute to regional
integration of member states.

Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)

In September 2006, the AfDB and the
ECA held a high-level retreat in Tunis
to review ongoing cooperation activities, identify and select areas for future
partnership, and develop a strategic and
dynamic framework for enhanced collaboration. In defining modalities for
future collaboration, the 2 institutions
agreed to avoid the duplication of activities and to use resources efficiently to
achieve desired development impact. The
following 5 areas were identified for
close collaboration: (i) knowledge management, capacity building, and statistics;
(ii) governance, post conflict and fragile
states; (iii) agriculture, natural resources,

Secretary further deepened AfDB/UA/ECA
tripartite cooperation. A major decision
was taken to discontinue the joint hosting
of the Annual Meetings Symposium by the
ECA and the AfDB.

 

Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS)

In October 2006, AfDB and ECOWAS
met to discuss a strategy to prevent the
spread of the avian influenza in West
Africa. The consultation took place amidst
concerns that the highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) was becoming endemic
in a growing number of countries in the
subregion, and in Africa at large. Based on
its action plan, the Bank Group approved
UA 2.97 million (US$4.5 million) in emergency assistance grants for 9 RMCs, 6 of
which are ECOWAS member countries,
to control or prevent HPAI. In addition,
ECOWAS and the AfDB reaffirmed the

Socioeconomic Trends and Bank Group Operations by Subregion42

Chapter 004 Economic and Social Trends by Subregion

This chapter examines Bank Group operations against the backdrop of subregional socioeconomic trends in Africa in 2006.
It reviews macroeconomic performance, social trends, key economic issues, cumulative Bank Group approvals from 1967 to
2006, and development challenges in each of the institution's 5 operational subregions.

ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
TRENDS IN AFRICA

Macroeconomic Performance

Africa's economic performance remained
robust and resilient in 2006, with the
continent recording its longest economic
expansion in the last 2 decades. Real GDP
growth remained stable at 5.2 percent in
2005 and 5.5 percent in 2006 (Table 4.1). For
the last 6 consecutive years, the annual real
GDP growth rate has averaged 4.7 percent,
exceeding 5 percent during the last 3 years.
The number of countries with higher growth
rates increased modestly in 2006, with 23
RMCs recording growth rates above 5 percent, 17 registering 3 to 5 percent, and only
2 recording negative growth rates.

The continent's economic growth was
sustained by both domestic and external
factors. The latter included favorable terms
of trade; a supportive global economic
environment, which boosted export volumes;
increased aid flows, which helped cushion
consumption, especially among oil importers;
and private capital inflows in the form of
direct investment and remittances. On the
domestic front, prudent policy frameworks
and improving business climates helped promote macroeconomic stability and resilience
to external shocks.

 

Growth was also broad-based across sectors, with the mining and services sectors
as the key drivers. Overall, Africa's 13 oil
exporters continued to reap large termsof-trade gains while oil-importing RMCs

Annual Report 2006

with large mining operations benefited from
higher metal prices. Economic growth was
more mixed in the remaining oil importing
countries. Among agricultural exporters,
stronger coffee prices led to income gains
while falling cocoa and cotton prices had
the opposite effect, though offset by export
volume increases. Overall, bumper harvests
in several parts of the continent boosted
growth in agricultural output to nearly 5
percent in 2006, compared with 3.4 percent
in 2005. Owing to stronger performance in
tourism, telecommunications, and financial
sector reforms, the services sector also
posted an average annual growth rate of
about 6 percent for the last 3 years.

Africa's real GDP per capita growth stood
at 3.1 percent in 2006, up from 2.9 percent
a year earlier. GDP per capita rose from
US$1,051 in 2005 to US$1, 182 in 2006 (see

able 4.1). Despite this favorable trend, the
5.5 percent real GDP growth in 2006 falls
short of the 7-8 percent required to achieve
he Millennium Development Goals (MDG), in
particular the goal of halving the proportion of
people living in extreme poverty by 2015.

mproved economic performance and susained oil price increases exerted upward
pressure on consumer prices, pushing up
average inflation from 8.8 percent in 2005
© 9.1 percent in 2006 (See Figure 4.1).
Most of the 40 oil-importing RMCs allowed
artial pass-through of the oil price increases
while maintaining tighter monetary policies.
his helped curb inflationary pressures.
As a result, the continent's fiscal balance
improved from an average fiscal surplus of
2.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to 3.2 percent
of GDP in 2006. This improvement in the
fiscal balance is attributable to increased

RMCs that reached completion point under
the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

Africa's external position improved in 2006
owing to both higher export volumes and
continuing high terms of trade. Overall
average terms of trade growth remained
favorable at 11.9 percent in 2006—marginally lower than the 13.2 percent recorded
a year earlier. The positive external position
is due in part to the surge in the price of
metals—such as copper—owing to buoyant global demand driven mostly by Asian
countries, in particular China and India. The
average current account balance recorded a
surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP, compared with
surpluses of 1.2 percent and 3.6 percent of
GDP in 2004 and 2005, respectively.

Africa continued to benefit from the dividends of debt relief measures under the

enhanced HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. As
a result, its external debt declined from 34.4
percent of GDP in 2005 to 25.3 percent of
GDP in 2006. Similarly, its debt-service, as
a percentage of exports, dropped from 10.0
percent in 2005 to 7.3 percent in 2006. As
he business climate continued to improve,
rivate capital inflows in the form of foreign
direct investments (FDI) also increased.
However, the volume of these flows (about
2.5 percent of global FDI) remained low in
comparison with inflows to other developing
regions. Remittances from African migrants
ave also become an increasingly important
source of development finance for the
continent. Recent estimates underscore that
remittances to Africa more than doubled,
rom US$17 billion per year in 2000-2003 to
US$30-40 billion per year in 2005-2006.

Social Indicators
Despite the observed improvements, the
majority of African countries continued to lag

behind other developing countries in most
socio-economic indicators in 2006: Because
of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, life expectancy at
birth (51 years) in Africa remained far below
the average for developing countries (65
years). Only 67 percent of the population
had access to health services, reflected in
the high infant and maternal mortality rates.
In fact, infant mortality in Africa, estimated
at 83 deaths per 1,000 live births, is much
higher than the estimated average of 57
deaths per 1,000 live births for developing
countries. As well, maternal mortality (609
per 100,000 live births) is far above the rate
for developing countries, (440 deaths per
100,000 live births). Gross primary school
enrollment ratios, estimated at 104/90 percent for males/females, do not compare well
with the estimated averages for developing
countries—112/105 percent, respectively.
Only 62 percent and 44 percent of the
population had access to drinking water and
sanitation, respectively, compared with 80
percent and 50 percent, respectively, in all
developing countries.

 

The continent's population grew by 2.1
percent on average in 2006, continuing the
downward trend from 2.7 percent in 1990.
However, this average masks considerable
differences among countries and subregions.
It is estimated that the population growth
rate for Southern Africa declined to 1.2
percent in 2006 because of the HIV/AIDS
pandemic. It remained constant at 1.8 percent for North Africa, and ranged from 2.3
percent in West Africa to 2.5 percent in East
Africa and 2.7 percent in Central Africa.

 

Most importantly, with support from the
AfDB and other development partners, an
increasing number of RMCs are improving
their socio-economic situations. Measures
implemented in this regard include pro-poor
policies and programs; improving public
sector management and good governance;
increasing investments in the social sector,
infrastructure, and agriculture and rural
development.

SUBREGION

North Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The population of the North Africa subregion
(Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco,
Sudan, and Tunisia) in 2006 was estimated
at 197.1 million, representing 21.3 percent
of Africa's population.

North Africa accounted for 37.2 percent of
the continent's GDP in 2006, the highest
contribution among the 5 subregions. It
recorded the strongest economic performance in Africa, with an average real GDP
growth rate of 6.3 percent. Its GDP per capita
increased significantly, rising 17.7 percent,
from US$1,816 in 2005 to US$2,137 in
2006—almost twice the continental average
(Table 4.2). Mauritania and Sudan recorded
the highest growth—twice the subregional
average—while other major oil-exporters,
such as Algeria and Libya, posted 5 percent. Economic growth in Egypt, Morocco,
and Tunisia was underpinned by tourism
and agriculture and was slightly below the
subregional average.

Inflation in North Africa declined from 5.9
percent in 2005 to 4.3 percent—about onehalf of the continent's average of 9.1 percent
(Figure 4.2). The decline was attributable
to the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and tight monetary and
fiscal measures. Higher savings among oil
exporters also contributed to the subregion’s
healthy fiscal position. Overall, North Africa's
fiscal balance improved considerably, from a
surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to 5.0
percent of GDP in 2006, compared with the
continental average of 3.2 percent of GDP
in 2006. Similarly, owing to rising oil prices
and enhanced external competitiveness, the
subregion’s external position improved significantly and its current account surplus rose

 

Annual Report 2006

to 12.5 percent of GDP, from 10.5 percent in
2005. As well, the subregion, which has the
third lowest debt burden in the continent,
after Southern and West Africa, recorded a
substantial decline in its debt stock, from
32.4 percent of GDP in 2005 to 26.2 percent
of GDP in 2006. In contrast, its debt-service
ratio, which had been on a declining trend
over the years, rose marginally to 13.2
percent in 2006, from 12.5 percent a year
earlier (Table 4.2).

Social Indicators

North Africa continued to record the lowest incidence of poverty in the continent.
Average life expectancy in the subregion
(68 years) was well above the continental
average (51 years). In fact, life expectancy
rates in most countries in the subregion
compete well with those in developed
countries. As for infant and maternal mortality, the subregional averages of 38 deaths
per 1,000 live births and 177 deaths per

Bank Group Operations
Four of the 7 countries in North Africa
(Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia) are

ADB-window eligible because of their high
incomes. Mauritania and Sudan are only ADF
eligible. Libya is not yet a borrowing RMC.

In 2006, loan and grant approvals for
North Africa amounted to UA 669.3
million, up from UA 642.1 million in 2005
(Annex II-7). This accounted for 30 percent
of Bank Group loan and grant approvals. The Bank's support for the subregion
focused on reinforcing key reform programs,
strengthening the private sector, upgrading
infrastructure, and improving the overall competitiveness of the subregion’s economies.
Approvals in 2006 benefited the following
counties: Egypt (59.6 percent), Morocco (36.7
percent), Tunisia (2.2 percent), Mauritania
(1.4 percent), and Sudan (0.04 percent).

The sectoral distribution of approvals
was as follows: finance, UA 338.0 million
(50.5 percent); transportation, UA 102.5
million (15.3 percent); water supply and
sanitation, UA 79.3 million (11.9 percent);
multisector, UA 73.2 million (10.9 percent);

Economic and Social Trends by Subregion Chapter 004

Although the Bank Group started operations
in North Africa in 1968—a year later than
in other subregions—between 1968 and
2006, the subregion was the largest recipient of cumulative Bank Group approvals,
amounting to UA 12.67 billion, equivalent
to 32.5 percent of loan and grant approvals (Annex |I-7). Morocco and Tunisia have
consistently been the main beneficiaries,
receiving 32.7 percent and 27.8 percent,
respectively, of the subregion’s cumulative
approvals during the period. This is followed
by Egypt (19.0 percent), Algeria (14.9 percent), Mauritania (2.9 percent), and Sudan
(2.8 percent).

In contrast with other subregions, almost all
of the Bank Group's cumulative allocations
to North Africa were to finance infrastructure,
finance, and multisector reforms that have
a positive impact on private sector development (Figure 4.3).

Chapter 004 Economic and Social Trends by Subregion

West Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

West Africa is the largest subregion in Africa,
both geographically and demographically. It
comprises the following 15 RMCs: Benin,
Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire,
Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra
Leone and Togo. Its population of 266.7
million represents 28.8 percent of the
continental total.

In 2006, West Africa's GDP constituted 17.1
percent of the continent's total, the third
highest contribution after North and Southern
Africa. Its economic growth performance was
robust, with an average real GDP growth rate
of 4.8 percent, slightly lower than the 5.6
ercent recorded in the region in 2005 and
also lower than the 5.5 percent recorded at
he continental level in 2006. However, 5
countries in the subregion—Burkina Faso,
Cape Verde, Ghana, Nigeria, and Sierra
Leone—recorded growth rates above 5
ercent. Economic growth in the subregion
was largely affected by the persistent socioolitical situation in Céte d'Ivoire and by
he deterioration in the terms of trade for
cotton exporters such as Benin, Mali, and
ogo. This notwithstanding, the subregion’s
GDP per capita grew from US$620 in 2005
‘0 US$693 in 2006 (Table 4.3).

 

nflation in West Africa declined from 13.6
percent in 2005 to 7.7 percent, comparing
well with the continental average of 9.1
percent (Figure 4.4). The subregion’s fiscal
alance improved marginally, registering
a fiscal surplus of 5.7 percent of GDP
in 2006, compared with 5.5 percent for
2005. The improvement was due mainly
© higher oil-revenue savings in Nigeria,
debt relief to 11 RMCs in the subregion,
and continued prudent fiscal policies. This
notwithstanding, the subregion’s external
position deteriorated, with its trade balance
surplus declining to 13.1 percent of GDP in
2006, from 14.7 percent in 2005. Similarly,

 

Annual Report 2006

its current account surplus decreased from
5.3 percent of GDP to 3.2 percent of GDP
during the same period.

The subregion’s debt stock declined considerably, from 39.3 percent of GDP in 2005 to
21.9 percent of GDP in 2006, largely due
to Nigeria paying off its US$25 billion debt
to the Paris Club. Debt service also declined
substantially from 13.9 percent of exports
in 2005 to 2.9 percent of exports in 2006.
Indeed, the debt burden of the subregion

is expected to decline further as 7 of the
13 HIPC countries in the subregion reach
their completion points and benefit from
the MDRI.

Social Indicators

Most of the social indicators in West Africa
do not compare well with continental averages. Average life expectancy stood at 48
years, lower than the average of 51 years
for the continent (Annex II-1). Unless urgent
measures are taken to halt its spread, the

Regarding education, the subregion’s gross
primary school enrollment rates continued

percent for males and females, respectively.
However, these rates were still below the
continental rates of 104 percent and 90 percent for males and females, respectively. As
well, the secondary school enrollment rates
of 34 percent and 26 percent for males and
females, respectively, were much lower than
the continental averages of 41 and 37 percent for males and females, respectively. This

 

clearly underscores the need to provide support to help this subregion close the social
indicators gap with the rest of Africa.

Bank Group Operations

Nigeria is the only blend country in West
Africa that can borrow from the ADB and ADF
windows. The other 14 RMCs are only ADFeligible, and 13 of them are HIPC countries.
Bank Group approvals to the subregion
declined by almost half, from UA 553.7
million in 2005 to UA 267.8 million in 2006,
owing primarily to the frontloading—by most
of the RMCs in the subregion—of ADF-X
allocations in 2005 (Annex |I-7). However, this
trend is expected to reverse in 2007 through
the reallocation of unused ADF-X resources.

Approvals to the subregion accounted for
23.4 percent of total approvals and were
mainly for finance, agriculture and rural
development, water supply and sanitation,
and the multisector. The sectoral distribution was as follows: finance, UA 89.5 million
(33.4 percent); agriculture, UA 73.6 million
(27.5 percent); water supply and sanitation,

and Sierra Leone (0.7 percent).

West Africa was the second highest recipient of loan and grant approvals, after
North Africa. Between 1967 and 2006,
cumulative Bank Group loan and grant
approvals to the subregion amounted
to UA 9.14 billion, about 23.4 percent of
cumulative allocations to all RMCs (Annex
\l-7). Nigeria received the highest cumulative approvals (26.5 percent), followed by
Cote d'Ivoire (12.5 percent), Ghana (11.2
percent), Senegal (7.3 percent), Mali (7.1
percent), Burkina Faso (6.5 percent), Guinea
(6.2 percent), and Benin (5.5 percent). Figure

East Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends
The combined population of the East Africa
subregion (comprising Comoros, Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, and
Uganda) in 2006 was estimated at 218.4
million, or 23.6 percent of the continent's
population.

East Africa accounted for 7.0 percent of the
continent's GDP, the second lowest contribution after Central Africa. Its real GDP grew
by 5.1 percent on average—the second best
subregional economic growth performance,
after North Africa. However, this is lower than
e 6.4 percent recorded in 2005. Although
Ss GDP per capita rose from US$316 in
005 to US$349 in 2006, it was less than
ne-third of the continent's per capita GDP
US$1,182 in 2006, and the lowest among
e subregions (Table 4.4).

The 4 largest economies—Kenya, Tanzania,
and Uganda, members of the East African
Community (EAC), and Ethiopia—benefited
from higher coffee prices, which boosted
eir GDP growth rates above 5.1 percent.
The medium-sized economies of Madagascar
and Mauritius registered growth rates that
were between 3 and 5 percent. In contrast,
e smaller economies of Eritrea, Comoros,
nd Seychelles recorded growth rates below
percent. The lingering conflicts in the horn
f Africa continued to affect economic activy in the subregion. In addition, some of
e performing countries in the subregion
failed to continue pursuing sound inflation
targeting monetary policies and prudent fiscal policies. As a result, the average inflation
rate rose to 9.9 percent in 2006, from 8.2
percent in 2005 (Figure 4.6).

generation and tightening government
expenditure. The subregion’s fiscal deficit
remained high (4.7 percent) compared with
the continental average surplus (3.2 percent
of GDP). Although the subregion’s terms of
trade have been consistently negative in
recent years, they improved considerably,
from 9.6 percent in 2005 to 3.1 percent in
2006. This notwithstanding, the subregions
external position worsened, with its current
account balance turning to a deficit of 6.1
percent of GDP in 2006, from 5.5 percent
in 2005, compared with the average cur
rent account surplus of 4.7 percent of GDP
recorded by the continent.

The subregion’s external debt burden continued to decrease in 2006 owing to the
cautious borrowing policies of many governments and to multilateral debt relief for
4 of its HIPC completion point countries;
namely, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Tanzania,
and Uganda. Total external debt-to-GDP
ratio declined from 43.5 percent in 2005
to 35.1 percent in 2006; however, this
is still much higher than the continental

Social Indicators

Average life expectancy in East Africa, 50
years, is very close to the continental average of 51 years (Annex II-1). This notwithstanding, the combined effects of a high
incidence of poverty, low access to health
and sanitation services, and the HIV/AIDS
pandemic continue to undermine social and
economic development.

he proportion of the subregion's populaion with access to health services in 2006,
54 percent on average, remained very low,
compared with the continental average of 67
percent. Infant mortality and maternal morality rates remained high, with an average
of 86 deaths per 1,000 live births, and 643
deaths per 100,000 live births, respectively,
compared with the continental average of 83
per 1,000 live births and 609 per 100,000
ive births, respectively. Only 46 percent of
he population had access to drinking water
in 2006, against a continental average of 62
percent; 31 percent had access to sanitation,
much lower than the continental average
of 44 percent.

continental average of 104/90 percent. In
addition, 6 countries registered high and
gender-balanced ratios. Although secondary
school enrollment has improved significantly
over the last 5 years, it remained low at
36/28 percent (male/female) in 2006,
compared with the continental average of
40/37 percent (male/female). Raising the
percentage of the population with access
to health services, water and sanitation, as
well as secondary school enrollment ratios
to the continental level remains a priority
development challenge for the subregion.

restricted access to ADB resources for private
sector and enclave projects only. Overall, the
subregion received UA 522.4 million in

The Bank's support to the subregion was
directed primarily to infrastructure (comprising transportation, water and sanitation,
and power supply), the multisector, and
social sectors. Distribution of approvals
by sector was as follows: multisector, UA
169.0 million (32.4 percent); transportation,

Southern Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The population of the Southern Africa subregion (comprising Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,
Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) in 2006
was estimated at 128.9 million, or 13.9
percent of the continental population.

The subregion accounted for 32.9 percent of
the continent's GDP, the second highest after
North Africa. Its real GDP growth rate leveled
off at 5.4 percent, marginally lower than the
5.5 percent continental average real GDP
growth rate for 2006 (see Table 4.5). However,
he subregion’s GDP per capita income coninued its upward trend, rising from US$2,470
in 2005 to US$2,685 in 2006, driven mainly
y South Africa, with a per capita income of
US$5,499, compared with an average of US$
1,905 for the remaining countries.

Angola recorded the highest growth rate in
he subregion and in Africa, with its GDP
growth surging to 14.6 percent as more oil
roduction came on stream and oil prices
remained high. Mozambique and Zambia also
enjoyed strong growth rates (above 5.4 percent of GDP), mainly because of higher metal
tices. However, growth rates in South Africa,
Botswana, and Namibia came in slightly below
he subregional average. The removal of trade
quotas for textile, following the end of the
Multi-Fiber Agreement on January 1, 2005,
affected economic performance in Lesotho
and Swaziland, which both recorded growth
rates below 2 percent. Economic activity
contracted by 5 percent in Zimbabwe.

 

The inflation rate in Southern Africa rose from
10.7 percent in 2005 to 16.5 percent in 2006,
almost twice the continental average of 9.1
percent (Figure 4.8). This rising trend masks
considerable variations in inflation rates across
countries: Zimbabwe suffered from hyperinflation (1,216 percent in 2006), whereas the rates
of inflation in most of the other RMCs in the
subregion remained in the single digits.

 

Annual Report 2006

The overall fiscal situation in Southern Africa
weakened in 2006: Its fiscal balance declined
from a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005
to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2006. In contrast,
terms of trade improved from 5.8 percent in
2005 to 10.0 percent in 2006, pushing up the
merchandise trade balance from a surplus of
3.6 percent of GDP in 2005 to a surplus of
4.4 percent in 2006. This notwithstanding,
the current account deficit of Southern Africa
improved slightly—from 2.4 percent of GDP
to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2006.

The subregion is the least indebted in the
continent, with only 3 of its RMCs—Malawi,
Mozambique and Zambia—classified as
HIPCs. All 3 countries qualified for the MDRI.
As a result, the external debt-to-GDP ratio of
the subregion averaged 23.3 percent, down
from 28.1 percent in 2005. Similarly, its
debt-service ratio declined from 9.5 percent
in 2005 to 7.8 percent in 2006.

Life expectancy in the subregion in 2006,
42 years, was the lowest in the continent,
compared with the continental average of
51 years (Annex II-1). This low rate is attributable to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, although
a number of RMCs in the subregion are
achieving tangible results in halting the
spread of the disease. The proportion of the
population with access to health services, 48
percent, is lower than the 67 percent for the
continent. On the other hand, 72 percent
and 52 percent of the population had access
‘0 drinking water and sanitation, respecively. These rates are much higher than the
continental averages of 62 percent and 44
percent for water and sanitation, respecively. Infant and maternal mortality rates in

Bank Group Operations

Bank Group operations in Southern Africa
started in 1969. Four of the 10 RMCs in
the subregion—Botswana, Namibia, South
Africa, and Swaziland—are ADB-window eligible. Angola, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
and Zambia are ADF-eligible. Zimbabwe, a
blend country eligible for funding from both
the ADB and the ADF windows, has been
under sanctions since May 2000.

In 2006, Bank Group loan and grant
approvals to the subregion increased
substantially to UA 225.1 million, more
than 5 times the UA 43.5 million approved
in 2005, representing 9.8 percent of total
loan and grant approvals in 2006 (Annex
ll-7). This turnaround trend is attributable
to (i) allocations for 3 large operations in
Mozambique, to support 2 infrastructure
development projects and 1 multisector
project, and (ii) increased funding for budget

The main sectors supported in 2006 were
infrastructure (comprising transportation,

rural development. Sectoral allocations
were as follows: multisector, UA 80.0 million (35.5 percent); transportation, UA 36.9

beneficiaries in 2006: Mozambique (52.8
percent), Zambia (28.4 percent), Malawi
(13.3 percent); Lesotho (3.0 percent); and
Swaziland (2.4 percent).

 

Between 1969 and 2006, Southern Africa
received cumulative Bank Group loan
and grant approvals worth UA 5.11
billion (Annex |I-7). This represents 13.1
percent of cumulative loan and grant
approvals to all RMCs. Within the region,
Mozambique received the highest approvals
(20.3 percent), followed by Zimbabwe (14.2

Central Africa

Recent Macroeconomic Trends

The population of the Central Africa subregion (Burundi, Cameroon, Central African
Republic (CAR), Chad, Republic of Congo,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda, and
Sao Tome & Principe) was estimated at
113.3 million in 2006, or 12.3 percent of
the continent's population.

Central Africa contributed 5.9 percent to
the continental GDP—the lowest among
the 5 subregions. Its real GDP growth rate
declined from 4.9 percent in 2005 to 3.9
percent in 2006. However, its GDP per capita
rose from US$505 in 2005 to US$570 in
2006 (Table 4.6). In the subregion, only
Cameroon recorded a growth rate above 5
percent; Gabon’s growth rate came in far
elow this rate; while Equatorial Guinea
registered a negative growth rate of 0.4
ercent—compared with an average of 25
ercent in the past decade—owing to the
impact of reduced oil production on the
economy. In contrast, among the oil importers, Burundi and DRC recorded strong GDP
erformance above the 3.9 percent average.
Overall, prospects for economic growth in the
subregion are improving due to the sharp
decline in conflicts in the subregion and to
he major initiatives launched by the donor
community to support development in the
Great Lakes area.

 

 

n spite of the tight monetary and fiscal
policies in the CFA zone, the inflation rate
in the subregion remained stable at about
9.1 percent in 2005 and 9.5 percent in
2006— close to the continental average
of 9.1 percent (Figure 4.10).

Central Africa’s fiscal balance rose substantially, from a surplus of 6.5 percent of GDP
in 2005 to 8.3 percent of GDP in 2006,
owing to fiscal surpluses generated by countries such as Cameroon, Congo Republic,
Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and Sao Tome &

Principe. Similarly, the subregion’s external
position improved, with its current account
balance turning to a significant surplus of 5.2
percent of GDP in 2006, up from a modest
surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP in 2005. This
favorable trend is attributable to positive
developments in the terms of trade, which
stood at 15.6 percent in 2006, compared
with 13.8 percent in 2005. The subregion,
through Cameroon, CAR, Burundi, Rwanda,

Congo, and DRC, also benefited from the
combined effects of the post conflict initiative, the enhanced HIPC Initiative, and the
implementation of the MDRI. This led to a
sharp reduction of its external debt burden,
from 57.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 28.5
percent of GDP in 2006. As well, the subregion's debt service-ratio declined from
6.2 percent to 5.8 percent over the same
period, as shown in Table 4.6.

Social indicators in Central Africa remain
a major source of concern, compared with
the rest of Africa. Average life expectancy
at birth in 2006, 45 years, was lower than
the continental average of 51 years (Annex
|I-1). The percentage of the population with
access to health and sanitation services, 64
percent and 33 percent, respectively, was
below the continental average of 67 percent
and 44 percent, respectively. Limited access
to health and sanitation services continued
to have an adverse impact on quality of life
in the subregion: The infant mortality rate
averaged 106 deaths per 1,000 live births,
well above the continental average of 83
deaths per 1,000 live births. The maternal
mortality rate also remained high, at 1.071
deaths per 100,000 live births, compared
with the African average of 609 deaths per
100,000 live births. Similarly, only 55 percent
of the population had access to water, much
lower than the average of 62 percent for the
entire continent.

 

The subregion’s gross primary school enrolment rate of 109 percent for males exceeded

 

the continental average of 104 percent,
while the rate for females was almost at par
with the continental average of 90 percent
for females. In contrast, the subregional
average enrollment rate at the secondary
school level for male and female students
was abysmally low at 23 percent, compared
with the regional average enrollment rate of
42 percent. This situation continues to seriously undermine prospects for the social and
economic development of the subregion.

Gabon and Equatorial Guinea are the only
RMCs in Central Africa that are eligible for
ADB resources. The other 8 RMCs are only
eligible for ADF funding, with limited access
to ADB resources for private sector and

received UA 205.6 million in Bank Group

Chapter 005 Bank Group Operations

This Chapter presents an overview of Bank Group operations in terms of financing instrument, sectoral distribution, and
financing window (ADB, ADF, and NTF). It also presents profiles of all projects and programs approved in 2006, including
multinational operations in support of strong regional integration in Africa.

OVERVIEW OF BANK
GROUP OPERATIONS

In 2006, the AfDB approved a total of UA
2.59 billion—comprising UA 2.31 billion
for operations financing and UA 0.28 billion
in debt relief, arrears clearance, and private
sector loan guarantees. Operations focused
on finance, infrastructure development, and
multisector activities, reflecting the Bank
Group's new strategic orientation towards
enhancing selectivity and targeting specific
areas of intervention. These 3 sectors, which
accounted for 76.6 percent of loans and
grants, have the greatest impact on economic
growth, private sector development, and the
promotion of good governance in support of
the achievement of the MDGs.

Approvals by Financing Instrument
Bank Group total financing approvals reached a record high in 2006, rising
13.1 percent, from UA 2.29 billion in
2005 to UA 2.59 billion in 2006. This
increase is attributable to the volume of
loan and grant approvals, which rose from
UA 1.74 billion in 2005 to UA 2.31 billion in 2006. During the period under
review, project lending increased from
UA 1.05 billion to UA 1.20 billion; policybased lending more than doubled—from
UA 274.7 million to UA 618.4 million; and
grants increased from UA 420.3 million to
UA 492.4 million. In terms of financing
window, the ADB and ADF accounted for
40.4 percent and 59.6 percent, respectively, of approvals in 2006, compared
with 37.9 percent and 62.0 percent,
respectively, in 2005 (see Table 5.1).

As Table 5.1 shows, there was a sig
nificant increase in loan approvals
(project and policy-based lending),

Annual Report 2006

which rose 37.9 percent, from UA 1.32
billion in 2005 to UA 1.82 billion in
2006, and represented 70.1 percent
of Bank Group operational approvals.
Project lending, including sector investment operations and lines of credit, was
the main financing instrument, accounting for 46.2 percent of operational
approvals while policy-based lending
accounted for 23.9 percent. The remaining 19 percent of approvals was allocated to financing for 70 grants, with
the bulk of the resources (16.2 percent)
allocated for 27 investment operations
and 1 structural adjustment grant. The
grants comprised 25 technical assistance
grants (including 4 under the Middle
Income Countries (MIC) initiative), and
17 special relief fund grants. UA 0.3
million was also approved for 1 Project
Preparation Facility advance. In addition,
UA 257.5 million was approved for 6
debt relief operations under the HIPC
Initiative; UA 15.6 million in arrears
clearance for the CAR under the PCCF,
and UA 8.8 million for a private sector
loan guarantee. These Bank-financed
programs and projects will be implemented in 37 RMCs, in partnership with
other multilateral and bilateral donors.

The Bank Group used both ADB and ADF
resources to finance operations aimed at
promoting regional economic cooperation and integration. Loan and grant
approvals for multinational operations soared to their highest level in
the past 5 years, reaching UA 417.9
million in 2006 (18 percent of operations approvals), compared with UA 85.8
million in 2005 and UA 219.2 million
in 2004. The unprecedented increase
reflects the Bank Group’s new emphasis

on the development of regional and
multinational infrastructure and services.
Consistent with its lead role in promoting
subregional infrastructure under NEPAD,
the Bank Group is stepping up action to
help its RMCs build infrastructure and
alleviate poverty. As Figure 5.1 shows,
infrastructure received the highest percentage of approvals, 45.6 percent, in
support of the implementation of the
NEPAD Short-term Action Plan (STAP).
Agriculture and rural development
(20.8 percent) and finance (16.2 percent) also benefited from large financing. These 3 sectors together accounted
for close to 83 percent of approvals for
multinational operations. The remaining sectors, social development, multisector, and humanitarian emergency
assistance received about 18.0 percent
of approvals.

Chapter 005 Bank Group Operations

Loan and Grant Approvals by Sector
In line with the Bank Group's new strategic orientations, the bulk of the UA 2.31
billion approved for sectoral projects and
programs in 2006 was allocated to priority areas that are critical for promoting
economic growth and reducing poverty
in RMCs. The top 3 sectors that benefited
from loan and grant approvals were infrastructure, finance, and the multisector, as
described below.

Infrastructure projects (transportation, water supply and sanitation, power
supply) accounted for the largest share of
loan and grant approvals—UA 857.7 million (37.2 percent) for 32 operations—a
24.8-percent increase from UA 687.1
million for 23 operations a year earlier
(Table 5.2).

Table 5.2: Bank G

(in millions of UA)

As Figure 5.2 shows, the largest allocation under infrastructure went to transportation, UA 462.8 million (54.0 percent); followed by water and sanitation,
UA 227.7 million (26.6 percent); and
power supply, UA 167.2 million (19.5
percent).

Box 5.1: Classified Road

Network Development
Project (Phase II), Tunisia

 

Background

The Tunisia Classified Road Network
Development Project (Phase Il) was approved
on June 9, 1999, and was completed on
December 31, 2003. The project was cofinanced by the Bank Group—with a net loan
of UA 85.4 million—and the government of
Tunisia.

Outcomes
981 kilometers of roads upgraded in 21 districts in Tunisia.

Impact

The project contributed to job creation and to
private sector growth by expanding marketing
of agricultural produce in areas where the new
roads were built. It improved access to rural
areas and to the canning and clothes manufacturing industries.

Remarks

Project design and implementation were highly
satisfactory, with strong commitments from the
government and the executing agency. AfDB
supervision missions were regular and responses to identified problems were prompt.
Monitoring and evaluation activities were carried out regularly, including preparation of the
Bank's Project Completion Report.

Because of the remarkable success of this
project, a follow-up project (Phase III)
involving the upgrading of 1,025 kilometers of
road, at a cost of about UA 113.6

million (US$150.0 million), is currently under
implementation, and Phase IV,

which involves 1,256 kilometers of road at a
cost of about UA 133.3 million

(US$200.0 million) has been launched.

 

UA 218.6 million for 4 operations in reform program (See Box 5.2).

The Financial Sector

Program (FSRP), EG

 

In 2006, the Boards approved US$500.0 million to finance a public sector program in Egypt. This is the
largest single loan ever approved by the AfDB since its inception.

Objectives: The loan will (i) allow Egypt to develop an enabling environment for financial intermediation, resource mobilization, and risk management; (ii) increase private sector participation in the provision of financial services; (iii) support policy reforms to strengthen the domestic banking system and
develop contractual savings system, and; (iv) strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for
bank and non-bank financial institutions.

Amount: UA 338.0 million (US$500.0 million) in the form of a development budget support loan to the
government of Egypt.

Project Period: September 2006 — 2008.

Expected Outcomes
Long-Term: Increase the contribution of the financial sector to the GDP.

Medium Term: Reduce the market share of deposits of state-owned banks from 58 percent to 48
percent by end-2007; consolidate the banking sector, with the number of banks reduced from 57 to 35
by end 2007; increase the market share of private sector banks by at least 60 percent by end-2008;
reduce the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans by 50 percent by end 2008; reduce the market
share of state-owned insurance companies to less than 30 percent by end-2008; and increase capitalization of the bond market by 20 percent by end-2008.

Chapter 005 Bank Group Operations

Multisector activities received the third
largest share of loan and grant approvals—UA 414.3 million for 24 operations—
compared with UA 264.4 million for 11
operations in 2005. This 56.7 percent rise
over 2005 allocations, and the substantial increase in the number of multisector
activities is attributable to the Bank Group's
new focus on sector rehabilitation and
institutional support for capacity building,
public sector management, private sector
development, and good governance operations in RMCs.

Figure 5.3 presents the subsectoral breakdown of approved funding for multi-sector
operations: Public sector management was
allocated UA 138.2 million; budget support UA 115.0 million; governance UA
47.0 million; institutional support UA 10.5
million; and other multisector operations
UA 103.6 million.

Social sector approvals also increased
in volume and size, from UA 233.7 million
for 27 operations in 2005 to UA 244.3
million for 16 operations in 2006—a 4.5
percent increase. Approvals for the sector represented 10.6 percent of loan and
grant approvals. In terms of subsectoral
breakdown, UA 80 million of the approved
funding for the sector was allocated for 3
health projects (32.8 percent); UA 65.0
million for 4 education projects (26.6 percent); and UA 99.3 million (40.7 percent)
for 9 other projects (social sector related
operations, including gender equity, population and nutrition, as well as income
generating activities). (See Figure 5.4).

Social sector projects and programs funded
by the Bank Group have a positive impact
on the economies of RMCs. Box 5.3 profiles a successful Bank-financed education
project in Mali.

Background: The project was approved on November 20, 1997, and signed on December 17, 1997. The loan became
effective on April 12, 1999, for an initial 5-year period. The project achieved a physical implementation rate of 99.5
percent at a project cost of UA 11.1 million, with a 10 percent (UA 1.1 million) counterpart contribution from the
Government of Mali. The disbursement rate was about 95 percent.

Outcomes: Construction and provision of equipment for 2 teacher-training institutes, 11 pedagogic centers in 3
regions, and 9 women’s training centers. Construction of 3 vocational training centers. Rehabilitation and provision
of equipment for 4 offices of the National Girls Enrolment Unit.

Impact: The project contributed to the development of vocational technical education in Mali. Youths were trained in
different trades and were awarded certificates after the training. The women’s training centers offered vocational training for girls and literate women.

General Remarks: Because of the resounding success of the project, communities that do not have women’s training
centers have requested that such facilities, which contribute to women’s empowerment, be extended to them.Bank Group Operations Chapter 005

General Remarks:

 

   

The project was approved on July 8, 1998, and started on the same day. Total project cost at project completion stood at UA
7.3 million (UA 6.5 million from ADF resources, and UA 0.7 million from the government of Djibouti).

Community pharmacists were provided with essential drugs worth US$550,000. Health posts serving over 30,0000 inhabitants
in the northern region of the country were rehabilitated, as were 7 kilometers of the water supply system. Over 1,200 women

(in 16 groups) were trained in micro-finance, and 16 Project Partner Associations were formed. School supplies and equipment
were provided for 7 primary schools with 850 pupils.

The project promoted income-generating activities for 3,168 women, beneficiaries of the 16 micro-credit institutions established under the project. Overall, the project improved the socio-economic conditions of the beneficiary groups.

Three of the winners of the Head of State's prize for women entrepreneurs for 2006 were members of the 16 Project Partner
Associations.

Agriculture and rural development
was allocated UA 240.7 million (10.4 percent of the total) for 36 operations UA 9.6
million more than the UA 231.1 million
allocated for 21 operations in 2005. The
modest increase in Bank Group approvals
for the social and agriculture sectors in
2006, compared with approvals in 2005,
reflects a major shift in the distribution of
the Bank's resources and a sharper focus
on infrastructure financing and multisector
activities in RMCs. Box 5.5 presents an
overview of a successful Bank-financed
agricultural project in Uganda.

Approvals for the industry, mining, and
quarrying sector rose to UA 55.9 million
(2.4 percent of approvals) for 2 privatesector-led operations, up from UA 34.0
million for one operation in 2005 (see

General
Remarks:

 

The Area-based Agricultural Modernization Project was approved on September
13, 2000, and started on November 1, 2003. The cost of the project was UA
22.4 million, with the Bank Group providing an ADF loan of UA 9.7 million; the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, a loan of UA 9.6 million; and
the government of Uganda and beneficiaries contributing UA 3.1 million.

As at June 2006, about 67.2 percent of the 700 kilometers of road slated for
rehabilitation had been completed, with the rest expected to be completed in
December 2006.

The project has contributed significantly to poverty reduction in rural areas by
improving accessibility to markets, revamping rural economies, and increasing
household incomes in rural areas.

Because of the success of the project, the government is considering extending
or replicating the program in other regions to consolidate project achievements.

Crosscutting Activities

In line with directives from its stakeholders, the Bank Group put a high premium
on mainstreaming crosscutting issues such
as gender equity, particularly through the
socio-economic empowerment of women;
environmental protection, and good governance.

Gender Mainstreaming Activities

In 2006, the Bank Group conducted the
mid-term review of its Gender Plan of
Action to determine progress, gaps, challenges, and the way forward. The review
highlighted areas where gender-mainstreaming actions have been taken, and
where gender perspectives have been
incorporated into the Bank's major thematic and sector policies. These include
the micro-credit policy; human resource
management policies, notably a sexual

harassment policy; the integration of gender analysis into programming tools; and
improved gender analysis in RB CSP documents. The review also identified areas that
require further action: scaling up the development of gender mainstreaming tools;
putting in place a process to ensure staff
accountability in gender mainstreaming
at all levels; and ensuring gender-sensitive
compliance.

In 2006 as well, guidelines for mainstreaming gender into the education and agriculture and rural development sectors were
completed. The gender profile for Namibia
was finalized, and that of Angola should
be completed in 2007. Table 5.3 shows
the status of gender profiles for other
RMCs. Overall, a large majority of Bank
Group projects approved in 2006 sought
to promote women’s economic power and
opportunities by ensuring the participation
of women in development activities,

Environmental Management
Because of growing concerns about climate
change, in 2006 the Bank Group introduced

Bank Group Operations Chapter 005

innovative operational measures to mainstream environmental and social issues
into its policy dialogue and project cycle
activities and to consolidate its operations
in the environmental and natural resources
sectors. Specifically, environmental management issues featured prominently in
policy dialogue during the preparation
of Results-based Country Strategy Papers
(RB-CSPs) for Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Gabon, Morocco, and Tunisia. Within the
framework of the Paris Declaration on
Aid Effectiveness, the AfDB participated
in the preparation of Equivalence Studies
on Environmental Impact Assessments and
applied the assessment to the country systems process in Ghana and Uganda.

Other environmental management activities undertaken during 2006 include the
streamlining of the ESAP and the establishment of an institutional Joint-Initiative
between GTZ and the AfDB in the Maghreb
countries and Mauritania for effective
implementation of the ESAP; the review
of Environmental and Social Guidelines on
Lines of Credit to Financial Intermediaries;

Water Harvesting andWetlands, with support
from the Multi-Donors’ Water Partnership
Program. Strengthening the capacity of key
staff responsible for environmental issues
was made a requirement for the approval of
lines of credit to commercial banks.

Five Strategic Environmental and Social
Assessment studies were also undertaken
during the preparation of multinational
and national operations in 2006. These
studies aimed to ensure that environmen‘al considerations are fully addressed in
he programming and project processing
cycles. In line with the requirements of the
Extractive Industries Review, appraisals of
arge-scale mining projects approved in
2006 included robust community development action plans. As well, the Bank
Group participated in the preparation of
he Strategic Investment Program (SIP) of
errAfrica, a multi-partner platform estabished to scale-up the mainstreaming and
inancing of country-driven sustainable
and management approaches.

 

Promotion of Good Governance

n line with its mandate under NEPAD,
he Bank Group plays a leader role in
promoting good banking and financial
governance in Africa. The Bank's guiding
principle is a zero-tolerance policy on fraud
and corruption, whether perpetrated by
Bank staff or occurring in connection with

 

projects, programs, and equity financed
by the Bank Group. To this end, in 2006
the Bank Group adopted a proposal to
“Establish an Anti-corruption and Fraud
Investigation Function” as a core part of its
policy on good governance. As well, a new
Anti-corruption and Fraud Division was
set up in the Office of the Auditor-General
to handle all matters relating to corruption and fraud, and a new department in
charge of governance was created under
the new organizational structure.

As part of the implementation of the
Bank's good governance practices, management prepared and submitted updated
“Guidelines for Financial Management and
Financial Analysis” of projects for approval
by the Boards. When approved in 2007,
these guidelines will help improve the
efficiency of Bank activities in support of
best practices on financial governance of
projects/programs. The guidelines will also
enhance the Bank's contribution to RMCs’
efforts to ensure better project design,
delivery, and impact.

Building a sound governance environment
that supports reforms and private sector
development remains at the heart of the
Bank's strategy in its RMCs. To support the
African Peer Review Mechanism, the Bank
Group implemented 9 Country Governance
Profiles (CGPs) in 2005, submitted 3 CGPs
to the Board in 2006, and has 9 other

Compliance Review and
Mediation Unit

The Compliance Review and Mediation
Unit (CRMU) is the focal point of the
Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) of
the AfDB.

The IRM, which came into force in 2006
was established to allow people adversely
affected by a Bank-financed project to
(i) request the Bank Group to undertake
a compliance review to verify the Bank's
complience with its own policies and procedures; or (ii) to engage in a mediation
exercise with the affected people. Major
achievements in this area in 2006 included
(i) the appointment of the director and secretarial staff for CRMU, (ii) the launching of
the IRM website, which is integrated with
the Bank Group's main website; (iii) the
production of a brochure for people living
in areas where the Bank Group is financing projects, and the wide distribution of
this brochure to field offices, Operations
Complexes, and NGOs; and (iv) discussions
with NGOs with special interest in the
accountability of MDBs.

 

 

 

At a seminar organized on November
21, 2006, in Tunis, representatives of the
World Bank's Inspection Panel, the Asian
Development Bank's Compliance Review
Panel, and the Bank Group presented samples of past cases investigated by these
institutions. The seminar was attended by
about 40 participants. The Bank Group also
participated in the meeting on Accountability
and Recourse Mechanisms of International
Financial Institutions in Montreal, Canada,
from May 18 to 19, 2006. As well, during
the year, the Director of CRMU undertook
a fact-finding visit to strengthen partnership with the World Bank's Inspection Panel
and the International Finance Corporation's
Compliance Adviser/Ombudsman.THE AFRICAN

Operations

The ADB window is the Bank Group's nonconcessional lending arm, through which it
supports development activities in 13 creditworthy RMCs and in 2 blend countries.
The latter, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, are also
eligible for concessional financing from the
ADF window. Specifically, the ADB mobi
lizes financial resources from international
capital markets to finance key operations
and viable private sector activities in eligible RMCs. Through its Special Relief Fund
(SRF), it provides emergency assistance to
RMCs that are in post-conflict situations or
are affected by natural disasters and major
external shocks.

Approvals for ADB operations increased
significantly in 2006, rising 20.9 percent—

was mainly driven by the Financial Sector
Reform Program for Egypt (UA 338.0

the Bank Group since its inception. It
was also due, in part, to the sharp rise in
policy-based lending and in private sector

assistance grants under the Special Relief
Fund (UA 5.8 million); 3 debt relief operations under the enhanced HIPC Initiative
(UA 102.2 million); and 1 private guarantee (UA 8.8 million). Technical assistance
grants, provided under the Middle Income
Countries (MIC) Facility, support project
cycle and institutional activities in beneficiary RMCs. This is the first time that this
new financing instrument is being used
by the ADB window to provide assistance
to RMCs.

In terms of sectoral distribution, the top
3 sectors received more than 84 percent
of loans and grants: Finance received the
largest share (53.0 percent), followed by

infrastructure (23.9 percent); and multisector (7.8 percent). The distribution for the
remaining sectors ranged from 6.6 percent
for the social sector to 2.7 percent for agriculture and rural development (see Table
5.6). The dominance of finance, infrastructure, and multisector operations reflects a
higher demand for financing in the areas
of financial sector reform, infrastructure
development, and public sector management to spur growth in RMCs.

Public Sector Operations

Public sector operations—comprising all
project loans and grants—and other
approvals (excluding private sector operations) continued to play a dominant
role in ADB operations in 2006. In

Table 5.6: ADB Approvals by Sector, 2004-2006

(in millions of UA)

total, UA 664.7 million was approved
for 28 projects and programs (representing 71.1 percent of approvals for
operations). The public sector operations comprised 2 policy-based loans
amounting to UA 411.2 million, or 44
percent of all loan and grant approvals during the year (see Table 5.5). The
dominance of policy-based operations,
lines of credit, and project loans—99
percent of approvals—reflect their role
as the main financing instrument used to
support the implementation of government economic reform policies and to
create the physical, financial, and social
infrastructure necessary for sustainable
development and poverty reduction.

THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT FUND

Operations

The ADF window is the Bank Group's concessional lending arm for 38 RMCs that cannot borrow at market rates under the ADB
window. Nigeria and Zimbabwe, the 2 blend
countries, are also eligible for ADF financing.
ADF resources are allocated for investment
in basic economic and human development
projects based on the following criteria:
country creditworthiness, per capita GNI, and

country performance using the enhanced
Performance-Based Allocation (PBA) system as recommended by ADF Deputies. The
resources are intended to accelerate broadbased, equitable, sustainable economic
growth and social development, with the
overall goal of reducing poverty.

ADF loan and grant approvals for operations financing rose from UA 992.2 million
for 61 operations (in 24 countries and 5
multinational projects) in 2005 to UA 1.37
billion for 80 operations in 32 countries.

Table 5.7: ADF Approvals by Financing Instrument, 200

(in millions of UA)

These include 20 multinational projects and
1 project preparation facility advance of UA
0.30 million. The average size of projects
also increased by 5.4 percent. In addition
to the loans and grants, the Fund also
approved UA 155.3 million in HIPC debt
relief for Cameroon, Republic of Congo,
and Malawi, as well as UA 15.6 million in
arrears clearance for CAR under the PCCF.
Overall, approvals under the ADF window in
2006 totaled UA 1.54 billion, an 8.5 percent
increase from the Fund’s commitment level
of UA 1.42 billion in 2005 (see Table 5. 7).

92 Annual Report 2006THE NIGERIA TRUST
FUND

Operations

The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) makes available
financial resources at below market rates
to support development efforts in RMCs,
particularly in low-income ADF countries.
Article XII of the Agreement Establishing
the Nigeria Trust Fund (the NTF Agreement),
signed by the Bank and Nigeria on February
26, 1976, provides that the NTF shall be
in effect for thirty (30) years. This may be
extended by mutual agreement between
Nigeria and the Bank. Furthermore, Article
XIII, Section 1, of the NTF Agreement, states
that unless its duration is extended beyond
April 25, 2006, (the “Termination Date”) by
mutual agreement, on that date, the NTF
shall legally cease all activities, except those
related to orderly winding down of prior
commitments.

During the 2006 Annual Meetings in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, the Boards o
Governors took note of the letter from the
Governor for the Federal Republic of Nigeria
informing the Bank that the Government o'
Nigeria had (i) granted the Bank its reques'
for an extension of the duration of the NTF
for an interim period of one year; (ii) decided on an immediate drawdown of US$200
million from the NTF; and (iii) authorized
the Bank to conclude the winding down
process within the extended duration of the
life of the Trust Fund. In light of this development, no loans or grants were approved
under the NTF in 2006.

An evaluation of the NTF began on 28
November 2006. The main objectives o'
the evaluation are to (i) review how wel
NTF resources have been used, (ii) assess
the performance of the Bank and Nigeria
in managing the NTF, and (iii) examine the
terms of NTF financing in relation to NTF
sustainability as a Fund. Other objectives
include identifying possible niches for future
NTF use and determining the NTF extension

 

period and changes that should be made
in relation to its governance structure. Five
country case studies (Benin, the Gambia,
Mauritania, Rwanda and Swaziland) will be
used as a benchmark for the evaluation. The
first report will be available before the end
of the first quarter of 2007.

Cumulative Loan and Grant
Approvals, 1976-2006

Since its establishment in 1976, the NTF has
approved UA 304.6 million for 71 projects
in 30 RMCs. Of this amount, UA 14.1 million was allocated to multinational projects.

Cumulative approvals according to sector
remained unchanged in 2006 since there

Bank Group Operations Chapter 005

were no NTF operations (see Figure 5.14).
The data indicated that infrastructure
accounted for 51.9 percent of approvals,
followed by agriculture and rural development, 18.8 percent; the social sector, 18.2
percent; finance, 5.8 percent; and industry,
mining and quarrying, 5.4 percent.

Distribution of approvals by subregion
shows that West Africa received 39.2 percent of NTF cumulative loan approvals,
followed by East Africa, 24.5 percent;
Southern Africa, 17.5 percent; Central
Africa, 10.8 percent; North Africa, 3.4
percent; and multiregional operations, 4.6
percent (see Figure 5.15).

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

This Chapter discusses the management of the financial resources of the Bank Group's windows—the African
Development Bank (ADB), the African Development Fund (ADF), and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF)—during the year.
It also presents the Audited Financial Statements for 2006 for the three windows, and the ADB and ADF
Administrative Budgets for the financial year 2007.

THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK

Financial Management
Subscriptions

The authorized capital stock of the Bank
stood at UA 21.87 billion as of December 31,
2006, and has been allocated to regional
and non-regional members in such proportion so that, when fully subscribed, the
regional group holds 60% of the total
capital stock and the non-regional group
40%. Members’ subscriptions reached UA
21.79 billion, that is 99.63% of the capital
stock.

The capital stock is composed of paid-up
and callable capital. The paid-up capital is
the amount of capital payable over a period
determined by the relevant General Capital
Increase (10 years for the fourth General
Capital Increase and 8 years for the fifth
General Capital Increase). The paid-in capital, which represents the portion of paid-up
capital that has been actually paid, reached
UA 2.31 billion. As of December 31, 2006,
the Bank's callable capital was UA 19.44
billion of which UA 5.63 billion was from
countries rated double-A and higher. The
callable capital is subject to payment as
and when required by the Bank to meet its
obligations incurred, (a) by making or participating in direct loans out of funds borrowed or otherwise acquired by the Bank
for inclusion in its ordinary capital resources
or in special resources; or (b) by guaranteeing in whole or in part, loans made by other
entities. It is a protection of the Bank's
creditors and holders of Bank's guarantees
in the event that it is not able to meet its

Annual Report 2006

financial obligations. There has never been
a call on the capital of the Bank.

In accordance with the Shares Transfer
Rules, shares for which payments have
become due and remain outstanding are
forfeited after a prescribed period and
offered for subscription to member countries. Unsubscribed capital amounts to UA
75.46 million and comprises shares to be
made available for reallocation as well as
shares held by the former Social Republic
of Yugoslavia. The fifth General Capital
Increase (GCI-V) became effective in 1999.
A member country’s payment of the first
GCI-V installment triggers the subscription
to the entire callable capital portion of
shares allocated to it. However, shares representing the paid-up portion of subscriptions are issued only as and when the Bank
receives actual payments for such shares.

 

The position of capital subscriptions
at December 31, 2006 is shown in the
Statement of Subscriptions to the Capital
Stock and Voting Power, which forms part
of the audited Financial Statements of this
Report.

Bank Rating

The rating agencies Standard & Poor's,
Moody's, Fitch Ratings, and the Japan Credit
Rating Agency reaffirmed their AAA and AA+
rating of the African Development Bank's
senior and subordinated debt respectively,
with a stable outlook. Their rating reflects
the Bank’s strong membership support,
its preferred creditor status, sound capital
adequacy and prudent financial management and policies.

Capital Markets Operations

The very high credit ratings enjoyed by
the Bank enable it to issue securities at
low interest rates. Its borrowing activities
are guided by client and cashflow requirements, assets and liability management
goals, and risk management policies.

In order to support these borrowing activities, the Bank has available for its use an
array of instruments to access the international capital markets. These include a
Global Debt Issuance Facility and a Euro
Commercial Paper Program. These programs are flexible documentation facilities
allowing convenient and continuous issuance, giving access to a large investor base
in a wide range of capital markets.

As at December 31, 2006, the borrowing
portfolio of the Bank stood at UA 5.87 billion. The Bank is well within its debt policy
limits. The key debt ratios are as follows:

¢ Total debt/total callable capital
(max 80 percent): 30.20 percent

¢ Senior debt/non-borrowing members’
callable capital (max 80 percent):
60.69 percent

For the year 2006, the ADB Board of
Directors had approved in January 2006 a
borrowing program of up to UA 850 million including a UA 70 million component
for the Enhanced Private Sector Assistance
for Africa Initiative (EPSA). The Bank raised
UA 731 million at a weighted average cost
of 6-month US Dollar LIBOR minus 24.7
basis points through transactions in the US
Dollar global bond market and AustralianDollar domestic market, African currencies
in Euro-markets, private placement market
in Japan and Uridashi market.

While the Bank made its annual appearance in October 2006 in the global bond
market with a finely-priced and well-distributed USD 500 million transaction, the
bond issue in Australian Dollar domestic
market ("kangaroo” market) in February
2006 was a debut issue for the Bank. The
Bank also raised funds through small-sized
structured transactions to take advantage
of attractive funding opportunities in the
japanese private placement market. The
private placement activity in Japan was
complemented through three Uridashi
ransactions targeted at the Bank’s retail
japanese investor base.

he Bank continues to focus its efforts
on the possibility of issuance in African
currencies. Following the success of the
Botswana Pula issue in December 2005,
he Bank launched the first-ever Tanzanian
Shilling-linked bond issue by a supranaional in February 2006. Subsequently, in
October 2006, the Bank launched the first
bond ever issued by a supranational that is
denominated in Ghanaian Cedi. The bond
matures on October 19, 2008. Both transactions attracted participation by global
institutional investors.

 

These bond issues represent important
milestones that reinforce the Bank's strategy of bringing visibility to the opportunities
that African capital markets, and African
currencies, offer to local and international
investors.

Consistent with the expectation of many
regional member countries that the Bank
issue bonds in their domestic markets and
utilize the proceeds from such bond issues
predominantly for development-related
lending in their own countries, the Bank
has taken a major step in creating a policy
framework that provides the basis for the

Bank to designate African currencies as
lending currencies of the Bank, subject to
necessary supply-demand and risk management safeguards. As a next step, the
Bank is currently examining the feasibility
of cost-effective issuance in domestic bond
markets in Africa.

Investments

The Bank's cash and treasury investments
(net of repurchase agreements) as of
December 31, 2006 totaled UA 5,344.86
million, compared to UA 4,758.43 million at
the end of 2005. Investment income for 2006
amounted to UA 213.82 million, or a return
of 4.22 percent on an average liquidity of UA
5.06 billion, compared to UA 155.38 million
in 2005, or a return of 3.36 percent, on an
average liquidity of UA 4.63 billion.

Effective January 1, 2001, the ADB's liquid
assets were tranched into 3 portfolios,
namely operational portfolio, prudential
portfolio, and equity-backed portfolio, each
with a different benchmark that reflects the
cashflow and risk profile of its assets and
funding sources. These benchmarks are
one-month LIBID for the operational portfolio, and 6-month marked-to-market LIBOR,
resetting on February 1 and August 1 for
the prudential portfolio. The equity-backed
portfolio is managed against a repricing
profile benchmark with 10 percent of the
Bank's net assets repricing uniformly over
a period of 10 years.

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans signed, net of cancellations, as at December 31, 2006 amounted
to UA 18.09 billion. Total outstanding loans,
as at December 31, 2006 was UA 5.29 billion, UA 221 million lower than the UA 5.51
billion outstanding as at the end of 2005.
This decrease was attributable primarily to
prepayments during the year amounting to
UA 298.14 million. Undisbursed balances
at December 31, 2006 totaled UA 2.03
billion, an increase of UA 173.09 million
from December 31, 2005. The number of

Financial Products
Loans. The Bank offers 3 loan products:
variable, floating, and fixed interest rate
loans with a selection of loan currencies,
currently, US Dollars, Euro, Japanese Yen,
and South Africa Rand. To suit the longterm financing needs of borrowers, loans
have a maximum maturity of 20 years,
including a grace period on the repayment
of the principal amount, generally not
exceeding 5 years.

For the single currency variable interest rate
oan, the lending rate is determined twice a
year, on January 1 and July 1, and is based
on the Bank's average cost of a designated
ool of borrowings funding the loans in
he specific currency. The lending rate for
he floating interest rate loan is derived
from the 6-month market reference rate in
he specific currency, for example, LIBOR,
EURIBOR, or JIBAR. The lending rate is reset
on February 1 and August 1 each year and
applies to the 6-month period following
he reset date. For the fixed interest rate
oan, the lending rate in each currency is
he fixed amortizing swap rate derived
rom the 6-month market reference rates.
Borrowers may select from a number of
rate-fixing alternatives, including fixing at
each disbursement or after all disbursements have been completed. Prior to rate
fixing, the currency-specific floating interest
rate applies.

 

 

The pricing formula applicable to all 3 loan
products is the same. The applicable rate of
interest is the sum of the chosen base rate
plus a lending spread. Loans to sovereign
and sovereign-guaranteed borrowers enjoy
a lending spread of 40 basis points above
the 6-month market reference rate. For nonsovereign guaranteed borrowers in both
the private and public sector, the lending
spread is computed based on the Bank's
risk-based pricing framework.

Annual Report 2006

Agency Lines. Loans to private sector
enterprises can be extended directly or
hrough a private financial institution (PFI).
nan agency line (AL), the credit risk of the
orrower is borne by the Bank. In addition,
he PFI acts as an agent for the Bank, to
carry out a variety of activities, including,
ut not limited to, identifying projects
within certain parameters; appraising such
rojects on behalf of the Bank; when
approved, undertaking all of the administrative steps related to disbursement
billing, collection of Bank's funds, filing of
security); supervising projects, monitoring
he performance of the borrower, submitting reports thereon; and transmitting
amounts related to the repayment of the
loan to the Bank.

Guarantees. Through the guarantee
roduct, the Bank seeks to leverage its
referred creditor status to assist eligible
orrowers to obtain financing from third
arty lenders, including capital markets.
Guarantees will also enable borrowers to
obtain financing in their own local currency
where the Bank is not able to provide such
inancing directly from its own resources.

Risk Management Products are
offered to enable borrowers to manage
he market risks associated with their loans
rom the Bank, including interest rate, currency, and commodity price risks. These
roducts assist borrowers to manage their
alance sheets and their changing needs
more efficiently over time. Risk management products such as interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, interest rate caps and coljars are available to borrowers at any time
during the life of the loan.

 

Equity Participation or QuasiEquity Products. The Bank’s ability to
provide risk capital through equity investments is a key element of its resource mobilization role. Even though the Bank cannot
be a majority shareholder in a company,
it can participate in a project by acquir
ing ordinary stocks, redeemable preferred
stocks, or debentures.

Other Financial Services. |n addition to the products described above,
the Bank may offer loan syndication and
underwriting services through its private
sector window.

Risk Management
Policies and Processes

As a development finance institution, the
African Development Bank seeks to reduce
its exposure to risks that are not essential
to its core business of providing development finance and related assistance. To
this end, the Bank has adapted its risk
management policies, guidelines and processes to reduce exposure to interest rate,
currency, liquidity, counterparty, legal, and
other operational risks, while maximizing
its capacity to assume the risks of extending credit to its public and private sector
clients within its approved risk limits.

Credit Risk

Credit risk, the potential default of one or
more debtors, is the largest source of risk
for the African Development Bank and is
managed within an integrated framework of
credit policies, guidelines and processes. The
foundation of the Bank's credit management
framework is a systematic credit risk assessment based on a uniform internal credit risk
rating scale that is calibrated to reflect the
Bank's statistical loss expectations.

The Bank manages three principal sources
of credit risk: 1) sovereign credit risk on its
public sector portfolio; 2) non-sovereign credit
tisk on its portfolio of private sector, nonsovereign and enclave projects; and 3) counterparty credit risk on its portfolio of treasury
investments and derivative instruments.

Sovereign Credit Risk
When the Bank lends to public sector borrowers, it generally requires a full sovereignguarantee or the equivalent from the borrowing member state. Consequently, the
expected loss rate on the Bank's public
sector portfolio is derived from regular
assessments of the ultimate collectibility
risk of the sovereign guarantees from the
Borrowing Member States. The credit risk
ratings of the Bank's Borrowing Member
States are updated quarterly by the credit
management division.

In 2006, the overall risk profile of the Bank's
sovereign guaranteed portfolio improved
significantly, mainly due to the combined
effect of improvement in the weighted average credit rating of the regional member
countries and the increased Bank's exposure
to high graded countries.

The portfolio’s weighted-average risk rating showed a marginal strengthening from
3.15 at the end of 2005 to 2.93 at the end
of 2006. The distribution of the sovereign
portfolio across the Bank's five credit risk
classes is shown in the table below.

To ensure adequate diversification, the Bank
maintains a prudent distribution of its sovereign guaranteed portfolio through its
exposure management policies. For each
eligible public sector borrower, the Bank
applies an exposure limit that reflects the
country’s risk rating and its economic potential subject to a maximum loan equivalent
exposure for any single country that is no
more than 15% of the Bank's maximum
sustainable portfolio?. The country exposure
limits are reviewed annually and are used as
a risk-based benchmark to plan the Bank’s
medium-term country assistance strategies.

It is the Bank's policy that if a payment of
principal, interest or other charges with
respect to any Bank Group credit becomes
30 days overdue, no new loans to that
member country, or to any public sector
borrower in that country, will be presented
to the Board of Directors for approval, nor
will any previously approved loan be signed,
until all arrears are cleared. Further, for such
countries, disbursements on all loans to or

guaranteed by that member country are suspended until all overdue amounts have been
paid. These countries also become ineligible
in the subsequent billing period for a waiver
of 0.50% on the commitment fees charged
on qualifying undisbursed ADB loans.

Although the Bank benefits from the advantages of preferred creditor status and rigorously monitor the exposure on non-performing sovereign borrowers, some countries
have experienced difficulties to service their
debts to the Bank on a timely basis. With
the adoption of the revised International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from
2005, the Bank no longer makes general
provisions for performing loans. In line with
the IFRS norms, the Bank makes a provision
for the impairment? in its sovereign portfolio
commensurate with the assessment of the
incurred loss in the cumulative portfolio. The
Bank's impairment allowance of UA 436.77
million (2005: UA 392.37 million) is consistent
with the estimated incurred loss associated
with impaired loans at the end of 2006.

To cover potential unexpected credit-related losses due to extreme and unpredictable events, the Bank maintains a conservative risk capital cushion for sovereign
credit risks. The Bank's capital adequacy
policy articulates differentiated risk capital
requirements for all credit-sensitive assets
(loans and equity investments) plus contingent liabilities (guarantees and client risk
management products) in each risk class‘.
At the end of 2006, the Bank's public sector portfolio required as risk capital, 41%
of the Bank’s total capital>. This compares
with 45% at the end of 2005 and reflects
the changes in the composition of the
sovereign portfolio.

Non-Sovereign Credit Risk

When the Bank lends to private sector borrowers or to enclave projects it does not
enefit from full sovereign guarantees or
he equivalent. The Bank may also provide
financing to creditworthy commercially oriented entities that are publicly owned, without a sovereign guarantee. Consequently,
he expected loss rate on its non-sovereign
portfolio is derived from the assessment of
he ultimate collectibility risk of each project
oan including any security or guarantees.
he credit management division assigns
a credit risk rating for all new projects at
entry and the risk ratings on all outstanding
rojects are updated quarterly.

 

n 2006, the non-sovereign loan and equity
portfolios size increases. By year-end, the
weighted-average risk rating deteriorated
marginally from 3.12 in 2005 to 3.52 in
2006. The distribution of the non-sovereign

portfolio across the Bank's five credit risk
classes is shown in the table below.

To ensure a prudent distribution of its
non-sovereign portfolio, the Bank manages
its lending activities within a framework
of country, sector, client, and instrument
exposure limits and risk profile benchmarks.
In addition, the Bank generally requires a
range of securities and guarantees from the
project sponsors to partially mitigate the
credit risk for direct private sector loans.

In compliance with the revised IFRS, the
Bank no longer makes general provisions
to cover the expected losses in the performing non-sovereign portfolio. For the
non-performing portfolio, the Bank makes
a specific provision based on an assessment of the credit impairment, or incurred
loss, on each loan. At the end of 2006, the

loss on impaired loans in the non-sovereign
portfolio decreased to UA 15.40 million
as a comparison to UA 16.10 million in
2005.

In addition to lending, the Bank may make
equity investments in private sector projects,
either directly or through investment funds.
To the extent possible, equity investments
are carried at fair value. In cases where an
equity investment that is not fair valued
is assessed as potentially non-performing,
the Bank may make a provision based
on accepted impairment tests measured
against the Bank's carrying cost. At the end
of 2006, the average provisioning rate for
equity investments in private sector was
equivalent to 6.24% of the outstanding
equity portfolio.

Counterparty Credit Risk

n the normal course of its business, the Bank
utilizes various financial instruments to meet
he needs of its borrowers, to manage its
exposure to fluctuations in market interest
and currency rates, and to temporarily invest
its liquidity prior to disbursement. All of these
inancial instruments involve, to varying
degrees, the risk that the counterparty in
he transaction may be unable to meet its
obligation to the Bank.

=

a

=

Reflecting a preference for minimizing
exposure to counterparty credit risk, the
Bank maintains eligibility criteria that limit
he Bank's financial operations to counerparties with the very best credit ratings.
For example, the minimum rating of counerparties for non collateralized derivative instruments is AA- or the equivalent,
while in 2006, the Bank enabled derivative
counterparties with a rating of no less than
A-, but only when any material transaction
exposure is fully collateralized.

 

 

In addition to these stringent rating stand
ards, the Bank operates a framework of
exposure limits based on the counterparty
credit rating and size subject to a maximum
of 8% of the Bank's total risk capital for
any single counterparty. Individual counterparty credit exposures are aggregated
across all instruments using the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) potential
future exposure methodology and monitored regularly against the Bank's credit
limits after considering the benefits of any
collateral. As a rule, the Bank executes
an ISDA master agreement and netting
agreement with its derivative counterparties prior to undertaking any transactions.
As shown below, the estimated potential
counterparty credit exposure of the investment and derivative portfolios continues to
be predominantly AA or higher.

he Bank maintains a conservative risk capi‘al cushion for counterparty credit risks as
per the current BIS standards. At the end of
2006, the Bank's counterparty credit portfoio including all investments and derivative
instruments required as risk capital just over
2.2% of the Bank's total on-balance sheet
tisk capital sources. This is a minor change
rom 1.9% in 2005.

 

Liquidity Risk

As a long-term development lender, the
Bank holds sufficient liquid assets to secure
he continuity of normal operations even in

 

African Development Bank Chapter 006

the unlikely event that it is unable to obtain
fresh resources from the capital markets for
an extended period of time. To achieve this
objective, the Bank computes a prudential
minimum level of liquidity based on the
projected net cash requirement for a rolling
one-year period. The prudential minimum
level of liquidity is updated quarterly and
includes all potential debt service payments due to early redemption of swaps
and borrowings with embedded options.
To enable the Bank to take advantage of
low-cost funding opportunities as they
arise, the Bank's policy permits a judicious
increase of liquid resources where there is
an economic benefit. Throughout 2006, the
level of liquid assets remained well above
the minimum prescribed by the Bank's

liquidity policy.

To strike the optimal balance between
generating adequate investment returns
and holding securities that can be easily
sold for cash, if required, the Bank divides
its investment portfolio into tranches with
different liquidity objectives and benchmarks. The Bank's core liquidity portfolio is
invested in relatively liquid securities that
can be readily sold, if required. In addition
to the core portfolio, the Bank maintains a
second tranche of liquidity that is always
invested in the most highly liquid securities
to cover its expected operational cash flow
needs. Probable redemptions of swaps and
borrowings with embedded options are
included in the computation of the size of

the operational tranche of liquidity. A third
tranche of liquidity, which is funded by the
Bank's equity resources, is held in a portfolio of fixed income securities designated
as “held-to-maturity” investments (HTM).
Only HTM investments with a remaining
maturity of one year or less are considered
as liquid investments against the Bank's
minimum liquidity requirements.

Currency Risk

The agreement establishing the Bank explicitly prohibits it from taking direct currency
exchange exposures by requiring liabilities
in any one currency (after swap activities)
to be matched with assets in the same currency. This is achieved primarily by holding
or lending the proceeds of its borrowings
in the same currencies in which they were
borrowed (after swap activities). To avoid
creating new currency mismatches, the
Bank requires its borrowers to service their
loans in the currencies disbursed®.

Because a large part of its balance sheet
is funded by equity resources, which are
denominated in Units of Account (equivalent to the SDR), the Bank has a net asset
position that is potentially exposed to
translation risk when currency exchange
rates fluctuate. The Bank's policy is to
minimize the potential fluctuation of the
value of its net worth measured in Units
of Account by matching, to the extent possible, the currency composition of its net
assets with the currency basket of the SDR.
In line with this policy, throughout 2006
the Bank's currency alignment was adjusted within a tight band of the risk-neutral
position in each of the currencies making up the SDR composition. The revised
International Monetary Fund's (IMF) SDR
basket took effect from January 1, 2006.
In keeping with the Bank's currency risk
management policy, currency transactions
were carried out in early 2006 to realign

the net assets to the revised SDR basket.
During 2006, despite sharp movements in
the values of the major currencies during
the year, the Bank registered only a minor
change in translation adjustments of less
than 0.25% of net assets.

The distribution of the currencies of the
Bank's recurring administrative expenditures shows a high concentration of
expenses in Euros, USD and Tunisian Dinar.
For 2006, the Bank’s strategy of purchasing currencies in the forward market to
cover the estimated currency composition
of expenses during the year mitigated the
unfavorable impact of those currencies
movements during the year.

Interest Rate Risk
The Bank's exposure to interest rate risk
can be traced to two principal sources:
1) the interest rate sensitivity of the net
interest margin between the rate the Bank
earns on its assets and the cost of the
borrowings funding those assets; and 2)
the interest rate sensitivity of the interest margin the Bank earns on the assets
funded by its equity resources. The Bank's
principal interest rate risk management
objective is to generate a stable overall
net interest margin’. It is understood that
as an inevitable part of managing interest
rate risk, the strategies that would help to
stabilize the Bank's net interest margin on
the longer duration equity backed portfolio
would often lead to increased volatility of
the economic value of the Bank's equity on
a mark-to-market basis.

 

 

Assets Funded By Debt

Over half of the Bank's interest-rate-sensitive assets are funded by debt. The Bank
seeks to generate a stable net interest margin on assets funded by debt by matching
the interest rate characteristics of each class
of assets with those of the corresponding
liabilities.

In 1990, the Bank began offering “varile rate loans” whose interest rate resets
semi-annually based on the average cost of
dedicated pool of the Bank's borrowings.
ese pools are funded with a mix of fixed
rate and floating rate borrowings to provide
borrowers with broadly stable interest rates
at gradually track changes in market interest rates. The cost of funds pass-through
formulation, incorporated in the lending rates
arged on the Bank's pool-based loans, has
traditionally helped to minimize the interest
rate sensitivity of the net interest margin
on this part of its loan portfolio. In view of
eclining demand for this product in favor
of market-based loans, the Bank is carefully
managing the gradual winding down of the
lesignated funding pools.

The Bank also offers fixed and floating
rate loans whose interest rate is directly
linked to market interest rates. For the
market-based loan products, the Bank’s net
interest margin is preserved by using swaps
to align the interest rate sensitivity of the
loans with that of the Bank's underlying
funding (six-month Libor floating rate). The
Bank may also provide borrowers with risk
management products such as swaps to
modify the currency and interest rate terms
of its market-based loan products. Although
it prefers to retain the credit risks, the Bank
safeguards the intermediation fee it earns
on risk management products by simultaneously laying off the market risks with an
approved derivative counterparty.

 

For the portfolio of liquid assets funded by
borrowings, the Bank protects its net interest margin by managing its investments
within duration mismatch limits around
benchmarks that replicate the interest rate
characteristics of the underlying funding
for each portfolio tranche. The portfolio
of liquid assets funded by borrowings

 

®To facilitate loan repayment for its borrowers that may not have easy access to certain currencies, the Bank provides currency exchange services on an agency basis.
7A net interest margin that is not overly sensitive to sharp changes in market interest rates yet adequately responsive to general market trends.

Annual Report 2006is currently divided into two tranches to
reflect the different business purposes and
underlying funding. The core part of the
investment portfolio is held to comply with
he Bank's liquidity policy and uses a sixmonth Libor floating rate benchmark. The
operational liquidity portfolio is managed
‘© meet projected operational cash flow
needs and uses a one-month Libor floating
rate benchmark.

he Bank diversifies the sources of its funding by issuing debt in a variety of markets
and instruments. Unless fixed rate funding
is required for one of its pool-based loan
roducts, the Bank protects its net interest
margin by simultaneously swapping all new
jorrowings into floating rates in one of
he Bank's active currencies on a standard
six-month Libor rate reference. Where the
Bank issues debt with embedded options,
he Bank simultaneously enters into a
swap with matching terms to synthetically
create the desired six-month Libor-based
loating rate funding. For risk management
urposes, callable funding is considered
as one alternative to issuing short-term
debt such as Euro Commercial Paper. The
Bank manages refinancing risk by limiting
he amount of debt that will mature or is
potentially callable within one year to 25%
of the outstanding debt portfolio.

Assets Funded by Equity
he second principal source of interest rate
tisk is the interest rate sensitivity of the
income earned from funding a significant portion of the Bank's assets with equity resources.
Changes in market interest rates in the currencies of the Bank's equity resources (the
SDR) affect the net interest margin earned on
assets funded by equity resources. In general,
lower nominal market interest rates result in
lower lending and investment rates, which in
the long-term, reduce the nominal earnings
on the Bank's equity resources.

 

 

The Bank manages the interest rate profile
of the assets funded by equity resources with

the objective of reducing the sensitivity of the
net interest margin to fluctuations in market
interest rates. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the repricing profile of the
assets funded by the Bank's equity resources
(fixed rate loans and investments) to match
a re-pricing profile benchmark. The Bank's
re-pricing profile benchmark is a 10-year
ladder whereby a uniform 10% of the Bank's
assets funded by equity re-price in each year.
Using this benchmark, the Bank’s net interest
margin on assets funded by equity tends to
track a ten-year moving average of 10-year
maturity SDR interest rates. At the end of
2006, the Bank's overall repricing profile was
closely aligned to the benchmark in almost
all annual buckets. For net assets re-pricing
within one year, the Bank had a manageable
gap relative to the benchmark.

n addition to these two principal sources
of interest rate risk, the Bank is exposed
‘0 prepayment risk on the parts of its loan
portfolio issued before 1997. Although the
Bank is unable to charge a prepayment
penalty on these older loans, in practice
he level of prepayments has generally been
within acceptable levels. In 2003 and 2004,
owever, driven by low market interest rates,
contracting credit spreads for emerging maret borrowers and enhanced debt management by several sovereign borrowers, total
loan prepayments increased sharply to UA
471 million and UA 542 million respectively.
n 2005, with the reversal in the market
interest rates, prepayments of pre-1997
loans declined sharply to UA 70 million. For
all market-based loans issued since 1997,
he Bank protects itself from prepayment
tisk by linking the prepayment penalty to
he cost of redeploying the funds at current market rates. In 2005, prepayments of
market-based floating rate loans amounted
‘0 UA 192 million. While in 2006, the total
prepayment reached UA 298.14 million, of
which 79% were market based loans.

 

 

Operational Risk
The Bank, like all financial institutions,

African Development Bank Chapter O06

is exposed to many types of operational
risks including all aspects of risk-related
exposure other than those falling within the
scope of credit and market risk including
specifically the risk of loss resulting from
inadequate or failed internal processes,
people and systems or from external events
and reputational risk.

n the past, the Bank Group has relied
almost exclusively upon internal controls
within departments, although not necessarily identified as managing operational risk,
or its internal controls and operational risk
management. The evolving best practice is
‘or specific structures and methods to be
dedicated for managing and coordinating
operational risks. The Internal Control Unit
(ICU) was approved by the AfDB Board of
Directors in 2004 to meet the requirement
of these challenges in line with the evolving
est practices.

Controls and Operational risks exist and
impact broadly across many aspects of
he Bank with a risk of operational losses
potentially arising in many activities, funcions and departments. There are also many
interdependencies among risk factors that
may result in an operational risk loss.

 

As a first step towards the implementation
of an effective operational risk management framework, the ICU commenced the
implementation of the COSO framework
of integrated internal control in September
2005. The first phase of the implementation,
which focused on controls around financial
reporting, was completed at the end 2006.

Management's report regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over external financial reporting is included in this report.

There are other initiatives or activities in
the other areas of the Bank Group that
are complementing the operational risk
management and controls including:

Risk Management Process

The processes and procedures by which the
Bank manages its risk profile continually
evolve as its activities change in response to
market, credit, product, and other developments. The highest level of risk management
is assured by the Bank's Board of Executive
Directors, which is chaired by the President.
In addition to approving all risk management policies, the Executive Directors regularly review trends in the Bank's risk profiles
and performance to ensure compliance
with those policies. An independent risk
management team supports the Bank's risk
management process.

The asset and liability management committee (ALCO) is the Bank's most senior
management forum on risk management
issues. ALCO is chaired by the Vice President,
Finance and meets at least monthly to
perform its oversight role. Among its key
functions, the committee reviews regular
and ad-hoc finance and risk management
reports and projections, approves strategies
to adjust the balance sheet, and confirms
country and project credit risk ratings and
the associated expected/incurred loss estimates. ALCO is supported by seven standing
working groups that report to the committee
on specific risk management issues. These
working groups cover country risk, commercial credit risk, interest rate risk, currency
risk, financial projections, financial products
and services, and operational risk.

 

Day-to-day operational responsibility for
implementing the Bank's risk management
policies and guidelines is delegated to the
appropriate business units.

Annual Report 2006

Financial Results

In 2006, the Bank changed its accounting
treatment for transfers approved by the Board
of Governors. These transfers, which are made
to organizations, funds and institutions for
purposes congruent with the Bank's mission,
were previously presented as direct reductions
of equity. Under the new accounting treatment, these transfers are treated as grants and
reported as expenses in the Income Statement.
This accounting change is described in greater
detail in Note C to the Bank's audited financial statements. This accounting change has
been applied retrospectively, resulting in the
restatement of previously published financial
statements. While the accounting change did
not affect the balance of the Bank's reserves
at December 31, 2005 or the Bank’s overall
financial position, it did reduce reported net
income for 2005 from UA 221.32 million
previously published to a restated amount of
UA 77.32 million, reflecting the UA 144.00
million of transfers approved by the Board of
Governors in 2005. Since net income is now
a function of distribution decisions, “Income
before transfers approved by the Board of
Governors” is separately disclosed on the
income statement, to highlight income from
operations.

The highlights of the Bank's financial
performance in 2006 include the following:

¢ Income before transfers approved by the
Board of Governors decreased by 12.33
percent from UA 221.32 million in 2005 to
UA 194.03 million in 2006. The decrease
is attributable to an increase in provisions
for impairment of loan principal and
charges receivable from a net write-back
of UA 13.85 million in 2005 to a charge
of UA 51.69 million in 2006, as well as a
UA 35.50 million increase in impairment
charges relating to equity investments
primarily caused by a write-down of

the ADB's investment in the ADF, which
was in turn the result of the write-off of
a significant portion of the ADF's loan
portfolio under the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (see note T-2 (iv) to the Bank’s
audited financial statements). These effects
were partially offset by a UA 55.29 million
increase in unrealized gains on borrowings-related financial instruments.

Loan income increased by UA 4.80 million,
or 1.48 percent, in 2006. The increase
in loan income was caused by a higher
lending rate on USD floating rate loans
during 2006. Investment income increased
in 2006 by UA 58.45 million, or 37.62
percent, as a result of higher average
investment balances and higher yields,
but the increase was more than offset by
a UA 63.43 million increase in interest and
amortized issuance costs and net interest
on borrowing-related derivatives.

The Bank continues to maintain a strong
tisk-bearing capacity. Total reserves plus
accumulated loss provisions on outstanding loan principal and charges at
December 31, 2006 were UA 2.74 billion,
up from UA 2.66 billion at December 31,
2005. As a percentage of gross loans
and loan income and charges receivable,
reserves plus loss provisions on loan principal and charges increased from 44.73
percent at December 31, 2005 to 47.72
percent at December 31, 2006.

The number of sovereign borrowers in
arrears for six months or more decreased
from 8 at December 31, 2005 to 6 at
December 31, 2006. However, a total
impairment provision of UA 51.69 million on loan principal and charges was
recorded during 2006, primarily because
of an increase in the estimated time
in default for a sovereign borrower in
arrears. This loss provision compares to
a net write-back of UA 13.85 million in2005. The total accumulated provision
‘or losses on principal and charges at
December 31, 2006 was UA 436.77
million, which was 7.60 percent of gross
principal and charges receivable at that
date, up from UA 392.38 million at
December 31, 2005, or 6.60 percent of
gross principal and charges receivable.

Administrative expenses, net of reimursement by the ADF and the NTF for
heir share of such expenses, decreased
y UA 4.82 million from UA 41.68 million
in 2005 to UA 36.86 million in 2006. The
decrease was caused by a reduced share
of administrative expenses allocated to
he Bank pursuant to a predetermined
cost-sharing formula among the Bank,
he ADF and the NTF, which is driven
rimarily by the relative levels of certain
operational volume indicators. Total Bank
group administrative expenses decreased
marginally from UA 155.69 million in
2005 to UA 154.34 million in 2006.

 

For the past several years, the Bank has
earned levels of net income sufficient to
enable not only the further strengthening
of the Bank's reserves position, but also
contributions on behalf of its shareholders to other development initiatives for
Africa. In 2006, the Board of Governors
approved transfers of UA 139.20 million
to various development initiatives in
Africa. These transfers included UA 67.30
million to the special fund for postconflict assistance to the Democratic
Republic of Congo, UA 21.30 million to
the ADF, UA 10.60 million to the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative,
UA 15.00 million to the Special Relief
Fund, and UA 25.00 million to the PostConflict Countries Facility (PCCF).

As mentioned above, in 2006 the Bank
began expensing transfers approved by the
Board of Governors, rather than recording

them directly in equity. Since these transfers
are a function of distribution decisions
taken by the Board of Governors and are
not operating items, the Bank focuses
on “income before transfers approved by
Board of Governors” as its most relevant
indicator of operating performance.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP

 

. . Date: March 30, 2007
Management's Report Regarding Effectiveness

of Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting

The Management of the African Development Bank Group (“The Bank Group”) is responsible for the preparation, fair presentation and overall
integrity of its published financial statements. The financial statements for the African Development Bank and the Nigeria Trust Fund have been
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, while
those of the African Development Fund were prepared on a special purpose basis.

he financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting firm that was given unrestricted access to all financial records and
related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Boards of Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes that all representations made to the external auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate. The external auditors’ report accompanies the audited
inancial statements.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over external financial reporting in conformity with the
asis of accounting. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms and actions that are taken to correct deficiencies identified.
internal controls for external financial reporting are subject to scrutiny and testing by management and internal audit and are revised as considered
necessary. Management believes that such controls support the integrity and reliability of the financial statements.

here are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
or overriding of controls. Accordingly, an effective internal control system can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance with
respect to financial statements. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an internal control system can change with circumstances.

he Bank Group's Boards of Directors have appointed an Audit and Finance Committee (AUFI) to assist the Boards, among other things, in their
oversight responsibility for the soundness of the Bank Group's accounting policies and practices and the effectiveness of internal controls. AUFI,
which is comprised entirely of members of the Board of Directors, oversees the process for the selection of external auditors and makes recommendation for such selection to the Board of Directors who in turn makes recommendation for approval to the Board of Governors. AUF! meets
eriodically with management to review and monitor matters of financial, accounting or auditing significance.

he Bank's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls was based on the framework provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). On the basis of the work performed, Management asserts that, as at December 31, 2006, the Bank Group
maintained effective internal controls over its financial reporting as contained in the Financial Statements for 2006.

 

he Office of the Auditor General (OAGL) has reviewed the Bank’s assessment described above and has concluded that there are no material
weaknesses that could affect the reliability of the 2006 financial statements.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

NOTE A- OPERATIONS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS

The African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) is a multilateral development finance institution dedicated to the economic and social
progress of its regional member states. The Bank finances development projects and programs in its regional member states, typically
in co-operation with other national or international development institutions. In furtherance of this objective, the Bank participates in
the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to such development and, where necessary, provides technical assistance.
The Bank also promotes investments of public and private capital in projects and programs designed to contribute to the economic and
social progress of the regional member states. The activities of the Bank are complemented by those of the African Development Fund
(ADF or the Fund), which was established by the Bank and certain countries; and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), which is a special fund
administered by the Bank. Notably, the ADB, ADF, and NTF each have separate and distinct assets and liabilities. There is no recourse to
the ADB for obligations in respect of any of the ADF or NTF liabilities. The ADF was established to assist the Bank in contributing to the
economic and social development of the Bank's regional members, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly
among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms for such purposes.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Bank’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by the
International Accounting Standards Board. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for
certain financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value.

The significant accounting policies employed by the Bank are summarized below.

Revenue recognition

Interest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest rate for the time such instrument is outstanding
and held by the Bank. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of
the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount.

Income from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading financial instruments.
Dividends relating to investments in equity are recognized when the Bank’s right to receive payment is established.

Functional and presentation currencies

Although the Bank conducts its operations in the currencies of its member countries, as a result of the application of IAS 21 revised, “The
Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, the Bank prospectively changed its functional currency from the currencies of all its member
countries to the Unit of Account (UA) effective January 1, 2005. The UA is also the currency in which the financial statements are presented.
The value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Agreement) as equivalent to one
Special Drawing Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

Currency translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are
translated into UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated into UA at historical rates.
Translation differences are included in the determination of net income. Capital subscriptions are recorded in UA at the rates prevailing
at the time of receipt. The translation difference relating to payments of capital subscriptions is reported in the financial statements
as the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS). This is composed of the difference between the UA amount at the
predetermined rate and the UA amount using the rate at the time of receipt. When currencies are converted into other currencies, the
resulting gains or losses are included in the determination of net income.

Annual Report 2006

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

Member Countries’ Subscriptions

Although the Agreement establishing the ADB allows for a member country to withdraw from the Bank, no member has ever withdrawn
its membership voluntarily, nor has any indicated to the Bank that it intends to do so. Moreover, there is a significant financial disincentive
to withdrawing membership. The stability in the membership reflects the fact that the members are independent African and non-African
countries, and that the purpose of the Bank is to contribute to the sustainable economic development and social progress of its regional
member countries individually and jointly.

In the unlikely event of a withdrawal by a member, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of the former member's shares. The Bank
may partially or fully offset amounts due for shares purchased against the member's liabilities on loans and guarantees due to the Bank.
The repurchase price of the shares is the value shown by the books of the Bank on the date the country ceases to be a member, hereafter
referred to as “the termination date”. The former member would remain liable for direct obligations and contingent liabilities to the Bank
for so long as any parts of the loans or guarantees contracted before the termination date are outstanding.

Were a member to withdraw, the Bank may set the dates in respect of payments for shares repurchased. If, for example, paying a former
member would have adverse consequences for the Bank's financial position, the Bank could defer payment until the risk had passed, and
indefinitely if appropriate. Further, shares that become unsubscribed for any reason may be offered by the Bank for purchase by eligible
member countries, based on the share transfer rules approved by the Board of Governors. In any event, no payments shall be made
until six months after the termination date. If the Bank were to terminate its operations within six months of the termination date, all
liabilities of the Bank would first be settled out of the assets of the Bank and then, if necessary, out of members’ callable capital, before
any distribution could be made to any member country, including the withdrawing member.

 

If at a date subsequent to the termination date, it becomes evident that losses may not have been sufficiently taken into account when
the repurchase price was determined, the former member may be required to pay, on demand, the amount by which the repurchase price
of the shares would have been reduced had the losses been taken into account when the repurchase price was determined. In addition,
the former member remains liable on any call, subsequent to the termination date, for unpaid subscriptions, to the extent that it would
have been required to respond if the impairment of capital had occurred and the call had been made at the time the repurchase price
of its shares was determined.

Employee benefits

1) Pension obligations

The Bank operates a contributory defined benefit pension plan for its employees. The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP) provides benefit
payments to participants upon retirement. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an
employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. An
actuarial valuation of the cost of providing benefits for the SRP is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Upon reaching
retirement age, pension is calculated based on the average remuneration for the final three years of pensionable service and the pension is subject to annual inflationary adjustments. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in retained earnings in the year
they occur. Past service cost is recognized immediately to the extent that benefits are already vested, and otherwise, is amortized on a
straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. The pension liability is recognized as part of other accounts
payable in the balance sheet. The liability represents the present value of the Bank's defined benefit obligations, net of the fair value of
plan assets and unrecognized actuarial gains and losses.

2) Post-employment medical benefits

The Bank operates a contributory defined Medical Benefit Plan (MBP), which provides post-employment healthcare benefits to eligible
former staff, including retirees. Membership of the MBP includes both staff and retirees of the Bank. The entitlement to the post-retirement
healthcare benefit is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum
service period. The expected costs of these benefits derive from contributions from plan members as well as the Bank and are accrued
over the period of employment and during retirement. Contributions by the Bank to the MBP are charged to expenses and included in
the statement of income and expenses. The MBP Board, an independent Board created by the Bank, determines the adequacy of the
contributions and is authorized to recommend changes to the contribution rates of both the Bank and plan members.

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized on the Bank's balance sheet when the Bank assumes related contractual rights
or obligations.

1) Financial assets

The Bank classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables;
held-to-maturity investments; and available-for-sale financial assets. Management determines the classification of its investments at
initial recognition.

i) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
All trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. The investments in the trading portfolio are acquired
principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as held-for-trading.

ii) Loans and receivables
The Bank has classified demand obligations, accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts
as receivables. Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Bank provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. Accrued income and receivables include accrued interest on derivatives.

iii) Held-to-maturity investments
The Bank has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative
financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Bank’s management has the positive intention
and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortized cost.

iv) Available-for-sale financial assets
The Bank has classified equity investments over which it does not have control or significant influence as available-for-sale. Availablefor-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and may or may not be sold in the future.

v) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon
acquisition of three months or less.

Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale investments are
recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Bank commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when
cash is advanced to the borrowers. Financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value
plus transaction costs. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or
where the Bank has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Loans and receivables as well as held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Availablefor-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value. Gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the
period in which they arise. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized
directly in equity, until the financial asset is derecognized or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in
equity is recognized in profit or loss. Accrued interest on financial assets is included in other accounts receivable.

Annual Report 2006

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

2) Financial liabilities

i) Borrowings
In the ordinary course of its business, the Bank borrows funds in the major capital markets for lending and liquidity purposes. The
Bank issues debt instruments denominated in various currencies, with differing maturities at fixed or variable interest rates. The Bank's
borrowing strategy is driven by three major factors, namely: timeliness in meeting cash flow requirements, optimizing asset and liability
management with the objective of mitigating exposure to financial risks, and providing cost-effective funding. In addition to long
and medium-term borrowings, the Bank also undertakes short-term borrowing for cash and liquidity management purposes only.
Borrowings not designated at fair value through profit or loss are carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost with interest expense
determined using the effective interest method. When these borrowings contain embedded derivatives that require bifurcation, the
embedded derivatives are separated from the borrowing contract and carried on the balance sheet at fair value. Borrowing expenses
are recognized in profit or loss and include the amortization of issuance costs, discounts and premiums, which is determined using
the effective interest method. The unamortized balance of the issuance costs is netted off against borrowings in the balance sheet.
Certain of the Bank’s borrowings have been obtained from the governments of some member countries of the Bank and are interest
free. In accordance with IAS 20 — "Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance”, the benefit of
borrowing at subsidized rates from member countries’ governments has not been recognized through the imputation of interest
expense in the financial statements.

ii) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial liabilities held-for-trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss
at inception. Derivatives are categorized as held-for-trading. The Bank primarily applies fair value designation to borrowings which
have been swapped into floating-rate debt using derivative contracts. In these cases, the designation of the borrowing at fair value
through profit or loss is made in order to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch which would otherwise have arisen if the
borrowings were carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost while the related swaps are carried on the balance sheet at fair
value.

iii) Other liabilities
All financial liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at fair value through profit or loss are recorded at amortized cost. The
amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable.

Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are discharged or cancelled or when they expire.

Derivatives

The Bank uses derivative instruments in its portfolios for asset/liability management, cost reduction, risk management and hedging purposes. These instruments include currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The derivatives on borrowings are used to modify the interest
rate or currency characteristics of the borrowings portfolio linked to the related borrowings at inception, and remain so throughout the
terms of the contracts. The interest component of these derivatives is disclosed as borrowing cost over the life of the derivative contract
and included in the income statement.

Although IAS 39 allows special hedge accounting for certain qualifying hedging relationships, the application of such special hedge
accounting criteria does not make fully evident the asset/liability and risk management strategy of the Bank and would result in inconsistent
treatment of similar hedged instruments. Therefore, the Bank has elected not to designate any qualifying hedging relationships, but rather
classifies all derivatives as held-for-trading at fair value, with all changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.

Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other non-financial host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with
unrealized gains or losses reported in profit or loss. Such derivatives are stripped from the host contract and measured at fair value with
unrealized gains and losses reported in profit or loss.

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

Impairment of financial assets

1) Assets carried at amortized cost

The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Bank determines that no
objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financial assets
with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for
which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. A financial asset
or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as
a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that loss event (or events) has
an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Objective
evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable data that comes to the attention of the Bank.

if the Bank determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
carried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount
and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the
inancial asset's original effective interest rate. For sovereign-guaranteed loans, the estimated impairment arises from delays that may be
experienced in receiving amounts due. For non-sovereign-guaranteed loans, the impairment reflects management's best estimate of the
non-collectibility, in whole or in part, of amounts due as well as delays in the receipt of such amounts.

he carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in the
income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment
loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.

nterest and charges are accrued on all loans including those in arrears.

2) Available-for-sale assets

he Bank assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. For available-for-sale equity instruments carried at fair value, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security
elow its cost is considered in determining whether the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale equity
instruments carried at fair value, the cumulative loss, which is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current
air value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognized in profit or loss is reclassified from equity to profit or
loss in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in the income statement on available-for-sale equity instruments carried at
air value are reversed through equity.

f there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on an available-for-sale equity instrument that is carried at cost
ecause its fair value cannot be reliably measured, the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying
amount of the impaired instrument and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the instrument discounted at the current
market rate of return for a similar equity instrument. Once recognized, impairment losses on these equity instruments carried at cost are
not reversed.

 

Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset
the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair value disclosure

The fair values of quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For financial assets with inactive markets or unlisted
securities, the Bank establishes fair value by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data inputs. These
include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques
commonly used by market participants. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been valued
using methodologies and assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such

Annual Report 2006

ng120

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not readily determinable.
Management believes that these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable, however, the values actually realized in a sale might
be different from the fair values disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Borrowings: The fair values of the Bank's borrowings are based on market quotations when possible or valuation techniques based on
discounted cash flow models using LIBOR market-determined discount curves adjusted by the Bank’s credit spread. Credit spreads are
obtained from market data as well as indicative quotations received from certain counterparties for the Bank's new public bond issues.
The Bank also uses systems based on industry standard pricing models and valuation techniques to value borrowings and their associated
derivatives. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. Valuation
models are subject to internal and periodic external reviews.

Equity investments: The underlying assets of entities in which the Bank has equity investments carried at fair value are periodically fair
valued both by fund managers and independent valuation experts using market practices. The fair value of investments in listed enterprises is based on the latest available quoted bid prices. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities is assessed using appropriate
methods, for example, discounted cash flows. The fair value of the Bank's equity participations is estimated as the Bank's percentage
ownership of the net asset value of the funds.

Derivative financial instruments: The fair values of derivative financial instruments are based on market quotations when possible or
valuation techniques that use market estimates of cash flows and discount rates. The Bank also uses tools based on industry standard
pricing models and valuation techniques to value derivative financial instruments. The models use market-sourced inputs such as interest
rates, yield curves, exchange rates and option volatilities. All financial models used for valuing the Bank’s financial instruments are subject
to both internal and periodic external reviews.

Loans: The Bank does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the expected cash flows of these loans. For
multi-currency and single currency fixed rate loans, fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end
variable lending rate in that currency, adjusted for impairment. For all loans not impaired, fair value adjustments are made to reflect
expected loan losses. The estimated fair value of loans is disclosed in Note G.

Day one profit and loss

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received). A gain or loss may only be recognized on initial recognition of a financial instrument if the fair value of that
instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. On initial recognition,
a gain or loss may not be recognized when using a valuation technique that does not incorporate data solely from observable markets.
The Bank only recognizes gains or losses after initial recognition to the extent that they arise from a change in a factor (including time)
that market participants would consider in setting a price. The gain or loss is amortized over the life of the applicable borrowing on a
straight-line basis.

Investment in associate

Under IAS 28, “Investments in Associates”, the ADF is considered an associate of the Bank. An associate is an entity over which the Bank
has significant influence, but not control, over the entity's financial and operating policy decisions. The relationship between the Bank and

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

the ADF is described in more detail in Note H. IAS 28 requires that the equity method be used to account for investments in associates.
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized at cost and the carrying amount is increased or decreased
to recognize the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition. The investor's share of the profit or loss
of the investee is recognized in the investor's income statement. The subscriptions by the Bank to the capital of the ADF occurred between
1974 and 1990. At December 31, 2006, such subscriptions cumulatively represented approximately 1% of the economic interest in the
capital of the ADF. Although ADF is a not-for-profit entity and has never distributed any dividend to its subscribers since its creation in
1972, the revisions to IAS 28 require that the equity method be used to account for the Bank’s investment in the ADF. Further, in accordance with IAS 36, the net investment in the ADF is assessed for impairment. Cumulative losses as measured under the equity method
are limited to the investments original cost as the ADB has not guaranteed any potential losses of the ADF.

Retained earnings
Retained earnings of the Bank consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior year's income, unallocated current year net income
and expenses recognized directly in equity as required by IFRS.

Property and equipment

Property and equipment is measured at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the
acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate,
only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Bank and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement when they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to amortize the difference between
cost and estimated residual values over estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

- Buildings: 15-20 years

- Fixtures and fittings: 6-10 years
Furniture and equipment: 3-7 years
Motor vehicles: 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if appropriate. Assets that are subject to amortization
are reviewed annually for impairment. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's
carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs
to sell and its value in use. Gains and losses on disposal are determined as the difference between proceeds and the asset's carrying
amount and are included in the income statement in the period of disposal.

Intangible assets
Intangible assets include computer systems software and are stated at historical cost less amortization. Amortization on intangible assets
is calculated using the straight-line method over 3-5 years.

Leases

The Bank has entered into several operating lease agreements, including those for its offices in Tunisia and in certain regional member
countries. Under such agreements, all the risks and benefits of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor. Payments made under
operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and receivable
as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When an operating lease
is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payment required to be made to the lessor by way of penalty is recognized as an
expense in the period in which the termination takes place.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significant
judgments and estimates are summarized below:

1) Impairment losses on loans and advances

At each financial reporting date, the Bank reviews its loan portfolios for impairment. The Bank first assesses whether objective evidence
of impairment exists for individual loans. If such objective evidence exists, impairment is determined by discounting expected future
cash flows using the loan’s original effective interest rate and comparing this amount to the loan’s net carrying amount. Determining
the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans requires significant judgment. If the Bank determines that no objective
evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed loan, that loan is included in a group of loans with similar credit characteristics
and collectively assessed for impairment. Objective evidence of impairment for a group of loans may include observable data indicating
that there has been an adverse change in the payment status of borrowers in a group, or national or local economic conditions that
correlate with defaults on assets in the group. Management uses estimates based on historical loss experience for assets with credit
risk characteristics and objective evidence of impairment similar to those in the portfolio when scheduling its future cash flows. The
methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amount and timing of future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce
any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experience.

2) Fair value of financial instruments

he fair value of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets is determined by using valuation techniques. Where valuation
echniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel
independent of the area that created them. All models are calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual data and relevant market prices.
o the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk (both own and counterparty), volatilities and
correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of
inancial instruments.

3) Impairment of available-for-sale equity investments

he Bank determines that available-for-sale equity investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in
air value below the carrying amount. The determination of what is significant or prolonged requires judgment. In making this judgment,
he Bank evaluates any evidence of a deterioration in the financial health of the investee, industry and sector performance, changes in
echnology, and operational and financing cash flows.

4) Held-to-maturity investments

he Bank follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturity as held-to-maturity. This classification requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, the Bank evaluates its intention
and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

 

NOTE C - CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

1) Change in accounting treatment for transfers of income approved by the Board of Governors

In the current year, the Bank changed its accounting treatment for the transfers of income approved by the Board of Governors. Article 42
of the Agreement establishing the Bank authorizes the Board of Governors to distribute part of the net income of the Bank after making
provision for reserves. In prior years and in the exercise of the above provision of the Agreement, the Bank after approval by its shareholders
at its annual general meetings has made transfers from its annual net income to organizations and institutions for purposes congruent with
the Bank's mission. Previously, the Bank accounted for such transfers from net income similar to dividends and reported them as reduction
in equity. This previous accounting for the transfers of income approved by the Board of Governors placed emphasis on the role of the

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

Governors acting on behalf of shareholders and viewed as being constructively a transaction with owners. In effect, the Bank viewed these
transactions as being equivalent to distributions whereby the shareholders constructively received these funds and simultaneously agreed
to contribute them to the designated recipient. The Bank effected the distributions via transfers to the designated recipients. This accounting
reflected the shareholders’ view of the substance and intent of these transfers and had been consistently applied over the years.

Description of the change in accounting treatment

In the light of the increasing frequency of these transfers and varying nature of recipients, the Bank has re-evaluated its accounting
treatment of these types of transactions and determined that effective in 2006 all distributions approved by the Board of Governors
would be reported as expenses within the Income Statement in the year that the distribution is approved.

This change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively and has therefore resulted in the restatement of prior year comparative figures. Net income transfers previously treated as a reduction in reserves in 2005 amounted to UA 144.00 million.

2) New and Revised IFRS
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and its International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued
certain new and revised Standards and Interpretations, which took effect during the year ended December 31, 2006. These were either
inapplicable to the Bank or did not have a material impact on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, a number of new and amended International Financial Reporting Standards and
Interpretations had been promulgated, but will be effective for periods after December 31, 2006. Of these, the two that are most relevant
to the Bank are IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and amendments to IAS 1, “Presentation of Financial Statements” — “Capital
Disclosures”. IFRS 7, which becomes effective for the Bank's financial statements for the period beginning on January 1, 2007, introduces
additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures about exposures to risks arising from financial instruments and how entities manage
those risks. Management is reviewing the additional disclosures that are required starting in 2007 as a result of the implementation of this
standard. The amendments to IAS 1 are also expected to be effective for the 2007 financial statements of the Bank, but are not expected to
have any significant impact on the financial reporting of the Bank. Also, IFRS 8, ‘Operating Segments”, which becomes effective for financial
statements for the period beginning January 1, 2009, replaces the segmental reporting requirements of IAS 14, Segment Reporting. IFRS
8 requires alignment of the segments in the financial statements with those used internally by management in the allocation of resources
and assessing performance. IFRS 8 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Bank's financial statements. None of the other new
and amended standards and interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

 

 

NOTE D - INVESTMENTS

As part of its overall portfolio management strategy, the Bank invests in government and agency obligations, time deposits, asset-backed
securities, secured lending transactions, resale agreements and related financial derivatives including futures, forward contracts, currency
swaps, interest rate swaps, options and short sales.

For government and agency obligations with final maturity longer than 1 year, the Bank may only invest in obligations with counterparties
having a minimum credit rating of AA or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities. For
asset-backed securities, the Bank may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Investments in money market instruments are
restricted to instruments having maturities of not more than 1 year and a minimum credit rating of A. Over-the-counter (OTC) options on
government securities and interest rate products are purchased only if the life of the option contract does not exceed 1 year, and such
transactions are only executed with counterparties with credit ratings of AA- or above. Currency and interest rate swaps including asset
swap transactions are permitted only with approved counterparties or guaranteed by entities with minimum credit ratings of AA-/Aa3
at the time of the transaction.

 

The Bank uses external managers in the management of certain of its liquid assets, in accordance with the Bank's Asset and Liability
Management Guidelines. At December 31, 2006, investments under external management were UA 120.39 million (2005: UA 42.20
million).

Administrative expenses hedge

To insulate the Bank from possible significant increases in administrative expenses that could arise from an appreciation of the principal
currencies of administrative expenditure i.e. EUR, GBP and USD vis-a-vis the UA, the Bank executed forward exchange transactions to
economically hedge its administrative expenses. As at December 31, 2006, there were no open positions with respect to the forward
exchange transactions (2005: nominal value of UA 64.12 million with an unfavorable market value of UA 0.65 million).

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

NOTE F - NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF CAPITAL

Prior to May 1981, all payments in respect of paid-up capital had been made in convertible currencies. However, for the capital increases
authorized in May 1979 (but effective December 1982) and May 1981, regional members had the following two options for making
their payments:

1) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which at least 50 percent is payable in convertible currency and the remainder in local currency;
or

2) Five (5) equal annual installments, of which 20 percent is payable in convertible currency and 80 percent in non-negotiable, noninterest bearing notes. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in installments commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

Non-regional members were required to make their payments solely in convertible currencies.

The paid-up portion of subscriptions, authorized in accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolution B/BG/87/11 relating to the Fourth
General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), is to be paid as follows:

1) Regional members — 50 percent in five (5) equal annual installments in cash in freely convertible currency or freely convertible
currencies selected by the member state, and 50 percent by the deposit of five non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes of equal
value denominated in Units of Account. Such notes are redeemable by the Bank solely in convertible currency in five (5) equal annual
installments commencing on the fifth anniversary of the first subscription payment date.

2) Non-regional members — five (5) equal annual installments in their national currencies, where such currencies are freely convertible or in notes denominated in freely convertible currencies encashable on demand.

Under the Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V), there is no distinction in payment arrangements between regional and non-regional
members. Each member is required to pay for the paid-up portion of its subscribed shares in eight (8) equal and consecutive annual
installments. The first installments shall be paid in cash and in a freely convertible currency. The second to the eighth installments shall
be paid in cash or notes encashable on demand in a freely convertible currency.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the non-negotiable notes balances were as follows:

NOTE G - LOANS

The Bank’s loan portfolio comprises loans granted to, or guaranteed by borrowing member countries as well as certain other non-sovereign guaranteed loans. Amounts disbursed on loans are repayable in the currency or currencies disbursed by the Bank or in other freely
convertible currency or currencies approved by the Bank. The amount repayable in each of these currencies shall be equal to the amount
disbursed in the original currency. Loans are granted for a maximum period of twenty years, including a grace period, which is typically
the period of project implementation. Loans are for the purpose of financing development projects and programs, and are not intended
for sale. Further, management does not believe there is a comparable secondary market for the type of loans made by the Bank.

Annual Report 2006

127128

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

The types of loans currently held by the Bank and the rates charged are described below:

Multi-Currency Fixed Rate Loans: For all loans negotiated prior to July 1, 1990, the Bank charges interest at fixed rates.

Multi-Currency Variable Rate Loans: Between July 1, 1990 and September 30, 1997, the Bank offered variable rate loans to its
borrowers. The variable interest rate is reset twice a year and is based on the Bank’s own cost of qualified borrowing plus 50 basis
oints, resulting in a pass-through of average borrowing costs to borrowers.

Conversion of Multi-Currency Pool-Based Variable Rate Loans: Borrowers were offered the choice to convert the disbursed
and undisbursed amounts of their multi-currency pool-based variable rate to single currency variable terms or retain the terms of
heir existing multi-currency pool-based variable rate loans. The conversion dates were October 1, 1997 and March 1, 1998. The other
erms and conditions of converted loans remained the same as in the original loan agreements. Since October 1, 1997, the Bank
as provided several alternative interest rate mechanisms. In all cases, the applicable rate of interest is the sum of two components,
namely, the chosen base rate plus a lending margin.

Single Currency Variable Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered single currency variable rate loans. The variable
ase rate is the average cost of funding a designated pool of borrowings in each currency and is adjusted semi-annually on January 1
and July 1.

Single Currency Floating Rate Loans: Since October 1, 1997, the Bank has offered LIBOR-based single currency floating rate
loans. The floating base rate is determined for each currency and reset frequency is based on the Bank’s selected reference interest
rate in each market. The Bank's standard floating base rate is the six (6)- month reference rate (USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR, EURIBOR and
IBAR) which is reset semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 and is applicable for the six-month period following the reset date.

Single Currency Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans were reintroduced with effect from October 1997 in the form of single currency

 

ixed rate loans. The fixed rate is computed as the inter-bank swap market rate corresponding to the principal amortization schedule.
Lending Margin: The lending margin is a rate premium expressed as a nominal interest rate added to the Borrower's chosen base rate
to determine the total lending rate. The lending margin determined by the Bank is independent of the base rate chosen, and remains
unchanged throughout the life of the loan. The lending margin for sovereign guaranteed loans is fixed at 40 to 50 basis points. For nonsovereign guaranteed loans, the lending margin is based on the Bank's assessment of the risks inherent in each project.

Guarantees

The Bank may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to the borrowers or other parties for goods and services to be
financed under loan agreements. At December 31, 2006, irrevocable reimbursement guarantees issued by the Bank to commercial banks
on undisbursed loans amounted to UA 8.09 million (2005: nil).

Also, the Bank may provide guarantees for securities issued by an entity eligible for the Bank’s loans. Guarantees are regarded as
outstanding when the borrower incurs the underlying financial obligation and are called when a guaranteed party demands payment under
the guarantee. Guarantees represent potential risk to the Bank if the payments guaranteed for an entity are not made. At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the Bank had no outstanding guarantee to any entity.

NOTE H - EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS

Investment in Associate: ADF

The ADF was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the Bank in contributing to the economic and social development
of African countries, to promote co-operation and increased international trade particularly among the African countries, and to provide
financing on highly concessional terms for such purposes. The Fund's original subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original
State Participants to the ADF Agreement, and State Participants acceding to the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter,
further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of Special General Increases and General Replenishments.

The ADF has a 12-member Board of Directors, made up of 6 members selected by the African Development Bank and 6 members selected
by State Participants. The Fund’s Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund.

To carry out its functions, the Fund utilizes the offices, staff, organization, services and facilities of the Bank, for which it pays a share of

the administrative expenses. The share of administrative expenses paid by the Fund to the Bank is calculated annually on the basis of a

Annual Report 2006

31Chapter 006 African Development Bank

cost-sharing formula, approved by the Board of Directors, which is driven in large part by the number of programs and projects executed
during the year. Based on the cost-sharing formula, the share of administrative expenses incurred by ADF for the year ended December
31, 2006 amounted to UA 114.56 million (2005: UA 111.86 million), representing 71.39 percent (2005: 68.76 percent) of the shareable
administrative expenses incurred by the Bank. The accounts of the ADF are kept separate and distinct from those of the Bank.

Although the ADB by agreement exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF, the Agreement establishing the ADF also
provides that in the event of termination of the ADF's operations, the assets of the Fund shall be distributed pro-rata to its participants
in proportion to the amounts paid-in by them on account of their subscriptions, after settlement of any outstanding claims against the
participants. At December 31, 2006, the Bank's pro-rata or economic share in ADF was 0.93% (2005: 1.01%).

During the year ended December 31, 2006, as a result of the implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative described in note
T-2, the net asset value of ADF declined. Consequently, the Bank recorded an impairment loss of UA 34.75 million on its investment in
the Fund.

Other Equity Participations
The Bank may take equity positions in privately owned productive enterprises and financial intermediaries, public sector companies
that are in the process of being privatized or regional and sub-regional institutions. The Bank's objective in such equity investments is
to promote the economic development of its regional member countries and in particular the development of their private sectors. The
Bank's equity participation is also intended to promote efficient use of resources, promoting African participation, playing a catalytic role
in attracting other investors and lenders and mobilizing the flow of domestic and external resources to financially viable projects, which
also have significant economic merit.

Although the Bank is allowed to take equity positions of up to twenty five percent (25%) the Bank currently holds less than 20% of the
total equity capital of each institution in which it participates. The Bank therefore does not seek a controlling interest in the companies
in which it invests, but closely monitors its equity investments through Board representation. In accordance with the Board of Governors’
Resolution B/BG/2001/09 of May 29, 2001, total equity investment by the Bank shall not at any time exceed ten percent (10%) of the
aggregate amount of the Bank's paid-up capital and reserves and surplus included in its ordinary capital resources.

Equity investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured are reported at cost less provision for losses for estimated permanent
and lasting decline in value. The investments for which fair value cannot be reliably measured typically relate to sub-regional and national
development institutions. Investments in these institutions are made with a long-term development objective, including capacity building.
The shares of such institutions are not listed and also not available for sale to the general public. Only member states or institutions
owned by member states are allowed to subscribe to the shares of these institutions. Provisions for losses on impaired equity investments
are included in the income statement.

Under the Headquarters’ Agreement with the host country, the Bank's owned buildings in the host country are intended to be used for the
purposes of the business of the Bank Group only. The rights on the lands and buildings therefore cannot be transferred to a third party.
If the Bank elected to give up the use of the lands and buildings, the properties would have to be surrendered to the host country.

34 Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

NOTE J - BORROWINGS

It is the Bank's policy to limit senior borrowing and guarantees chargeable to the Bank’s ordinary capital resources to 80 percent of
the callable capital of its non-borrowing members and also to limit the total borrowing represented by both senior and subordinated
debt to 80 percent of the total callable capital of all its member countries. At December 31, 2006, total borrowings amounted to
UA 5,870.47 million (2005: UA 5,940.40 million) comprising senior debt and subordinated debt amounting to UA 5,178.74 million
(2005: UA 5,210.66 million) and UA 691.73 million (2005: UA 729.74 million), respectively. As of the same date, the ratio of senior
debt to the non-borrowing members’ callable capital of UA 8,533.51 million (2005: UA 8,523.93 million) was 60.69 percent (2005:
61.13 percent). Also at December 31, 2006, the ratio of total outstanding borrowings to the total callable capital of UA 19,436.76 million
(2005: UA 19,367.00 million) was 30.20 percent (2005: 30.67 percent). At December 31, 2006, borrowings with embedded callable
options amounted to UA 381.05 million (2005: UA 466.60 million). The Bank uses derivatives in its borrowing and liability management
activities to take advantage of cost-savings opportunities and to lower its funding costs.

The Bank has entered into currency swap agreements with major international banks by which proceeds of a borrowing are converted
into a different currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for the future exchange of the two
currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The Bank has also entered into interest rate swaps, which transform a floating rate
payment obligation in a particular currency into a fixed rate payment obligation or vice-versa.

The fair value of borrowings carried at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2006 was UA 4,823.65 million (2005:
UA 4,604.70 million). For these borrowings, the amount the Bank will be contractually required to pay at maturity at December 31, 2006
was UA 4,748.81 million (2005: UA 4,553.43 million). The surrender value of callable borrowings is equivalent to the notional amount
plus accrued finance charges.

As per note M, there was a net gain of UA 10.67 million on borrowings and related derivatives designated at fair value through profit
or loss for the year ended December 31, 2006 (2005: loss of UA 30.77 million). This included a loss of UA 33.89 million which was
attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk during the year ended December 31, 2006 (2005: UA 10.18 million). Fair value changes
attributable to changes in the Bank's credit risk are determined by comparing the discounted cash flows for the borrowings at fair value
through profit or loss using the Bank's credit spread versus LIBOR both at the beginning and end of the relevant period.

For borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss at December 31, 2006, the cumulative unrealized fair value losses to date
were UA 74.64 million (2005: losses of UA 51.27 million).

The valuation of some borrowings and derivatives is based on valuation techniques and not market prices and the effect for 2006
amounted to a loss of UA 35.03 million (2005: loss of UA 45.70 million).

NOTE K - EQUITY

Equity is composed of capital, retained earnings and fair value gains or losses on available-for-sale equity investments. These are further
detailed as follows:

Capital

Subscriptions paid in

Subscriptions to the capital stock of the Bank are made up of the subscription to the initial capital, a voluntary capital increase and five
general capital increases. The Fifth General Capital Increase (GCI-V) was approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank on May 29,
1998 and became effective on September 30, 1999 upon ratification by member states and entry into force of the related amendments
‘© the Agreements establishing the Bank. The GCI-V increased the authorized capital of the Bank by 35 percent from 1.62 million shares
© 2.187 million shares with a par value of UA 10,000 per share. The GCI-V shares, a total of 567,000 shares, are divided into paid-up
and callable shares in proportion of six percent (6%) paid-up and ninety-four percent (94%) callable. The GCI-V shares were allocated to
he regional and non-regional members such that, when fully subscribed, the regional members shall hold 60 percent of the total stock
of the Bank and non-regional members shall hold the balance of 40 percent.

Prior to the GCI-V, subscribed capital was divided into paid-up capital and callable capital in the proportion of 1 to 7. With the GCI-V, the
authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of 10.81 percent paid-up shares and 89.19 percent callable shares.

he Bank’s capital as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was as follows:

(UA thousands) 2006 2005

ncluded in the total unsubscribed shares of UA 75.46 million at December 31, 2006, was an amount of UA 38.83 million representing
he balance of the shareholding of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (former Yugoslavia).

 

Since the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist as a state under international law, its shares (composed of UA 41.93 million callable,
and UA 5.99 million paid-up, shares) were held as treasury shares of the Bank in accordance with Article 6 (6) of the Bank Agreement. In
2002, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved the proposal to invite each of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia to apply
for membership in the Bank, though such membership would be subject to their fulfilling certain conditions including the assumption
pro-rata of the contingent liabilities of the former Yugoslavia to the Bank, as of December 31, 1992. In the event that a successor state
declines or otherwise does not become a member of the Bank, the pro-rata portion of the shares of former Yugoslavia, which could have
been reallocated to such successor state, would be reallocated to other interested non-regional members of the Bank in accordance with
the terms of the Share Transfer Rules. The proceeds of such reallocation will however be transferable to such successor state. Furthermore,
pending the response from the successor states, the Bank may, under its Share Transfer Rules, reallocate the shares of former Yugoslavia to
interested non-regional member states and credit the proceeds on a pro-rata basis to the successor states. In 2003, one of the successor
states declined the invitation to apply for membership and instead offered to the Bank, as part of the state's Official Development Assistance
its pro-rata interest in the proceeds of any reallocation of the shares of former Yugoslavia. The Bank has since accepted the offer.

142 Annual Report 2006Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions (CEAS)

African Development Bank Chapter 006

Prior to the fourth General Capital Increase (GCI-IV), payments on the share capital subscribed by the non-regional member countries
were fixed in terms of their national currencies. Under GCI-IV, payments by regional and non-regional members in U.S. dollars were fixed
at an exchange rate of 1 UA = US$ 1.20635. As a result of these practices, losses or gains could arise from converting these currencies
to UA when received. Such conversion differences are reported in the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions account.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment on Subscriptions was as follows:

NOTE N - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Total administrative expenses relate to expenses incurred on behalf of the ADF, the NTF and for the operations of the Bank itself. The ADF
and NTF reimburse the Bank for their share of the total administrative expenses, based on an agreed-upon cost-sharing formula, which is
driven by certain selected indicators of operational activity for operational expenses and relative balance sheet sizes for non-operational
expenses. However, the expenses allocated to the NTF shall not exceed 20 percent of the NTF's gross income.

Administrative expenses comprised the following:

 

(UA thousands) 2006 2005
Personnel expenses 123,234 124,517
Other general expenses 31,106 31,174

Included in general administrative expenses is an amount of UA 3.91 million (2005: UA 3.87 million) incurred under operating lease
agreements for offices in Tunisia and in certain other regional member countries.

At the balance sheet date, the Bank had outstanding commitments under operating leases, which fall due as follows:

Within one year 3,941 3,419
In the second to fifth years inclusive 2,285 4,528
Total 6,226 7,947

Leases are generally negotiated for an average term of one (1) to three (3) years and rentals are fixed for an average of one (1) year.
Leases may be extended for periods that are no longer than the original term of the leases.

NOTE O - EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a defined benefit plan established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 05-89 of May 30, 1989,
became effective on December 31, 1989, following the termination of the Staff Provident Fund. Every person employed by the Bank on
a full-time basis, as defined in the Bank's employment policies, is eligible to participate in the SRP, upon completion of 6 months service
without interruption of more than 30 days.

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

The SRP is administered as a separate fund by a committee of trustees appointed by the Bank on behalf of its employees. In November
2004, the Board of Directors of the Bank approved certain revisions to the SRP, including simplification of the calculation of the employee
contribution rate, more explicit reference to the Bank's residual responsibility and rights as the SRP sponsor, changes in survivor child
benefits and an increase in the pension accumulation rate from 2 percent to 2.5 percent for each year of service. The past service cost
associated with these changes amounted to UA 1.64 million and has been recorded in 2004. Most participants have switched to the
revised SRP. Staff joining the Bank after January 1, 2005 can benefit only from the revised SRP. Under the revised SRP, employees contribute
at a rate of 9 percent of regular salary. A tax factor included in the basis for the determination of contribution in the previous SRP has
been eliminated. The Bank typically contributes twice the employee contribution, but may vary such contribution based on the results of
annual actuarial valuations.

All contributions to the SRP are irrevocable and are held by the Bank separately in a retirement fund to be used in accordance with the
provisions of the SRP. Neither the contributions nor any income thereon shall be used for or diverted to purposes other than the exclusive
benefit of active and retired participants or their beneficiaries or estates, or to the satisfaction of the SRP’s liabilities. At December 31,
2006, virtually all of the SRP’s investments were under external management and these were invested in indexed funds, with the following
objectives: a) Equity portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index as well
as hedging the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities; b) Bond portfolio — to track as closely as possible, the returns
of the Citigroup World Government Bond Index as well as hedge the currency exposure of the SRP’s anticipated future liabilities.

Medical Benefit Plan

The Medical Benefit Plan (MBP) was created under the Board of Directors’ resolution B/BD/2002/17 and F/BD/2002/18 of July 17, 2002
and became effective on January 1, 2003. Under the MBP, staff members or retirees contribute a percentage of their salary or pension
while the Bank also contributes twice the total staff contribution towards the financing of the MBP. Contribution rates by staff members
and retirees, which are based on marital status and number of eligible children, range between 0.70 percent to a maximum of 3.10
percent of salary or pension. An MBP board, composed of selected officers of the Bank and representatives of retirees and the staff
association, oversees the management and activities of the MBP. The contributions from the Bank, staff and retirees are deposited in a
trust account.

In accordance with IAS 19, and based on actuarial valuations, the pension and medical benefit expenses for 2006 and 2005 for the Bank,
the ADF and the NTF combined (the Bank Group) comprised the following:

- at end of fiscal year 8.00 9.00

- ultimate health care cost growth rate 5.00 5.00
Year ultimate health cost growth rate reached 2009 2009

The expected return on plan assets is an average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for debt securities and equity
securities, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed based on historical returns as well as forward-looking
expectations. Equity return expectations are generally based upon the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings growth and
expected long-term dividend yield. Bond return expectations are based upon the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk
premium. The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is selected by reference to the long-term year-end rates on AAA
corporate bonds.

For measurement purposes, the annual growth rate in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed to decrease ratably
between the current period and 2009, with the growth rate assumed to remain at that level thereafter.

No plan assets are invested in any of the Bank's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by
the Bank.

Commercial Credit Risk: In the ordinary course of business, the Bank uses a variety of financial instruments, some of which involve
elements of commercial credit risk. Commercial credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible
non-performance by counterparties under the terms of the contracts. Additionally, the nature of certain instruments involves contract
value and notional principal amounts that are not reflected in the basic financial statements.

For investments in securities, the Bank limits trading to a list of authorized dealers and counterparties with the highest credit ratings. Credit
risk is controlled through application of eligibility criteria and limits for transactions with individual counterparties, based on their credit
rating and size, subject to a maximum of 10 percent of the Bank’s total risk capital for any single counterparty. For swap transactions,
the Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce such credit risk, the Bank
only enters into long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible under the Bank's Asset and Liability Management Guidelines,
which include a requirement that the counterparties have a minimum credit rating of AA-/Aa3. The Bank does not anticipate that any of
its counterparties will fail to perform their obligations under such agreements.

The Bank may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual counterparties in order to mitigate
its credit exposure. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of such collateral held by the Bank was UA 5.61 million.

Currency Rate Risk: In order to minimize exchange rate risks the Bank matches, to the extent practicable, its borrowing obligations in
any one currency (after swap activities) with assets in the same currency. To avoid currency mismatches, borrowers are required to service
their loans in the currencies disbursed by the Bank. Because a large portion of the Bank's funding comes from equity resources, which
are denominated in UA, the Bank’s policy is to minimize the potential fluctuation of its net worth measured in UA by matching, to the
extent possible, the currency composition of its net assets with the proportions of the four currencies (US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen and
British pound) whose values affect the value of the UA.

Net swaps on borrowings per statement of net currency position

Liquidity Risk: The Bank's liquidity policy ensures that it has the resources to meet its net disbursement and debt service obligations
and allows it flexibility in deciding the appropriate time to access the capital market. As a long-term development lender, the Bank holds
sufficient liquid assets to enable it continue normal operations even in the unlikely event that it is unable to obtain fresh resources from
the capital markets for an extended period of time. To achieve this objective, the Bank operates on a prudential minimum level of liquidity,
which is based on the projected net cash requirement for a rolling 1-year period. The prudential minimum level of liquidity is updated
quarterly and includes all potential debt service payments due to early redemption of swaps and borrowings with embedded options.
To enable it to take advantage of low-cost funding opportunities as they arise, the Bank's policy permits a judicious increase of liquid
resources where there is an economic benefit. The Bank maintains interest rate limits for each internally managed or externally managed

active currency portfolio.

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

The borrowing cost pass-through formulation incorporated in the lending rates charged on the Bank’s loans has helped to limit the
interest rate sensitivity of the net spread earnings on its loan portfolio. The Bank holds or lends the proceeds of its borrowings in the
same currencies borrowed (after swap activities).

The table below provides an analysis of assets, liabilities and equity into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from
the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. It is presented under the most prudent consideration of maturity dates where
options or repayment patterns allow for early repayment possibilities. Therefore, liabilities are classified according to the earliest possible
repayment date, while assets are classified according to the latest possible repayment date. Assets and liabilities that do not have a
contractual maturity date are grouped together in the “Maturity undefined” category.

Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest
rates. The extent of exposure to interest rate risk is largely determined by the length of time for which the rate of interest is fixed for a
financial instrument. The Bank's principal interest rate risk management objective is to generate a stable overall net interest margin by
matching the interest rate characteristic and repricing profile of the assets with those of the underlying borrowings and equity sources,
respectively. The table below provides information on the extent of the Bank's interest rate exposure based either on the contractual
maturity date of its financial instruments or, in the case of instruments that reprice to a market rate of interest before maturity, the next
repricing date. Securities that comprise the Bank's trading portfolio are assumed to reprice within the “one year or less” category.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

In connection with an internationally co-ordinated effort between the Bank, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF), the World
Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the
Board of Directors on June 26, 2002, approved an arrears clearance plan for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance plan, contributions
received from the donor community were used immediately for partial clearance of the arrears owed by the DRC. The residual amount
of DRC's arrears to the Bank and loan amounts not yet due were consolidated into new contractual receivables, such that the present
value of the new loans was equal to the present value of the amounts that were owed under the previous contractual terms. The
new loans carry the weighted average interest rate of the old loans. In approving the arrears clearance plan, the Board of Directors
considered the following factors: a) the arrears clearance plan is part of an internationally coordinated arrangement for the DRC;
b) the magnitude of DRC's arrears to the Bank ruled out conventional solutions; c) the prolonged armed conflict in the DRC created
extensive destruction of physical assets, such that the DRC had almost no capacity for servicing its debt; and d) the proposed package
would result in a significant improvement in its repayment capacity, if appropriate supporting measures are taken. Furthermore, there
was no automatic linkage between the arrears clearance mechanism and the debt relief that may be subsequently provided on the
consolidated facility. In June 2004, the DRC reached its decision point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
Consequently, the consolidated facility has since that date benefited from partial debt service relief under HIPC.

A special account, separate from the assets of the Bank, was established for all contributions towards the DRC arrears clearance plan.
Such contributions may include allocations of the net income of the Bank that the Board of Governors may from time to time make
‘o the special account, representing the Bank's contribution to the arrears clearance plan. The amount of such net income allocation
is subject to the approval of the Boards of Governors of the Bank, typically occurring during the annual general meeting of the Bank.
Consequently, income received on the consolidated DRC loans is recognized in current earnings and is transferred out of reserves to
he special account only after the formal allocation, in whole or in part, of such amount by the Board of Governors of the Bank.

 

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance

he Post Conflict Countries’ Fund was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflict in their efforts towards reengagement with the donor community in order to reactivate development assistance and help these countries reach the Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework entails
he setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with allocations from the ADB's net income, and contributions from
he ADF and other private donors. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries not
yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank Group.
n this connection, the Board of Governors by its Resolution B/BG/2004/07 of May 25, 2004, established the Post-Conflict Countries
Facility (PCCF) under the administration of the ADF and approved an allocation of UA 45 million from the 2003 net income of the Bank.
he Board of Governors also, by its resolution B/BG/2005/05 of May 18, 2005, approved an additional allocation of UA 30 million
rom the 2004 net income as the second installment of the Bank’s contribution to the facility and by its resolution B/BG/2006/04
of May 17, 2006, the Board of Governors also approved the third and final installment of the Bank's allocation of UA 25 million
rom the 2005 net income. By policy, contributions made by ADB to the PCCF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Bank by
eneficiary post-conflict countries.

Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

he Bank participates in a multilateral initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as HIPCs. Under this initiaive, creditors provide debt relief for eligible countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring
heir debt burdens to sustainable levels. Under the original HIPC framework, selected loans to eligible beneficiary countries were
aid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent to the lower of the net present value of the loans, as calculated using the
methodology agreed under the initiatives, and their nominal values.

Following the signature of a HIPC debt relief agreement, the relevant loans were paid off at the lower of their net present value or
heir carrying value. On average, loans in the ADB's portfolio carry higher interest rates than the present value discount rates applied

 

Annual Report 2006African Development Bank Chapter 006

and therefore the net present value of the loans exceeds the book value. Consequently, affected ADB loans were paid off by the
HIPC Trust Fund at book values.

The HIPC initiative was enhanced in 1999 to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by
reducing the eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original
framework. Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are eligible, the debt relief is delivered through annual debt
service reductions, as well as the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total debt
relief is provided. In addition, interim financing between the decision and completion points of up to 40 percent of total debt relief
is provided whenever possible within a 15-year horizon. At December 31, 2006, the Board of Directors had approved relief for 17
ADB borrowing countries, of which 13 had reached the completion point. During the year ended December 31, 2006, debt relief of
UA 52.28 million (2005: UA 106.05 million) was received on behalf of the ADB borrowing countries.

(iv) Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI)
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the
International Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on
countries that have reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38
countries worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
while simultaneously safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation would be delivered
by relieving post-completion-point HIPCs' repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same
amount. To maintain the financial integrity of the ADF, donors have committed to make additional contributions to the ADF to match
“dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal and service charge payments.

 

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006. As of that date, the ADF wrote down its balance of disbursed and
outstanding loans net of HIPC relief by an amount of UA 3.84 billion, with a corresponding decrease as of that date in the ADF's
net assets. The reduction in the net asset value of the ADF has resulted in a reduction in the value of the Bank’s investment in the
Fund by UA 34.75 million during the year.

NOTE T-3: SPECIAL FUNDS
Under Article 8 of the Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Bank may establish or be entrusted with the administration of special funds.
At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the following funds were held separately from those of the ordinary capital resources of the Bank:

(i) The NTF was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development
Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the NTF shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the
date the Agreement became effective and that the resources of the NTF shall be transferred to Nigeria upon termination. However,
the 30-year sunset period may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and Nigeria. The terms of the current agreement
terminated on April 25, 2006. The Nigerian authorities in May 2006 granted a one-year extension, for the agreement to April 25,
2007. On March 27, 2007, the Government of Nigeria granted a further 1-year extension of the NTF Agreement to April 25, 2008.
The initial capital of the NTF was Naira 50 million payable in two equal installments of Naira 25 million each, in freely convertible
currencies. The first installment, equivalent to US$ 39.90 million, was received by the Bank on July 14, 1976, and payment of the
second installment, equivalent to US$ 39.61 million, was made on February 1, 1977.

During May 1981, the Federal Republic of Nigeria announced the replenishment of the NTF with Naira 50 million. The first installment
of Naira 35 million (US$ 52.29 million) was paid on October 7, 1981. The second installment of Naira 8 million (US$ 10.87 million) was
received on May 4, 1984. The payment of the third installment of Naira 7 million (US$ 7.38 million) was made on September 13, 1985.
Following a request by the Government of Nigeria on June 14, 2006, a payment of US$ 200 million (UA 135.74 million) was made

to the Government of Nigeria from the resources of the Fund.

The Special Relief Fund (for African countries affected by drought) was established by Board of Governors’ Resolution 20-74

to assist African countries affected by unpredictable disasters. The purpose of this fund was subsequently expanded in 1991 to
include the provision of assistance, on a grant basis, to research institutions whose research objectives in specified fields are likely to
facilitate the Bank's objective of meeting the needs of regional member countries in those fields. The resources of this fund consist
of contributions by the Bank, the ADF and various member states.

NOTE T-4: TRUST FUNDS

The Bank has been entrusted, under Resolutions 11-70, 19-74 and 10-85 of the Board of Governors, with the administration of the
Mamoun Beheiry Fund, the Arab Oil Fund, and the Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa. These funds,
held separately from those of the ordinary resources of the Bank, are maintained and accounted for in specific currencies, which are
translated into Units of Account at exchange rates prevailing at the end of the year.

(i) The Mamoun Beheiry Fund was established under Board of Governors’ Resolution 11-70 of October 31, 1970, whereby
Mr. Mamoun Beheiry, former President of the Bank, agreed to set up a fund, which could be used by the Bank to reward staff members
who had demonstrated outstanding performance in fostering the objectives of the Bank.

(ii) The Arab Oil Fund (contribution of Algeria) was established following Board of Governors’ Resolution 19-74 of July 4, 1974.
Under a protocol agreement dated November 15, 1974, the Bank received the sum of US$ 20 million from the Government of Algeria
to be kept as a Trust Fund from which loans could be granted to member countries affected by high oil prices. On August 11, 1975,
an amount of US$ 5.55 million was refunded to Algeria upon request, leaving a balance of US$ 14.45 million, from which loans
refundable directly to Algeria have been made. At December 31, 2006, a total of US$ 13.45 million (2005: US$ 13.45 million) had
been so repaid.

(iii) The Special Emergency Assistance Fund for Drought and Famine in Africa (SEAF) was established by the 20th Meeting
of Heads of State and Government of member countries of the African Union formerly Organization of African Unity (OAU) held in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from November 12 to 15, 1984, under Resolution AHG/Res. 133 (XX), with the objective of giving assistance
to African member countries affected by drought and famine.

Chapter 006 African Development Bank

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF
THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

We have audited the accompanying annual financial statements of the African Development Bank (the Bank), which comprise the balance sheet as at
31 December 2006 and the income statement, the statement of recognised income and expense and the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, a
summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes, as set out in notes A to T. The financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article
32(d) of the Agreement establishing the Bank. This report is made solely to the Bank’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 32(d) of
the Agreement establishing the Bank. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Bank’s members those matters we are required to
state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Bank and the Bank’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Annual Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement Establishing the Bank. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards
on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Basis for Qualified Opinion

As set out under the Member Countries’ Subscription accounting policy in Note B to the financial statements, the Agreement Establishing the Bank
provides that a member country (or “State”) may withdraw from the Bank at any time (defined as the “termination date”). Exercising such right of withdrawal
requires the Bank to arrange for the repurchase of such member country’s shares as part of the settlement of accounts with that State. In our view, although
the Bank is able to withhold any amount due to the member country for its shares so long as the State remains liable as borrower or guarantor to the Bank,
and notwithstanding the fact that the member country remains liable for its direct and contingent liabilities to the Bank as long as any part of the loans or
guarantees contracted before the termination date is outstanding, the Bank does not have the unconditional right to avoid settling its contractual obligations at
termination date to the member country. Therefore, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IAS 32, “Financial Instruments: Disclosure
and Presentation”, member countries’ capital stock should be reclassified in the Bank’s financial statements as financial liabilities instead of equity.

The impact of this accounting treatment would be to reclassify credit balances of UA 2,303,061,682 and UA 2,263,445,736 of capital stock and to reclassify
debit balances of UA 155,742,042 and UA 151,758,878 of cumulative exchange adjustment on subscriptions from equity to liabilities in the balance sheet
of the Bank for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 respectively.

Disagreement with management — Qualified Opinion

In our opinion, except for the effect on the annual financial statements of the matter referred to in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2006, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Subscriptions

ADF Replenishments

The resources of ADF mainly consist of subscriptions by the Bank and State Participants,
as well as other resources received by the
Fund. Cumulative subscriptions and contributions to ADF as of December 31, 2006
stood at UA 15.26 billion (UA 14.95 billion in
2005).

he replenishment level for the Tenth General
Replenishment of the resources of the Fund
(ADF-X) was set at UA 3.40 billion, and covers the 2005-2007 operational period. ADF-X
ecame effective in September 2005, and,
as of December 31, 2006, State Participants
subscribed to an amount of UA 2.23 billion,
representing 65.59 percent of the ADF-X
arget replenishment level.

Subscriptions to the Fund are usually
aid in three equal annual installments,
in either cash or promissory notes. As of
December 31, 2006 payments received for
ADF-X amounted to UA 1.39 billion and
included advance payments made under
he accelerated encashment framework.
he last ADF-X installments are due by
April 30, 2007. The encashment schedules
of promissory notes are directly linked to
specific ADF replenishments and usually
cover a standard 10-year period based on
disbursement projections.

 

Commitments under the

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI or
Initiative) became effective on September 1,

2006.' To preserve the financial integrity
and the financing capacity of the African
Development Fund, the terms of the MDRI
require donors to fully compensate the Fund
for debts cancelled. The cost of the MDRI? is
estimated at UA 5,835.9 million in nominal
terms. Management will, at the commencement of each ADF replenishment, adjust this
cost estimate for exchange-rate induced
excesses or shortfalls that have materialized
over the previous replenishment period.

As of December 31, 2006, the Fund received
from donors aggregate commitments in
excess of UA 4.00 billion. These commitments represent 74 percent of the indicative
cost of debt relief for 33 eligible countries
(UA 5,835.9 million). The total indicative cost
of the MDRI for the period 2006-2007 is
UA 84.8 million and payable on January 15,
2007. As of December 31, 2006, payments
of UA 43.25 million had been received.

Investments
ADF cash and liquid investments amounted
to UA 2.94 billion at December 31, 2006,
compared to UA 1.96 billion in 2005. Investment income for the year amounted to UA
102.50 million, representing a return of 4.37
percent, on an average liquidity level of UA
2.35 billion, compared with an income of UA
68.75 million in 2005, which represented a
return of 3.98 percent on an average liquidity
of UA 1.73 billion.

 

Loan Portfolio

Cumulative loans and grants signed, net
of cancellations, at December 31, 2006,
amounted to UA 14.17 billion compared
with UA 13.17 billion at the end of 2005.
Total outstanding loans, as at December 31,
2006 was UA 3.83 billion, UA 3.96 billion
lower than the UA 7.79 billion outstanding

as at the end of 2005. This decrease was
attributable primarily to debt cancellation
under the MDRI for 16 completion point
countries during the year amounting to UA
4.32 billion. At the end of 2006, there were
1,593 active signed loans and grants. Also
at December 31, 2006, a total of 48 loans
amounting to UA 220.87 million had been
fully repaid.

Disbursements

Disbursements of loans and grants decreased
from UA 691.07 million in 2005 to UA
685.16 million, representing a decrease of
0.86 percent. As at December 31, 2006,
cumulative disbursements on loans and
grants amounted to UA 9.96 billion. A
total of 1,357 loans and grants were fully
disbursed for an amount of UA 8.15 billion,
representing 81.83 percent of cumulative
disbursements.

 

Financial Results

The Fund’s surplus was UA 40.42 million
in 2006, compared to UA 19.71 million in
2005. The UA 20.71 million increase in surplus was due to a UA 33.75 million increase
in income on investments as a result of higher investment balances and yields, and UA
13.98 million in other income mainly from
the recovery of ADF funds from a liquidation
proceeding. Partially offsetting these factors
was a UA 21.44 million decrease in income
from loans, which was caused primarily by
loan cancellations under the Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).

Administrative expenses, which represents
the Fund’s share of the total shareable
expenses of the ADB Group, increased by
UA 2.70 million, from UA 111.86 million
in 2005 to UA 114.56 million in 2006.
The Fund's share of the total shareable

 

‘The effectiveness of the MDRI was triggered when the Fund received Instrument of Commitments representing at least 70% of the total cost of debt relief for
14 post-completion countries, of which not less than an amount equivalent to at least 75% of the cost of debt relief incurred during the ADF-X period, were unqualified

commitments for payments due in 2007.

?Based on debt outstanding and disbursed as of December 2004 as cut-off date, and January 1, 2006 as implementation date, for 33 eligible beneficiary countries.

Annual Report 2006expenses of the ADB group is based on a
predetermined cost-sharing formula, which
is driven primarily by the relative levels of
certain operational volume indicators.

According to the Fund's non-accrual policy,
service charges on loans made to, or guaranteed by borrowers are excluded from loan
income if principal repayment and service
charges are in arrears for 6 months or more.
As a result of this policy, UA 4.53 million of

non-accrued loan income was excluded from
2006 income compared to UA 5.39 million
in 2005. In addition, UA 8.17 million of loan
income previously not accrued was recovered
and recognized in income in 2006. There
were no such recoveries in 2005.

As a result of the implementation of the
MDRI, the Fund cancelled debts owing by
MDRI beneficiary countries net of recovery
from HIPC.

NOTES TO THE SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

NOTE A - PURPOSE, ORGANIZATION AND RESOURCES

Purpose and Organization

The African Development Fund (ADF or the Fund) was established in 1972 as an international institution to assist the African
Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) in contributing to the economic and social development of the Bank’s regional members, promote
cooperation and increased international trade particularly among the Bank's members, and to provide financing on concessional terms
for such purposes.

The ADF's Board of Directors has twelve (12) members, made up of six (6) members selected by the Bank and six (6) members selected by
State Participants. The Board of Directors reports to the Board of Governors, which is made up of representatives of the State Participants
and the ADB. The ADB exercises fifty percent (50%) of the voting powers in the ADF and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio
President of the Fund.

The ADB, the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF) (which is a special fund administered by the ADB) and the ADF are collectively referred to as the
Bank Group. The assets and liabilities of the ADB and of the NTF are separate and independent of those of the ADF. Furthermore, the ADF
is not liable for their respective obligations. Transactions with these affiliates are disclosed in the notes that follow. The principal purpose
of the ADB is to promote economic and social development in its regional member countries. The ADB finances development projects and
programs in its regional member states. The ADB also participates in the selection, study and preparation of projects contributing to the
development of its member countries and where necessary provides technical assistance. The NTF was established under an agreement
between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria to further support the development efforts of ADB regional member countries,
particularly the lesser-developed countries.

Resources

The resources of the Fund consist of subscriptions by the Bank, subscriptions and contributions by State Participants, other resources
received by the Fund and funds derived from operations or otherwise accruing to the Fund. The initial resources of the Fund consisted
of subscriptions by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement Establishing the Fund (the Agreement). Thereafter, the
resources have been replenished through special and general increases of subscriptions and contributions.

NOTE B - BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Due to the nature and organization of the Fund, these special purpose financial statements have been prepared for the specific purpose
of reflecting the net development resources of the Fund and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards. Net development resources represent resources available to fund loan and grant commitments and comprise primarily cash, marketable investments and demand obligations of State Participants. These special purpose financial statements
have been prepared to comply with Article 35(1) of the Agreement , which requires that the Fund circulates, at appropriate intervals, a
summary of its financial position and income and expenditure statement showing the results of its operations.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Fund’s special purpose financial statements are as follows:
Monetary Basis of Special Purpose Financial Statements

The special purpose financial statements are expressed in Units of Account (UA). Article 1 of the Agreement defined a Unit of Account
as having a value of 0.81851265 grams of fine gold.

On April 1, 1978, when the second amendment to the Articles of the Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into

effect, gold was abolished as a common denominator of the international monetary system. Computations relating to the currencies of
IMF members were thereafter made on the basis of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) for purposes of applying the provisions of the Articles

Annual Report 2006African Development Fund Chapter 006

of the IMF. The Fund's Unit of Account was therefore based on its relationship to the SDR at the time of establishment of the Fund. This
was 1 Unit of Account equal to SDR 0.921052.

Subsequently, on November 16, 1992, the Board of Governors decided by Resolution F/BG/92/10 to redefine the Fund’s Unit of Account
to be equivalent to the Unit of Account of the ADB, which is defined as equivalent to the Special Drawing Right of the IMF. In compliance with this Resolution, the Board of Directors, on June 22, 1993, adopted January 1, 1993, as the date for the entry into effect of the
Resolution, and the Fund’s UA has since then been defined as equal to the Bank's Unit of Account.

The Fund conducts its operations in the currencies of its State Participants. Income and expenses are converted into UA at the rate
prevailing on the date of the transaction. Assets and liabilities are translated into UA at rates prevailing at the date of the Statement
of Net Development Resources. Translation differences are debited or credited to the Cumulative Currency Translation Adjustment.
Translation gains and losses on subscriptions and contributions received are credited or debited to the Cumulative Exchange Adjustment
on Subscriptions and Contributions. Where currencies are converted into any other currency, the resulting gains or losses are included
in income.

The rates used for translating currencies into UA as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

2006 2005
1 Unit of Account equals:
Argentinian Peso 4.454380 4.301570
Brazilian Real 3.215210 3.344340
Canadian Dollar 1.753080 1.664180
Danish Krone 8.517020 9.038810
Euro 1.142290 1.211550
Indian Rupee 66.539800 64.416800
Japanese Yen 178.948000 168.610000
Korean Won 1,398.490000 1,458.260000
Kuwaiti Dinar 0.434622 0.418938
Norwegian Krone 9.410170 9.674270
Pound Sterling 0.766377 0.830055
South African Rand 10.485700 9.040120
Swedish Krona 10.339000 11.336300
Swiss Franc 1.835820 1.878480
United States Dollar 1.504400 1.429270

No representation is made that any currency held by the Fund can be or could be converted into any other currency at the cross-rates resulting
from the rates indicated above.

Participant Subscriptions and Contributions

Subscriptions committed by state participants for each replenishment are recorded in full as subscriptions receivable from participants upon
submission of an instrument of subscription by the participants. A replenishment becomes effective when the ADF receives instruments of
subscription from participants for a portion of the intended replenishment level as specified in the replenishment resolution. The portion
of subscribed amounts for which payments are not yet due from State Participants are recorded as installments on subscriptions not yet
payable, and are not included in the net development resources of the Fund. The subscriptions not yet payable become due throughout
the replenishment period (generally three years) in accordance with an agreed payment schedule. The actual payment of subscriptions
when they become due from certain participants is conditional upon the respective participant's budgetary appropriation process.

Annual Report 2006

79180

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

he subscriptions receivable are settled through payment of cash or deposit of non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes. The
notes are encashed by the Fund as provided in an encashment program agreed to at the time of the replenishment.

For the ADF-IX and ADF-X replenishments, participants were given the option of an early payment of cash in an amount equivalent to the
net present value of their entire subscriptions. Upon receipt of such cash payments, participants are credited with the full face value of
heir entire subscriptions, and in agreement with the Fund, such cash amounts received are invested and the income generated thereon
is retained by the Fund. A discount, calculated as the difference between the face value of the subscriptions and the cash amount
received, is initially recorded to represent the interest expected to be earned on the cash received from State Participants who opted
‘or the accelerated encashment program. Such discount is amortized over the projected encashment period, to recognize the effective
contributions to equity by the relevant participant over and above the initial cash advanced.

By its resolutions F/BG/2006/12 and F/BG/2006/13 of May 18, 2006 and August 31, 2006 respectively, the Board of Governors of the
Fund authorized the Board of Directors to approve the participation of the ADF in the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) and in
hat regard the Board of Governors also authorized an increase in the resources of the ADF to provide full and timely compensation for
he debt cancellation under the MDRI subject to the attainment of the following effectiveness thresholds:

 

) Receipt of Instruments of Commitment from donors covering an aggregate amount equivalent to at least seventy percent (70%) of
he total cost of debt relief for the first group of 14 post-completion point HIPCs; and

 

2) Receipt of unqualified Instruments of Commitments from donors for an amount not less than the equivalent of at least seventy five
percent (75%) of the total cost of debt relief incurred during the remainder of ADF-X period.

 

Upon satisfaction of the above two thresholds, the Board of Directors of the Fund approved the effectiveness of the MDRI with effect
from September 1, 2006. To ensure full compensation for foregone reflows as a result of the upfront debt cancellation, the ADF governing bodies endorsed Management's proposal for a compensation scheme over the 50-year period of the initiative. Donors will contribute
additional resources to the ADF, equivalent to the foregone debt service (service charges and principal) for each replenishment period,
by submitting pledges over the life of the initiative. The compensatory financing arrangements will take the form of a general increase in
the contribution of State Participants pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement Establishing the ADF. The contributions received from State
Participants under the compensatory financing arrangements shall not be counted as part of the burden share for the replenishment
period in which such resources are received, but shall carry voting rights in the same manner as normal subscriptions. Such contributions
are separately disclosed within the total of subscriptions and contributions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings
Prior to the second general replenishment, subscriptions were denominated in UA and were subject to Article 13 of the Agreement
which provided that, whenever the par value in the IMF of the currency of a State Participant is reduced in terms of the UA or its foreign
exchange value has, in the opinion of the Fund, depreciated to a significant extent within that participant's territory, that participant shall
pay to the Fund within a reasonable time an amount of its currency required to maintain the value, as of the time of subscription, of the
amount of such currency paid into the Fund by that participant and which has not been disbursed or exchanged for another currency.

 

Conversely, if the currency of a State Participant has increased in par value or appreciated in its foreign exchange value within that
participant's territory, the Fund shall return to that participant an amount of such currency equal to the increase in the value of the Fund's
holding of that currency which was received by it in payment of subscriptions, to the extent that these amounts have not been disbursed
or exchanged for another currency.

In accordance with Board of Governors’ Resolutions 9-78, 9-82, 4-84, 01-88, 91-05, 96-04, 99-09, 2002-09 and 2005-01, which in turn
stipulated that Article 13 shall not apply to the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth general replenishments,
subscribers to these replenishments fixed the amount of their subscriptions payable in national currencies in terms of agreed parities
ruling at the date these replenishments came into force. Gains or losses arising on translating these subscriptions, when received, into UA
are applied against subscriptions, with the offsetting debits or credits recorded as cumulative exchange adjustment on subscriptions.

 

Annual Report 2006African Development Fund Chapter 006

Investments
The Fund's investment securities are classified based on the Fund's intention on the date of purchase. Securities which the Fund has the
intention and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. Held-to-maturity investments
are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund's management has the positive
intention and ability to hold to maturity. All other investment securities are classified as held-for-trading and measured at market value.
Government and agency obligations include marketable bonds or notes and other government obligations issued or unconditionally
guaranteed by governments of member countries or other official entities with a minimum credit rating of AA-. For asset-backed securities,
he Fund may only invest in securities with a AAA credit rating. Money market instruments include time deposits, certificates of deposi
and other obligations with a maturity period of less than 1 year, issued or unconditionally guaranteed by banks and other financia
institutions with a minimum rating of A.

ncome on investments includes interest earned and unrealized gains and losses on the held-for-trading portfolio. Purchases and sales o
investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date on which the Fund commits to purchase or sell the investments.

Loans

he Fund provides concessional funding for development purposes to the least developed countries in Africa. Outstanding loans are no’
included in Net Development Resources. Accordingly, no provision for possible loan losses is required. The Fund places all loans to a
orrower country in non-accrual status if the principal installments or service charges on any of the loans to such member country are
overdue by 6 months or more, unless the Fund's management determines that the overdue amount will be collected in the immediate
uture. Further, management may place a loan in non-accrual status even if it is not yet overdue by 6 months, if the specific facts an
circumstances, including consideration of events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date, warrant such action. On the date a
jorrower’s loans are placed in non-accrual status, unpaid charges that had previously been accrued on loans to the borrower are
deducted from income on loans for that period. Charges on loans in non-accrual status are included in income only to the extent tha
ayment of such charges has been received by the Fund.

 

Grants

n addition to loans, the Fund is authorized to provide development financing in the form of grants. Prior to the ninth replenishment of the
resources of the Fund, grant funds were granted for technical assistance activities only. With effect from the ninth replenishment, grants
may be used for technical assistance as well as project financing. Grants, like loans, represent allocations of development resources and
are accordingly treated as such in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

 

The Fund participates in a multilateral debt relief initiative for addressing the debt problems of countries identified as heavily indebted
poor countries (HIPCs) to help ensure that their reform efforts are not compromised by unsustainable external debt burdens. Under this
initiative, creditors provide debt relief for those countries that demonstrate good policy performance over an extended period to bring
their debt burdens to sustainable levels. As a part of this process, the HIPC Debt Initiative Trust Fund, (the Trust Fund) constituted by funds
from donors, including the Bank Group, was established to help beneficiaries reduce their overall debt, including those debts owing to
the Fund.

Under the original framework of the debt relief initiative, upon signature of a HIPC Debt Relief Agreement by the Fund, the beneficiary
country and the Trust Fund, loans or repayment installments identified for sale to the Trust Fund are written down to their estimated net
present value. On the settlement date, the estimated write-down is adjusted to reflect the actual difference between the cash received
and the carrying value of the loans sold.

Under the enhanced HIPC framework, the implementation mechanism comprises a partial payment of ADF debt service as it falls due
with funds received from the Trust Fund.

Under the MDRI, loans due from eligible HIPCs are cancelled when the countries attain the completion point under the HIPC framework.
The Fund is expected to be fully compensated for loans cancelled under the MDRI by additional contributions to be made by donors over
the previously scheduled repayment periods of the cancelled loans. When the MDRI becomes effective for a country, certain amounts

 

Annual Report 2006

181Chapter 006 African Development Fund

previously disbursed to that country as loans are no longer repayable by the country and effectively take on the character of grants made
by the Fund. Accordingly, loans cancelled under the MDRI are included in the amount reported as “Debt Relief” under the allocation of
development resources in the Statement of Net Development Resources, with a corresponding offset to loans outstanding.

Reclassification
Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform with the current period's presentation.

NOTE D - DEMAND OBLIGATIONS

Demand obligations represent subscription payments made by participants, in accordance with Article 9 of the Agreement, in the form of
non-negotiable, non-interest-bearing notes payable at their par value on demand. The Board of Governors has agreed that the encashment of these notes will be governed by the Fund’s disbursement requirements.

NOTE E - DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

According to the Fund's loan regulations, loans are expressed in UA and repaid in the currency disbursed.

Project Loans and Lines of Credit

Loans are generally granted under conditions that allow for repayment over 40 years, after a 10-year grace period commencing from the date
of the loan agreement. Loan principal is generally repayable from years 11 through 20 at a rate of 1 percent per annum and from years 21
through 50 at a rate of 3 percent per annum. A service charge at a rate of 0.75 percent per annum on the principal amount disbursed and
outstanding is payable by the borrower semi-annually. Loans approved after June 1996 carry a 0.5 percent per annum commitment charge on
the undisbursed portion. Such commitment charge commences to accrue after 90 days from the date of signature of the loan agreement.

Prior to the establishment of the Technical Assistance Account, loans for pre-investment studies were normally granted for a period of 10
years, including a grace period of 3 years, with repayments in seven equal installments from years 4 through 10.

Of the undisbursed balances of loans signed, the Fund may enter into special irrevocable commitments to pay amounts to borrowers
or others in respect of the cost of goods and services to be financed under loan agreements. As at December 31, 2006, outstanding
irrevocable reimbursement guarantees to commercial banks amounted to UA 2.26 million (2005: UA 3.18 million).

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

As at December 31, 2006, loans made to or guaranteed by certain borrowers with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of
UA 568.02 million (2005: UA 687.69 million) of which UA 70.29 million (2005: UA 78.36 million) that was overdue, were in non-accrual
status. If these loans had not been in non-accrual status, income from loans for the year ended December 31, 2006, would have been
higher by UA 4.53 million (2005: UA 5.39 million). At December 31, 2006, the cumulative charges not recognized on the non-accrual
loans amounted to UA 39.52 million, compared to UA 43.19 million at December 31, 2005.

Lines of credit to national development banks and similar national finance institutions are generally granted for a maximum of 20 years,
including a 5-year grace period. The service charge rate on utilized lines of credit is the same as for project loans.

Grants and Technical Assistance Activities

Under the Fund’s lending policy, 5.00 percent of the resources available under the third and fourth general replenishments, 10.00 percent
under the fifth and sixth general replenishments, and 7.50 percent under the seventh and eighth general replenishments were allocated
as grants and grant-based technical assistance for the identification and preparation of development projects or programs in specified
member countries. In addition, amounts in the range of 18 to 21 percent of the total resources under the ninth replenishment were set
aside in the form of grants for permitted uses, including technical assistance and project financing. Grants do not bear charges. The share
of grants under the tenth general replenishment is based on a country-by-country analysis of risk of debt distress. Under the seventh,
eighth and ninth general replenishments, technical assistance may also be provided on a reimbursable basis.

echnical assistance loans are granted under conditions that allow for repayment in 50 years, including a 10-year grace period, from the
date of the loan agreement. However, the following categories of loans have different terms:

i) where the loan is granted for the preparation of a pre-investment study and the study proves that the project is not possible, the
grace period is extended to 45 years with a repayment period of 5 years thereafter.

ii) where the loan is granted for strengthening regional member countries’ co-operation or for the improvement of the operations of
existing institutions and is not related to specific projects or programs, the grace period is 45 years with a repayment period of 5
years thereafter.

echnical assistance loans do not carry charges.

HIPC Debt Relief Initiative
Under the original framework of HIPC, selected loans to beneficiary countries were paid off by the HIPC Trust Fund at a price equivalent
‘0 the net present value of the loans as calculated using the methodology agreed under the initiative. Following the signature of a HIPC
debt relief agreement, loans identified for payment were written down to their estimated net present value. The amount of the write-down,
representing the difference between the book value and net present value of the loans, was shown as an allocation of development
resources. The amount disclosed under debt relief in the statement of net development resources included UA 71.08 million representing
he write-down relating to HIPC debt relief granted to Mozambique in 1999 under the original HIPC framework. The outstanding
balance and net present value of the loans owed by Mozambique and sold to the HIPC Trust Fund in 1999 were UA 132.04 million and
UA 60.96 million, respectively.

n 1999, the HIPC initiative was enhanced to provide greater, faster and more poverty-focused debt relief. This was achieved by reducing
he eligibility criteria for qualification under the initiative and by commencing debt relief much earlier than under the original framework.
Under the enhanced framework, where 32 African countries are currently eligible, debt relief is delivered through annual debt service
reductions which allow the release of up to 80 percent of annual debt service obligations as they come due until the total net present
value (NPV) of debt relief, determined by the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), is provided. Interim financing of up to 40 percent of total
debt relief is granted between the decision and completion points. Total contributions by the Fund to the HIPC initiative at December 31,
2006 amounted to UA 184.00 million and are shown as an allocation of development resources in the Statement of Net Development
Resources.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
At the Gleneagles Summit on July 8, 2005, the Group of 8 major industrial countries agreed on a proposal for the ADF, the International
Development Association (IDA), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cancel 100 percent of their claims on countries that have
reached, or will reach, the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. Through the Development Committee Communiqué of
September 25, 2005, the donor community expressed its support for this MDRI, and urged the institutions referred to above to proceed
with the necessary steps to ensure implementation.

The main objective of the MDRI is to complete the process of debt relief for HIPCs by providing additional resources to help 38 countries
worldwide, 33 of which are in Africa, to make progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while simultaneously
safeguarding the long-term financing capacity of the ADF and the IDA. The debt cancellation is delivered by relieving post-completionpoint HIPCs’ repayment obligations and adjusting their gross assistance flows downward by the same amount. To maintain the financial
integrity of the ADF, donors are expected to make additional contributions to the ADF to match “dollar-for-dollar” the foregone principal
and service charge payments.

The MDRI became effective for the ADF on September 1, 2006, following the attainment of the thresholds. Since disbursed and outstanding
loans are already excluded from net development resources, the debt cancellation does not have an impact on the Fund's balance of net
development resources. Further cancellation of debts will be effected when other eligible countries reach the HIPC completion point.

 

At December 31, 2006, a gross amount of UA 4.32 billion of outstanding loans had been cancelled under MDRI for 16 HIPC completion
point countries. Of this amount, UA 806.27 million in nominal terms (with a present value equivalent of UA 478.59 million) were covered
by the HIPC Trust Fund. As of December 31 2006, the present value amount of UA 478.59 million had been transferred from the HIPC
Trust Fund to ADF. A summary of debt relief granted under HIPC and MDRI as at December 31, 2006 and 2005 follows:

Special Arrears Clearance Mechanism

In connection with an internationally coordinated effort including the ADB Group, the IMF, the World Bank and other bilateral and multilateral donors to assist the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in its reconstruction efforts, the Board of Directors on June 26, 2002
approved an arrears clearance mechanism for the DRC. Under the arrears clearance mechanism, representatives of ADF State Participants
(the Deputies) authorized an allocation of approximately UA 36.50 million of grant resources from the ninth replenishment of the ADF
(ADF-IX) to clear the entire stock of the DRC’s arrears to the Fund. The Deputies also authorized the use of approximately UA 11.77 million
of the residual Supplementary Financing Mechanism (SFM) resources from ADF-VIII as a partial payment against the DRC’s arrears on
charges to the ADB.

Post-Conflict Countries Assistance

The Post Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF) was established as a framework to assist countries emerging from conflicts in clearing their
arrears and prepare them for re-engagement with the donor communities in order to reactivate development assistance and help these
countries reach the HIPC decision point to qualify for debt relief after clearing their loan arrears to the Bank Group. The framework
entails the setting aside of a pool of resources through a separate facility with contributions from the ADF and other private donors and

Annual Report 2006

185186

Chapter 006 African Development Fund

allocations from the ADB's net income. Resources from the facility are provided on a case-by-case basis to genuine post-conflict countries
not yet receiving debt relief to fill financing gaps after maximum effort by the post-conflict country to clear its arrears to the Bank
Group. Contributions made by ADF to the PCCF are not used to clear the debt owed to the Fund by beneficiary post-conflict countries.
Contributions by the Fund to the PCCF are included in the Grants and Technical Assistance Activities in the Statement of Net Development
Resources.

NOTE F - SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

The Fund's initial subscriptions were provided by the Bank and the original State Participants to the Agreement, and states acceding to
the Agreement since the original signing date. Thereafter, further subscriptions were received from participants in the form of a special
general increase and ten general replenishments. Details of these movements are shown in the Statement of Subscriptions, Contributions
and Voting Power in Note 0.

The tenth general replenishment, approved by the Board of Governors resolution F/BG/2005/01 adopted on May 4, 2005, came into
effect on September 6, 2005, when State Participants deposited with the Fund instruments of subscription representing an aggregate
amount of 30.98 percent of the total intended subscription.

At December 31, 2006 cumulative contributions pledged on account of the MDRI amounted to UA 4.06 billion of which UA 43.25 million
had been paid. Consistent with the resolution approving the MDRI, the contributions paid entitle the State Participants to voting rights,
as reflected in Note O.

Gains or losses arising from translation of subscriptions and contributions received into UA are reported as cumulative exchange adjustment
on subscriptions in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

NOTE G - OTHER RESOURCES

In conformity with the findings of the UN General Assembly, the Board of Directors accepted that the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia no longer exists as a state under international law and hence is no longer a State Participant in the Fund or a member of
the Bank. Pursuant to a decision of the Board of Directors of the Fund in 1993, the subscriptions of the former Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia in the Fund less the unpaid portion (UA 12.97 million), are deemed to have become part of the permanent patrimony of
the Fund and are not returnable to any entity. Accordingly, the amounts of the paid subscriptions are reported as part of other resources
in the Statement of Net Development Resources.

Also included in other resources is a total of UA 144.60 million representing contributions by the Bank of UA 142.60 million, and by the
Government of Botswana of UA 2.00 million towards the Fund's activities, in accordance with Article 8 of the Agreement.

NOTE H - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Investments: Since the Fund carries its held-for-trading investments at market value, the carrying amount represents the fair value of
the portfolio. Fair values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are
based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Loans: All loans of the Fund are intended to provide concessional assistance to low-income regional member countries of the Bank. While
the principal amount is fully repayable, no interest is charged to the borrowers. However, a service fee of 0.75 percent of the disbursed and
outstanding balance and a commitment charge of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed balance are charged to cover the cost of administering
the loans. Due to the highly concessional nature of these loans, it is not meaningful to calculate fair values for outstanding loans.

Surplus for the year 40,418 19,709
Reserves at December 31 136,655 96,237

NOTE J - TRUST FUNDS

The Fund has available resources arising from contributions entrusted to it under Article 8 of the Agreement, which empowers the Fund
to receive other resources including grants from state participants, non-participating countries, and from any public or private body or
bodies.

At December 31, 2006, the undisbursed balance of trust fund resources was UA 3.86 million (2005: UA 4.06 million) representing the
balance of a grant received from Japan for the development of human resources in Africa.

Resources of the trust funds are kept separate from those of the ADF.
NOTE K - ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

Pursuant to Article 31 of the Agreement, the Fund reimburses the ADB for the estimated fair value of its use of the latter's offices, staff,
organization, services and facilities. The amount of such administrative expenses reimbursed is based on a predetermined cost-sharing
formula, which is driven, in large part, by the Fund’s relative share of the number of programs and projects executed during the year
by the Bank Group. The administrative expenses incurred by the Fund for the year amounted to UA 114.56 million (2005: UA 111.86
million).

NOTE L - RELATED PARTIES

The general operation of the Fund is conducted by a 12-member Board of Directors, of which 6 members are selected by the Bank. The
Bank exercises 50 percent of the ADF's voting power and the President of the Bank is the ex-officio President of the Fund. In accordance with its Agreement, the Fund utilizes the officers, staff, organization, services and facilities of the the Bank to carry out its functions, for which it reimburses the Bank as disclosed in Note K. In this regard, the Bank administers the resources of the Fund. The Fund
also administers trust funds entrusted to it by some of its State Participants.

On March 28, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The financial statements will be approved by the Board of Governors at its annual meeting in May 2007.

Annual Report 2006Chapter 006 African Development Fund

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON THE SPECIAL PURPOSE
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND TO THE BOARD
OF GOVERNORS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

We have audited the accompanying special purpose financial statements of the African Development Fund (‘the Fund’) prepared in compliance with the
accounting and financial reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B of the Special Purpose Financial Statements for the year ended
31 December 2006. These Special Purpose Financial Statements have been prepared for the purposes of submitting approved and audited Special Purpose
financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Article 26 (v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement Establishing the Fund, and are not intended
to be a presentation in conformity with a recognised accounting framework, such as, International Financial Reporting Standards.

This report is made solely to the Fund’s Board of Governors, as a body, in accordance with Article 26 (v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the Agreement Establishing
the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Fund’s Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund
and its Board of Governors as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Annual Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these financial statements in accordance with Article 26 (v), 35(1) and 35(3) of the
Agreement Establishing the Fund and the accounting policies set out in Note B to the special purpose financial statements. This responsibility includes:
designing, implementing and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable
in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing applicable to compliance auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the special purpose financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial statements. The
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the special purpose financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and presentation of
the special purpose financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion

In our opinion, the Special Purpose Financial Statements of the Fund have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the accounting and financial
reporting matters as set out in the accounting policies in note B of the Special Purpose Financial Statements for the year ending 31 December 2006.

are authorised by the Government of Nigeria
and made to HIPC, were previously presented
as direct reductions of equity. Under the new
accounting treatment, these transfers are
reported as expenses in the income statement. This accounting change is described in

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

NOTE A - NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund or NTF) was established under an agreement signed on February 26, 1976 (the Agreement) between the
African Development Bank (ADB or the Bank) and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The African Development Bank, which is headquartered
in Abidjan, Céte d'Ivoire, manages the resources of the Fund on behalf of the Government of Nigeria. The purpose of the Fund is to assist
in the development efforts of the poorer ADB regional member countries. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for
a period of 30 years from the date the Agreement became effective and that such sunset date may be extended by mutual agreement
between the Bank and Federal Republic of Nigeria. The current agreement terminated on April 25, 2006. In May 2006, the Nigerian
Authorities granted a 1-year extension of the Agreement to April 25, 2007. On March 27, 2007, the Government of Nigeria granted a
further 1-year extension of the NTF Agreement to April 25, 2008.

With the exception of loans, all balance sheet items are carried at values that approximate realizable values. All NTF loans are sovereignguaranteed and their carrying values on the balance sheet are not intended to represent realizable values in the event of liquidation.
However, as provided by the NTF agreement, in the event of termination of the NTF, the Bank shall within a reasonable period after the
termination date, transfer to Nigeria such of the resources of the Fund as are in the possession of the Bank and are not required for the
purpose of settlement of any of the outstanding obligations of the Fund, and shall thereafter transfer the balance of such resources as
and when received by the Bank.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

he financial statements of the Fund are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) promulgated by
he International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention
except for certain financial assets that are carried at fair value. The significant accounting policies of the Fund are summarized below.

Revenue recognition

nterest income is accrued on a time basis and recognized based on the effective interest method during the time an investment or
loan is outstanding and held by the Fund. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows through
he expected life of the financial asset to the asset's net carrying amount. Commitment fees are accrued in arrears for unutilized loan
acilities.

ncome from investments includes realized and unrealized gains and losses on held-for-trading investments.
Functional and presentation currencies
he Fund conducts its operations in U.S. dollars, and has determined that its functional currency is the U.S. dollar. In accordance with

Article Vil, section 7.3, of the Agreement, the financial statements are presented in Units of Account (UA).

he value of the Unit of Account is defined in Article 5.1 (b) of the Agreement Establishing the Bank as equivalent to one Special Drawing
Right (SDR) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or any unit adopted for the same purpose by the IMF.

 

Annual Report 2006

201202

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Currency translation

Income and expenses are translated to UA at the rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities are translated from U.S. dollars to UA at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Translation differences are included in reserves under cumulative currency translation adjustment (CCTA). Changes in CCTA are reported in the statement of changes in equity. Capital replenishments
are recorded in UA at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of receipt. Translation gains and losses on conversion of currencies into
U.S. dollars are included in the determination of net income.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Fund assumes related contractual rights or obligations.

1. Financial assets
The Fund classifies its financial assets in the following categories: held-for-trading financial assets, loans and receivables, and held-tomaturity investments. Management determines the classification of its investments upon initial recognition.

(i) — Held-for-trading financial assets
All held-for-trading assets are carried at fair value through the income statement. Investments in the held-for-trading portfolio are
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Held-for-trading financial assets are measured at fair value, with
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.

(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans include outstanding balances receivable from borrowers in respect of amounts disbursed. The Fund has also classified
accrued income and receivables from loans and investments and other sundry amounts as receivables. Loans and receivables are
non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the
Fund provides money, goods or services directly to a borrower with no intention of trading the receivable. Loans and receivables
are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments
The Fund has classified its investments in certain debt securities as held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Fund's management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. Held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective
interest method.

(iv) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily
convertible to a known amount of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and have a time to maturity upon
acquisition of 3 months or less.

Purchases and sales of held-for-trading and held-to-maturity investments are recognized on a trade-date basis, which is the date the
Fund commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans are recognized when cash is advanced to the borrowers.

Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the Fund has
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.

Annual Report 2006Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 006

2. Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities include accounts payable and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized
upon discharge, cancellation or expiration.

Impairment of financial assets

he Fund assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is
impaired. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) and that
loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be
reliably estimated. Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable evidence that comes to
he attention of the Fund.

f the Fund determines that there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred on a loan, receivable or held-to-maturity
investment carried at amortized cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the
resent value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the financial
asset's original effective interest rate. The estimated impairment loss may arise from delays that may be experienced in receiving amounts
due, and the impairment calculations reflect management's best estimate of the effect of such delays.

he impairment loss is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the asset through the use of an allowance account and recognized
in the income statement. If a loan or held-to-maturity investment has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined under the contract. Interest and charges are accrued on all loans, including
hose in arrears.

Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Fair value disclosures

he fair values of investments that are quoted in active markets are based on current bid prices. Fair values of financial assets listed in
inactive markets or unlisted securities are determined by using valuation techniques that incorporate the maximum use of market data
inputs. These valuation techniques include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing
models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.

 

Fair values for financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available have been determined using methodologies and
assumptions that necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial instruments
could be exchanged in a current transaction, or whether they are exchangeable at all, is not readily determinable. Management believes
these methodologies and assumptions are reasonable; however, the values actually realizable in a sale might differ from the fair values
disclosed.

The methods and assumptions used by the Fund in estimating the fair values of financial instruments are as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amount is the fair value.

Investments: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.

Annual Report 2006

203204

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Loans: The Fund does not sell its loans, nor does it believe there is a comparable market for its loans. The fair value of loans reported in
these financial statements represents management's best estimates of the present value of the loans’ expected cash flows. Fair values
are estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on the year-end market equivalent lending rate in that currency, adjusted for
estimated credit risk.

Retained earnings
Retained earnings of the Fund consist of amounts allocated to reserves from prior years’ income and unallocated current year ne
income.

Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Actual results could differ from such estimates. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience
and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The most significan
judgments and estimates are summarized below:

(i) Impairment losses on assets carried at amortized cost
The Fund first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets. If the Fund determines tha
no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, that asset is included in a group of financia
assets with similar credit characteristics and collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective
evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a ‘loss event’) an
that loss event (or events) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets an
can be reliably estimated. Objective evidence that a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable evidence tha
a financial asset or group of assets is impaired includes observable evidence that comes to the attention of the Fund.

the Fund determines there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments
arried at amortized cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amoun
nd the present value of its estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted a
e financial asset's original effective interest rate.

a

 

o

e carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in
e income statement.

(ii) Fair values of financial instruments

e fair values of financial instruments that are not quoted in active markets are determined by using valuation techniques.
Valuation techniques, for example, models that are used to determine fair values, are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified
ersonnel independent of the area that created them. All models are periodically calibrated to ensure that outputs reflect actual
ata and comparative market prices. To the extent practical, models use only observable data; however, areas such as credit risk
oth own and counterparty), volatilities and correlations require management to make estimates. Changes in assumptions about
ese factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.

(iii) Held-to-maturity investments

e Fund follows the guidance of IAS 39 on classifying certain financial assets as held-to-maturity. This classification requires
significant judgment. In making the judgment to designate an asset as held-to-maturity, the Fund makes a positive determination
as to its intention and ability to hold such investments to maturity.

 

 

Annual Report 2006Nigeria Trust Fund Chapter 006

NOTE C- CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND THE EFFECT OF NEW AND REVISED INTERNATIONAL
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS

1. Change in accounting treatment for the transfer of income approved by the Board of Governors

n the current year, the Fund changed its accounting treatment for the transfer of income approved by the Board of Governors of the Bank.
Article 1 section 1.02 of the protocol agreement between the Government of Nigeria and the Bank, authorizes the allocation of part of
he net income of the Fund for the purpose of contribution by NTF to HIPC. In prior years, the Fund accounted for such transfers from
net income as similar to dividends and reported them as a reduction in equity. This previous accounting for the transfer of income placed
emphasis on the role of the Governors acting on behalf of the Government of Nigeria and viewed the transfer as being constructively a
ransaction with the owner of the Fund. In effect, the Fund viewed these transactions as being equivalent to distributions whereby the
shareholder constructively received these funds and simultaneously contributed them to the designated recipient. The Fund effected the
distributions via transfers to the designated recipient. This accounting reflected the shareholder's view of the substance and intent of
hese transfers and had been consistently applied over the years.

Description of the change in treatment

n view of the fact that the amounts allocated were not paid directly to the Government of Nigeria, the Fund has re-evaluated its
accounting treatment of these types of transactions and determined that with effect from 2006, all such approved distributions would
e reported as expenses within the Income Statement in the year that the distribution is approved.

his change in accounting principle has been applied retrospectively and has therefore resulted in the restatement of prior year
comparative figures. Net income distributed previously treated as a reduction in reserves in 2005 amounted to UA 0.60 million.

2. New and Revised IFRS

he International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and its International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued
some new and revised Standards and Interpretations which took effect during the year ended December 31, 2006. These were either
inapplicable to the Fund or did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 

At the date of authorization of these financial statements, a number of International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations
had been promulgated, but will be effective for periods after December 31, 2006. Of these, the two that are relevant to the Fund are
IFRS 7, “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” and amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements — Capital Disclosures”.
IFRS 7, which becomes effective for the Fund's financial statements for the period beginning January 1, 2007, introduces additional
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about exposures to risks arising from financial instruments and how entities manage those risks.
Management is reviewing the additional disclosures that are required starting in 2007 as a result of the implementation of this standard.
The amendments to IAS 1, also expected to be effective for the 2007 financial statements of the Fund, are not expected to have any
significant impact on the financial reporting of the Fund. None of the other new and amended standards and interpretations are expected
to have any significant impact on the Fund’s financial statements.

NOTE D - INVESTMENTS

Country credit risk: Country credit risk includes potential financial losses arising from a country’s inability or unwillingness to service
its obligations to the Fund. The Fund manages country credit risk through financial policies and lending strategies, including individual
country exposure limits and overall creditworthiness assessments. These include the assessment of each country’s macroeconomic performance as well as its socio-political conditions and future growth prospects.

The individual country exposure to the Fund on outstanding loans as at December 31, 2006 was made up as follows:

Slight differences may occur in totals due to rounding.

At December 31, 2006, the Fund had UA 38.36 million of loans which were committed but not yet disbursed (2005: UA 51.32 million).
The interest rate on these undisbursed loans has been fixed at between 2% to 4% per annum.

Currency rate risk: Currency risk is mitigated by the Fund's policy of holding all of its investments and loans in U.S. dollars, the currency
in which the Fund's resources are denominated.

Annual Report 2006 2nChapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

Interest rate risk: The Fund is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its portfolio of loans and investments, substantially all of which
have fixed interest rates. These instruments are subject to interest rate repricing upon maturity or sale. Investments in the Fund's held-fortrading portfolio reprice within one year or less and are managed against a highly liquid reference benchmark. Investments in the Fund's
held-to-maturity portfolio are aligned against a fixed maturity benchmark. Repricing risk is not considered significant in comparison to
the Fund’s equity resources, and is accordingly not hedged.

The Fund's risk management policies and processes are substantially unchanged from the prior year. Interest rate risk positions as at
December 31, 2006 and 2005 were as follows:

Liquidity risk: In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the Fund’s investment management policy ensures it has sufficient liquid assets to
meet its disbursement obligations. The Fund’s liquidity risk is substantially reduced by the fact that its funding is provided by equity, not
borrowings.

NOTE J - RELATED PARTIES

The Nigeria Trust Fund is administered by the African Development Bank. The ADB conducts the general operations of the NTF on the
basis of the terms of the Agreement and in consultation with the Government of Nigeria. The NTF utilizes the offices, staff, organization,
services and facilities of the Bank and reimburses the Bank for its share of the costs of such facilities, based on an agreed-upon costsharing formula (refer to Note H). The net amount outstanding at December 31, 2006 in respect of the Fund's share of administrative
expenses was UA 0.05 million (2005: UA 0.19 million) and is included in Accounts Receivable on the balance sheet.

NOTE K - APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

On March 28, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Bank authorized these financial statements for issue to the Board of Governors. The
financial statements will be approved by the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank at its annual meeting in May 2007.

Annual Report 2006

Chapter 006 Nigeria Trust Fund

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF
THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK IN RESPECT OF THE NIGERIA TRUST FUND

We have audited the annual financial statements of the Nigeria Trust Fund (the Fund), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2006, and the
income statement, the statement of changes in equity and cash flow statement for the year then ended, a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory notes, as set out in notes A to K. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein, for the purpose of
submitting approved and audited financial statements to the Board of Governors as required by Section 8.2 of the Agreement Establishing the Fund. This
report is made solely to the Board of Governors of the African Development Bank, as a body, in accordance with Section 8.2 of the Agreement Establishing
the Fund. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Board of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Fund and the
Board of Governors of the Bank as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Management’s Responsibility for the Annual Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards, and in the manner required by the Agreement establishing the Fund. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether
the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected
depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting principles used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fund as at 31 December 2006, and of its financial
performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.

Emphasis of matter

Without qualifying our opinion, we draw attention to the going concern status of the Fund as set out in Note A to the financial statements, which indicates
that the Fund was established under an agreement signed on 26 February 1976 (the Agreement) between the African Development Bank and the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. The Agreement stipulates that the Fund shall be in effect for a period of 30 years from the date of the Agreement and that the termination
date may be extended by mutual agreement between the Bank and the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The current agreement terminated on April 25, 2006 and
in May 2006 the Federal Republic of Nigeria granted a one-year extension of the Agreement to April 25, 2007. In addition, on March 27, 2007, a further
one-year extension was granted by the Federal Republic of Nigeria to April 25, 2008. These conditions indicate the existence of an uncertainty which may
cast significant doubt about the Fund’s ability to continue as a going concern.

*Origin of Supply (OOS) for Bank Group procurement and disbursenment purposes means the country from which the goods/services supplied
originated as evidenced by the contract for procurement, and by the summary statement of items which accompanies the invoice or contract
supporting an application for withdrawal. For example, a French car purchased from a local dealer in Céte d'Ivoire would be classified under

the code for France.

**The nature of these disbursements makes it impossible to attribute them to any specific supplying or originating country until expenditures
have been reported to the Bank. However, these disbursements will be integrated into the reported country shares as soon as the relevant

invoices are received and processed.

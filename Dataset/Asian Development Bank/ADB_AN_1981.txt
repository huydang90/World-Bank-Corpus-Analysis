DURING 1981, the year which marked its 15th anniversary,
ihe Bank provided record landing support for ita developing
member countries (DMCs) and expandad substantially its
co-financing arrangements and borrowings in international
capital markets,

Pursuing its goal of fostering economic and social
development in the Aslan and Pacific region, the Bank continved to give special attention to three priority sectors:
agriculture and agro-industry (particularly food production),
energy (especially the increased use of indigenous energy
resources} and social infrastructure such as water supply,
education, housing, urban development, health care and
population planning.

Bank lending during tha year amounted to $1,878 million
compared with $1,436 million in 1986 and $776 million in
1976. Total disbursements amounted to $667 million
against $579 million in 1980 and $326 million in 1976. The
average size of loans rose from $24.3 million in 1980 to
$29.4 miltion in 1981.

Other highlights:

* Review of the Bank's ordinary capital resources continued to determine the appropriate size of a Third
General Capital Increase.

* Discussions commenced with donor countries for a
third replenishment of the Aslan Development Fund
{ADF) fo finance the Bank’s concessional lending program over the four-year period 1983-88.

* Co-financing of Bank-assisted projects provided by external sources rose to a new record of $627 million compared with $391 million in 1980.

* Bank borrowings reached a new high mark of $668
million compared with $458 million in 1980,

* The Bank completed Its Regional Energy Survey and
Sel new poallcy directions tor its operations in the Energy
sector.

* A Study of the Bank's Operational Priorities and Plans
for the 1980s, which aims at evolving mediurn-term operational strategies for Bank lending up to lhe end of 1987,
was launched.

LENDING ACTIVITIES: During the year, the Bank approved 57 loans for 54 projects In 15 DMCs, compared with
59 loans for 68 projects in 17 DMCs in 1980. Despite the
decline In the number of loans the amount of jending was
higher, reflecting mainly the programming of certain large
projects and the inclusion of five large sector loans during
the year, and partly inflation in project costs. Loans from
ordinary capital resources (OCR) amounted to $1,147
million, an increase of 19.6 per cent over the corresponding
figure of $958.5 million in 1980, white loans from Special
Funds (SF), amounting to $534 million, showed an increase
of 11.2 per cenl over the 1980 concessional landing figure
of $477 million. In 1981, almost 92 per cent of SF loans went
to DMCs which had a per capita GNP of less than $300 In
1980,

past experience, it ls esiimated that the total cost of the
subtoan projecis lo be financed by the six DFI loans will be
about $851 million. The projects and programs to be tinanced by the sector and program loans will involve an
estimated tolal investment cost of $698 million.

During the year, 23 projects involved co-financing, with
$627 million contributed by co-financiers and $827 million
by the Bank. As in the past, the Dulk of the Bank's cofinancing was with bilateral and multilateral official
sources which together contyibuted $481 million or 77 per

LENDING BY SECTOR: Agricultura and Agro-Industry
continued to account for the largest share of Bank tending

32.3 per cent, compared with 32.6 per cent in 1980. Bank
loans supported improvements to irrigation, drainage and
flood control facilities, agricultural support services and
feeder rvuad networks; construction of a multipurpose dam;
integrated agricultural and rural development; coconut
and cotton production; foodgrain storage; crop intensification programs; and forastry, fisheries and livestock
development.

The stare of the Energy sector in total lending rose from
26.6 per cent in 1980 to 28.6 per cent in 1981 — an increase
for the third year in succession, Lending for energy-related
projects included development of indigenous energy resources such as hydropower and natural gas, rehabilitation
and expansion of power generation, distrivution and transmission systems and axtension of rural electritication.

Social infrastructure pipjects accounted fur 21.7 per cent
of Bank lending compared with ahout 16 per cent in 1980.
This was the largest sectoral increase, both in absoluie
ferms and as a proportion of total Bank lending. Loans for
the social sector were for projects designed to improve
water supply and sewerage systems, provide low-income
housing and develop urban infrastructure, and upgrade
educational and health and population programs in DMCs.

To meet the medium and long-term credit requirements
of small and madium-scale industries, largely in the private
sector, Bank londing to development finance institutions in
1981 was increased by more than 60 per cent in nominal
terms over 1980 and accounted for 12.2 per cent af total
Bank lending. Conversely, there was a sharp decline in
Bank lending for Transport and Gommunirations — 4.3 per
cent of total jending compared with 15.6 per cent in 1980,
reflecting primarily changes in sectoral priorities in DMCs.

Agriculiure and Agro-Industry: Agriculture remains ite
most important economic sector in most of the DMCs and
the Bank continued to increase the range and volume of its
lending and lechinical assistance for agriculture and rural
davelopment in 1981. In addition to 17 project loans, the
Bank extended three program loans to enhance utilization
of production potential through crop intensification programs. Simllarly, it approved two sector loans to accelerate
and improve implementation of icrigalion development and
rehabilitation. :

Bank lending to this sector in 1981 amounted to $542
million in 22 loans, compared with $468 rnillion in the same
number of loans in 1980.

Energy: The sharp increases in the price of energy in recent years have saverely affected the economies of most
OMCs, the majority of which are highly dependent on ismported oif. ln an effort to provide a comprehensive assassment of Enargy sector needs and prospects, the Bank in
1981 completed and published its Regional Energy Survey
which highlighted three principal dimensions of the energy
problem: {i) the heavy and increasing foreign exchange
burden imposed on DMGs by rising oil prices; (ii) the high
capital costs associaled with developing indigenous
energy resources as alternatives to imported oil; andSPARES ETAT AAT AAT RTO EEN UN.

{ii} the greater dernands being placed on the already diminished non-commercial energy. resources of rural areas
due to higher cosis of allernative commercial fuels.
Based on these findings, the Bank will seek lo increase
its energy assistance, diversify such support ta inctude a
wider range of Energy sector needs of DMCs, and to make
special efforts through co-financing to mobilize additional
external resources for this sector. Plans were also made for

a meeting of major donor agencies in Manila in early 1982 
io review the scope and coverage of ongoing and planned
energy development planning activities in DMCs and to promote greater coordination of such efforts in the future.

Bank landing to the Energy sector in 1981 amounted ta
$4809 million in 11 loans, 25.5 per cent more than the $382
million in‘nine loans approved in 1980.

Social Infrastructure: Most DMGs have assigned high
priority to the provision of adequate social infrastructure —
water supply, sewerage, housing, education and health
facilities — especially to the poorer sections of their
populations. In response, Bank assistance to these sectors
has risen sharply from less than 10 per cent of total lending
in 1976 to nearly 22 per cent in 1981.

{n its project lending activities in the Water Supply and
Sewerage sector, the Sank has been endeavoring in recent
years to auhieve a balanced spread between major urban
water and sewerage systems and relatively simple water
and sanitation systems in provincial and ‘rural areas. In

(1968-70 average) (1979-81 average

1981, he Bank approved four loans for this sector — twoin
the Republic of Korea and one each In Indonesia and Philippines --- to improve the supply of potable water in several
primary and secondary urban centers, reduce the problems
caused by overloaded and obsolete sewerage systems, as
well as lo make extensive environmerital studies of the Han
River Basin.

Rapid population and urban growth constilules an
urgent and cumplex social problem for many DMCs, Two
loans for Urban Oevelopment approved by the Bank in 1981
will help improve the living conditions of the pour in Medan,
Indenesia’s fourth largest city, and in six major urban
centers, Including Seoul, in the Republic of Karca.

While continuing to emptiasize technical and vocational
aducation, tne Bank has also supported other areas of
education. Loans approved in 1981 for three projects in the
Education sector will help Indonesia, Papua New Guinea
and Philippines to improve the quality of selected educalional programs and lhereby augment their manpower
rasources and upgrada occupational skills, A fourth project

the Community Schools Project in Bangladesh—marked
the Bank’s first involvement in non-formal education.

tn addition, the Bank approved three loans for the Health
and Population sector during the year — oné each in Burma, Malaysia and Pakistan. This is in line with the Bank’s
strategy of supporting primary health care services, including population planning, and improving health delivery
systems.During 1981, Bank lending for social infrastructure projects amounted to $364.8 million, compared with $227.6
million in 1980, Of the 1981 total, loans for Water Supply
and Sewerage projects amounted to $123.7 million ($107.2
million in 1980), Urban Development to $99.3 million ($40
million in 1980}, Education to $82.5 million ($65 million in
1980) and Health and Population to $59.3 million ($15.6
million in 1980).

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals: Most OMCs accord
high priority to industrialization for achieving baianced
aconomic growth. In recognition of the role of small and
modium-scale industries in generating employment oppartunities and achieving a wider ownership of the means of
industrial production, the Bank attaches importance lo the
development of inslitutional infrastructure necessary to
promote anc support such industries. In 1981, the Bank approved a $13 million loan to the Republic of Korea for the
Small and Mediuin Industry Management and Technology
Institute Project.

During the year, Bank activities in this sector also tocused on the follow-up of earlier tectinical agsislance for
the development and upgrading of national capahilities to
conduct surveys arid exploration programs for the promotian of mineral resources development.

Development Banks: The Bank continued to assist the
growth of small and mediurt-scale industries, mostly in the
private sector, through credit lines to DFls which are able
to channel and.disperse medium and long-term funds to a
jarga number of industrial development projects too small
for direct Bank financing

During the year, the Bank made six loans to DFis
amounting to $204 million compared with six loans amounting to $127 million in 1980. These ranged in size from $4
million to the Development Bank of Weslern Sameua to $60
million to the Korea Long Term Credit Bank.

Transport and Communications: Recent sharp increases in fuel prices have obliged many OMCs to review
iheir investment priorities, and although adequate
transportation infrastructure remains important in overall
cconomic growth, the share of Bank lending to this sector
nas declined in recent years.

Development priorities within the sector have also
changed, from major road networks, large ports and airports to secondary and feeder roads, rural roads and secondary and minor ports. Transportation is also ofien included
as a companent of integrated agricultural development
projects.

(n 1981,lne Bank made two loans to this sector amounting to $72.4 millian compared with nine loans for $223
million in 1980. The Bank’s first loan {o the Republic of
Maldives, $1 million for an inierisland Transport Project,
will provide regular Shipping services between widely scatlered atolls. A $71.4 million Joan to Thailarid will help
facilitate the future economic and social development of
the southern region of the country through improvements
at Songkhla and Phuket Ports, These new lacilities will encourage Imperts and sxparts of the southern reglon to be
handled direct at these ports rather than through Bangkok
and Penang and thus promote substantial savings in
transshipment and inland lransportation costs.

DISBURSEMENTS AND LOAN ADMINISTRATION:
Loan disbursemenis from OCR and SF totalled $867 miltion
during 1981, compared with $579 million in the preceding
year. Disbursements under OCR loans improved from $429
million to $518 million. There was, however, a marginal
reduction in disbursements under SF loans from $150"

-million to $149 million. This fall was mainly attributable lo

the relatively long implementation periods of most loans
under disbursement, shortage of local funds which hampered the progress of certain projects and implementation
problems in some major borrowing couniries, As al the end
of 1981, cumulative disbursements wera $2,823 milllon from
OCR and $887 million from SF.

A total of 367 loans was under administration in 1981,
Nineteen projects were completed.

During lhe yeas lhere were significant developments in
project monitoring and supervision. In the course of the
year 345 full project reviews were carried oul. Country profiles of implementation performance in four OMCs were
completed. In addition, project reviews were intensified and
studics carried oul on how lo improve existing administrative and reporting arrangements concerning the
implementation of co-financed projects with a view to praviding more up-to-date information lo co-financiers,

During (981, the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement
under Asian Development Bank Loans was revised and a
Procurement Handbook prepared. The Bank also carried
out studies on consultant services in sume DMCs. Three
seminars — two on procurement and one on project implementation management — were held in Manila.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: Tha Bank provided technical assistance (other than regional technical assistance}
for 49 projects, compared wilt 58 projects in 1980, while the
fotal amount increased from $14.2 mlilion in 1980 to $14.8
million in 1881. Of this, project proparalory tectinical

technical assistance projects approved in 1981 was due
mainly to the longer lead time required to process some
large technical assistance projects and the consequent
deferment of Bank consideralion of these projects from
4981 to the early part of 1962,

On a sectoral basis, 58.2 per cant of the total amount of
technical assistance approved in 1981 was for Agriculture
and Agro-Industry, compared with 69,2 per cent in 1980.
About 18.6 per cent was provided for the Energy sector,
covering mainly rural electrification and mini-hydropower
development; and the rest for the Transport and Gommunications seclor; Social Infrastructure; and the Industry
and Non-Fuel Minerals sector.

REGIONAL ACTIVITIES: During the yaar, tha Bank initiated a Sludy of ihe Bank’s Operational Priorities and
Pians for the 1980s and completed and published the
Regional Energy Survey . Other regional activities included
a Second Fish Market Study, a Study of Agricultural Research Facllities and Requirements in the South Pacific, an
industrial Survey of the South Pacific, the Establishment of
a Genetic Resources Laboratory al ihe International Crops
Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT} and
several training programs and seminars.

POST-EVALUATION: Post-evaluation is emerging as an
important management tool and as a key input for policy
making. During 1981, the Post-Evaluation Office (PEO) postevaluated 35 projects which were reviewed in 30 separate
reports. These projects were underlaken in 13 countries
and covered ten sectors of Bank operations. Since its
establishment in 1978, PEO has evalualed a total of 78 projects or nearly halt of the Bank projects completad as of the
beginning of 1981. Ouring 1981, as in the preceding two
years, PEO focused on the preparation of Project Perfor
mance Audit Reports which evaluate, verify and audit the
findings of Project Completion Reports prepared by the
respective project departments far completed projacts.
During the year, PEO also issued its Third Annual Review of
Post-Evaluation Reports which summarized the findings
and recommendations of the post-evaluation reports e¢lrculated in the previous year. It highlighted (he substantial
achievements of Bank-assisted projects and drew attention
to some of the major difficulties experienced during
implementation.

POLICY REVIEWS: In an effort to respond more effectively to the changing needs of the region, the Bank in 1981
carried out several major policy reviews and studies, the
principal among which were those relating to proposals for
a Third General Capital Increase of the Bank and a Third
Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Tha
Board also. considered and took decisions on Arrangements for Resource Mobilization of the Tectinical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) and new TASF Regvlations.

The Board approved a lechnical assistance grant for a
Study of the Bank's Operational Priorities and |’lans for the
1980s, Othor policy papers considered by the Board included: Role of the Bank in the Energy Sector, Annual Review of
Financial Policies, Methodolagy ior Determining the Lending Rate of the Bank, Exchange Risk Pooling System,
Review of the Use of the Two-Envelope Systein for engagemeni of consultants, Establishment of a Bank Resident Office and Co-Financing,

LENDING RATE: The Bank's lending rate on ordinary °
loans was set at 9.25 per cent per annurn effective 31 March
1981. The rate was revised to 10.10 per cent in July and remained unchanged for the rest of the year.

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES: The authorized
capital stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1981 siood at
$8,404.5 million (SDR 7,226.6 million), of which the sub
scribed portion amounted to $8,296.8 million (SDR 7,128.1
million).

 

1 The lending rate was raised to 11 per cent per annum on ardinacy loans
approved after i January 1982.As of 31 Devernber 1981, total subscriptions under the
Second General Capital Increase amounted to $4,723.9
million (SOR 4,058.5 million). The amount of $80.6 million
{SDR 69.2 million), representing the full entitlement of lwo
members and a partial entitlement of one member, ramained unsubseribed.!

During 1981, the Bank undertook 11 borrowings amount:
ing lo the equivalent of $668.5 million, compared with
$457.8 mitlion in 1980. Because of the relatively favorable
terms In the Japanese market, about halt of the total
amount borrowed was denominated in Japanese yen. For
th second year in succession, the Barik made two public
bond Issues in the Swiss capital market where intaresi
rates were again relatively low. The Bank made two public
bond issues in the Federal Republic of Germany. [wo-Year
US Dollar Bonds totalling $70 million were placed with central banks and monetary authorities in 29 member coun
iries. The Bank also undertook two private placements in
ihe Middle East. The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted by arnounl, was 9.16 years, whicti had the elfect of increasing the average life of outstanding borrow.
ings from 5.78 years at the end of 1980 to 7.08 years at the
end of 1981.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND: As ithe period covered
by the second replenishment of the Aslan Development
Fund (ADF lil) is to end in 1982, the Bank commenced
discussions with ADF donor countries on the third ADF
replenishment (ADF iV) to finance its concessional lending
program over lhe four-year period 1983-86, During 1981,
there were two meetings of ADF donor countries held in duly and November. The replenishment negotiations were expected to be concluded in early 1982. During the year, some
at the developing member countrias indicated thelr inten:
tion to make modest contributions to ADF.

As lo the implementation of ADF Ul, the Bank received
during 1981 instruments of contributlon from Italy,
Netherlands and New Zealand. With the receipt of these, all
the 1/ developed member countries of the Bank had
become contributors to the replenishment. The payment of
ihe second insialment of the United States contsibutron to
ADF Ill made in December 1980 and the consequent release
in January 1981 of the third instalments of the other conInibutions to ADF Ill made available the resources needed
by the Rank to finance its concessional lending program
for 1981. z

During the year, the Bank received another $3.5 million
from the United States as partial payment towards the last
$60 million of its contribution to the first Asian Devetopment Fund replenishment {ADF iI}. The Board of Governors
authorized a further extension of the deadline for payment
by the United States of the remaining $56.5 million of ils
ADF I contribution.

Total ADF resources at the end of 1981, including contributed resources, set-aside resources and nat income
Stood at $3,185 million. Loan commitments from these
resources amounted to $2,928 raillion, leaving a balance of
$257 miliion, of which abous $90 milllan remained available
for loan commitments after allowance for exchange rate
fluctuations,

FIFTEEN YEARS OF ACTIVITIES: The Bank completed
15 years of activities in 1984. A review of its operations
since it opened ils doors for business on 19 December 1966
underlines the increasingly important catalytic role that iL
has played in pramoting economic and social developmen!
in the region.

At the end of 1981, cumulative Bank lending had reached
nearly $10 billion, of which nearly $2.6 billion was lent to the
poorest DMCs from the Asian Development Fund. Every
dollar lent by the Bank is matched with an average additional investment of about $1.5 by the borrowing countries
ang, in- certain cases, by outside co-financiers. The Bank's
total lending of about $10 billion Is thus expected Lo lead to
additional investments of about $16 billion, of which approximately 84 per cent would be provided by the borrowing
DMGs and about 16 per cent by co-financiers.

Though much sinaller amounts are involved in the Bank’s
iechnical assistance activities, their impact on DMCs —especially the smaller and less developed — has heen
significant. The bulk of the Bank's tacthinical assistance has
bean directed towards designing development projects for

TOTAL: 6,799.4 millionwhich the Bank itself or other institutions subsequently
provide financing. The Bank has been Involved in technical
assistance totalling $103 million for 510 projects, both af a
country-specific and regional nature. The catalytic role of
these activities is reflectect In the fact that an outlay of
$48.6 million in technical assistance resulted in Sank loans
totalling $3.6 billion.

Co-financing has become an important eloment in Bank
operations. At the end of 1981, 112 loan projects involved
co-financing of over $2.5 billlon, comprising over $1.2 dillion
from bilateral sources, $1 billion from multilateral sources
and $293 milllon from export credit and commercial
sources, Apart from the additional resources it brings to
meet the development needs of the Bank’s DMGs, cofinancing enhances the impact of Bank assistance and
enables the financing of large projects, the financing reéquirements of which could nol otherwise be met by the
Bank itself.

Over the past 15 years, in its lending and technical
assislance activities, the Bank has endeavored to respond
to the specific economic requirements of its DMCs and the

economic mainstay of the Asian and Pacific region, has
received the targest share of Bank loans and technical
assistance. In recent years, energy has also emeryed as a
priority sector in the wake of successive oil price increases.
Social infrastructure projects — such as water supply,
education, urban development, health and population control — have recorded an even more spectacular increase.
Physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, ports and
telacommunications, as also industry and non-fuel
minerals, have declined relatively as a percentage of total
Bank lending but continue to receive substantial Bank sup:

Since the inception of the Bank, there has been a growing awareness In DMCs of tha basic human needs of the
poorest segments of their populations. In response, the
Bank has formulated strategies to insure a wider distribution of benefits frorn the projects it supparts.

tn addition to financing the foreign exchange costs of individual projects, the Bank, since 1974, has also been
financing in suitable cases a proportion of local currency

Excludes regional activities,costs. More recently, it added two new categories — sector
and program lending — to its array of tools for transferring
resources to OMGs. The Bank has also emphasized the application of appropriate technology in the development
Projects it supports, particularly in DMCs with serious
unemployment problems.

{thas also encouraged the grawth of small and mediumseale industries, which have high employment potential,
through loans to development finance institutions whlch, in
turn, are relent to a large number of enterprises, mostly in
the private sector,

On the resources side, tha Bank's subscribed capital
resources have grawn from about $970 million at ihe end of
1967 tc $8.3 billion at the end of 1981. The capitat paid-in
has grown trom about $485 million to about $1.6 billion over
the same period, allhough as a share of subscribed capital
it has fallen from about 50 par cent to 19 per cent. The
callable capital, which serves as a backing for the Bank's

bond issues in the world’s capital markets, has grown dur-,

ing the same period from about $485 million (50 per cent of
subscribed capital) to about $6.7 billion (81 per cent of
subscribed capital}.

With the rapid growth in ordinary lending activities, the
Bank is increasingly relying on funds borrowed from the In
‘tarnational capital markets. At the end of 1981, the Bank
had raised nearly $3.1 billion from the international capital
markets of which $2.3 billion was outstanding. It had also
mobilized from its developed member countries Speciat
Funds resources of over $3 billion for concessional tending
to its poorer DMCs.

The first 15 years of the Bank have witnessed significant
improvements in other areas of its operational activities
and In its administrative structure: lt has explored ways to
promote regional and sub-regional cooperation through a
series of regional surveys; it has strengthaned its links with
other Institutions seeking to pramote socio-ecenomic
growth in the region; it has improved its loan and technical
assisiance procassing arrangements; It has stepped up iis
economic research activities in line with immediate and
long-term operational needs; and if has strengthened its
post-evaluation activities.

The Bank's staff strength has also grown in line with its
expanding activitics and the need to respond more effectively to the changing needs of its DMCs. The number of
Bank staff, professional and supporting, increased from
187 In 1967 to over 1,200, drawn from 33 member countries,
in 1981,

OUTLOOK: Based on its experience over the first 15
years, the Bank in 1981 startad a comprehensive review and
assessment of its operational plans and priorities in the
1980s, During the year, many DMCs were adversely atfected by general econamic recession, sluggish demand
for their exports and very high interest rates in the interna:
tional capital markets which increased the burden of
financing balance of payments deficits. Although the
economic performance of DMCs was generally satisfactory
during the year, thera can be little doubt that their external
resource requirements will grow steadily (hroughout the
1980s, especially if they are to maintain ihe momentum of
their development efforts.

As the Bank moves Into the 1980s, therefore, it must gear
itself towards haiping its DMCs meet three main
challenges: (i) raising food production; (ii) carrying out the
necessary structural adjusiments to cope with higher oil
prices; and {iil} providing adequate social infrastructure to
meet the basic human needs of their growing populations.

The Bank will endaavor to increase substantially its cofinancing, particularly with commercial and export credit
sources. |i will also look at ways in which it can assist further in the development of the region's private sector. In
order to promote private investmen| and revitalize private
industries, it will examine other techniques such as equity
financing.

To help DMCs meet these goals, the Bank must seek an
increase in its resources sufficient to support lending
levels during the period 1983-87 commensurate with the
projected requirements of its DMCs, Proposals for a third
increase in the Bank's capital stock and a further replenishment of ADF resources have been presenied to member
couniries and il |s expected that decisions regarding these
proposals will be made in 1982.HIGHLIGHTS OF THE BANK'S OPERATIONS, 1967: 1981

FiECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

DURING 1981, the Bank’s developing member countries
(DMCs), as a group, continued to have an overall economic
growth rate higher than the average for other groups of
developing countries, Many OMGs had rates of growth of
over 5 per cent in 1981. Some DMCs in East and Southeast
Asia continued to be among the fastest growing economies
in the world. The rate of increase in output in most of the
South Asian DMCs was above the average for all developing countries. Many DMCs were also able to reduce inflation. However, the ratas of aconomic growth In a majority of
DMCs were lower than thase achieved by them in 1980. The
trade deficits of most OMCs widened, causing them to have
larger recourse to high-cost external finance.

The International Setting

The economic performance of OMCs in 1981 was to a
large extent affected by world economic conditions,
characterized by sluggish economic growth, rising
unemployment and high interest rates in the capital
markets of most industrialized ecanomies. According to
estimates of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), for the first time in many years the volume of world
trade declined in 1981 due to unfavorable developments in
the internalional economy.

The aggregate Gross National Product (GNP) of the industrialized countries grew at about the same low rate in
4984 as in 1980 (1.2 par cant). Production, Incame and
empioyment continued to be depressed although the
average increase in consumer prices declined from 11.9 per
cent in 1980 to 10 per cent in 1981, and the aggregate current account deficit fell sharply from $44 billion in 1980 to
$15 billion in 1981.

The combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the oil
. €xporting countries! as a group decreased by 3 per cent in
1981. Since the oi! sector plays a major role in these
aconomies, the increase in oulpui from other sectors was
more than offset by the decline in oif production. The
average rate of inflation In these countries increased from

ect in South Sumatra. This Bank-assisted Project has helped in‘Crease Indonesia's annual cament production by 560,000 mt.

12.4 per cenl in 1980 to 14 per cent in 1981. The reducad
world demand for oil, stamming from the general economic
recession and greater energy conservation, and a coniinued high ievel of imports of goods and services led to a
dactine in the combined current account surplus of these
countries by $22 bvillion to $80 billion in 1981.

As a group, the non-oil developing countries had the
highest rate of growth (4 per cent) in 1981, though it was
jower than in 1980 (4.8 per cant). Inflation continued to be a
major problem, particularly in some of the larger nonregional, non-oil developing countries. The increasa in consumer prices in non-oil developing countries in 1981 avoraged 34 per cent, higher than the 32 per cent increase in
1980.

The low demand for exparts and generally falling lerms
of trade led to a further increase in the overall current account delicit of these countries by $15 billion to $97 billion
in 1981. Therefore, their requirements for external financing
increased significantly and, in the absence of adequate afficial long-term leans, they had to make greater use of
medium and short-term credits from cortumercial sources
and from the IMF.

Economic Developments in DMCs

The DMCs demonstrated considerable resilience in dealing with the difficult external conditions that pravailad during 1981, Aggregate, output of 16 DMCs! grew by 6.4 per
cent in 1981, somewhat higher Lhan the rate of growth in
1980. However, the economic performance of NMCs varled
considerably.

Growth In GDP

Of the 16 OMCs listed in Table 1,? seven had a higher rate
of growth in 1981, and in some of tha other DMCs, the
decline In the rate of growth was marginal. Except for five
countries, growih rates in ali DMCs were above 5 per cenit
and, consequently, they registered significant increases in
real per capita incomes.

OMCs.

1112

The newly industrialized DMCs (NICs)! achieved relatively high ratas of economic growth In 1981. Hlong Kong and
Singapore maintained the highest increases in output
among the DMCs wilh growth rates of 10,4 per cent and 9.9
per cent, respectively. In Ihe Republic of China the rate of
increase in GOP declined from 6.8 per cent in 1980 10 5.5 per
eent in 1981, The Republic of Korea, which had a 3.5 per
cent decline in GDP in 1980, showed a marked recovery
registering 4n increase in GDP of 8 per cent in 1981.
However, this growth rate was still below the average of 10
par cent achieved in the 1970s. ,

The reduced growth in outpul in the Republic of China
was due to lower domastic demand and a slower growth in
exports. Hong Kong had a higher GDP growth rate com:
pared to that achieved in 1980, because of high domestic
derhand and entrepot services provided mainly for the external trade activities of the Peopic's Republic of Chia, In
the Republic of Korea, the economic recovery was aided by
a bumper agricultural harvest and increase in manufacturing exports, The GDP growth rale in Singapore during 1984
was below that achieved in 1980, The higher growth in the
manutacluring sector was more than offset by a lower increase in output of the construction and trade sectors.

In Indouesia, Malaysia and Philippines, the increase in
GDP in 1981 was lower than in 1980, Depressed demand
and decline in prices of cxporl commodities reduced Indonesia's rate of growth [rom 9.6.per cent in 1980 to 8.2 per
cent in 1981, and Malaysia’s trom 8.1 per cent to 6.8 per
cent, In the Philippines, lower growth rates vl agriculture,
manufacturing and construction sectors resulted in a lower
increase of 4.8 per cant in GDP in 1984, compared with 5.8
per cent in 1980. In Thailand, GOP increased by 7.6 per cant
compared wilh 6.8 per cent in 1980. This strang performance was due to a high rate of agricultural growth with
associated growth in the oulpul of agro-based Industries
and continued high levels of foreign and public sactor investments.

Most of the OMCs in South Asia! recorded GDP growth
rates in 1981 which were above the average growth rates
achieved durlng the 1970s. In varying degrees, good performance of the agricultural and industrial sectors contributed lo the satisfactory growth rates. In Bangladesh,
GDP Increased by 7.3 per cent in 1981, almost double the
growth rate in 1980, mainly because of the excellent foadcrop production in fiscal year (FY) 1980-81. In Nepal, an impressive recovery in agricultural output during 1981 from
the below normal level of 1980 contributed to an increase of
4.6 per cent in GOP compared with a decline of 1.4 per cent
in the previous year. In Burma, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, sustained high rates of growth in both agricultural and industrial production contributed to rates of increase in GOP
of between & per cent and 7 per cent in 1981. However, in all
the three countries their growth rates were below those of
the previous year. Sa India, the growth rate of GOP was
about 4.5 per cenl in 7981, cornpared with 7.4 par cent
achieved in the previous year, Although industrial production showed a marked improvemen|, ihe agriculture sector,
which contributes nearly half of GDP, did not register a
significant improvement over 1880 when India had a
bumper crop

Among the South Pacific countries, both Fiji and Papua
Naw Guinea whose GDP had declined in 1980 by 5.5 per
cent and 9.6 per cenl, respectively, achieved modest increases in 1981 of 3.9 percent and 2 per cent. The recovery
In Fiji was due to the higher production of sugar cane, fish
and itmber. in Papua New Guinea, increased production
and investments in the mining sector contributed to improved growth

Estimates of the GDP growth rates are not avallable for
fhe remaining DMCs. However, reported higher agriculiural
production suggests thal lhere may have been a modest increase in GDP in the Lao People’s Demosratic Republic and
the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. In the South Pacitic
DMGs, which are heavily dependent on the production and
export of primary export commoditias, the decline in world.
demand and lower prices would suggest that their export
earnings and consequently their GDP growth rates were
adversely affected during 1981.

Sectoral Performance

the overall index of agricultural production in most
OMCs, for which data arc available, stowed an increase.
Agricullural production was particularly satisfactory in
some large DMCs (Indla, Indonesia, Republic of Korea,

Maldives, Nepsl, Makisian and Sr Lanka.

1Pakistan, Phitippines and Thailand) which account for most
of the agricultural output in the region, However, the situation varied from country to country as well as from commodity to commodity. Foodgrain production was generally
higher and found ready markets within the couniries as
well as abroad. Other agricultural crops such as rubber,
suga’ cans, coconut, jute and tea, did not fare so well
because of generally lower output growth and/or reduced
prices in the international market.

8 Output of foodgrains—rice, wheat and maize—intreased
by 4.9 per cent to a record level of 278 million tons in 1981
(See Tables 2 and 3).' The rate of increase was significantly
lower than 9 per cent recorded in 1980. However, 1980 was
an exceptional year in that rice output in many OMCs fad
recoversd markedly from the unusually tow level in the
previous year.

Rice production in 1987 generally increased in the DMCs
and their total output rose hy 2.8 par cant to a record 203.7
million tons. A bumper harvest was registered in the
Republic of Koraa, Bangladesh, Burma, Republic of China,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand had increases
of between 3.8 per cent and 7:2 per cent, Production de

clined in India, Pakistan and Philippines due to unfavorable
weather and natural calamities.

Tho production of wheal, the second major foodgrain in
OMGs, increased by 14.4 per cent to 53.5 million tons in
1981, mainly as a result of increased production in
Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. The production of maize
increased by 3.3 per cent to 20.9 million tons.

Because of higher foodgrain production, the net import
of foodgrains in the region declined during 1981. Burma, India, Pakistan and Thailand substantially increased their
rice exparts, while the Philippines maintained rice exports
at the 1980 level. Imports of foodgrains decreased despite
increased Imports of wheat by the Republic of Korea and by
India which enlered the import market for the first time
aftar three years. The decraasa was mainly attributable to
reduced import of rice by Bangladesh and tndunesia, and
lower imports of wheat by Bangladesh and Pakistan.
India’s wheat imports and Indonesia’s rice imports were
mainly to build up grain stocks to stabilize domestic food
pricas, Bangiacesh, which had a high rice output and some
reduction in the price of rice during FY 1980-81, faced food
shortages and rising prices towards the end of 1981 as the
main rice crop of the year was below normal.

Among the major commerciai crops, cutput of rubber
declined in Malaysia and Thailand but increased in Sri
Lanka. The outpul of jute, kenaf and related fibers
registered an overall decline of 10 per cent; Bangladesh,
Burma, Nepal and Thailand had lower production, but
India's production was higher. Sugar production was
higher in India but lower in the Philippines. World prices of
caconut oll, copra, jute, rubber, tea and sugar were much
lower in 1981 than in the previous year. [he decling in price
was sharpest In the case of rubber (22.5 per cent). Caconut
oil prices declined by 12 per cent, copra prices by 16 per
cent, jute prices by 12 per cent, tea prices by 10 per cent
and sugar prices by 9 per cent. As a result, producers of
these crops experienced income lesses during the year. In
general, the export volume af primary commadities did not
increase enough to compensate for the decline in prices,
while in some cases both prices and volume declined. This
meant lower export earnings and worsening of the balance
of payments siluation for countries which depend heavily
on such primary commodities for thelr exporis

The growth in industrial production was adversely affected in many DMCs due to several factors. These included foreign exchange constraints, rising labor cosis, high interest rates, Increases in domestic [uel prices and public
utilily tariffs and recession and prolectionism in several of
the major markets for manufactured exports from DMCs. In
some OMCs, sluggish domestic demand was also a constraint. The impact of these factors varied considerably
among PMCs and, in some, measures adopted to stimulate
industrial activities led to a higher growth in industrial production than in 1980.

In the Repubdlis of Korea, manufacturing production increased by about 10.6 per ceni,recovering from the 1.9 per
cent decline in 1980. This recovery was achieved by a betier
utilization of available capacity and was helped by a diversfication of export markets. In the Republic of China,
howaver, manuiacturing production grew at a much lower
rate than in 1980 because of sluggish domestic demand
and recession in its major expo markets,

In Indonesia, manufacturing and construction activities
remained buoyant as a result of high levels of investment

and increased imports of capital goods and industrial Inputs. In Malaysia, a 10.2 per venl increase in the output of
the manufacturing sector was spurred by strong domestic
demand for consumer durables, continued expansion in
private residential and commercial construction and (he
government's low-cost housing program. !n the Philiopines,
linancial and management difficulties posed problems far
industrial growth, although the timely intervention by the
government in some major industrial enterprises helped to
avert a further dechne in industrial production.

In Bangladash, manufacturing output grew by $ per cert
in F¥ 1981 from the depressed level of the previous yaar,
mainly on account of iniproved supplies of raw materials in
the major agro-processing industries. In India, manufacturing Oulpul increased duc to improvements in the availability of power, transporl and raw materials, and a decline in
the incidence of Jabor unrest. Pakistan recorded 11.1 per
cent growth in rnanufacturing oulput as a result of better
performance ai both private and public sector enlerprises.

Electricity generation in DMCs! increased by about 5.5
per cent, from 275.6 billion KWh in 1980 lo 290.9 billion KWh
in 1981, to meet the growing power raquirements of
agricullural and iadustiial production and increased
household demand generated by rising per capita incomes

and continuing urbanization. However, the growth rate was
slightly below the 6.6 per cent increase recarded in 1980.
Maldives, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tonga had high production gains ranging from 20 to 26 per cent. The Republic
of Ghina, Cook Islands and Vanuatu registered declines
during the year, The production gains were fairly evenly
distributed among the other DMCs.

Tota! output of crude oll in DMCs! Increased from 104.6
million tons in 1980 to 112.1 million lons in 1981 (see Table
4). Production increased in Burma, India, Indonesia and
Philippines but decreased in Malaysia. Malaysia's poticy of
conserving oil reserves by restricting output, pursued during the greater part of the year, affected production.

The output of natural gas also showed significant increase in the DMGs during 1981. Of the nine natural gas
producing DMCs,* production gains ranged from 10 to 12
per cent in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Pakistan
while Burma racorded a very high increase of 66 per cent.
On the other hand, production in the Republic of China and
Malaysia declined. In Thailand, a large off-shore natural
gas field came on stream during the year.

Preliminary data suggest that there was an increase In
the value of oll Imports by most DMCs during 1981. Imports
of ail (crude oi! and petroleum products) by DMCs increased by 30 per cent in 1981 to $46.9 hilllon, compared
with an increase of 81.2 per cent in 1980. Apart from Indonesia and Malaysia which are large net exporters of oil,
oll imports were between $1.5 billlon to $9.4 billion in
Republic of China, Hong Kong, India, Republic of Korea,
Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Inq
Singapore, a major part of oil imports was for re-exports.

The sising value of vil imports and a lower growth in
overall exports led to an incraasa in the ratlo of oil imports
to total exports from 25 per cen! in 1980 to about 30 per
cent in 1981. The burden of oil imports was particularly
heavy in thase DMCs whose export base is relatively narraw while dependence on energy imports is high. Among
the countries for which data are availabla, petroleum imports as a percentage of total exports exceeded 40 per cent
in Fiji, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Thailand, Tonga and Western Samoa, and ranged from 30
to 40 per cent in Republic of Korea, Maiaysia, Nepal and
Vanuatu. Although some OMGs’ imports of coal increased,

the Philippines, and for the supply of Australian coal to the

commodity export prices, absence of further increase in the
price of imported oil, adequate supply of foodgrains, and
stabilization measures adopted by many DMCs. Nevertheless, most DMCs continued to experience double digit
rates of Inflation, ranging from 11 per cent in Fiji to 33 per
cent in Western Samoa. Afghanistan, Burma, Indonesia,
Kiribati, Malaysia, Paoua New Guinea and Singapore had
inflation rates of less than 16 per cent.

While the rate of inflation generally fell in many OMCs in
1981, it increased In Burma, India, Malaysia, Nepal,
Pakistan, and in same South Pacific DMCs — Cook Islands,
Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The factors that tended to
push up inflation rates included higher taxes and public
utility tariffs, reduced subsidies for commercial energy, exPansionary monetary policies pursued by some countries
and the Impact of continued high rates of warld inflation

The External Sector

_ The aggregate trade deficit of OMCs increased by 30.4
Per cent to $21.4 billion in 1981 (sae Table 6). The trade
deticit of Singapore increased substantially, while those of
Hong Kong and the Republic of Korea were only marginally
higher, Tho trade surplus of the Republic of China increased while that of Indonesia and Malaysia declined. The
Phillppines and Thailand also had slightly larger trade
‘deficits. In South Asia, Afghanistan’s trade surplus ImProved while the trade deficits of Bangladesh, Burma,

Maldives, Nepal and Pakistan increased during 1981. India
and Sri Lanka continued to have large trade deficits,
although they were lower than in 1980.

The aggregate value of DMCs' exports increased to $161
billion in 1981, The sharp deceleration in the rate of growth
from 25.4 per cent In 1980 to 8.2 per cent in 1981 resulted
from both a decline in the rate of growth of ihe volume of
exports and a fall in the prices of major export commodities
such as palm oil, copra, rubber, sugar and copper.
Manufactured exports also registered slow growth in a
number of DMCs, This was principally due to the sluggish
economic situation in the industrialized countries which
account for more than two-thirds of the exports from the
region.

Reduction in the rates of growth in sxports was
widespread among DMCs. The DMCs which experienced
the sharpest declines in export growth to very low rates
were Fiji (from 46 per cent to -27 per cent), Indonesia (from
41 per cent lo -1,.3 per cent), Malaysia (from 17 per cent to
-3.8 per cent}, Philippines (from 28 par cent to 1 per cent),
and Singapore (from 36 per cent to 8.3 per cent). Only nine
DMCs increased their exports by 10 per cent or mora, two
increased exports by less than 5 per cent and in ten DMCs
exports either remained unchanged or declined.

The aggregate imports of the DMCs increased by 10.5 per
cent to $172 billion in 1981, compared with a growth of 30.1
per cent In 1980. Imports increased at a slower rate in 1981

than in 1980 in most DMCs except in Burma, Republic of
Korea, Papua New Guinea and Tanga. Imports declined in
absolute terms in Cook Islands, Fiji, Sri Lanka and
Vanuatu.

A wide range of faclors affected the external trade of
DMCs. The Republic of China's trade surplus grew as imports went up at a much slower pace than exports. The
trade deficits of Hong Kong and Singapore inereased mainly because oi a stow growth in their exports, As a result ot
devaluation and greater utilization of productive capacity,
the Republic of Korea's export carnings grew at a much
faster pace than imports, and its trade deficit remained at
almast the same level as in 1980.

The trade surplus of Indonesia fell substantially because
itg non-oil exports declined, while imports, aspacially of
capital goods, chemicals, fertilizers and pharmaccuticals,
rose steeply. The trade surplus of Malaysia, whict! was
relatively large aver several years, was almost wiped out as
the demand for its major exporl commodilies — lin, rubber,
palm oil and cocoa — weakened. The trade deficits of tha
Phillppines and Thailand remained at almost the same level
as in 1989. In the Philippines, both exports and irripourts
registered a modest increase of one per cent. In Thailand,
the cost of oil imports continued to rise, and offset the
inereased export receipls from tts primary commodity

Bangladesh tiad a slightly higher trade deficit, despite a
lowar import growth, because of an absolute decline in exports, In Burma, a faster increase i imports and a dactine
in export growth led to further deterioration of the trade
balance. indla's trade gap remained large because export
growth was depressed. ln Nepal, the heavy burden of ail Imports and a low export hase resulted in a largor Wade
deficit, despite a substantial growth in exports. In Pakistan,
higher oil impos and import liberalization cansicerably
offset the large intrease in export earnings. Sri Lanka's
trade deficit was slightly lower in 1981 due to lower imports
and increased exports.

In 1984, a major factor which contributed to the generally
increased trade deficils ur reduced trade surpluses af
DMCs was Lie deterioration in the terms of trade. Tho export unit value indices of OMCs either fell (Malaysia and
Philippines) or increased inarginally (Hong Kong, Republic
of Korea and Thailand), but the import unit value indices
significantly increased in most DMCs. [he terms of trade
indices in 1981 were theretore below those in 1980 in all
nine DMCs for which data are available. The declines were
substantial in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Solomon Islands
which are exporters of primary commodities

Ihe total international reserves of DMCs were $44.4

(he end of 1980 (see lable 7), For the first time in several
years, the total international reserves of DMCs failed tob Periale ts toustaneceetee. evasg.t

register a significant increase. The fevel of reserves at the
end of 1981 was equivalent to 3.9 months of imports compared with 4 months of imports in 1980. A number of counirles experienced a decline in reserves. Only four countries,
namely, the Republic of China, Papua New Guinea,
Singapore and Sri Lanka,made significant addition to their
reserves, =

Tha net flow of external resources to DMCs rose from
$12.2 billion Ia 1979 to $14.1 billion in 1980, the latest year
for which data are available (see Table 8). Concassional
flows contributed most of the inerease, rising from $6.7
billion in 1979 to $8.2 billion in 1980 while non-cancessional
flows rose from £5.6 billion to $5.9 billion. Gross public bor
rowings by OMGs in the international cagltal markets in the
form of syndicated bank credits and bond issues amounted
to $7.7 billion in 1980 which was slightly lower than the fevel
in 1979."

The external public debt of DMCs? increased from $72.7
billion in 1979 to $84.4 billion In 1980 (see Table 9), or by 16.1
per cent, compared with an increase of 11.4 per cent in the
previous year, The largest increases in external debt
outstanding were recorded by India, Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Philippines and Thailand, together accounting for
more than 70 per cent of lhe aggregate debt increase during the year.

The debt-service payments of DMCs rose from $8.1
billion in 1978 to $9 billion tn 1979 and to $3.2 billion in 1980,
but the overall debt-service ratio declinad from 7.6 per cent
in 1978 to 6.6 per cent in 1979 and 5.4 per cent in 1980. The
debt-service ratios of Individual DMCs varied widely, ranging from 0.1 per cent to 27.1 per cent. However, since these
ratios relate only to official external debl, they understate
the debt-service burden of OMGs, such as Hepublic of
Korea and Philippines, which have raised substantial external loans without government guarantee.

Domestic Policies and Efforts

During 1981, the DMCs implemented a wide range of
policies in their attempts to miligate the effects of difficult
external conditions, ansure stability, enhance resource
mobilization and promote economic and social development. The policies adopted helped lo ease the problems
and the constraints that the DMCs had to tace, and enabled
them to continue their socio-economic development
without undue disruption. Some of the actions taken during
the year are mentioned below.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Because of rising investment costs, mobilization of
domestic savings has been a major concern of most DMCs,
However, available data for 14 DMCs for 1978-80 show that,
with the exception of Burma, Nepal and the Philippines, the
gap between savings and investment widened in all DMCs
during that period (sce Table 10). Except for India and the
Republic of Korea, the higher resource gap was associated
with an increase in investmant-GDP ratio. This was reinforced by a decline in domestic savings-GOP ratios in
several! DMCs (Bangladesh, Republic of China, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka). In the Philippines, the

Suggesl that borrowings incrsased In 1981,
2 Cala on loial external debt In Ine OMCs are unavailable:

ratios of both savings and Investment to GDP increased
more or jess equally during 1978-80. As a result, the
resource gap In 1980 was at the same level as in 1978. In
Burma, a significant improvement in the domestic savings
tatio and a modest increase in investments led to a decline
fn the resource gap. In Nepal, the decline in the domestic
savings was more than offset by tha signiticant decraasea in
investments, resulling in a lower resource gap. In 1980, the
resource gap exceeded 10 per cent of GDP in Bangladesh,
Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Singapore
and Sri Lanka. It was 2 per cent or lower in Burma, Republic
of China, India and Malaysia. 3

Ouring 1981, DMCs took a variety.of measures to increase domestic savings. Some DMC governments increased public savings by trimming current expenditures while
others made additional efforis to increase tax revenues.
Certain DMCs introduced tisca! measures to encourage
domestic saving and to direct investment into priority
industries.

The importance of uttlizing the financial sector to mobilize mose resources for development received increased
recognition by saveral DMCs which took: significant
measures for this purpose during the year. Same countries
took measures to monitor more closely the operations of
ihe financial institutions. Republic of China, India,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore and
Thailand increased interest ratas during the year and considerably improved Incentives for financial savings. Hong
Kong redefined the areas of operations of banks and
deposit-taking companies In an effort ta improve the quali
ty of supervision. The Philippines strengthened its supervision of financial institutions by the Central Bank.
Singapore initiated the reorganization of Its Monetary
Authority and a review of regulations of financial operations in an effert to develop insurance, banking and fund
management services in the region. Thailand opened a
rediscount window for agricultural loans to help the
agricultural sector overcome the prevailing tight manatary
situation.

Several DMCs took staps to regulate monetary expansion and reduce inflationary pressures. The Republic of
China imposed ceilings on pre-export finansing by foreign
banks, and Indonesia and Sri Lanka imposed credit ceilings
on commercial banks. Afghanistan, Burma, Republic of
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand reduced the growth rate of money supply below [hat in 1980.

Trade Policies

Faccd with large and growing current account deficits,
several DMCs took steps to alleviate the foreign exchange
constraints on development. {n order to Improve Its competitiveness in exports and curtailing demand for its imports, Thailand devalued its currency by about 10 per cent.
The Republic of Korea devalued its currency by 5 per cent
over and above the 36 per cent devaluation of 1980.

Moreover, a number of DMCs experienced substantial
depreciation of their currencies which had an impact on
their external trade. The rates of depreciation in relation to
ihe US dollar were in the range of 18-19 per cent for
Bangladesh and Vanualu, 10-15 per cent for Cook islands,
Hong Kong, India, Sri Lanka and Western Samoa and 5-10
per cent for Afghanistan, Burma, Fiji, Nepal, Papua New
Guinea and Philippines.

credits on-fent by the National Development! Bank of Sri Lanka.

DMCs also adopted several measures to augment exports. Bangladesh, India and Pakistan introduced fiscal incantives fos promoting exporls. Hong Kung increased its eiforts lo revive exports to Japan by sending trade missions,
participating in trade fairs and encouraging Japanese investment in Hong Kong, Indonesia announced a policy
under which foreign firms winning certain categories of
large contracts for projects would be required to tielp promote exporis from ihe country.

Several countries took steps to diversify both their exports and export markets. The Republic of Korea launched
a vigorous program to develop. new products to overcome
the effects of low demand and various barriers in major expert markets. India and the Hepublic of Korea sought
cuoperation in engineering and contracting ventures in
developing countries. The Philippines initialed a modernization program and restructuring of the laxtile industry to
further promata its non-traditional exports. The measures
taken by DMCs to diversify export markets varied considerably, For instance, Singapore emphasized the expansion of trade with Asian countries and Pakistan cnlered into new trade agreemenis with countries in astern Europe
and Latin America.

Some DMCs took steps to increase the supply and
reduce the costs of imported inpuls and essential consumer goods, For instance, Pakistan abolished the
cusioms duty on a numher of items, including industrial
and agricultural machinery and lools, cement, some mine
rals, and chemicals, Bangladesh relaxed limits on imports
of essential consumer goods, industrial raw maletials and
Spare pars to ensure their greater availability; tha Republic
of Korea began to reduce its heavy dependence on [he
United States tor agricultural commodities by diversifying
the sources of such imporis; Nepal reduced customs dutles
on some cssential yoods such as coarse cotlon cloth,
kerosene oil and medicines, and inercased duties on luxury
items, and the Philippines began to implament a comprehensive ralionalization of its tariff structure by reducing
import tarifis on a large number of industrial inputs.

Energy Program and Policy

With the increasing burden of energy imparts on the
balance of payments, and with the praspcct that
dependence on tossil fuels will continue Lo remain high in
the foreseeable future, 1981 witnessed a significant. inerease in the exploralion for deposits of oil, gas and cual in
DMCs. Further raserves of commercially expioitable oil and
gas deposits were reported from Indonesia and Malaysia —
the net oil exporting DMCs, Moreover, a number of new
commercially exploitable deposils were found in Burma,
Rapublic of China, India, Pakistan, Philippines and
Thailand.

International oil companics continued to provide capital
and expertise for exploration and development of hydrocar
bon resources. The role of national companies increased
significantly in this sector, particularly in India, Indonesia

and Malaysia. The Korea Devcloprnent Corporation and
Partamina (of Indonesia) concluded an agreement for joint
exploration In indonesia. With a view to developing its coal
deposits, the Republic of China entered inio a joint venture
with a Canadian coal company.

During the year, vigorous efforts were continued in the
identification and development vi alternative suurces of
encrgy. Mini-hydro power development was stressed by
some DMCs, particularly Burma, Nepal and Philippines.
Bangladesh and Pakistan tock steps to expand the output
of nalural gas and to extend their transmission systems. In
Thailand, natural gas began fo be used instead of fuel vib in
a number of large alectricity ganerating units, and the
country also took steps to further exploit indigenous
deposits of lignite to reduce its dependence on imported
furnace oil

Indonesia acceleratad its program for the exploitation of
its considerable coal reserves with a view to using coal as
the primary energy source for a large power-generating
plani, and it also commissioned its first geothermal power
plant. In the Philippines, various measures were initialed
{o bring about greater Use af coal as an energy source,
parlicularly in the cement industry and for electricity
generation.

-There was a growing concern in most DMCs about the
adverse effects of higher energy prices on the welfare of
low-incame groups. In this context, several countries paid
special aliention to the development of fuelwood supplies
which remains a major source of energy in rural areas.

In many DMCs, retail prices of petroleum products were
generally increased and several OMCs increased (heir electricity tariffs. Rurma and Indonesia continued to sell
petroleum below international prices, and several DMCs
subsidized specific petroleum products (such as kerosene
or LPG) and provided concessional rates for small consumers of eleclicily.

During 1981, the flow of axternal rasousces into the
region increased for energy development. The Republic of
China, India, Hepublic of Korea, Philippines and Thailand
Increased investment in domestic energy development
through grealer exlernal assistance and commercial borrowings, and Sri Lanka established a joint venture with an
American company to manufacture charcoal trom wood

_ Wastes for ihe domestic market. Also, in many DMCS,

energy conservation measures continued to be imple:
mentad more widely.

Human Resource Policies

(n 1981, the promotion of sucial development received
considerable attention in DMCs in recognition of Its important role in the development process. The Republic of
Korea Is undertaking an Urban Rearrangement Han to
Uecongest urban areas, particularly the capital city of
Seoul, while the Sacrmaul Unidong program was continued
lo improve living standards in the rural areas to curb the
drift to the urban areas. In the Philippines, the human settlement scheme continued to provide improved housing for
the poor.

Measures to improve health and nutrition were intenSifled in many DMCs. A health center scheme was introduced in Indonesia to rapidly extend better health facilities
to the bulk of the populatian, Hong Kong undertook an extensive program of social services and community projects
to cope with its urban problems. Pakistan iriliated a proj
ect tu improve health standards by extending essential
primary health care services and basic hospital facilities lo
benefit poor rural households.

In many DMs, considerable attention was paid to the
improvement of technical skills and to increase employment opporiunities. Some examples of such policies ara
the lraining, job creation and resettlement schemes in Indonesia, the training programs adopled by Malaysia and
Pakistan, the “livelihood” program in the Philippines and a
program to upgrade the skills of industrial workers in
Singapore

Regional Cooperation

During 1981, efforts were continued among DMCs to promote regional cooperation bath by expanding and improv
STOCKPILING coal at Malangas, Philippines. In line with
the Government's goal of developing indigenous energy
resuurves and reducing dependence on imported oil, this
Bank-assisted Project will help double the Philippines’ pro
duction af coal.ing the operation of exisling organizations and by actively
exploring the possibilitias for increased cooperation.

The Association of Southcast Asian Nations (ASEAN) increased the number of items covered by its Preferential
Trading Arrangements (PTA), introduced measures to
speed up negotiations to bring more items under PTA, and
expanded the coverage for items imported [rom ASEAN
countries eligible for an automalic 20-25 per cent trade
preference, The Basic Agreement on ASEAN Industrial
Camplementation, the major instrument for private sector
cooperation, was signed during Ihe year and new ar
rangements to expedile the cansideration and approval of
large-scale industrial projects were approved. The substitution of a copper fabrication plant fora pulp and paper plant
as the Philippines’ project was approved by tha ASEAN
economic munisters and Thailand jinalizad the site for the
ASEAN Rack Salt-Soda Ash Project. Also, an ASEAN
Finance Corporation was astablished to finance ASEAN
projects,

In Aprit 1981, the foreign secretaries of Bangladesh,
Bhutan, india, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka met
to explora ways of prometing cooperation in South Asia.
They agreed to undertake studies of possible araas of
cooperation, including agriculture and rural development,
telecommunications, meteorology. and heaith and populatlon activilies.

The South Pacific OMCs coritinued to seek ways of nuproving and extending regional cooperation, A major
regional project being undertaken by the South Pacific

Ceammission (SPC) isa Skipjack Tuna Survey and Assessiment Program. A South Pacific Industrial Survey jolntly
sponsored by the Economic and Sociat Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), the South Pacific Bureau of
Economic Cooperation (SPEC) and the Bank was launched
during the year. In the meetings organized by SPC and
SPEC, proposals were discussed to establish a Pacltic
Islands Fund which is expected to Support programs/projects aimed at improving collective self-reliance of South
Pacific cauntries and reducing the vulnerability of their
economies to adverse international developments
Bilateral accords between’ DMCs entered into during
1984 included an agreement between Indonesia and
Malaysia coricerning the sharing of common waters for
fishing and navigational purposes, and an agreerent hetween India and Sri Lanka under which India will Provide Sri
Lanka credit for the purchase of machinery and equiprnent,
and assist In the formulation of medium arid long-term

There were a number of developments in the areas ot international finance and trade in 1981 which were of significance to developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (the region). World Bank loan conimitments
made to the region increased from about $2.3 bilfion in FY
1980 [ended 30 June) to about $2.5 billion in FY 1981.
However, new credit commitments to the region from the

* atedInternational Development Association (/DA), the soft loan
window of tha World Bank, fell from about $2.5 billion in FY
4980 to about $2.1 billlon in FY 1981. As a result, the overall
loan commitments made by the World Bank Group to the
region declined in FY 1981 to about $4.7 billion.

The IMF made changes in Its credit facilities and policies
to enable it to provide increased assistance to member
countries. New rules liberalizing a member's access to iMF
financial tacilities were adopted, A new Subsidy Account
was also introduced to reduce the relatively high interest
cost ot using the Supplernentary Financing Facility. Credit
commitments to the region under standby and extended arrangements amounted to SDR 8,148 million at the end of
4981, compared with outstanding commitments of SDR
3,392 milllon at the end of 1980. Net drawings from IMF
facilities by the countries in the region increased sharply
from SOR 958 million in 1980 to SDR 2,290 million In 1981.
Saveral developing countries of the region benefitted from
low interest Trust Fund loans before its resources were exhausted in early 1981 and from the distributions out of two
IMF administered subsidy accounts.

Aftar intensive negotiations, agreement was reached in
December 1981 on a new Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA)
which will govern world textlle trade until 31 July 1986. The
European Economic Community (EEC) extended its
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) scheme in 1981
for 10 years and Japan also expressed its willingness to do
50.

UNCTAD's integrated Programme of Commodities, a major international cooperation effort concerning trade in
several important primary commodity exports of developing countries, resulted in international commadity
agreaments (IGAs) for a few commodities by the end of

.1981. The International Natural Rubber Agreement, which

became provisionally effective in 1980, commenced butfar
stocking operations. The Sixth Intemational Tin ‘Agreement, succeeding the Fifth Agreement which expires in
June 1982, was ralified, The International Cocoa Agree:
ment became provisionally effective in 1981, while awaiting
ratification by major producing countries, The International
Sugar Agreement has had limited effect because a major
exporting country has yet to sign the Agreement. Negolla
tions on other commodities, including edible oil, tropical
woods, tea and jule, are still at a preliminary slage.

At the Annual Summit of seven major industrial countries
{Canada, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,
Japan, United Kingdom and United States) held in Ottawa
in July, the heads of governments agreed that priority
should be given to reducing inflation and unemployment,
and affirmed iheir commitment to a liberal trading system
and to continue energy cansarvation efforts. Similar concerns were expressed during the Commonwealth Heads of
Governments Meeting held in Melbourne from 20 Septernber to 7 October. Leaders of 22 developed and davelaping
countries met at Cancun in October and discussed food,
anergy, trade and monetary problems. Though they were
unable to reach significant agreement on a global strategy
for international cooperation, they agreed to resume
negotiations on the transfer of resources from rich to poor
countries in 1982.

At the United Nations Conference on the Least
Developed Countries held in Paris in September 1981,
pledges were made by several donors to improve their aid
to tha 31 least developed countries which include
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Maldives, Nepal and
Western Samoa. At the regional level, greater assistance to
the least developed countries was stressed in a closing

resolution at the Annual Session of ESCAP held in Bangkok 
in March 1881.

Oespite several adverse developments during the year,
the economic performance of the DMCs was generally
satisfactary. Their aggregata GDP growth of 6.4 per cent
was higher than that of the previous year, inflation rates
were lower and per capita availability of food irnproved.
However, because of sluggish demand for raw materials
anu manufactures in major external markets, their exports
increased at a slaw rate. The prices of primary exports, the
principal source of foreign exchange earnings for many
DMCs, declined considerably, As a resull, the overall trade
and currant account daficits of DMCs widened during 1981,
which in turn increased their external resource requirements. In its effort to hely the DMCs, the Bank
substantially expanded its assistance during 1981, details
of which are provided in the following chapters.

21Lending Operations

OVERALL BANK lending increased by 17 per cent in
nominal terms in 1981, compared with a rise of 18 par cent
in 1980. Total loan approvals during the year amounted to
$1,678 million, compared with $1,436 million in the previous
year,

Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) in- 1981
amounied to $1,146.7 million, an increase of 19.6 per cent
over Ihe corresponding figure of $958.5 million in 1980,
while concessional loans from Special Funds (SF), armounting ta $530.9 million, showed an increase of 11.2 per cent
over ine 1980 figure of $477.2 million.

The share of concessional loans to the poorer and less
developed member countries was about 32 per cent of total
lending during the year, slightly lower Lhan in 1980 bul still
higher lhan the average of 30 per cent over the period
1968-81. In 1981, almost 92 per cent of SF loans went to
developing member countries (DMCs) which had a per
capita GNP of tess than $300 in 1980.

Funds contributed by co-financiers in 1981 amounted to
$627 million compared with $391 million in 1980 and
substantially added to the Bank's own assistance to its
DMCs, ‘

During 1981, a total of 47 loans — including three program loans, five sector loans and one mulliproject loan —
for 54 projects in 15 DMCs was approved, compared with 59
loans for 58 projects in 17 DMCs in 1980. Of these, three
Projects — one each in Papua New Guinea, Philippines and

-Thalland — received blended loans, or, in other wards,
financing from bath OCR and SF.

The average size of loans showed a marked’ increase
from $24.3 million in 1980 to $29.4 million in 1981, The
average size of OCR loans increased from $33 million in
1980 10 $38.2 million in 1981, while the average size of SF
loans increased from $15.9 million to $19.7 million over the
same period, While this increase is partly attributable to inflation, it is primarily due to the programming of certain
large projects and the inclusion of five sector loans in 1981.

During the year, four DMCs received loans exclusively
from OCR: Fiji {$16 million), Indonesia ($337.8 millon),

ROAD IMPROVEMENT Project in tha Philinpines. A $45 million
jank foan.is helping to give farmers better acoess fo agricultural

Republic of Korea ($205.2 million) and Malaysia ($116.8
million).

Four DMCs feceived loans from both OCR and SF:
Pakistan, $210 million ($55 million from OCR and $155
million from SF); Papua New Guinea, $16 million ($8 million
from OCR and $8 million from SF); Philippines, $215.5
million ($200.5 milllan from.OCR and $15 million from SF);
aad Thailand, $222.4 million {$207.4 million from OCR and
$15 million from S&).

Saven DMCs received loans exclusively from SF;
Bangladesh {$197 million}, Burtna ($99.5 million), Maldives
($1 million), Nepal ($45.2 million}, Sel Lanka ($35.5 million),
Tonga ($1.68 million) and Western Samoa ($4 million).

The formulation of a broad sectoral strategy in the
Bank's lending operations is an evolutionary process and is
based upon the recognition of important country-specific
considerations. These include structural adjustments in national economics, the capacitics of local institutions to absorb Bank assistance and implement Bank-financed projects, relative sectoral priorities in DMCs’ development
plans, relative levels of economic development, and
availability of oiher sourcas of financing. However, despite
variations in economic prospects and development consirainls among DMCs, a consensus has emerged on the
high priority of thrae majar sectors: agriculture and agroindustry (particularly food production}, energy (particularly
the increased utilizalion of indigenous energy resources)

. and social infrastructure such as water supply, housing, ur
ban developmentl, education, heallh care ard population
control.

In 1981, Bank lending te the Agriculture and AgroInduslry seclor accounted for 32.3 per cent of total Bank
fending, about the same as in 1979 and 1980. In nominal
terms, however, lending to this sector in 1981 increased by
about 16 per cent. Bank loans supported, among other

“things, improvements to irrigation, drainage and flood con
trol facilities, related agricultural support services, and
feeder road networks; the construction of a multipurpose
dam; integrated agricultural and rural development;
coconut and cotton production; foodgrain sloraye; crop intensification programs; and forestry, fisherias and
livestock development. One large Joan in the agro-industry

The share of the Energy sector in total lending rose from
26.6 per cant In 1980 to 28.6 per cent in 1981, which marked
an increase for the third year in succession. Lending for
Snergyyelated projects during the year covered, among
other things, development of inciganuus energy resources
such as hyd/upower and natural gas, rehabilitalion and expansion of power distribution and transmission systems
and extension of rural electelfication,

However, during the year, the largest increase, both in
absolute terms and as a proportion of total Bank lending,
was for social infrastructure projecis which accounted tor
21.7 per cent of total lending, compared with just under 16
ber cenl in 1980, These loans were for the rehabilitation and
expansion of water supply systems in a number of provin:

cial cilies and municipalities, low-incume urban housing
and developmont, the upgrading of facilities and resources
of a university and vocatiunal and lectnical schools, and
for support of primary health care and population ptanning
services including the upgrading of hospitals and training
af paramedical technicians.

Lending to developinent finance institutions (DFis} ia
1981,to meet the mecium and long-term creuit requirements
of small and medium-scale industries in DMCs, increased
by more than 60 per cent in nominal terms over 1980 and accounted for 12.2 per cent of tolal Bank lending in 1981, On
the olher hand, there was a significant decline in Bank
Jending to the Transport and Communications sector in
19B1 — 4.3 per cent of total lending compared wlth 15.6 per
cent in 1980. This was due primarily to changes in sectoral
priorities in OMCs,

The total cost of projects approved in 1981, excluding six
DFI loans, five sector loans and three program loans, is
estimated at $3,212 million. Direct Bank financing of the
total project costs amounted to about 37.2 per cent. On the
basis of the Bank’s past experience, itis estimated that the
total cost of the subloan projects to ve financed by the six
DFI loans will be about $854 million. The projects and programs to be financed by the sector and program leans will
Ive an estimated total Investment cost of $698 million,

At the end of 1981, the Bank's cumulative lending had
reachad $9,771 million for 509 projects in 24 DMGs. Of this
tolal, jeans amounting to $6,799 million were from OCR and
$2,971 million were from SF.

Bank lending may be classified into three main
categortes: project lending, program lending and sector
lending. Although project lending remains the principal
vehicle by which the Bank transfers rasources to its OMCs,
sector lending in particular and program lending have

- assumed greater importance in making the Bank's

developmental role more flexible, effective and broader
based.

Prograin lending, introduced by the Bank in 1978, is
designed to help DMCs increase production where there is
under-utilization of existing capacity and to provide a
relatively flexible means by which DMCs can achieve optimum capacity utilization in a short time (about two years)
and maintain it hereafter with their own resources. in 1981,
the Bank approved three crop intensification program
loans amounting to $27 million: $18 million for Bangladesh,
$5 million for Burma,’ and $4 mlillon far Nepal. As of the
end of 1981, nine program loans had been approved by the
Bank, amounting to $87.5 million.

1 This program loan was co-financed by the OPEC Fund In (ne amount of $15
alltion

Sector lending, introduced by the Bank in 1980, has
several potential advantages, both from the Bank's point of
view as well as that of the DMCs themselves. Apart from
the fact that they are generally for larger amounts, seclor
loans have the advantage of faster disbursement because
the loans for srnaller projects embodied in the sector loan
are likely to be disbursed more quickly. Sector tending can
be useful over a wide area, covering such sectors and
subsectors as agriculture and rural development, energy,
water supply and sanitation, feeder road. networks,
tailways, education, health and small-scale industries,
where a number of individual small investment activities
can be combined under the structure of a sector loan. This
form of lending is also important in building up and
strengthening local institutions. in 1981, the Bank approved
five sector loans, amounting to $252.1 million. Three of
these — Ball Irrigation ($33.6 million) in Indonesia,’ Water
Supply ($46 million} and Rura! Electrification ($87.5 million}
in the Philippines — were from OCR and amounted lo
$167.1 million, and two — Small-Scale Irrigation ($50
million} in Bangladesh and Rural Electrification ($35
miftion) in Pakisilan — were from SF and amounted to $85
million. To date, seven sector loans have been approved hy
the Bank, amounting to $349.1 million — $264.1 million
from OCR and $85 million from SF resources.

Loeal.cost financing (LCF) involves lending foreign exchange lo meet lhe local cosis of a project on the basis of
such factors as a borrower's overall balance of payments
position and ability to mobilize domestic resources, as well
as specific project requirernents in Such sectors as
agriculture and social infrastructure where the local cast
component of the project is high. Such financing increased

from $5.9 million In 1974, the first year in which LGF was introduced by the Bank, 1o $105 million in 1980, In 1984, the
Sank provided $123.9 miliion in LCF tor 18 projacts in seven
DMCs. Of this, $49.5 million was from OCR and $74.4
million from SF, representing 4.3 per cenl and 14 per cent,
respectively, of OCR and SF loans approved during the
year. At the end of 1981, the Bank had provided a total of
$461 million in LOF,

The Bank has also financed Interest and other charges
under special circumstances such as the need to relieve
the fittancial strain on executing agencies during the construction period of projects, and also to ease lhe debt service burden on OMCs before projects start yielding
benefits. In 1981, the Bank financed interest and other
charges during construction amounting to $14.5 million
(rom OCR for three projects.

The relatively small size of individual projects has posed
some problems for the Bank in its lending-activilies to its
small island DMCs, mainly in tha South Pacific. Conse.

ect loans {or these countries and approved the first such
loan, $1.2 milllon to Tonga, in 1979, A multiproject loan for
$1 million was made to Cock Islands in 1980 and in 1981
Tonga received a second multiproject loan for $1.68 million
to cover the flnancing of five subprojects.

in view of the range and diversity of economic development and performance of its DMCs, the Bank has recognized three broad country categories — Group A, Group B
and Group G — based on an assessment of each country’s
per capita GNP level, balance of payments and debt repayment capacity. These categories are used as a broad guide
to determine access to concessional assistance and broadly reflect lhe relative levels of economic development
among the Bank's low-income (Group A), middle-income
(Group B), and high-income (Group C) OMGs, At present, the
Bank's lending poticy gives Group A countries full access
to SF; Group 8 countries borrow mainly from OCR, but may
have access to SF for modest amounts subject to the
economic circumstances of each country and the availabilily of resources (Papua New Guinea, which figures in this
group, has reccived a softer blend); while Group C countries
have access only to OGR. Due mainly to limited SF
resources, one Group A country (Pakistan) is also provided
with modest amounts of funds from OCR. Although In:
donesia is a Group B country, it is considered appropriate
for it to forego access to SF resources during the period
1980-82 on account of its better resource position and
overall development prospects. As DMCs develup and their
levels of per capita GNP and debt repayment capacity rise,
countries may shift from full access to modest acecss and
to “non-access” to SF loans. The Bank also conducts
periodic reviews of each DMG's economic situatlon, focus
ing on overall and sectoral performance as well as assessing what Impact current developments may have on future
growth prospects. These reviews, together with regular
ongoing dialoguas with DMCs, allow the Bank to fermulate
on a GouNtry-by-country basis a program of assistance
designed to hel» DMCs overcome their specific devclopment constraints.

Co-Financing

In 1981, the Hank continued to emphasize co-financing of
development projects with other external sources, The
main objective of co-finansing Is to help mobilize a larger
inflow of foreign resources lo meet the development needs
of DMCs, Co-financing also anhaness the impact of Bank
assistance and enables the Bank to finance larger projects
whose financing requirements may not be fully met by
ilself,

During 1981, a total of 23 projects involved co-financing,
with co-financiers contributing $627 million and the Bank
contributing $827 million. This compared with 22 projects
co-financed in 1980 for which co-linanciers provided $394
million and the Bark $600 million. The relatively high
amount of co-financing In 1981 is mainly aliributable to the
Inclusion of a few large projects in the Bank's lending
operations, including the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Project
in Bangladesh, which alone involved co financing of $221
million. This represents the largest single co-financing ever
coordinated by ite Bank, involving slx other donors. The
Bank played a leading role in appraising the project and
mobilizing support from co-financiers and will continue to
play a leading role in supervising its implementation. As ofer SyStem: Rehabiiaton and”

the end of 1981, co-financing had been arranged for 112
projects, with funds contributed by co-financiers amounting to $2,642 milllon and Bank financing for these projects
amounling to $2,977 million.

Asinthe past, the bulk of the Bank’s co-financing in 1984
was with bilateral and multilateral official sources which
together conlribuled $481 raillion or 77 per cent of total cofinancing during the year. Five traditional donor countries

- Canada, France, Japan, Norway and United Kingdom —
contributed $168 million in co-financing wilh the Bank, and
two OPFC sources -— Ahu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia — provided a further $156 million. Multilateral sources, comprising the European Economies Cummunity (EEC! European Iriyestment Bank (EIB), international Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), Islamic Development Bank (IsD8),
OPEC Fund for International Development, United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the Warld Bank, contributed $157 millhon,

in 1981, the Bank's co-financing with export credit
sources amounted to £59 million or 9 per cent af total cofinancing during the year. Ca-financing with commercial
sources totalled $87 million in 1981, cnmpared with
cumulative commjiercial co-financing of $38 million up to
the and of 1980. The amaunt of commercial co financing in
1981 accounted for 14 per cent of total co-financing during
the year. In regard lo co-financing with commercial
sources, the Rank usually incorporates a ''cross-default”
clause in its loan agreements with the borrowers, under
which the Bank has the oplion lu declare iis own loans in
default should the borrowers he in default under Ihe commercial loans.

in addition ie co-tinancing, the Bank appraised wo proy
ects leading to exclusive financing of $35.6 million by IFAD
during ite year, Tolal external resources mobilized by the
Bank through co-financing and exclusive financing in 1981,
therefore, amounted in the aggregate to $663 million,

During the year the Bank reviewed its co-financing
policias and practices. It was recognized that while the
Bank’s performance in co-financing wilh official sources
iad been generally satistactory, co-financing with commer:
cial and export credit sources had been limited and should
be expanded. Given the large resource requirements of tha
OMCs — particularly the middle-income countries — and
the limited availability of official assistance, it was felt that
the Bank should play a more active role in promoting cofinancing with commercial and export credit sources. Aside
from the “‘cross-defauit’ approach currently adopted by the
Bank, il was considered necessary to evolve other ways
and means of pramoting commercial/export credit co
financing, such as a complementary financing scheme,
assignment of early maturities to commercial lenders, and
even loosely connected parallel co-financing arrangements. Furthermore, the Bank stiould also consider a
more active marketing strategy to attract co-financing from
thase sources.

Plans were drawn up lo establish a co-financing unit in
tte Bank to stimulate the intarast and aniist the cooperation of commercial banks. The Bank is also organizing a
Workshop on Co-Financing with Commercial and Export
Credit Sources, to be hald Immediately before the Bank's
Fifteenth Annual Meeting in April 1982,with a view to exchanging views on the roie of such co-financing and
measures to promate it,

The Roard is expected ir) 1982 to consider further
measures which might be adopted by the Bank on cofinancing, particularly with commercial and export credit
Sources.

Environmental Activities.

The Bank has taken steps to systematize consideration
of the environmental impact of its development prujects. In1981, environmental problems were reviewed and analyzed
in regard to some 75 projects covering 17 daveloping countries. These encompassed all development sectors and, on
occasion, called tor cross-sectoral studies. With the expecied axpansion and diversification of Bank operations,
there is need to integrate further the Bank’s approach to environmental planning and management in all phases of the
project cycle. Where. possible, the opportunity is taken to
spell out the wider implications of the project, such as
natural resource development and resettlement of affected
communities, and to insure that appropriate safeguards
are instituted.

The Han River Basin Environmental Master Plan in the
Republic of Korea marked the Bank's first financing of an
environmental project per se. Other projects with signilicant environmental components Include the Palawan Infegrated Area Development Project and the Agricutlural
Waste Recycling Projact, both in the Philippines.

The Bank has also commenced assisting environmental
institution building in its DMCs and strengthened ihe
education and training of Bank staff in aspects of en.
vironmental planning and management.

Support for Private Sector Activities

The private sactor plays a very important role in the
aconoinic devclopment of most DMCs. Recognizing this,
the Bank assists private enterprises — especially small
and medium-scale industries — through its lending and
technical assistance activities. ,

Development finance institutions are the most effective
conduit for Bank loans to the private sector. The Bank’s
very first joan in 1968 was lo the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand for onlending to smaller enterprises,
Through credit tines to DFls, the Bank is able to channal
and disperse rnedium and long-lerm development funds to
a large number of small and madium-sized projects, the individual financing requirements of which are not large
enough to warrant direct Bank supervision.

As of the end of 1981, the Bank had extended over $1.3
billion in 64 credit lines lo 26 DFis in 17 DMCs. These credit
lines accounted for about four-fifths of the Bank’s
assistance to the industrial sector and about 13 per cent of
tolal Bank lending. Bank loaris to DFls were, iq turn, farmed
out fo over 6,800 subprojects, 95 per cent of which were in
the private sector, covering a wide range of manufacturing
industries such as textiles, chemicals, pager, building
materials, transport equipment, iron and steel, metal and
wire producis, wood, cork and food-processing.

A significant aspect of Bank loans to OF Is is that they
have proved to be perhaps the fastest vehicle of Bank
assistance, leading to a quick transfer of resources to the
horrowing countries as well as to quick realization of
economic benetits with minimai gestation periods. Bank
loans lo DEls also help prommole private initiative and
strengthen national standards of laan appraisal and
monltoring. This type of support is expected to continue in
the future. The Bank is also exploring the possibility of
undertaking equity financing on a modest scale as an additional tou! to promote private investment. A Regional
Seminar on Equity Financing was proposed to be held in
February 1982 lo discuss the subject,

Bank loans and technical assistance to the Agricuiture

and Agro-Industry seclor benefit millions of small farmers ,

who constitute = allhough they are aot always recugnized
as such — the region's largest bloc of private entrepreneurs. Aank-financed irrigation, rural development,
livestock and agricultural credit projects have helped
millions of small-scale agricultural entreprenaurs to raise
their output and thereby improve their standards of jiving.
For example, nearly 100,000 farmers have gained access to
previously unobtainable modern agricultural technology —
fertilizer and other inputs, and up-to-date crop processing
and marketing lectinigues — through ongoing Bank
agricultural cradit projects. Such assistance was
significantly augmented in 1981.

Private entrepreneurs in the fishing industry in the Asian
and Pacific region alsa have profited from the Bank's activilies, A major vehicle for this assistance is credit providad to tishermen, fish farmers, and other private individuals
and companies. Twenty-three Bank-financed projects have
helped underwrite, with funds channelled through DFls cr
other financial intermediaries, the cost of boats, engines,
fishing gear, aquaculture facilities and shorg installations
such as ice plants.

Apart from Bank lending to DFls and Agriculture and
Agro-Industry, private enterprises also benefit substantially from Bank support for infrastructure projecls — power,
roads, ports, shipping, railways and telecommunications
-— upon which they se heavily depend for their efficient
operation. Moreover, in many instances, Bank-financed infrastructure projects have triggered industrial expansion or
the establishment of new businesses — many oi which are
in the private sector.

Benefits to the Poor

As a financial Institution, the Bank pays very close attention to ensuring that its lending program meets the highest
and most vigorous tests of financial management and
sound banking practices. It ls, however, equally meticulous
about the social impact of the projects it supports, In this
respect, it seeks to focus the benefits of its assistance
predominantly on the poorest and most economically
depressed areas and population groups of ils borrowing
DMCs.

Nearly three-quarters of all the world's poor are found in
the Asian and Pacific region and, although some DMCs
have done much to improve the living conditions of their
populations, the majority of people continue to lack the
most basic human needs, Most of the extremely poor live in
the countryside but there are also large pockets of poverty,
even in the relatively better-off DMCs, in the cilies, many of
which are straining from overpopulation as 2 result of the
irrepressible drift of rural people to the urban centers.

The Bank's priority efforts in helping the poor are
manifested in a three-pronged lending strategy aimed at (I)
improving productivity and social infrastructure in rural
areas; (ii) providing better educational, health and housing
facilities for the poor; and (iil} moderating population

 

growth. In operational terms, the Bank has sought to implement this strategy by concentrating its available concessional lending from ADF in the poor countries, by focusing
allocations cf resources on sectors which benefit primarily
the poor, and by judicious project selection and choice of
project design and implementation techniques.

In 1984, the Bank continusd to restrict its ADF resources
almost solely to the poorer DMCs, and during the year 93
per cent of concessional loans were allocated to these
countries, compared with 90 per cent in 1980. Bangladesh
received the targest amount of ADF loans ($191 million),
fullowed by Pakistan ($155 million), Burma ($59.5 mililon),
Nepal ($45.2 million), and Sri Lanka ($35.5 million). Jn the
three inslances in which AOF resources were provided to
middle-income countries — the Technical Education Project in Papua New Guinea, the Palawan Integrated Area
Development Project in the Philippines and tha MediumScale Irrigation Project in Thallanc — care has been taken
to target these schemes at poor people.

Most of the poor in the Rank's region jive in rural areas,
and Bank-assisled projects in the Agriculture and Agro
Industry sector directly help alleviate rural poverty and
unemployment. During the year, the Bank approved 17 project loans, Witee program loans and two sector loans for
agriculture (see page 34) which will boost the output of major staple crops and generate millions of new jobs for the
tural poor.

Bank-assisted integrated development projects,
however, confer the most widespread benefits on the
tegion’s poor. Such projects cover a wide variety of activities, including Intersectoral linkages, within a depressedarea of a country, The Palawan Integrated Area Develop
ment Project in the Philippines, for which the Bank ap
proved a $47 million blended loan in 1981, is one example of
such an approach in which both economic growth and
more direct social improvement objectives are pursued in a
comprehensive and Integrated manner.

A large proportion of Asia’s poor live on islands or in
coastal areas and rely heavily upon fish for protein. Fishing
technology, however, ramains rudimentary in many countries, During 1981, the Bank approved two loans for
fisheries projects — the Second Fisheries Davelopment
Project in Sri Lanka and the Sabah/Sarawak Fisheries Infrastructure Project in Malaysia — which together will provide additional employment opportunities for over 16,000
people and are expected to increase fish catches by 62,000
mi. annually, Over four milfion people are expected to
benefit from these developments.

There is also a shortage of high quality animal protein in
the Bank's region. Two livestock projecis approved in 1981
— the Sumatra Livestock Development Project in Indonesia
and the Smallholder Livestock Development Project in the
Philippines — will create over 8,000 new jobs and are expected to banefit aboul 250,000 farmers.

Many limber-producing DMCs are now implementing logging control and conservation policies. The Bank recognizes that forestry can be important in improving the lives
of the rural poor through raising incomes and protecting
the environment and as a fuel source. During the year, the
Bank approved a concessional loan of $11 milllon for ihe
Communily Forestry Project in Bangladesh,

in the agro-industry subsector, the Bank in 1981 approved a $72 million concessional loan far the Chittagong
Urea Fertilizer Project in Bangladesh, which will help augment food supples and benefit millions of rural poor,

Bank-assisted Integrated rural development projects
have often included health clinic camponents, but in 1981
the Bank decided to expand the scope of its assistance for
healin services. The Bank's strategy now Concentrates on
environmental heaith; preventive and curative health services; drug production and distribution, and family plan.
ning services and transmigration schemes.

Many parts of tropical Asia are chronically affected by
waterborne diseases. Water supply, sewerage and
drainage projacts therefore constitute a key part of the
Bank's eftoris to alleviate poverty. Thrae water supply pro}acts approved in 1981 — one each in Indonesia, Republic of
Korea and Philippines — are expected to increase water
production by 145,000 cubic meters per day and bring im:
proved water supplies to over 2.75 million peaple, of whom
440,000 live in conditions of acute poverty. During the year,
the Bank also approved two Health and Population prajects
— ane each in Malaysia and Pakistan — which combine
the twin objectives of better health care and controlled
population growth. The Upgrading of Hospitals Project in
Burma aims at improving essential medical and referral ser
. Vices to about 60 per cenl of the population,

Among the Bank's DMCs, about 299 million people, or 22
per cont of Lhe total, now live In urban areas. If the current
urban population growth rate of 4 per cent per annum is
malntained, this number will rise fo 430 million people by
1996. The implications of this growth rate are enormous,
both in social and enviromental terms, Recognizing the
importance of providing adequate housing for lhe growing
number of urban poor, the Bank approved $60 million for

the Second Low Income Housing Project in the Republic of
Korea in 1981. The Bank also extended $39.3 million to Indonesia for tho Medan Urban Development Project during
the year.

Bank operations In other sectors can aise bring significant benefits to the poor. For example, two Energy sector
loans approved in 1981 amounting to $122.5 million — a $35
million Rural Electrificatlon Sactor loan to Pakistan and a
very large $87.5 million loan for a Rural Electrification
scheme in the Philippines — will help improve opportunities for small businesses and ralse living standards in
rural areas. Similarly, the Bank recognizes that good feeder
roads to neglected and economically depressed areas can
greatly irnprove the productive potential of the rural poor by
improving their access to markets, services and supplies.

The Bank also recognizes that project design and implementation techniques are as important as projact selection If the poor are really to benefit from Bank assistance
In this regard, the application of appropriate technology —
one which matches the human and natural resources of the
community, reduces dependence on imports, minimizes
adverse environmental effects, creates more jobs, permits
balanced growth and improves income sharing — is
crucial. Whenever possible, the Bank tries to take these
factors into account in project planning. local materials
and Jocal skills are used whenever possible. Projects are
appraised not only on financlai grounds but also on the
hasis of economic costs and benefits. The Bank also frequently includes a benefit monitoring and evaluation
system in projects in order to measure the flow of actual
benefits io the pour and to judge whether the objectives
originally set are fully realized.

Despite considerable advances in industrialization, agriculture remains the principal means of iivelihoad and the
main determinant of averall economic grawth in the majority of the Bank’s OMCs. With few exceptions, agricultura
contributes between 50 and 70 per cent of Gross National
Product, provides employment for between 50 and 90 per
sent of the labor force and accounts for a major part ot export earnings, ranging from about one-third up to 90 per
cent of the total value of merchandise exports if processed
products are included,

Because of its overriding importance, the Bank has cor
sistently accorded high priority in its lending and technical
assistance activilies to the agriculture sector — covering
irrigation and rural development, industrial crops and agroindustry (including fertilizer production), fisheries, livestock
and forestry, and agricultural Support services {including
Credit). in the selection and formulation of projects for
financing, the Bank has taken into account the davelopment priorities and abjactives of its DMCs including the increase of food production, employment creation, earning
and saving of foreign exchange and, particularly, the
eradication of poverty.

During 1981, the Bank continued to increase the range
and volume of iis lending and technical assistance for
agriculture and rural development. In pursuit of develop:
ment objectives and in order to enhance operational efficiency, the Bank made increased use of naw methods of
lending and strangthening implementation and institutional capacity through training and consultant services, In
addition to 17 project loans, the Bank extended three Pprogram foans to enhance utilization of production potential
and past invesiment through crop Intensification programs. Two sector loans were also appraved to accelerate
and improve Implementation of irrigation develoument ang
rehabilitation. Technical assistance grants in excess of $5
million were provided for consultant services and training
in the context of project implementation and institution
building in addition to loans approved for these purposes,

During the year, Bank lending to this sector amounted to
$541.6 million in 22 loans, compared with $467.9 million in
22 loans in 1980, Technical assistance amounted ta $8.2
million tor 24 projects, compared with #9.8 million for 30
projects in 1980.

In terms of overall Bank lending, the Agriculture and
Agro-Indusiry sactor received approximately one-third (32.3
per cent) of total loaris during 1981, compared with 92.6 per
cent in 1980. This sector also received 55.2 per cent of the
Bank's technical assistance, compared with 69.2 per cent
in 1980.

In addition, the Bank processed two loans for exclusive
financing by the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) in the amount of $35.6 million,

Total Bank lending to this sector as of the end of 1981
amounted to $2,806 million for 172 projects, while technical
assistance amounted io £49.8 million for 212 projects.

(rrigation and Rural Development: Raising food produc:
tion and diversifying agricultural outpul and the rural
economy remain the primary objectives of Bank-assisied
agriculture projects. Irrigation, combined with flood control

 

and drainage measures, Is the central factor in crop intensification strategies, The Bank pays close attention to increasing employment opportunities and raising rural incomes and emphasizes an integrated approach to rural
development projects. Special emphasis is put on
strenglhening rural institutions and ensuring the increased
participation of smallholders and landless workers in Bankassisted projects.

The Bank is concerned about delays in the implementation of projects and the long gestation periods before anlicipated project benefits are fully realized. Greater emphasis has, therefore, been placed on smaller-scale
schemes that employ simpler technology which can be
mare readily implemented and from which benefits can be
generated more rapidly. Similarly, incraased emphasis has
been placed on projects designed to rehabilitate and expand existing irrigation facililies and to improve water
Management in order to generate benefits more rapidly and
to utilize existing resources and Bank funds more efftectively. During 1981, the Bank approved Its first two water
resources scctor loans ($50 million for the Small-Scale Ir

Furthermore, the Bank approved-a $30 milion loan from
“QGR for the Farmers’ Organization Support Services Project in Malaysia which aims at assisting an estimated
- 100,000 smallholders through establishment of farmers’
davelopment centers, provision of farm mechanization ser
vices, and improving socio-economic canditions in the
depressed traditional crop farming sector which suffers
from a labor shortage and low labor productivity.

Three other loans — all concessional -- were to finance
Crop Intenstfication Programs In Bangladesh ($16 million),
Burma ($6 million with co-financing of $45 million from the
OPEG Fund for Internationa! Development) and Nepal ($4
million). The major part of these loans will be used for Importing chemical fertilizer to raise crop yields through in

‘Populationtreased and more balanced use of fertilizer, This Is complemented by facilities and services for extension, storage,
transportation, distribution and credit provision to remove
constraints on increased fertilizer use.

A large majority of projects approved in 1981 include a
built-in Project Benefits Monitoring and Evaluation element. This is particularly important in the two sector loans
where subprojects have nol yet been finally determined and
where the resuits of the monitoring of the subprojects first
selected wilt help in the selection and design of subsequent
schemes.

The sector loan for Bangladesh also includes a revolving
fund to finance local expenditures. Beth the Bank and the
Government of Bangladesh will contribute to this fund
which will help remove bottlenecks in the provision of
funds, “and thereby improve the pace of implementation of
the project. This is a new approach, both for Bangladesh
and for the Bank, and will be carefully monitored.

In 1981, the Bank approved 13 loans! amounting to
$348.8 million in the Irrigation and Rural Development
subsector. This accounted for 64 per cent of the Bank’s
total lending for Agriculture and Agro-Industry during the
year and raised the cumulative lending for the subsector to
$1,610,2 million.

(Industrial Crops and Agro-industry: The Bank’s approach to this subsector covers nat only investment in processing facilities but also omphasizes the provision of raw
materials for processing!

Ouring the year, the Bank extended four loans io this
subsector amounting to $423 million. The first ($12 million
for the Coconut Development Projact in Sri Lanka) is being
co-financed by IFAD and aims to revitalize this important
export sector through provision of inputs and axtension to
about 75,000 smallholders and modernization of processing facilitles. The second ($23 million for the Nucieus
Estate and Smallholder Cotton Project in South Sulawesi)
aims to reduce Indonesia's dependence on cotlon imports
and will benefit about 25,000 larm families. The Bank also
approved a $16 million loan to Burma in 1981 for the Paddy
and Rice Storage Project, involving, among olhers, the provision of modern paddy storage facilities in the Irrawaddy
Division and at Rangoon Port.

Increased and reliabie supply of chernicai fertilizer is
essential for raising ‘agricultural production in general and
that of foodgrains in particular. Helping DMGs achieve
these objectives provides the rationale of Bank support for
fectilizer projects tn Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and
Sri Lanka,

During 1981, the Bank extended a concessional loan of
$/2 million — the largest ever from AOF — for the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Project in Bangladesh. The loan will
cover part of the foreign exchange requirements of the Project. The halance of $224 million is being mel by six olher
co-financiers. After completion, the Project is expected to
produce about 560,000 tons of urea annually using indiganous natural gas as feedstock and fuel, enabling
Bangladesh lo achieve self-sufficiency in urea fertilizer and
to export the remaining surplus. Net foreign exchange sayings and earnings are estimated at $114 million a year.

At the end of 1981, the Bank had provided a total of $604

milllon in loans for 36 projects in this subsector, and $3.7 .
million in technical assistance for 25 projects.

Fisheries: Fisherles are important in developing

regional foad resources and the Bank continuss to provide
financial and technical assistance to this subsector
directed primarliy to artisanal fishermen and fish farmers.
The Bank aims to increase the availability of flsh and fish
products [or domestic consumption, to increase exports
and lo generate more gainful employment, thereby raising
the incomes of fishermen and fish tarmers.

The Bank envisages further development of fisheries in

line with its policy of assisting low-income artisanal
fishermen and fish farmers. The potential for increased
Bank assistance to this subsector has been enhanced by
declarations of 200-mile exclusive economic zones by many
countries which have considerably expanded marine
resources within national jurisdictions and the expansion
and intensification of aquaculture in DMCs.

approved for the ongoing Java Fisherles Devetopment Project in Indonesia. Technical assistance for project prepara:
tion was extended to the Second Irian Jaya Fisheries
- Development Project and Lhe Srackishwater Project in (ndonesia, the Aquaculture Project in Sri Lanka and the
Baluchistan Fisheries Project in Pakistan. A regional
technical assistance grant was also approved to update a
. Fish Market Study. 8
At the end of 1981, the Bank had made 29 loans amounting to $367.6 million for fisheries and aquaculture development and provided an addiliona! $742,000 for fisheries components in three rural development projects. tt had also extended 26 technical assistance grants amounting to $5.6
million to this subsoctor.

Livestack: Livestock is an intagral part of the economic
Structure of subsistence agriculture and of village life
throughout the region us the rearing of livestock consti
tutes a profitable family activity. In line with the Bank's
policy of assisting the rural poor, livestock producers are
now receiving more attention. Many DMCs have been successtul in increasing basle grain production in recent
years, and attention is now being paid to a greater extent to
livestock to utilize feed resources not in a form for human
consumption. New livestock projects emphasize increasing
the number of animals owned by smallholders and providing support services for required inputs and technology.

The Bank recognizes thal the genelic potential of the
region’s animals could be improved substantially, Combined with better teeding, this would enhance the availabiltty of animal protein and improves diets for the rural population and increase the Income-generating capacity of rural
areas, .

During the year, two livestock loans were approved: the
Sumatra Livestock Project in Indonesia and the Smallhoider Livestock Prolect in the Philippines. Both are designed to Increase malnly smallholder livestock output and
the supply of animal products to meet domestic demand.

Ai the end of 1981, the Bank had provided $81.3 miltion In
loans for elght livestock projects in eight DMCs, in addition
to almost $14 million in loans for livestock components in
seven area development projects and three agricultural
eredit projects. To date, the Bank has provided 19 technical

_ assistance granis In this subsector, amounting to about $4

million. :

Forestry: Traditionally, Bank support for foresiry has
concentrated on log extraction, processing and afforestation for industrial use, fuelwood production and environmental protaction. Afforestation has become very
urgent in many of the Bank’s DMCs due to diminishing
wood supplies and sharply increased costs of alternative
sources of fuel.

During 1981, the Bank approved a concessional loan of
$11 million for the Community Forestry Project in
Bangladesh. This is the first forestry project Involving active participation of rural communitles and aims at reducing a widening fuelwood gap which cannot be effected
through public sector involvement alone. The joan was ac:
companied by technical assistance grants tolalting $2.09
million {of which $1.84 million is to be financed by UNDP)
for project implementation and development of institu
tional capability to undertake large-scale community
forestry activilies. Technical assistance of $116,000 was
also approved forthe preparation of a Forest Development
Project in Pakistan.

At the end of 1981, the Bank had provided five loans
amounting to $50./ million to the forestry subsector, and
48 technical assistance grants amounting to $3.9 million.

Energy

During the year, the Regional Energy Survey, commissioned by the Bank in 1980, was completed and published.
The Survey provided a comprehensive assessment of the
Energy sector situation, needs and prospects of tha
DMCs." It highlighted the three principal dimensions of the
anergy problem: (i) the heavy and increasing foreign exchange burden imposed on DMCs by rising oil prices; (Ii)
the high capital costs associaled with developing in

digenous energy resources as alternatives to imported oil;
and (iii) the greater demands being placed on the already
diminished non-commercial energy resources of rural areas
due to higher costs of alternative commercial fuels. EmPhasizing the faci that domestic savings and export earnings of most of the DMCs will be inadequate in the decade
ahead to meet energy sector investment and import saquirements, the Survey enjoined international finance
agencies (IFAs} to assume the task af mobilizing the
necessary external financial resources and channeling
thom toward well-formulated national energy development
plans.

The Survey recommended that {FAs broaden their portfolios by increasing support far projects involved in indigenous energy resource development, improving the effisiency of energy use in energy-intensive seciors of the
economy, promoting the conservation of energy. and
enhancing the capability of national institutions lo formulate and implemeat effectively comprehensive anergy
develupment plans and policlas.

In the context of Ihe Regional Energy Survey findings,
the Bank considers it appropriate to (i) increase its overall
financial assistance for the Energy sector: (ii) assist in lhe
mobillzation of additional oxternal resvurces for Energy
sector development through co-financing with official and
commercial sources: (ill) widen the range of assistance lo
Include such activities as energy master planning, prepara:

tion of energy conservation programs, and development of
renewable and tural energy resources; and (iv) provide increased support lo ite development af technical and
managerial! manpower resources in the DMCs required for
the effactive implementation of energy programs and projects. The Bank proposes to implement this policy in closer
coordination with olher IFAs and bilateral aid agencies.

in line with this approach, Bank lending and technical
assistance during the year underwent significant changes
both in quantitative and qualitative terms. The number of
joan projects in the Energy sector incraased from nine in
1980 to 11 in 1981 with the total amount rising from $382.4
million to $480.1 million,

In addition to such signiticant quantitative increases,
there were also major qualitative changes, Under the Power
System Rehabilitation and Expansion Profect in
Bangladesh, for which the Bank provided $26.5 million [rom
ADF, rehabilitation and improvemont of existing power
system facilitles will be taken up in an acceleraled manner,
contributing lo improved operational efficiency. Likewise, a
$8.3 million concessional loan to Nepal will assist in electrifying a aumber of outlying rural demand centers through
the development of a renawabie energy resource, namely,
mint-hydropower. Development of a new, renewabla energy
souree |s also envisaged under a $87.5 million OCR loan to
the Phillppines for Rural Ftectrification which will help set
up three minl-hydro plants lo meet requiremants of in-1981

dividual demand cenlers ii the rural areas, Assistance In
the field of rural energy development also included a $36
million concessional sector loan for Rural Electrification in
Pakistan which will provide electricity io about 900 villages
‘nationwide over the period 1982-84.

in addition to Bank loans in the areas of rural and
renewable energy and improving the efficiency of cnergy
systems, Bank assistance during 1981 aiso emphasized the
development and utilization of indigenous energy
resources — mainly tydronower and natural gas. During
the year, Bank assistance was also aimed at rationalizing
the transmission and distribulion systems of its DMCs,
through rehabilitation, interconnection and extension so
thal power could be brought to more people with greater efficiency and reliability. Bank-assisted rural electrification
projects will also provide Incraasad economic apportunities and improve ihe quality of life of the rural poor.

Diversification of Bank assistance and increased emphasis on improving institutional capabillties are also
raflected in the technical assistance provided to the Energy
sector during the year. Under technical assistance projects
to Indonesia and Nepal, major institution-bullding and
Manoower-training efforts will be undertaken. Assistance
was also provided during the year to bring out collaboration
between the power utililies of two DMCs (Bangladesh and
Thalland) for the purpose of training arid information exchange. Under technical assistance grants to the Phillip
pines and Pakistan, training and studies for improving
financial management of their respective powar agencies
will be assisted. Technical assistance was also provided
during the year to evaluate some of the issues concerning
naw and renewable energy options, such as dendro-thermal
development. Findings of this technical assistance may
have wider applications to other DMCs, thereby accelarating the pace of adoption of such new options.

Two significant new projects, expected to be implemented in 1982, were prepared during the year: a study
of industrial energy utilization in the Philippines and
technical assistance for the development of an industrial
anergy conservation program; and a major reassessment of
the energy supply/demand situation in Bangladesh and formulation of approximate and feasible national energy
development plans,

The Bank continued its policy of strengthening borrowing institdtions through technical and other assistance in
such areas as the design of tariffs, systems planning,
iInancial managament and evaluation of new cnorgy
sources. Plans were also mada for a meeting of major
donor agencies in Manila in early 1982 to review the scope
and coverage of ongoing and planned energy development
planning activities in DMCs and to promote greater coordination of such efforts in the future.

During 1981 Bank technical assistance for the Energy
sector amounted to $2.8 million for nine projects compared

    

  
 
 
  

3940

with Just over $1 million for four projects.in 1980. At the end
of the year, total Energy sector lending amounted to
$2,443.4 million for 94 projects. Total technical assistance
amounted to $11.7 million for 47 projects.

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals

The majority of the Bank's DMCs have assigned high
priority to industrialization as a strategy for achieving
balanced and accelerated socio-economic development.
Due to their diverse economic conditions and cultural
backgrounds, the potential for industrial development In in
dividual DMCs varies greatly. The Bank’s fundamental
stategy is to help DMCs davalop their basic industries and
industrial infrastructures, taking into account their levels
of economic development, resource endowments {parlicularly energy), size of domestic markets and international trade relations. It does Lhis in two ways: by direct
lending for large-scale projects and by indirect lending
through development finance institutions (DFls) which are
involved in the promotion of small and medium-scale
industries.

Recognizing the importance of srnall and medium-scale
industries as a means to generate employment for the
growing labor farce in DMCs and to achieve a more
equitable income distribution and a wider ownership of the
means of industrlal production, the Bank has increasingly
placed emphasis on developing institutional infrastruc
tures necessary to promote and support such industries. A
major constraint on the development of the small and
madium Industry (SMI) sector in the majority of DMCs is the
lack of Suitable institutions to provide practical training in
modern industrial business management and modern
manufacturing and production techniques for SMI entrepreneurs, managers and operators.

Heflecting its policy of emphasizing the development of
SMIs, the Bank in 1981 extendad a $13 million OCR loan to
the Republic of Korea for ihe Small and Medium industry
Management and Technology Institute Project. This Project
will provide Lhe country’s SMI sector with better training for
Managerial and technical staff, and isiitial refresher training for industrial exlension service officers who are needed
to help SMls achieve greater operational efficiency, higher
productivity and better standards.

Development of non-fuel mineral resources for exporl
and domestic consumption can play an important role in
improving the balance of paymenis position of some
DMCs. A major constraint in the development of mineral
fesources is the lack of basic information and data for
assessing and evalualing mineral deposits. In 1981, Bank
aclivitics in the Non-Fual Mineral sector focused ort follow:
up of earlier tachnical assistance for the develonmant and
upgrading of national institutional capabllities and facilities for conducting geological, geophysical and geochemical surveys, as well as mineral exploration programs
to generate the iflurmation and data needed for the promotion of mineral resources development.

During the ycar, the Bank extended a_ technical
assistance grant of $190,000 to Pakistan to carry out a
feasibility study for a Gypsum Mining Project in Punjab
Province. The Project aims at increasing the production of
gypsum for use in raconditioning agricultural soils which
have bean affected by salinily, as well as tor use in cement
Production.

Development Banks

in 1981, the Bank continued to assist the growth of small
and medium-scale industries through DFls. The Bank’s
assistance to DFls complements its direct financing of
large-scale industrial projects which, through sectoral linkages to small and medium-scale industries, strengthens
and diversities the manufacturing sector and facilitales a
more effective utilization of existing capacity and wider
possibilities for industrial growth. The size and operational
scope of DF ls in the Bank's region varies greatly, reflecting
the differing needs of governments and economies for industrial financing. In general, DFis are able to channel and
disperse medium and long-term funds to a large number of
industrial development projects which are too small for
direct Bank financing. Bank assistance to DFlIs tends to
Promote strong and efiectiva domestic investment institu.
tions which play an important role in mobilizing domestic
and foreign resources.

DFls also undertake promotional activities that contribute to the development of the private industrial sector
through the Identification of investment opportunities and
the fostering of entrepreneurship. In many cases, they take
the lead in mobilizing and coordinating efforts to overcome
obstacles to industrialization, They have also contributed
to increases ir incomes and savings mobilization through
the expansion of the financial infrastructure of the
economy and the creation of skilled and unskilled employment opporlunities. Thase institutions also function as major ceniers for the dissemination of modern management
techniques, thus heiping to raise the level of industrial efftciency and productivity.

During the year, the Bank made six [oans to DFIs
amounting to $204 miltion. The loans, In the form of foreign
currency credit lines, will be re-lent by the recipient BEIs
mainly to small and medium-scale industrial enterprises.
The loans will also serve to strengthen the institutional and

These loans ranged from a $4 million loan to Lhe Develop.
iment Bank of Western Samoa (OBWS) to four relatively
large-sized credit lines — $30 million to the Citizens National Banis of Korea (CNR), $50 million each to the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT} and the National Development Finance Corporation of Pakistan
{NDFC) and $60 million to the Korea Long Term Credit Bank
(KLB). The loan to KLB has attracted co-financing of $50
million from commercial sources, the firsl time cofinancing from commercial sources has been blended with
a Bank loan to a DFI. The Bank also extended $10 million
during the year as its first loan to the National Development
Bank of Sri Lanka (NDBSL), which was established in 1979,
to promote industrial and agricultural development in both
the public and private sectors of the country.

At the end of 1981, the Bank had approved 64 credit lines
amounting to $4,310 million to 26 DFls in 17 DMGs, This
represented 13.4 per cent of total Bank lending.

Transport and Communications

Development of an adequate and etiective transportatlon Infrastructure has long been recognized as an impor:

clal resources of most OMCs fiave obliged many of them,
however, to review their priorities of Investment. This, in
turn, has also had an impact on the Bank's level and pattern of lending in the Transport and Communications
seclor.

Consequently, the share of transportation in the tolal
lending of the Bank registered a significant decline -- trom
an average of 21.3 pec cent in the period 1972-74 to 9.5 per
cent in the perlod 1979-81. Tha sharp decline in the share of
lending for the sector in 1981 to an all-time low of 4,3 per
cent is parily a reflection of this lrend and partly attributable to special circumstances leading to cancellation
of certain projects afler they had reached an advanced
stage. .

investment priorities within the transportation sector
have also undergone substantial changes. Whereas in the
past development of national and arterial road networks
and large ports and airports accounted for a major part of
the investment in this sector, the focus in recent years has
shifted to secondary and feeder roads for opening up new
areas and rural roads and the development of secondary
and minor ports. Transportation is also often included as a
component in integrated agricultural development projects. During 1982, the Bank plans to undertake a study of
the impact of higher energy cosis on priorities of investment in the transportation sector with a view to assessing
the future priorities of DMCs aad to developing an appropriate strategy for Bank assistance in this sector.

During 1981, (he Bank's first loan to the Republic of
Maldives was approved, $1 million for an Interisland
Transport Project. This Project, which follows technical
assistance extended earlier by the Bank, is being cofinanced hy the OPEC Fund for International Development.
The loan will help provide ihe country's first reliable,
scheduled shipping services between the capital island of
Male and the widely scattered atolls. It is expected to
benefit (he country's agriculture sector which ts heavily
dapendaent on regular transport services for the marketing
of perishable products, stimulate intra-atoll trade and promote social aud administrative integration.

During the year, the Bank also approved a $71.4 million
loan - - the single largest loan so far in (his seclor — for the
Songkhla and Phuket Ports Project in Thailand. This loan
wilf enable deepwater berthing facilities to be constructed
at two important porls in south Thailand — Songktila on
the east coast and Phuket on tha west — to allow for direct
loading and discharging of carga, thereby eliminating current lighterage operations and transshipment of cargo
through othar international ports. Under the Project, two interconnected bridges having a total length of 28 km.
across Songkhla Lake will also be constructed.

Seven technical assistance projects were approved hy
the Bank for this sector in 1981. A technical assistance
grant of $100,000 was extended for the preparation of a
feasibilily report to improve and expand Lautoka Port, the
second largest port in Fiji. The Bank also approved two

 

attechnical assistance grants for feaslbility studies and
preparation of rural roads projects In Papua New Guinea
and Indonesia and a supplementary technical assistance
lo Kiribati for the completion of geotechnical investigations in connection with a causeway project financed by
the Bank. In addition, the Bank, acting as Executing Agency, approved three other technical assistance grants for
road projects In Bangladesh, Nepal (both with finaneing
from the Government of Switzerland) and Philippines (with
financing from UNDP). :

At the end of 1981, the Bank had approved 90 loans
amounting to $1,354 million for 84 projects in the Transport
and Communications sector. Within the sector, roads and
ports projects received the major share of funding with 53
per cent and 96 per cent, respectively, followed by airports
{7 per cent), rallways (4 per cent) and telecommunications (1
per cent)

Water Supply and Sewerage

The improvement of Water Supply and Sewerage
facilities is of critical importance to the health and secioeconomic progress of Asia. It tas Leen estimated that ai
any given time there are about 156 million Asians suffering
fram gastro-enteritis and that if everyone had access io
sale drinking water and sanitation, infant mortality would
he reduced by 50 per cent.

The objective of the United Nations’ International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade, which started In
November 1980, is to provide sate drinking water and adequate sanilation to everyone in the developing world by the
year 1990. In the past, the Bank had made a significant contribution to the improvement and expansion of water supplies in major urban centers and reducing the problems
caused by inadequate and overloaded sewerage systems
which particularly alfeet the urban poor. This role has been
enlarged in recent years with Bank financing being dlrectad
increasingly to projects In provinclal and rural areas, This
trend will continuc and future Bank aclivilies will show &
balanced spread between major urban water and sewarage
systems and relatively simple village water and sanitation
systems. With its considerable experience in several major
sewerage projects in large urban areas, the Bank has
recantly become invalved in comprehensive studies of air,
water and solid waste pollution in order to determine the
most cast-eflective appraach to environmental protection

In (981, a $46 million sector loan was approved for a projecl in the Philippines which will expand the water supply
systems in three major urban centers and also provide a
reliable water supply service in 44 small urban areas which
al presenl have intermittent, unsafe water supplies.

A $35.6 million loan was also provided in 1981 to Indonesia to provide an additional groundwater supply
Source and to renabilitate fhe distribution system in
Aamarang, the country's fifth largest city: Under the Proj:
ect, an adequate and reliable water supply will be provided
to densely populated areas.

Three provincial cities in the Republic of Korea will also
benefil from a $38.1 millign loan which will help finance tne
expansion of their water supply systems. Another Joan to
that country, for $4.1 million, will finance the foreign exchange cost of consultant services to carry oul siudias an
the protection of the envirenment of the Han River Basin.
About 12 rnillion pcople reside in lhe river basin area, which

includes the city of Seoul. Under tha Bank loan a long-term
master pian covering the control of air, water and solid
waste pollution will be formulated and high priority first
stage projects identified and prepared.

Threaa project preparatory technical assistance grants
were provided in 1981, In the Republic of Korea, $150,000
was provided to assist in the preparation of a project for the
expansion of water supply systems in 21 municipalities and
another $50,000 was provided for the preparation.of long
lent! master plans and first stage projects in 15 cities
throughout the country. In the Philippines, the feasibility of
@ bulk waler supply scheme for 24 munlelpalities in
Bulacan province will be determined with $150,000 in
technical assistance.

The Bank approved four loans amounting to $123.7
million for this sector in 1981, Total Bank lending for water
Supply and sewerage projects al the end of 1981 amounted
lo $829.5 million, Covering 40 projects in 13 countries.

Urban Development

The Bank's focus in the Urban Development sector has
been mainly on programs which will help stem thecert:

and also, where necessary, housing for low-income groups,
and by improving the capabilities of the institutions respansible for urban development. The Bank also seeks to reduce
pressures on primary cities by checking the influx of people
through the development of rural arcas and secondary
urban centers. Water Supply and Sewerage sector loans
also contribute directly to the Bank's urban development
programs.

During 1981, the Bank approved $99.3 million for two urban development projects. It also approved $680,000 for
two technical assistance projects which will receive financing of $530,000 from UNDP.

The Second Low Income Urban Housing Project in ihe
Republic of Korea (the first was approved in 1979} is de
signed to ease the acute shortage of urban housing among 
jow-income groups in some of the country's primary and
secondary cities. The Project will provide about 9,600 housing units and benefit about 43,000 persons in 1983, In Indonesia, the Medan Urban Davelonpment Project is designed to meel the priority needs of the city in water supply,
sanitatlon and housing. [he Project involves components
In waler supply, sewerage, drainage, salid waste management, upgrading of low-income residential area, sites and
services with core housing, institutional develapment and
an urban land management study. The improvementextension of urban services under the Project will, on completion
in 1986, benefit over one million people. Also'ln Indonesia, a
technical assistance grant for the Small Towns Kampung
Impravement Project will prapare a sector loan for the improvement of kampungs in about 36 small and mediumsized towns in Central Java. The Low Cost Housing technical assistance in Malaysia, partially funded by UNDP, will
prepare a project designed lo meel ihe housing needs of
low-income groups in selacted urban areas in Peninsular
Malaysia.

At the end of 4981, total lending for the sector amounted
to $239.3 million for nine loans and $724,500 for five
technical assislance projects, excluding contributions
amounting to $854,500 from UND? for three technical
assistance grants.

Education

The Bank recognizes the crucial role of education in
economic and social development. While continuing to amphasize technical and vocational cducation the Bank has
also been extending its support for other areas of education. Bank projects generally support educational devetopment consistent with overall development needs. Projects
for technical and vocational aducation aim mainly at
upgrading the quality of training and occupational skills. [n
project formulation and appraisal, attention ig given to a
wide range of assistance covering such aspects as
upgrading of educational and supgort facilities; provision
of equipment: revision of curricula; provision of academic
and technical consultants; fellowships for staff development; and management and institutional improvernent, all
in the context of supporting a country’s manpower and
development needs,

Four projects amounting to $82.5 million were approved
In the Education sector during the year, Including the Com
munity Schools Project in Bangladesh which marked the
Bank’s first involyement in non-formal education. This Project aims to improve the skills and productivity of the rural
population by establishing and equipping workshap
facililies in about 200 secondary schools. These schaois
will offer non-formal training programs as well as civic
education programs in nutrition, heallh and family health
care and will become the focal centers for community
educatlon. The Technical Education Project in Papua New
Guinea will improve and expand tectinical education and
apprentice training through the provision of better facilities
and equipment and the establishment of a Technical
Teachers’ Training Center and an Apprantice Training
Center.

The Technical and Vocational Education Project in the
Philippines will help produce better trained middle-level
technical manpower resources in the context of ac
celeratad industrialization. The Project will upgrade 23
technical education institutes throughout the country from
which about 20 per cent of the country's annual incremental needs for technicians are expected to be drawn. The
fourth project aims at upgrading the University of North
Sumatra to improve the output of high-level manpower
needed mainly for the development of the western region, a
relatively backward area of Indonesia. Six faculties in the
fields of agriculture, engineering, science, medicine, dentistry and economics will benefit from a comprehensive
program, covering construction and refurbishing of
facilities, development of a demonstration farm, equipping
of laboralories and workshops, strengthening of support
facilities, supply of books and periodicals, fellowships arid
consultant services,

During the year, the Bank also approved project
preparatory tachnical assistance ta Nepal to improve
science education and to Thailand for agricultural education. In Nepal, a team of consultants will explore the
feasibility of setting up centers for upgraded training of
science teachers, selecting. secondary schools for |Improved science instruction, enriching sclence curricula and
providing facilities and equipment. In Thailand, consultants
will study the feasibility of upgrading facilities at a number
of existing agricultural training institutions according to
agricultural manpower requirements, regional needs, and
areas of specialized demand. The Bank will also act as Ex
ecuting Agency for the Vocational and Industrial Training
Project in Singapore, for which UNDP is providing $542,720
in technical assistance.

At the end of 1981, Bank assistance for education
amounted to $296.3 million for 21 loans and $3.3 milllon for
18 technical assistance projects

Health and Population

Bank assistance for heallh and population projacts increased sharply in 1981. The Bank adopts a comprehensive
approach to health improvement and populalion programs
in its DMGs. Ils main support ts for primary health care services, including family planning, and for improvements to
health detivery systems in support of primary health care
services through the upgrading of haalth and support
facillties, provision of equipment, medical supplies,
development of manpower and the provision of consultant
services and fellowships

During 1981, three projects amouniing to $69.3 million

4344

were approved for the Health and Population sector, two of
which resulted fram previous Bank technical assistance.
The Health and Population Project in Malaysia, which the
Bank is supporting with $25.8 million from OCR, provides
for the expansion of primary health care and family planning services, and basic hospital facilities through the construction and equipping. of health centers and district
hospitals and provision of consultant services and on-thejob training for health staff. Tne Upgrading of Hospitals
Project In Burma, for which the Bank provided $18.5 million
from ADF, is designed io support several components of
the health services delivery system including upgrading of
rural hospital facilities, establishment of facilities for the
repair and maintenance of medicat equipment, strengthening of the drug distribution netwark (including supply of
essential drugs). and improvements to paramedical training facilities.

The Health and Population Project in Pakistan, which the
Bank is financing with a $16 million concessional loan,
aims to improve the functioning of District and Tehsil (a
smaller administrative unit) hospitals In Punjab Province
inrough the establishment of paramedical technician training schools, supply of medical equipment including related
maintenance and repair workshops, and provision of consultant services and fellowships. The Project also provides
direct assistance for population sarvices at selected
hospitals in Punjab Province.

in ather sectors, apart from Water Supply and Seweraga
projects, where health is inherently an important considera:
tion, specific health components have been included in the
Second Multiproject Loan In Tonga, which provides new
health centers, and tha Palawan Integrated Area Development Project in the Philippines, which includes a malaria
control comporisnt.

At the end of 1981, the Bank had dpproved six loans in
the Health and Population sector amounting to $113.4 mil
lion and $1.1 ralllion for six technical assistance projects

Multiproject Loans

Multiproject joans are considered as a separate calegory
because they combine components relating to several sectors [In one package, With a growing number of such loans,
the approach has proved to be highly suceesstul ir meeting
a variely of needs of the smaller South Pacific DMCs In a
special framework — flexible, practical and economical
from the viewpoint of the recipient DMCs as well as of the
Bank, {n 1981, the Bank made its third multiproject loan —
to Tonga — amounting to $1.68 million. The loan covered
five subprojects relaled to agriculture, fisheries, health,
roads and tourism.

Despite the relatively small amounl involved, tne three
loans have covered as many as 21 widely dispersed subprojects in several sectors and ranging in individual
estimated total costs from $45,000 to $299,000, with the
single exception of the Vanilla Development subproject in
Tonga which has an estimated total cost of about $1.6
million. The loans have proved lo be probably the fastest
disbursing Bank foans, and tn view of the special needs and
features of the smaller South Pacific OMCs, they have afforded maximum flexibility in the preparation, approval,
supervision and administration of the subprojects.

The three multiproject loans to date amount to $3.88
million.

Loan Administration

During the year, 357 loans were under administration,
compared with 326 in 1980. The Increase, together with the
implementation of more complex and socially oriented pro}ects, prompted the Bank to initiate measures to cope with
the expanding volume of loan administration activities and
to strengthen its capability to supervise the projects it
finances.

The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under Asian
Development Bank Loans was revised during 1981. The
ravised guidelines, which are mare comprehensive and
detailed, aim to provide better guidance to borrowers as
well as to suppliers and contractors, thereby facilitating
the procurement of goods and services, In addition, a Procurement Handbook has been prepared and Is being
distributed to the executing agencies. The preparation of
sample standard tender decuments and sampis conditions
of contract in cotlaboration with other international lending
institutions is Underway and will be completed in early
1982,

In order to facilitate the identification of prospective candidates for consultancy assignments and to better assess
their qualifications, the use of the Data on Consultants
(DACON} form for registration of consultants was expanded and computerized. The Bank also carried out studies on
ihe local consulting industry In some DMCs and ascer

There were significant developments in project monitoring and supervision — a key loan administration activity —
in 1981. In the course of the year 345 [ull project reviews (including those donc by fact-finding and appraisal missions}
were carried out. Supplementing these loan administration
missions for indlvidual projects, six country disbursement
missions and lwo country review missions were also undertaken to help expedite disbursements and to better
famillarize project agencies with the Bank's loan administration procedures. On a much wider basis, country
profiles of implementation performance, providing an Indepth assessment of an individual country’s experience,
have been completed for four selected DMCs. Other Imporfant steps taken toward project monitoring were the intensitiod project reviews -~ especially with respect to projects
beset with start-up problems — and the distribution of
Critical Path Method (GPM) networks, which Indicale lhe
varlous tasks lo be done and identify for executing agencles the critical activities to be performed within a definite

Racognizing the importance of providing borrowers with
suitable training opportunities in order to improve Lheir irriplementation capabilities, the Bank conducted three
seminars In 1981 at its Headquarters: two on procurement
and one on project implementation management. A total of

. 63 participants from 15 DMCs attended these seminars.
Furthermore, four country seminars on procurement were
held in Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and Philippines, with the
participation of 134 senior and middle-level officials involved In procurement.

The total value of contracts awarded during the year was

$646 million, against $841 million in the previous year, while
toiat disbursements amounted to $667 million against $679
million in the previous year.

Cisbursements under ordinary loans improved from $429
miflion to $518 million. There was, however, a marginal
reduction In disbursements under Special Funds joans
from $160.3 million in 4980 to $149.2 million in 1984 for the
following reasons: {i} most of the loans which were being
disbursed related to projects in sectors where the period of
implementation is relatively long and, consequently,
disbursament is spread out over a wider period; {ii) shortage
of local funds slowed down progress of certain projects;

   

4546

and (iii) implementation problems in some major borrowing
countries had a significant effect on the overall disbursement performance.

The ratias of cumulative amounts of contracts awarded
and disbursed relative to the total amount of effective
loans as of the end of 1981 were 55 per cent and 47 per cent,
respectively, comparad with 57 per cent and 46 per cent,
respectively, in 1980,

Projects Completed

A total of 19 projects were completed in 1981, bringing
the total number of projects complated to 172 out of 509
projects approved lo (he end of the year. Five of the 19 prajects wera in the Agriculture and Agro-Indusiry sector, and
the remainder were distributed in Transport and Communications (foun, Energy, Development Banks, and Water
Supply and Sewerage (three each), and Industry and NonFuel Minerals (one).

Buring 1981, 20 Project Completion Reports (PCRs) were
completed, compared with 25 in 1980. In addition, 11 PCRs
have been substantially completed and will be circulated in
early 1982 A total of G8 PCRs have been prepared out of 164
projects which have been completed up te 31 December
1981.

Post-Evaluation

Post-Evaiuation is viewed in the Bank as an important
management tool and asa key input far policy making. In
order to ensure that evaluation staff can make independent
judgments, the Posl-Evaluation Office (PEO) is organized
as @ separate unit reporting directly to the President

Because of the importance attached to post-avaluatinn
activities by ihe Board of Directors, its Audit Committee is
requirad to satisfy itself that the Bank's past-evaluation activities are adequate and efflclent. The Audit Committes
meets periodically with the Chief, PEO io review progress.
Individual post-avaluation reports are discusssd on a selec:
tive basis as are PEO's activities, procedures and annual
work program.

During the past year as in the two preceding years, PEO
foucused on the preparation of Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs) which evaluata, varify and audit the tind.
ings of Project Completion Reparts (PCRs) prepared by the
respective project departments for completed projects
Aspects of the project reviewed during this independent
assessment include project preparation and appraisal, joan
documentation, project implementation, operating performance, economic evaluation and assessment of the Bank’s
performance. s

The Bank, in its post-evaluation reports, uses, as appropriate, a varicty of tests in assessing the performance of
compleied projects. These lesis, which are by no means
mutually exclusive, approach the project from different
perspectives. Thus ihe achievemenl tesl judges success
using objectives adopted at appraisal as the standards of
comparison. The effectiveness test determines whether the
project compcnents provided were sufficient to attain, or
contributed to the attainmant af, the stated abjectives. The
efficiency test determines whether the selected project
was completed in ihe munimum possible time and constituted the least cost alternative, or whether avoidable
delays occurred, and if the costs of attaining the objectives

were reasonable compared to alternative methods of
achieving the same objectives. Ine adequacy test deter.
mines whether the measures used by the Bank during projeci appraisal and implementation proved adequate to cnsure attainment of «a project's objectives within the
framework of lhe borrower's capabilities and the Bank's
guidelines and procedures, Finally, the significance lest
determinas whether the project made a significant contribution to economic and social development of the country concerned,

PFO staff discuss drafts of each post-avaluation report
wilh concerned officers of other Departments and Offices S
of the Bank as well as providing drafts to executing agen a
cies for comment. Their attention is specifically drawn to
the findings and conclusions submitted by PEO. Bank staff
at the operational level thus become aware of PEO’s findings and lessens learncd can be suitably noted when
preparing future projects. The appraisal reports for some
projects have contained specific references to pastevaluations which had previously been undertaken on
similar projects. :

PEO follows up with concerned Bank staff and executing H
agencles to determine what actlon has been taken on the i
suggestions included in ils post-evaluation reports. A suimmary report on the Implementation Status of Findings and
Conclusions found in post-evalualion reports is prepared. 5
Also, each year PEO staff review the major results of in- é
dividual PPARs in order to dariva broader conclusions 4
which are reported ta the Board in an Annual Review .of
Post-Evaluation Reports,

During 1981, PEO post-evaluated 35 projects which were
reviewed in 30 separate reports. These projects were under

eajaken in 13 countries and covered ten sectors of Bank
gperations. Since its establishment In 1978, PEO has
evalualed 4 total of 78 projects or nearly half of the Bank
projects completed as of the beginning of 1981,

A new feature of PEO’s 1981 operations was the preparation of abbreviated PPARs. Such reports were prepared
mainly for projects where earlier evaluations of projects
undertaken by the same executing agency had not ravaaled
substantial problems and where the PGR for the new projact indicated that no major difficulties were encountered in
_implementation of the project.

During 1981, PEO Issued its Third Annual Review of Post
Evaluation Reports. It summarized the findings and recommendations of the post-evaluation reports circulated in the
previous, year, A separate chapter addressed the general
topic of Steps proposed to improve project preparation.

The 15 projects coverad in the Third Review resulted ina
total investment of $366.7 million of which Bank loans contributed $106.03 million or nearly 30 per cent. Eleven of the
45 projects post-evaluated in 1980 seem to have largely
achieved their major objectives. Three of the projects did
not fully achieve some important objectives although progress was made in some areas. For one project the project
facilities are no longer being utilized as expected because
of changes in external factors which could not have been
anticipated at the time of appraisal.

While the Third Annual Review highlighted lhe sudstantial achievements of Bank-assisted projacts, attention was
also drawn to some of the difficullies experienced during
implementation. The major findings showed that for some
projects time delays and cost overruns continued to pose
significant problems. in most cases overruns did not,
howevel, have too adverse an tmpact on project viability as
they were largely offset by higher benefits than were anticipated at the time of appraisal.

Since the establishment of PEO, the Rank has gained

' . considerable experience in post-evalualion activities. Late

in 1981, a paper on PEO's activitias and procedures was
presented to the Board ior discussion early in 1962.

Werk continued on a Concordance of Post-Evaluation
Reports. This cross-indexed reference document will
facilitate ready access to the findings of all reports
prepared by PEO over the years thus strengihening the
feedback of PEO findings into Bank operations.

The activities of PEO are expected to be furlher expanded in 1982, I) addition to preparing PPARs for all projects

* for which PCRs were issued in (he previous year, as well as
ihe Annual Review and Report on Implementation Status,
work will also begin on three special studies which will
focus on issues of general relevance to the Bank. Likely
topics include an evaluation of the impact of Bank lending
in the fisheries sector, an evaluation af the effectiveness of
executing agency arrangements and evaluation of the effectiveness of Bank-financed technical assistance.

Technica! Assistance and
Regional Activities

Technical Assistance for DMCs

Technical assistance constitutas another very important
area of Bank activity. Technical assistance operations
facilitate ihe transfer of resources io DMCs by enabling

 

 

a

them to improve their capabilities to formulate, design, implement and operate development projects as well as to
make effective use of available external project financing,
either from the Bank or from other sources.

In broad terms, the Bank provides lhree types of
technical assistance: project preparatory; advisory and
operational (including project implementation/supervision);
and regional. Project preparatory technical assistance (5
aimed at helping a borrower to formulate viable investment
projects for subsequent financing by the Bank or other
sources. Advisory and operational technival assistance is
directed lowards assisting executing agencies in institu:
tlon building, and in the supervision, implementation and
operation of Bank-financed projecis. This includas the
training of local personnel and improvements to technical,
financial and administrative management. It is also provided for studies on scctoral policies or for formulating national davalopment plans.

Regional technical assistance, on the other hand, Is addressed to needs that are common to more than ane DMC.

tional technical assistance, regiunal technical assistance
has been provided more frequently and specifically for
such activitles as training courses, seminars and
workshops, secloral and other studies, as well as in support of international fasearch institutions located in the
Bank’s region.

In recent years, roughly 60 per cenl of the Bank's total
lechnical assistance has been for project preparation, 30

per cent for advisory and uperational, and the remaining 10
per cenl for regional activitias.

During 1981, the Bank provided technical assistance
(other than regional technical assistance) for 49 projects,
compared witt 56 projects in 1980, while the lolal amount
increased fram 14.2 million in Ihe previous year to $14.8
million. Project preparatory technical assistance amounted
lo $6.8 million for 32 projects, while advisory and opera:ion; FAO will provide sis0, 00 unger a cost: senting siengeinent,

tional technical assistance amounted to nearly $8 million
for 17 projects. These amounts included technical assistance grant components incorporated in 16 Bank loans,
amaunting to $8.2 million, of which $1.4 million was for
Project preparation and $6.8 million for advisory and operalional (including implementation),

The lower number of technical assistance projects approved in-1981 was due mainly to the longer lead time ra
 

quired to process soma large technical assistance projacts
and the consequent deferment of Bank consideration of
these projects from 1981 to the early part of 1982.
Technical assistance grants are financed mainly from

An Advisory Group consisting of five outside experts
with wide experience in development planning and

assistance was constituted to provide overall direction and
guidance to the Study, It hald its first meeting in Octobor.
The issues to be reviowad during the Study will be examined in country-specific situations by teams of Bank staff
led by an economist with expertise in macro-economic
analysis and experience in development planning. These
studies will be conducted in Bangladesh, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Nepal and Thailand. Thereafter, the
overall Study report will be reviewed by the Advisory Group
and the Bank. It is expected that the Study will be completed in late 1982.

Bank also made arrangaments for a mocling of major donor
agencies to be held at the Bank's Headquarters early in
1982 (se@ page 39). During 1981, the Bank also approved
several other regional activites, including studies, (raining

During 1981, the Board of Directors considered a
nurniber of operational and financial polly Issues, principal
among which were those relaling to the Third General
Capital Increase of the Bank and the Third Reptenishment
of the Asian Development Fund (ADF), Papers relating to
the General Capital Increase further retined those considered in 1980 and dealt with, among other things, the staffing implications of the future operational program and the
need for an increase in the Bank's capital stock. A paper on
the ADF replenishment reviewed the resource requirements
at low-income DMCs and, in that light, recommended an
ADF lending program for 1983-86. The Buard also considered and look decisions on Arrangements for Resource
Mobilization of the Technical Assistance Special Fund,

In addition, several other operational and financial policy
Issues were considered by the Board during 1981, including
new Regulalions of the Technical Assistance Special Fund,
Role of the Bank in the Energy Sector, Co-Finaneing,
Establishment of a Bank Resident Office, Annual Raview of
Financial Policies, Methodology for Determining Ihe Lending Rate’ol the Bank, Lending Rate Review, Exchange Fisk
Poaling System and Review of the Use of the Two-Envelape
System for engagement of consullerils.!

Policies Under Consideration: At tha end of 1981, two
papers — one on Special increases in Capital Subscriptions: Formulation of Guidelines; and (he other on PostEvaluation Office: Activities and Procedures — had been
circulated fur consideration by the Board early in 1982. Also
at the end of the year, several major policy papers were in
preparation for early consideration by the Board in conneclion with proposals for the replenishment of the Bank's
resources, namely, Transfers to Special Heserve, Alloca:
tion of Administrative Expenses between Ordinary Capital
Resources and Special Funds, Gearing Ratio and Use of Article 6.2 {b) Resources® and Annual Review of Financial
Policies.

Establishment of a Bank Resident Office

In October, the Board approved a proposal lo establish a
Bank resident office, on an experimental basis, in Dacca,
Bangladesh. The office will be headed by a Hesident
Representative supported by two professional stalf, and
will help slrengthen the working relationship between Bank
personnel and Bangladesh aulhorities involved in key
aspects of the Bank's operalions. Specifically, the office
will focus attention on activities directly related to the tmplamentation of Bank-assisled projects. It will also complament the Bank's aid coordination efforts and should be of
direct benefit to the Bank’s pragramming activities and
economic work in Bangladesh. A comprehensive review of
the office, which is expected ilo begin operations in
mid-1982, will be undertaken before the end of the fifth
year.

Review of the Use of the Two-Envelope System

The Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by
Asian Development Bank and ts Borrowers was reviewed
in 1978 and ravised guidelines were finally approved by ihe
Board in April 1979. These guidelines Included a provision
allowing a borrower to use, if it so preferred, a 'twoenvelope’ system in inviting consultants’ proposals
whereby a technical proposal and a financial proposal ara
obtainad simultaneously bui mw two separalo envelopes
from each of the shortlisted firms. In approving the adoption of [he system, the Board of Directors had decided that
a review of the use of the system should be canducted after
18 months.

Accordingly, a review was undertaken by the Barik during
the year. The findings indicate that nc major difficulties
have so far been encountered in the use of the twoenvelope system. Savings in time was considered the
strongest argument In favor of the system. It was also [elt
that the financial proposals submitted reflected the most
economical costs because of an expected element of competition in the submission of proposals, However, because
of the limited number of cases included in the review, il was
decided thal another review be undertaken covering the
period to the erid of 1982 to enable a more meaningful
evaluation.56

69ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

Review of the Bank’s Resource Requirements

IN RESPONSE to a resolution at lhe Thirteenth Annual
Meeting, @ report on the Resources of the Bank was submitted by the Board of Directors to the Board of Governors at
the Fourteenth Annual Meeting. lt stated that the Bank had
on the basis of staff studies undertaken a general review of
its future operational program with reference to the
resource requirenents of its developing member countries
(DMCs). This review included a consideratlan of staffing itnplications of the future operational program as wail as
policy issues relating to Rank operations in ihe 1980s, The
reviaw confinned the need for a general increase in lhe
Bank’s capital stock to enable the Bank to continue iis
operations beyond 1982. Accordingly, in Decembar 1980,
the President submitted to the Board uf Directors a Working Paper outlining certain basic considerations relevant to
a determinalion of the size and composition of a general
capital increase. This paper was discussed by the Board of
Directors in February 1981 and it was concluded that in this
reqard various possibilities should be further examined. Accordingly, additional malerial was submitted to the Board
of Directors during the year, This will be considered by the
Board of Directors early in 1982. After a final conclusion
has been reached, the Board of Diractors will submil to the
Governors for consideration and approval a raport containing its findings and recommendations.

Capital

During the year, the Bank’s subscribed capital Increased
by $240.2 million (SDR 206.4 million) on account of (i)
another partial subscription of $239.5 million (SDR 205.8
million) by the United Slales under the Second General
Capital Increase, and (ii) a subscription of $0.7 million {SDA
0.6 millign) by the Republic of Vanuatu, a now member. As
of 31 December 1981, subscribed capital amounted to
$8,296.8 million (SDR 7,128.1 million} while authorized
capital stock stood at $8,404.6 million (SOR 7,220.6 million),

Progress of Second General Capital Increase

As of 31 December 1981, total subscriptions under the
Second General Capital Increase amounted to $4,723.9
million (SOR 4,088.5 million). The amount of $80.6 million
{SDR 69.2 million), representing the full entitlement of two
members and a partial entitlement of one member, re
mained unsubscribed.'

Valuation of Capital

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in its Arlicles of
Agreement In terms of United States dollars of the weight
ard fineness in effect an 31 January 1986, Since the coming
into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (LMF) on 4
April 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold. The implications of this change on the basIs of valuation af the Bank's capital stock are under consideration by
the Bank. In ihe meantime, for purposes of the Bank’s
financla! statements, lhe Bank‘s capita! stock has becn
valued on the basis af SDR 10,000 per share. The SDR is expressed in the financial statements in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31 December
1981, the rate was $1.16996 per SDR. Further information on
this subject is given In Notes A and C of the Notes to Financial Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources, Appendix

Review of Financial Policies

The Annual Raview of the Financial Policies of the Bank
was canducted early in the year and covered, in a relatively
broad conlext, the Bank's lending and borrowing programs
for 1981 as well as its financia! objectives, policies and indicators. The review conciuded that the basic financial abjectives of lhe Bank, which are designed to result in a
steadily rising trend in net income leading lo a strong
reserves position, were sound and should continue. The
borrowing program for the year 1981 was sect at $650
million, In respect of liquidity, special reserve, commitment
charge and allocation of administrative charge between ordinary and special operations, the Board approved con
linuation of the Bank's existing policies.

Methodology for Determining the
Lending Rate of the Bank

The methodology was reviewed during lhe year, and a
number of options were examined in detail. fhe Board approved a further refinement of the “cost-plus" formula camprising cosl of borrowing and carrying liquidity and of ad
ministrative expenses. Under this formulation, the borrowing costs continue to be determined as the average of a

'24-month period centered on the date of lending rate deter
mination. To this cost a spread is added to cover adtninistrative expenses, and the cost lo the Bank of carrying
liquidity. As a result of the review, the spread was increased from 30 basis points {0.30 per cent} to 40 basis
points {0.40 per cant). The rate thus determined by this farmulais to be considered as an indicative lending rate which
is tested in the Bank's long-term financial projections

objectives, and the need to maintain its decisive financial
indicators at the desired levels as well as to keep a
reasonable relationship over time with the lending raie of
the World Bank.

Lending Rate

Prior to approval of the new methodology for determining
the Bank's landing rate, an interim rale reflecting an Increase in the Bank's average borrowing costs was considered and fixed at 9.25 per cent per annum effective 34
March 1981, Subsequently, taking Into account a furiherincrease in the Bank's average borrowing costs, a new lend
ing rate of 10.10 per cent per annuin was approved, effective 1 July 1987.!

Exchange Risk Pooling System

In order to distribute equitably the exchange risks on currencies disbursed and repayable under loans financed from
tha Gank's ordinary capital resources, the Board of Directors approved in August 1981 the adoption of an Exchange
Risk Pooling System. This system is baing included in the
Bank’s on-going computerization. To allow sufficient time
to Institute accaunting. legal and administrative arrangements and to bricf borrowers as well as guarantors on
the syslem, ihe possible conmmencement of the system is

that ali loans approved from the commencement date to be
financed out of ordinary capital resources will coma under
the system. The interim DFI disbursement scheme, in
which disbursements under loans to davelopment finance
institutions and other intermediaries are made 50 per cent
in Uniled States dollars and 50 per cent in any other
convertible currency, will be terminated and wil! be subsumed uncer the Excharige Risk Pooling System. The bor
rowers of the existing loans including BF! toans will be
given [he option to join the pooling sysleri in respect of the
undisbursed portions of the loans,

Maintenance of Value

Exchange rates adopted by the Bank during the year
continued to be used for purposes of translation in the
Bank's books of accounts and for somputing the “riotional
amounts required to maintain the vaiue of currency
holdings.” Settlement of maintenance of value has been
held in abeyance pending a decision on the valuation oi the
Bank's capital stock.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resourees during
1981 amaunted to $418 million, representing an increase of
$89.3 million or 20.8 per cont over the 1980 figure and bringing cumulative disbursements as of the end of the year to
$2,822.6 million. Repayments in 1981 amounted to $127.6
million consisting of $126.0 million on loans hald by the
Bank and $1.6 million on loans sold to participants. As al 31
Dacember 1981, cumulative repayments on loans held by
these sources were $491.5 million and $15.6 million, respec:
tively, making a total of $507.4 million,

investments

At the end of 1981, the Bank's investments of OCR funds
were denominated in 23 currencies and amounted to ihe
equivalent of $1,670.1 million ($1,393. 1 million at the end of
1980), including investments of Special Reserve Fund
Assets. Of the total Investments, 28.4 per cent (24.4 per
cent at the end of 1980) was held in securities issued or
guaranteed by member governments and obligations of ap:
proved government agencies of member countries, The remainder was invested In time deposits and certificates of
deposit of banks In member countries and the Bank for International Settlements. The average yleld on the Bank's
OCR investments over tha year was 10.56 per cent campared with 9.81 per cent In 1980.

Accounting Change

In consultation with lhe Bank's External Auditors, the
Bank has made a change relroactively In 1981 in the
method of accounting for translation of currencies in line
willi anew accounting principle adopted in Decernber 1981.
This accounting change has been reflected in the Financial
Statements (Appendix 1) and in tha taxt of this Annuat
Repart.

The new accounting principle is to treat unrealized gains
or losses arlsing frora translation of functional currencies

As a result of this accounting change, net income of Or-.

respectively; however, net equity shawn in the respective

AS THE period covered by the second replenishment of the
Asian Developmant Fund (ADF ill} is to end in 1982, the
Bank commenced discussions with ADF donor countries
an the third AOF replenishment (ADF IV) to finance its concessional lending program over lhe four-year period
1983-86. During 1981, there were two meetings of ADF
donor countries held in July and November. The replenishment negotiations were expected to be concluded in early
1982,

As to the implementation of ADF Ill, the Bank received
during 1981 instruments of contribution from Italy,
Netherlands and New Zealand. The payment of the second
instalment of the United States coniribution to ADF Ill
made in December 1986 and the consequent release in
January 1381 of the third instalments of the other contributions to ADF ||] made available the resources needed hy tha
Bank to flnance its concessicnal lending program for 1981.

During the year tha Bank received another $3.5 million
from the United States as partial payment towards the last
$60 inillion of its contribution to the first Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF (I), The Board of Governors
aulhorized a further extension of the deadline for payment
by the United States of the remaining $56.5 million of its
ADF II contributlon.

During the yaar the Board of Directors approved proposals for the improvement of arrangements for the
mobilization and replenishment of resources of the
lechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF). The Board also
adopted new TASF Regulations. Additional contributions
to TASF were received during the year from eigtt member
countries,

Second Replenishment {ADF lil)

The second ADF replenishment (ADF Ill}, authorized In
July 1978 by Governors’ Resolution No. 121, was to finance
the Bank's concessional ending program over the four-year
period 1979-82. The amount authorized was $2,150 million
{ai 1 April 1978 exchange rates}, consisting of a basic
replenishment of $2,000 million plus a further $150 million
in supplementary contributions. The replenishment came

Into aftact in March 1979 when the Bank racelved instruments of contribution for a total amount in excess of
the rigger figure of $1,000 million provided for in the
Resolution.

During 1981 the Bank received instruments of contribu:
tion from Italy, Netherlands and New Zealand. With the
receipt of ihese, all lhe 17 deveioped member countries of
the Bank had become contributors to the replenishment.
Sixteen of thesa countries deposited unqualttied Instruments of contribution, while one country, the United
States, deposited a qualified instrument of contribution in
accordance with the provisions of Resolution No. 121.

Resolution No. 121 envisages that unqualified contribytions would be made available to the Bank for loan commiiment over the replenishment period in four equal annual inslalments, depending on the progressive payment of the
qualified contribution made by the United States. Pursuant
to the Resolution, the first and second instalments of unqualified contributions became avaiiable in 1979 and 1980,
respectively. The third instalmant of unqualified contriputons was released on 1 January 1981 as a result of the payment by the Uniled States of the second full instalment of
its ADF III contribution in December 1980. All these instalments, togather with the additional payments made by
the three donor countries which deposited Instruments of
contribution in 1981, enabled the Bank to finance its concessional lending program for 1981 as planned.

At year end, the procedures for payment af the third full
instalment of the U.S. contribution to ADF fll had not been
completed, The release of the fourth instalments of the
other contributions was therefore expected to be delayed
beyond 1 January 1962.'

' First Replenishment (ADF Ii)

Resolution No. 92, adopted by the Board of Governors in
December 1975, authorized the Bank to receive conirioutions to ADF II to finance the concessional landing pragram
over the three-year period 1976-78. The total amount
authorized was $830 million, later revised to $809 million to

Third Replenishment (ADF IV)

With the ADF ill replenishment period scheduled to end
“in 1982, the Bank commenced discussions with ADF donor
countries on the third ADF replenishment (ADF IV) to
finance Its concessional lending program over the four-year
period 1983-86. Two forma! meetings, attended by representativas of all 17 developed member countries, were field
during 1981, the first In Geneva in July and the second in
Canberra in November. At these meetings, the Bank pro
posal for a replenishment of $4.1 billion, and the procedural
” arrangements for the replenishment, were discussed at
length. Since one major donor country, the United Stales,
was not able to state its position on ine Bank's proposal, it
was declded that a furthar maeting of the donor countries
would be held in February 1982.

During ihe year some of the developing member countries indicated an intention to makc modest contributions
to ADF. When the ADF IV replenistiment negotiations
among the traditional doner countries are completed, the
offers of contributions by such developing member countries, together with the contributions pledged by the traditional donor countries, will be submitted to the Board of
Governors as a lolal replenishment for ADF iV.

Resources and Utilization

At the beginning of 1981, the net resources available for
concessional loan commitmenis, after allowing a provision
for exchange rate fluctuations, was about $297 million. Dur
ing the year additional ADF resources totalling $508 miltion
were made available under ADF Il snd ADF tll. Individual
contributions to ADF fave been made in the national currencies of lhe respective contributars. Changes during the
year in the values of some of the major contributors’ nationa! currencies against the United States dollar resulted
in a net decrease of $251 ‘million in the total value of contributed reseprces expressed in terms of US dollars. In addition, an amount of $16 rnillion accrued to ADF by way of
net Income.

Total ADF resources at the end of 1981, including contributed resources, set-aside resources and net income
stood at $3,185 million, anet increase of $269 million during
the year

New concessional loans approved during the year totalled
$531 million, or $54 million more than in the previous year
As of 31 December 1981, the cumulative amount of concessional loans (after allowing for axchange rate adjustments,
cancellations and repayments) was $2,928 milllon, leaving
a balance of uncommitted resources al that dale of $257
million. After allowing for a provision against exchange
rale fluctuations, the net amount available for further loan
commitments stood at about $86 million. In 1981, disbursements from ADF resources amvcunted to $149.2 million and
repayments to $10.6 million. As of the end of the year,
cumulative figures for disbursements and repayments were
$886.9 million and $40.5 million, respectively.

Income and Expenses

Net income for 1981 amounted te $25.9 million, $3.8
million less than the 1980 figure of $29.7 million.’ The
decrease was due mainly to an increase of $4.8 million in
Administration Charge to ADP.

At the end of 1981, the Bank's investments of ADF
rasources were denominated in 17 currencies and
amounted to the equivalent of $396.6 million ($384.0 million
al ihe end of 1980). Of the total investments, 3/.7 per cent
(37.3 per cent al the end of 1980) was held in sacurities
issued or guaranteed by member governments and obligations of approved government agencies of member coun

Technical Assistance Speciat Fund

In May 1981, the Board of Directors approved proposals,

for the improvement of arrangements far the mobilization
and replanishment of resources of ths Tectinical
Assistance Special Fund (TASF). These arrangements cal!
for an annual review by the Board of the status and utilization of TASF contridulions and of the future resource reQuirements of TASF. Contributors are also invited to accept

To this end, all contributions to TASF made from 1983 onward are to bo available for Procurement at least from all

to keep this aspect under review and, as soon as feasible,
request contributors to make only such contributions as
are available for procurament at feast from al) DMCs and all
contributor countrias. Moreover, no tied contributions to
TASF are to be accepted by the Bank if in its judgment, and
taking inlo account relevant factors, it is unlikely to be able
to utilize them in a reasonable way.

Following approval of these arrangements, the Board of

2. It provides for Internal Administrative Expenses in 1982
amounting to $68,585,000, an increase of $16.7 million over
actual expenses in 1981. This increase is attributable largely to: di) additional staff required lor activities programmed
in 1982 and arising from positions which could not be filled
in 1981; (ii) salary and benefit Improvements approved in
1981 and further improvements subject to consideration in
1982; {ili} increased business lravel and consultants’ ser
vices required for the Bank's work in 1982; (iv) additional

commitments and disbursements in 1981, respectively. lhe
increases in bath commitments and disbursements in 1982
are due to the higher volume of iechnical assistance to be
processed for approval and to Lhose under irnplementation.

NOTE A —

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(1)

(3)

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional curren
cies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Capital Stock

The capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1
of the Articles of Agreement “in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966" (the 1956 dollar). The capital stock
had historically been translated Into the current
United States dotlar (the Bank's unit of account), on
the basis of its-par value in terms of gald. From 1973
until 81 March 1978, the rale arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the Internatianal Monetary Fund (IMF}
came Into effect, currencies na longer have par
values in terms of gold. The Bank is examining the
implications of Ihis charge on the valuation of its
capital stock but has not made a daclsion on the matter. Pending such a decision, the Bank’s capilal
stock has been valued for purposes of the accumpanying financial statements in terms of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31
December 1981, the SDR was valued at $1.16396. (See
Note C. This note also shows whai the value of the
Bank's capitaf slock would ve if expressed in tarms
of $1.20635 per 1986 dollar.)

Translatlon of Currencies

Assets and liabililies are translated from their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally
at the applicable ratas of exchange at the end of a
renorting period. Income and expense amounts are
translated for cach quarter generally at the rates of
exchange al the beginning of the quarter; such prac
(4)

(6)

(”)

tice approximates the applicatian of average rates in
effect during the quarter. Translation adjustments,
other than those relating to maintenance of value of
currency holdings under Article 25 (sea Note D) and
“Notional amounts required lo maintain value of cur:
rency holdings” (see Note |), are charged or credited
lo “Accumulated translation adjustments’. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
among functional currencies are included tn income.

Loans

The Summary Statement of Loans (Appendix 1-V}
presents, by country, total approved loans to be
financed [rom ordinary capital resources. _Adjustments for loans not yet effective, rofundings and
cancellations, payments received, loans agreed ta be
sold and exchange adjustments are made to arrive at
effoclive loans held by the Bank.

Unamortized Discounts, Premiums and
Issuance Costs of Borrowings

Unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance
costs of borrowings are amortized over the life of
gach issue in proportion to each of the principal
amounts ouistanding,

Property, Furnitura and Equipment

The headquarters seat of ite Bank, including land,
building, facilities and fixtures and the Initial cost af
necessary staff amenities and of related furnishings

NOTE C —

CAPITAL STOCK

Ths authorized capital stock of the Bank consists of
722,057 shares, of which 712,807 shares have been
subscribed by members. Of the subscribed shaves,
573,966 are “callable” and 138,849 are “paid-in”. The
“callable” share capital is subject to call by the Bank
only as and when required to meat the Bank's obligations incurred on borrowings or on guarantees. The
“paid-in” share capital is payable or has boen paidin
Instalments, partly in convertible currencies and
partly in the currency of the subscribing member. In
accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Arlicles, the Bank accepts non-negotiable, nonInterest-bearing demand obligaiions in salisfaction
of the portlon payable in the currency of the member,
where such currency is not required hy the Bank for
the conduct of ils operations.

In the Articles, the Bank's capital stock is defined “in
terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 34 January 1966", and the value
of each stare of stock is defined as belng 10,000
1966 dollars. On 1 April 1978, tha Second Amendment
to the iMF Articles entered into force, under which
gold has been abolished as a common denominator
of the international monetary system, currencies no
longer have par values, and all calculations for the
purposes of the IMF Articles are made on the basis of
the SDR. Simultaneously, tho provision of United
States law defining the gar vaiue of the United States
dollar in terms of gold was repealed. As a result of
these changss, the pre-existing basis for translating
the term “United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” inio current
United States dollars, or into any other currency, no
longer exists.

The Bank is considering a proposal that Its capital
stock be redefined in terms of the SOR. A member
government has raised the question whether the
substitution of a new unit of value, insofar as It
would give rise to any new obligations with respect
to maintenance of value and capital stock subscrip
tion payments, should be made only by amendment
of the Articles. This member has also raised questlons as to the approprlatenass of substituting a unit
of value other than the SOR, the desirabillty of retaining Lhe princlple of mainlenance of value, and the
form in which maintenance of value should be applied,

The Goneral Counsel of the Bank is of the opinion
that the SOR is the successor in lhe internalional
monetary system to the gold-based dollar, and that
pending the exercise hy the appropriate authoritles
of the Bank of their statutory powers under Chapter
IX of he Articles, referenees in the Articles to the
1986 dollar should be read as referring to the SDR as
defined from time to time by the IMF. In view of this,
and pending consideration and action on tha issuss
referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Bank has
tor purposes of (hese financial staternonis expressed the value of its capital stock in terms of the SDR,
on the basis that each share has the value of SDA

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1981 and 31 December 1980

10,000. For purposes of these financial siatements, it
has also measured the mutual obligations of each
member and of the Bank with respect to
mainienance of value of currency holdings by that
standard. However, the appropriaie authorities of Ihe
Bank could decide that the value of each share
should be fixed at $12,063.50, on the basis of a
substitution of 1.20635 current United States dollars
for each 1966 dollar,

When the SOR was introduced into the IMF Articles
in 1969, It was expressed in terms of a specified
weight of gold equal to the gold content of the 1966
dollar. Since 1 July 1974, its value has been based on
the weighted relative values of a number of major
currencies {a “currency basket"). On 1 July 19/4, the
value of the SOR, expressed in terms of United States
dollars was $1.20635, namely the same value as the
1966 dollar, but subsequently the value in current
monetary ters tias varied from day to day. Effective
1 July 1978, the IMF made certain adjustments in the
SDR currency basket, and established a method far
further adjustments at five-yearly intervals, to reflect
changes in ihe relalive importance of currencies over
time, while ensuring continuity and reasonable
predictablilty for the valuation of the SDR. The IMF
further revised the currency basket effective 1
January 1981 by reducing the number of currencies
from 16 to 5. The adjustmerits made at the time of the
changes are such that the value of the revised
baskets In terms of any currency was axactly the
same under both the then existing and the revised
valuations. As of 31 December 1981, the value of the
SDR in ierms of the United States dollar was
$ 1.16996, giving a value for each share of the Bank's
capital equivalent to $11,639.60.

The substilution of the SDR rather than $1.20635 in
currenl United States dollars for the 1966 dollar dues
not have a material eifect on the financial position or
results of operations of the Bank, If the capital stock
as af 31 December 1981 had been valued in terms of
$12,063.50 per share, he “callable” capital subscribed would have been £6,924,039,000 ($6, /00,092,000
-— 1980) Instead of $6,680,735,000 ($7,083,653,000
—1980}, ihe “‘paid-in” capital subscribed would have

been $1,674,908,000 ($1,649,949,000 — 1980) instead
of $1,816,053,000 ($1,744,403,000 — 1980), the total
subscribed capital would have been $8,598,947,000
($8,350,041,000 --. 1980) instead of $8,296,788,000
($8,828,05€,000 — 1980} and maintenance of value
obligations would have been $75,825,000 receivable
from mambers instead of $27,888,000 recelvable from
members ($9,488,000 payable to members instead of
$64,497,000 receivable from members — 1980),

As of 31 Dacember 1981, all matured instalments
amounting to $1,609,058,000 ($1,626,848,000 — 1980)
were received except $1,527,000 ($374,000 --- 1980),
Instalments not due aggregating $6,995,000
($117,455,000 — 1980) are receivable as follows:

ACCOUNTING CHANGE

In 1984, ihe Bank adopted retroactive application of
the principles described In Note A for translation of
currencies. Previously, all changes in value of currencies, other than those to whieh the maintenance of
value of currency holdings applies (see Notes D and
I), were charged or credited to income, Had the
aforementioned accounting change not been
adoplad, net income for 1981 would have decreased

by $40,539,000 (increased by $6,301,000 — 1980).DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are func
tional currencies. The reporting currency Is the
United States dollar, and the financial statements
are expressed in thousands of current United States
doilars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from Lheir (unetional currencies to the reporting currency generally
at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period, Income and expense amounts are
translated for each quarter generally at the rates of
exchange at the beginning of the quarter; sucti practice approximates the application of average rates in
eftect during the quarter. Transiation adjustments
relating to contributions are offset by increases or
decreases in the contribution accounts. Translation
adjustments relating lo capital set-aside are recorded as recelvable from or payable to ordinary capital
resources. Other translation adjustments are
charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency
transaclions are inctuded in income.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included in
the financial statements as amounts committed from
the date Instruments of Contribution are deposited
and ralated formalities are completed,

ACCOUNTING CHANGE

In 1981, the Bank adopted retroactive application of
the principles described in Note 2 for translation of
currencies. Previously, all chanyes in value of currencies, other than those relating to contributions and
capital-set aside, were charged or credited to income. Had the aforementioned accounting change
not been adgpled, riel income for 1981 would have
decreased by $9,416,000 (increased by $1,711,000 —

Bank lending for agricultural Gevelopment since the mid1970s and underscores the Bank's growing commitment to
the rural sector (see Table on page 29).

Similarly, lending to the Energy sector has increased in
amnounts over tie years and its share of total lending has
risen since the mid-1970s, The increasing importance of
enengy in the development programms of many DMCs was
retiected in a substantial nse in the share of lending to this

tion of employment opportunities and the provision of com:
modities and services to moet basic human needs. These
considerations have underlined the increased emphasis on
an integrated approach to rural development, land utilizathon, water management, strengthening of rural institu
thons, broader distribution of development Seretits and increased participation of small ‘farmers and ‘andiess
workers In Bank-assisted projects.

The Bank's sustainec support for Agriculture and Agro
industry was further reinforced during the year by a review
undertaken by the Board of Directors of the Bank's role in
agriculture anc rural development and she Identification of
a number of priority areas for future lending and technical
assistance, These include the provision of more anc better
employment for the rural work-foree; the improvement of
production and distribution systems for rural products;
managerial traning and institution Oulding for rural deve
lopment; anc the protection of vital ecosystems.

added to the Bank's loan portfolio in 1979. This combined
the provision of fertilizer with ine strengthening of extenSion, credit and distribution services and faci/ties.

During the year thie sector received loans totalling $412
million against $311 million in 1978. Cumulative lending to
the sector as of the anc of December 1979 reached $1,772
million.

Energy: The continued rise in the prices cf ol! and other
fuels anc Its serious balance of payments implications for

ment of indigenous energy resources and to formulate
policies and programs which are conducive to efficient use
and conservation of energy.

management of Thailand's energy sector and of resource
development projects in Nepal - and in
Bangladesh (natural gas). Cumulative lending to the Energy
sector as of ine enct of 1979 amounted to $1,581 million and
comprinad 84 projects.

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and Development Banks:
The majority of OMCs have also assigned a high priority to
industrialization as a strategy for achieving accelerated
economic Gevelopment, Efforts at industrialization have
generally been two-pronged. On the one hand, the
establishment of small and medium-scale industries to
Qenerate greater employment, improve technical and
Managerial skills and to meet domestic and export needs
has been actively pursued. On the other, the setting up of
larger industrial projects embocying sconomies of scale
has been considered equally important. The Bank's lending
has supported both these efforts towards Industrialization.

Development banks have proved to be appropriate channats for financing small and medium-scale enterprises
which are normally beyond the reach of direct Bank financing. The provision of credit fines has also strengthened
the development banks themselves, anhancing their
Capacity to tap other sources of funds and making them
more ettective Instruments for economic development,

The total Special Funcs resources for concessional lending stood at $2,066 million at the end of 1979. Loan com
mitments from these resources amounted to $1,959 million,
jeaving a balance of $106 million, of which abou: $9 million
remained availatte for commitment atier allowance for exchange rate fluctuations.

Seven countries made nontriputicons to the Bank's
Technical Assistance Special Fund (TAS) auring 1978,
amounting to $4 million equivalent. At the enc of the year,
total contributions to the TASF hac reached $41 million, of
which $24 million had deen utilized by the Bank.

REORGANIZATION: With a view to providing more et
fective support for its expanding activities, the Gank at tne
beginning of the year reorganized and strengthened Its administrative functions. The former Agministration Department was divided along functional lines into the Budget,
Personnel and Management Systems Department and the
Olfice of Administeative Services.

OUTLOOK: Overall, the Bank's performance in 1970 ac
ded to its achievements in the 19708 and geared the
organization — In terme of its capacity to land, to arrange
co-financing, to provide technical assistance ang to
mobilize rascurces {fom member countries and the world
capital markets — for # larger role in the new cecade. The
expanding program of post-evaiustion studies anc the
Stops to strengthen its research and analytical capability
shoulc nalp the Bank further inoreese its impact anc
broaden Its Ceveloprmenta! role in the region.

{t ie estinated that the total arnount of $6.7 billion ihe
Bank has lent for 415 projects will result in a curnwuiative investmaent of over $14.5 billion, including funcs investec by
the borrowing countries and co-financiers. Aoditionally,
some 325 projects involving $81 rillion in technical
assistance grants have nelped augment the flow of exter
nat funds to OMCs and facilitated their ettective use. Tha
multiplier effect of these grants is illustrated Dy the fact
that an outlay of $26 million in technical assistance for project preparation resultec In loan approvals of $2,058 miiilon
by the Bank”

Subject to @ review in 1960 of the Bank's ordinary lending
program, current projections envisage total fending In @xcass of $3 billion trom the Bank's ordinary capital
resources and around $1.7 billion from its Special Funds
during the 1960-1982 period. This program .» based on a
progressive growth in its overall lancing and \s designed to
ensure increased attention to the Agricuiture and Rural
Development sector, an axpancing role for enargy davelopment and a widening of activities in the Social Intrastructure sector, especially Education, Health anc Population.
The program also calls for « substantial increase in ihe
Bank's technical assistance activities and continuing efforts tc streamiine operational policies and procecures to
meet the changing needs of OMCe

The Bank has degun preparalory work to formulate @

ve strategy for its programs in the 1980s.
Studies will be undertaken to identity major ‘seues affecting the development of DMCs anc to neip strengthen the
Bank's role in the region's deveiopment process during the
new decade. in particular, these stucies wil| provide a basis
for the Bank to assess the size anc relative emphasis of lis
lending and technical assistance activities during the
period in which a further capital increase and replenishmant of ADF will become necessary.HOMLIGHTS OF THE BANK'S OPERATIONS, 1967- 1979

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

DURING THE decade 1970-79, the average annual growth
rate of real output in the Bank's developing member countries (OMCs) was relatively high, despite unfavorable
developments in the world economy since 1974. The growth
rate in several OMCe was higher than the 6 par cent target
established by che United Nations for the Racond Develop
mont Decade but fall short of this mars in the lowincome
countries. The rate of Increase in agricultural production
improved significantly, although many OMCs did not
achieve thelr cbjective of seif-sutticiency in foodgrains.
The contribution of manufactures to national output, total
employment and exports increased steadily in many DMCs.
In some of them manulecturing has emerged as the isading
sector of the economy.

in 1972 — the last year of the cecade of the 1970s —
however, the economic performance of OMCs was signifi
cantly below the overall average performance during the
decace. The setback suffered by OMCs during 1979 was
due te a combination of factors. While some of these factors were domestic in origin, others resulted from several
adverse international developments.

The International Setting

The world economy was beset with many problems and
Growing uncertainties during 1978, A series of ol! price increases, far higher than those originally announced by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),
almost doubled the price of oll during 1979, These increases, which came at a time when many Industrialized
nations were already afflicted by stagfintion, ec fo a dele
Horation in the balance of payments on current account of
oll importing countries, higher rates of inflation, greater inStability in foreign exchange rates, and reduced rates of
economic growth. World production of foodgrains also do
clined, causing serious food shortages in several countries.

The impect on individual countries of the economic
changes which ocourred during the year varied, cepencing
on each country's vulnerability to external factors anc its
ability 10 formulate and implement policies to cope with the
changing clrounstances.

The rate of growth in Gross National Product (GNP) of
the countries which are members of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) averaged
3.5 per cent in 1972 compared with 3.9 per cent in 1978, At

AAVESTED grain is bagged at the Pitot irrigation Scheme Project in
Fiji, assisted by # Bank eublean through Fifi Development Benk and

feetinanced by the Food and Agriculture Organization,

the same time, the average rate of inflation’ in OECO courr
tries increased frocn 7.2 per cert in 1978 to 10.6 per cent in
1978, the level of unemployment rose, and the combine
balance of payments on current account changed from a
sutptus of $9.1 billion In 1978 to a Ceficlt of $30 billion In
4979, According to preliminary indications, the real GNP
growth of OECD countries in 1980 could be In the range of t
to 1.5 per cent and the current account deficit may double
fo perhaps $60 billicn.

The OPEC countries generally maintained their high
Growth rates in real income, Thelr terms cf trade improved
asa result of the increase in oll prices, and their current account surplus is estienated to have Increased ‘rom $7 billion
in 1978 to $65 Dillion in 1879,

The non-oll developing countries were hard hit by higher
oll prices and the Increasing coat of otner imports. While
their inctvidual growth rates varied wicely, their combined
growth rato in 1978 would appear to have been Selow the
average annual rate of 4.7 per cent they achieved during
1974-78, Their rate of inflation alsc increased: the average
rate in 1979 was about 26 per cent, compared with about 25
por cent in 1978. For many developing countries, a deterio:
ration in their terms of trade contributed to the reduction in
ther growth rate and they were therstore forced to adopt
austerity measures, to pare down thelr Investment proGrams, to make structural acjustments In their economies,
and to step up their quest for alternative souroee of energy.
Sesides having te adjust to higher import conte, many de
veloping countries found that the cemand for their exports
was adversely affected because of the slower growth, im
creased Unemployment and continued restrictions on cer
tain imports in some af the major importing countries.

Recem estimates indicate that the current account
daticit of non-oll developing countries Incceased trom $36
billion in 1878 to $47 billion in 1979, and OECD projections
Suggest this could increase to $80 Dillion in 1960, These In
creasing deficits are imposing a heavy burden on mos! de
veloping countries, particularly the less developed countries which depend mainly on flows of official capital mace
avaliable on concessional terms to promote developirient.

Food shortages reached serious nroportions in several
developing courtries during 1979, The world production of

1 Throughout thle onapte le fation roters tc increases is oonsuner prices.10

rice, # staple food in most of Asia, was 2 per cent less while
production of other cereals was 4 per cent less in 1979 than
in 7976. The downturn In the production cf cereais lec to a
reduction in food Inventories and to higher prices, World
carry-over stocks of cereals are expected to have been
reduced by 6 million tons, to 260 million tons, by the close
of the 1979/80 crop year.’

Economic Developments In DMCs

The economic situation of DMCs In 1979 commpared unfavorably with that of 1976 in several aspects: their total
procuction of foodgrains was lower, the rate of inflation in
most DMCs was higher; thelr combined balance of trade
deficit increased; and the rate of growth of their total output In real terms ceciinec. Nevertneiess, with a few major
exceptions, the rate of growtn in Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in DMCs was sutticiont to onable a modest increase
in per capita income.

In most of the DMCs for which Preliminary estimates of
GDP for 1979 are avaliable (see Table 1},* the rates of
growth were below those in 1978. The exceptions were Bur.
ma, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore In Burma the
higher raze of growtn was due to the improved performance

of the industria! sector, while those In Hong Kong and
Singapore resulted trom tne buoyancy of thelr manufactur:
ing, trading and commercial sectors, Malaysia's improved
growin performance wat large'y attributaple to a strong
recovery in agricultural production and the higher prices of
some of Its major exports.

The growth rate in Thailand fel! sharply but still remain:
ec in line with the general trend of is growth rate during the
1970s. The 1979 growth rates In Republic of China, indonovia, Republic of Korea, Philippines and Sri Lanka were
lower than theit growth rates during 1970-76; while In
Bangladesh and Pakistan, the 1976 growth rates were jower
than in 1978 but higher than the average for the period
1970-78.

The slower rates of growth in Indonesia, Philippines, Sri
Lanka and Thailand targely resulted from a decline In the
Growth rates of the'r agricultural sectors, while in the other
countries montioned in the preceding paragraph, they were
dus largely to slower growth in non-agricultural sectors, Ex:
cent for indonesia anc Malaysia, which are net exporters of
oll, and Burma which is self-autticient, the economic perfor
mance of all these countries during 1979 was actversaly af
fected by increased ol! prices.

Of the DMCs for which GDP figures are not available, India's GOP is not likely to show any growth in real terms. India experienced a severe and prolonged drought during
1979 which is expected to reduce the level of its agricultural
production in the rnp year 1979-80 by about 5 per cent from
that achieved in the previous crop year, Mydro-electricity
generation, which constitutes about 45 per cent of total
power generated, increased by only 3.7 pet cent in 1978 a3
comparad with en increase of 27.1 per cent In 1978. This affected overall avaliability of power for some of the sectors
suring 1979.

Of the other DMCs for which 1979 GOP figures are not
available, it would appear that the growin rate in Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam Improved somevat in 1979 largely as @ result of higner agricultural output. Duw to crop losses caused by drought, the GDP growth
rate in Nepal ts axpected to be beicw the level of the
previous year. in Afghanistan, serious dislocations caused
by the situation prevailing in that country curing the yoar
together with adverse weather conditions would indicate
that GDP declined below the lavel in 1976. In Cambodia,
events ot the past ywar make cifficult any assessment of
the economic situation. While GDP of Kiribati ceciinec on
nocount of the cessation of phosphate production from
mid-1972, other Pacific inland DMCs and Papua New
Guinea appear to have achieved satisfactory growth rates
uring 1979, due largely to the favoranie prices provalling
in the works market for their major exports.

The output of the agricultural sector In most OMCs was
penerally less satisfactory in 1979 than in 1978. Output
declined In Afghanistan, Cambodia, India, Philippines, Sri
Lanka end Thallana; and grew st 8 slower rate in Burma,
Rapubiic of China, inconesia, Nepal and Papua New
Gu nea, tt increased at a faster rate in 1879 in only 8!x major
countries; Bangladesh, Republic of Korea, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Pakistan and Viet Nam, ail
of which had experienced @ decline in agricultural produc:
tion in 1878 except Viet Nam, The generally unfavorable
agricultural pertormance in 1979 was attridutable mainty to
adverse weather, compounded by the rising cost of
agricuttural inputs.The lower production of foodgrains in OMCs In 1979
largely accounted for the deciine in thelr agrisultura! out
put, Their total output of cereats fol! trom 257 miilion tons
In 1878 to 252 million tons in. 1978, Of tne three main cereal
crops, the production of rice declined from 194 million tons
in 1878 to 185 million tone In 1979, the targest reduction being In India. The reduction was party offset by an increase
i: the production of wheet from 44 million tons In 1978 to 48
million tons in 1979, which was mainly the result of good
wheat harvest in Incla and Pakistan in earty 1979, The output of maize fell by 0 per cent in 197; increased production
in Philippines and Thailand deing more than offset by decreased production in Indonesia and Indie.

Increase in population is the main factor contributing to
the higher Gemand for food In DMCs, particularly in the
case of the low Income and more populous countries. The
aggregate population of the region grew by 2.2 per cent in
1979 as against 2.3 per cent in 1870-74. Though the overall
growth raic had dectined afightly, in a number of DMCs
(Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, indonesia, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon ialands, Sri

Lanka and Viet Nam) rates of population growth were on

the increase or were unchanged betwean the two periods.

Because of the reduced output in 1979 and expanding
population pressures, several OMCs had to [ncreasue thelr
Imports of foodgrains, though some were able to meet their
needs by drawing on thelr stocks of foodgrains, The DMCs"
total Imports of foodgrains increased from about 20 million
tons in 1978 to 22 million tons in 1978. The largest Importers
of foodgrains were Sangtadesh, Indonesia, Republic of
Korea anc Pakistan whose combined Imports of rice, wheat

and maize were about 12 million tons in 1978 and 13 million

The tate of growth of industrial production in most DMCs
was lower in 1978, mainly because of slower growth Ip
manufacturing. The only exceptions were Fij! — which exPerlanced a cecline in manufacturing output in 1976 —
Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, While the relevant index
is not avaliable for Hong Kong, the growth In its manutacturing output also appears to have been higher in 1979 then
in 1978. In other countries, a number of factors accounted
for the slowdown in manufecturing output: higher input
costs; shortages of agricultural raw materials, hydropower
anc reducec rurai household income in some OMCs which
suffered from drought; and a reduced demand for exports
due to restrictions on imports of manufactured goods In a
number of major importing countries,

Tourism continued to be a small but cynamic sector in
several OMCs and the receipts from tourism accruing to
OMCs increased trom $4,500 million In ‘978 to $4,990

these countries increased from 12.5 million In 1978 to 13.2
million In 1979, The eight OMCs with the highest aggregate
fecelpts from tourism in 1979 were Republic of China, Hong

The production of energy in DMCs also increasec
significantly in 1978. The production of petroleum In OMCs
is estimated te nave increased by 2.4 per cent trom 116.4
million tons in 1978 to 119.2 million tons in 1978. The total
proguction of electricity (both hydro and thermal) in those
OMCs for which Gate are available increased trom 230
billion kWh in 1976 to 256 billion KWo ir 1979. The ovteut of
natural gas also increased, India, Indonasia, Pakistan,
Philippines anc Thailanc reported significant gas ancior ol!
discoveries during 1978.

Higher food prices, large increases in oil prices and
worke-wide inflationary pressures led to higher rates of inflation in many OMCs tr 1979 (Table 5). For the region an a
whole, the weighted average tate of inflation increased
from 6.5 per cent In 1872 to 11.6 per cent in 1979. While a
masority of OMCs hac # higher rate of Inflation than in the
previcus year, in some it was kept af the same bevel of
reduced. The highest! rates of inflation were in Banglacesn,
Cook lslands, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kiripatl, Republic of
Korea, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand anc Western
Samoa, all of which had double-digit rates of Inflation

CHANGES IN CONSUMER PRICES
OF SELECTED DMCs, 1979

 

 

A variety of factors accounted for the different rates of
inflation expertenced in OMCs in 1979, However, increased
prices of imported oll and subsequent upward acjusiments
in public utility charges, in the prices of major consumer
thems and in wage rates were the-common contributing tactors in mest cases, The situation was accentuates in some
OMCs by Gomestic factors, such as crop faliures, expansion in money supply, speculative hoarding and impact of
exchange tale cepreciations,

‘The doticit in the combined balance of trade of OMCs Increased from $8.6 billion in 1978 to $71.0 bition In 1978 (see
Table 6). This was cespite ihe higher rare of increase in
DMCe’ export earnings (20.4 per cent) than in their
payments for mports (25.3 pet cent)

Though the total trace deficit increased, some DMCs
showed @ Detter trade oesition in 1879. The two DMCs
which are oll exporters, viz, Indonesia anc Malaysia, eact
had a higher trade surpius in 1979 because of the higher
prices endior increase in the volume o! their exports. The
devaluation of the rupiah he'ped indonesia to increase its
exports of non-o!! products. Papua New Guinea maintained
tts trade surplus at the level of 1878. Berma also improved
Hs balance of trade and, atter having nad a deficit for
several years, recorded a sizeable surplus in 1979 attrfputadie mainly to its self-sutficianey In oll and the export:
oriented policies it has beer pursuing in recent years,

The Republic of China had a sizeanie trade surpius,
though It was considerably less than in 1978, bocauee its
import bili rose by 33.6 per cent while ite export earnings
rose by only 27 per cert.

Most of the other OMCs had larger trace deficits in 1879.
Their total de‘icit wes $19.7 billion in 1979 which was 33.6
per cont higher than the deficit of $14.7 billion in 1976, Six
DMCs, namely, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea, Pakistan,
Philippines, Singapore and Thaliand, together accounted
for B5 par cant of this deficit. The larger deficit for ine
Republic of Korea was primarily caused by the import

0 Tincrease In Imports account for the larger trade detic!ts of
Hong Kong anc Singapore. The increased trade de'icits of
Pakistan, Philippines and Thalland were due to a vary rapid
rate of growth in import requirements, since in each case
the deficit increased cespite the very high rate of growth of
exports achleved in 1979. Imports of invesimant goocs ard
highor payments for oll accounted for this high growin in
thalr imports.

The 1979 growth rate for the value of axporis of OMCs
was higher than In 1978, The overall value of exports in 1979
increased by 26.4 per cent, compared with an Increase of
1%.7 per cent in 1978. Most of the DMCs with @ trace
surplus, viz, Burma, Republic of China, Indonesia and
Malaysia, had high growth rates for exports — 48.5 per
cent, 27 per cent, 39,5 per cent and 34.7 per cent, respec
tively. India’s exports continued to grow slowly (6.6 per
cent), although this rate was significantly higher than the
very low rate (3.7 per cent) recorded in 1978. Some of the
othar OMCs with a low or negative rate of growth In export
earnings were Afghan!stan, Kirlbat!, Nepal and Papua New
Guinea. The remaining DMCs registered a moderate growth
rate, which in most onses was higher than the average rate
of inflation in the world ocongeny but less than the rate of
growth of importa.

The aggregate value of imports of DMOa increased by
25.3 per cant from $92 billion in 1878 to $115 billion In 1978.
This rate of increase was only marginally ower thar the
25.9 par cant Increase recorded |n 1978. Of the $23 billion Increase in DMCs’ import payments curing the year, nearty
one-third was ecoounted for by increased payments for
thelr oll Imports. The increases in imports were gonorally
more uniformly spread among OMCs than thove In exports,

The pattern of trade has shown very little change In re
cent years. The latest avaliable data (for 1978) ahow that
Japan, United States and Western Europe continued to be
the main tracing partners of OMCs. They adso*bed 16.2 per
cent, 25.5 par cent anc 17.9 per cant raspactively of the
total exports of OMCs, and supplied 26,0 per cent, 15.3 per
cent and 17.9 per cent respectively of total impos. The
shares of Intra-regional trade in exports and imports wore
16.3 per cent and 15.6 per cent respectively. The share ot
Midcle East countries in OMCs" exports in 1978 was 6.4 per
cent and thal of Imports 17.7 per cent. These shares were
only marginally different trom those observed In 1877, ex.
cept for the share of Middle East countries in the imports of
OMCs which declined from 14 per cent in 1977 to 11.7 per
Cent in 1978, This was due to a faster increase In the cos! of
horroll imports of DMCa during 1078, a oll prices were
relatively stable during thet year. However, with the doutfing of oll prices during 1979, the share of Middle East countries in the total impors of DMCs would have again in
creased.

A comparison of the 1978 position with that ir 1973
Shows that over the five-year period, there was a deciine in
the relative share of DMCs’ exports to Japan, anc an increase in the shares of Middle East countries and the
United States. On the import side, the share of OMCs" im:
ports from the United States declined while those from MidBe East countries regisierec a marked Increase, The share
of intra-regional trade in both DMCs’ exports and imports
over the same period ceclinec marginally.

While the prices DMCs paid for imports in 1979 rose
Sharply, increases in the prices thoy received for thelr axPorts were generally modest. The terms of trade of several

1979. Fewer DMCs (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan and
Philippines} had Improvements in theit terms of trade dur
Ing the year,

The aggregate International reserves of DMCs increased
from $31.7 billion in 1978 to $39.4 billion in 1979 (Table 7).
However, because of the growing Imports at OMCs, these
were equivalent to about 4.6 morths'’ imports — slightly
jess than in 1878. The increases in reserves were widely
Gisiributed among DMCs. Of the 20 countries for which
Gata are availadie, only the reserves of Western Samoa
fell.”

Figures for OMCs" external public debt In 1979 are not yet
available, The latest tigures avallab’e (for 1978) show that
the total public dadt outstanding for OMCs increased from
$96.4 Dillion in 1977 to $86.7 billion in 1976 (Table 8) and that
the overall cebt service ratio increased from 6.6 per cent to
7.6 por cent in the samme period, There were, however, wide
ditterences in this ratio and the date covered only officia!
Gabt. The ratic therefore considerably understated the actual debt service recuirerrents of those countries — mostly
in Southeast Asia — which were in 2 position to raise large
amounts ir private borrowings and other debts not
guaranteed by the government. in view of larger current acSount gape In many DMCs during 1979, debt service ratios
would have gone up further by the end of 1979.

Domestic Efforts and Policies

The damestic economic policies of DMCs were designed
to moet both short-term anc longterm objectives. The
short-term objectives pursued during 1978 were to remedy
the immeciate probiems resulting from external changes,
food shortages and, in some cases, ihe mass movement of
refugees within the region. The OMCs made pragmatic
policy adjustments during 1979 to reduce the impact of
higher prices for oll and other Imports on thelr economies.

The higher costs of essential imports necessitated cer
tain adjusiments in the structure of domestic prices in
DMCs during 1979. The domestic prices of goods anc services naving & high energy input were goneraily increased
16 Dring them Into line with the new wertd prices for off and
petro-chemisal products. Though the adjustments added to
comestic inflationary pressures, these oressures wore held
in check in several DMCs through vigorous stabilization
measures. At the same time efforts to recuce tne con
sumption of energy resources were intensified and |nventment in the exploitation of domestic energy resources in
creased

Despite foreign exchange difficulties, sevaral DMCs pur
sued & policy of lideralizing imports, partly to ensure @ sup
ply of the imported items required for development purposes anc partly jo overcome shortages of essential com
moditiss, OMCs simuttancously endeavored to follow
policies designed to improve thelr export earnings so as to
be able to meet the increased cost of imports.

In addition to ihe propiems cremiec by oll price increases
and changes in the international economic environment,
some OMCs had to ‘ace problems causec by economic
dislocations, edverse weather conditions or an intiux of
refugees. Agricultural production in a number of OMCs In
Indochina, South Asia and Southeast Asia was adversely
affected by droughts. However, the food situation became
critical only In Bangladesn, Cambodia and Nepal.

Bangladesh, with international assistance, procured and
distributed over two million tons of foodgrains during 1979.
This averted the threat of famine, which seamed very real at
an early stage of the crisis. An international rescue oparatlon was mounted in Cambodia to save people from starvar
tion, but the success of this effort was impaired by con
tinued armed conflict, To forestall a critical food situation
in Nepal, the government appealed for emergency interna:
tiona! fooc assistance.

India sutfered from a prolonged and widespreac drought
in 1979 tut coped with the resulting problem by using ite
large stocks of loocgrains to cover the shorttall in produc
tion. The jevel of agricultural development it has now attained, including Its extensive system of Irrigation, enavied
India tc contain the atverse impact of drought and narrow
the gap between consumption and production te @ tar
greater extent than in the past, Because of its large stocks,
india did not import any foodgrains during the year; in fact,
it was able to make significant amounts available to other
countries in the region — Afgnanistan, Banglades, Nepal
and Viet Nam.

Another problem wnich several OMCs had to deal with
Outing 1979 was the mass movement of refugees from
Afgnanistan, Cambodia and Viet Nam. Amongst DMCs, the
major burden of the refuges problem fell on Hong Kong,
Malays’a, Pakistan and Thailand, but other OMCs, such as
Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore were also affected.
Several OMCs provided permanent homes for refugees,

others provicied temporary assistance while arrangements
were being mace for the refugees to proceed to their places
of resettiement.

‘The long-term objectives of DMCs continued to be foster
ing economic growth, disseminating the benefits of this
growth as widely as possinis, improving economic manage
mont, attaining greater self-reliance and controlling tho
rate of population increase, As the resource endowment
and level of industrial Cevelopment of DMCs varied, the appropriate development strategy for various OMCs was ailferent. The more industrialized OMCs were faced with ris
ing costs of labor, Secause of tri, as wall as tne fimitations on thelr exports of traditional labor-intensive products, these countries placed increasing emphasis during
the year on capitel and skillintensive sectors, while retain
ing their basic export orientation. They also tackled more
vigorously than before the problems of urbanization and ervironmental pollution

Some other OMCs such as India. Indonesia and Pakistan
placed emphasis mainly on the developmert of labor
intensive industries for Import-substitution as well as for
exports. In India, the governenent provicec special incentives for the promotion of smail-scale industries and reserved some iadustries or their expansion ‘or tne smati-scale
Sector. indonesia has undertaken an ambitious program of
building a considerable number of Industria) mini-estates
within the next 10 years, in Java as well as in the outlying
stands, These estates will provide infrastructure facilities,
training and information for smait industries. in Pakistan,
the government liberalized investment in the private sector,
particularly for medium and smalbacale industres. As
Countries in this group Nave @ large agricultural sector, they
continued to place considerable emphasis on agriculture
and rural Gevelopment in pursuance of their twin goals of
sconomic growth and equitable cistribution o! Its benefits,

The precominantly agrarian DMCs, which sutfer from tow
productivity and @ high Incidence of unemployment and
underemployment, continued to give high priority to
agricultural development and at the same time sought to
generate errployment in rural infrastructure projects and
wrnall and medium-scale industries with «high employment
potential. The industries of these couniries are mostly Dasec on the simple processing of the principal agricultural
commodities they produce. Afgnaristan, Bangladesh, Gur
ma, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam, which are the major
countries in this group, cortinved to adopt such policies
Curing 1979,

The OMCs generally pursued policws to encourage
Gomestic saving and investment and to attract foreign investors. Higher rates of inflation, nowever, anc the conseQuent dectine in real rates of interest tended to discourage
private saving in some DMCs. Data on aggregate domestic
savings and investmetis available for 12 OMCs (Tabie 9)
show that in 1875 (the latest year for which such statistics
aro avaliabie), domestic savings were low in Bangladesh
and Pakistan. Consequentty, they depended heavily on external resources even to finance their moderate lavels of invesiment. in the remaining OMCs the share of domestic
savings in GOP was generally high and ranged from 17 per
cent to 35 per cent. in three of these OMCs domestic sar
ings exceeded their total investments; in seven others,
although domestic savings ‘ell short of total Investment requirements, the dependence on external resources general
ly did not exceed 25 per cent of total investment and ft wasAepudlic of Korea. The Project suppii

improved irrigation, produces hydropower and oss/s

   

due not so much to inadequate mobilization of domestic
Savings as to (heir high levels of investment. During 1879,
severa! OMCs improved thelr public sector mobilization etforts. Bangladesh, Horg Kong, indonesia, Singazore and
Western Samoa hac significantly higher budgetary
surpluses; Sei Lanka had 4 surplus in its revenue budget for
the first time in five years; and Fiji, Lao Peopie's
Democratic Republic anc Maldives reduced thelr budgetary
deficits.

Fiscal incentives for investors in gener nd tor foreign
capita! and entreproneurstip in particular, were further
enhanced by some DMCs during 1979, These incentives
were designed particularly to promote the growth of exportoriented industries. Sri Lanka's 1989 budget srovided o
range of tax Incentives designed to attract foreign invest:
tment. Thailand adopted measures to stimulate investmont
and the package of Incentives included # longer period of
tax exemption tor foreign loans. Some DMCs (Pakistan,
Philippines and Sri Lanka) increased thelr efforts to
establish of expand free trade zones to attract foreign investors.

The ecoriomic policies adopted by many OMCs In recent
years to promote international trade were continued, and
Several of them adopied measures in 1979 to liberalize
trade, The Republic of Korea lowered tariffs on a wide
range of products. india allowed ite commercial banks
greater freedom in foreign exchange transactions. Sri

Lanka took steps to develop an offshore banking sector in
the country. Lao People’s Democratic Republic and
Westen Samoa adjusted thelr exchanges rates to improve
the cornpetitiveness of thelr exports. Papua New Guinea
revalued It currency to reduce the inflationary impact of
an increase in the prices of imports on the country's
domestic price leve. indones!a introduced reforms i taxation and tariffs to make them compatible with the new ex
change rate which came into effect after the devaluation of
the rupian in November 1978

Varying Gagrees of progress were made In populatior
control activities, particularly in more heavily populated
DMCs such as Sangiadesh, Republic of China, india, In
Gonesia, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Prilippines and
Thailand. Most OMCs reported varying degrees of reduc
tion in birth rates over the last two decades, though in
some of them thie was not yet refiected in lower rates of
population increase due to a simultaneous decline in ceath
rates. Reduction of high birth rates remained a priority o>
jective in many OMCs, which received increased intenational support for this purpose. Among others, Bangle
cosh's family planning program reported major gains in the
number of ecoeotors, and indonesia, which achieved con:
siderable success in recent years In reducing ‘ta high birth
rates, continued to pusn its family planning programe wit!
vigor. Institutional and physica! facilities for extending
family planaing services further expanded in the region.

Progress in Regional Cooperation

& number of develooments in regional cooperation
among OMCs took piace Curing 1879, of which the more
significant sre discusse below. At their Eighth Annual
Session, the Economic Ministers of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) acted about 1,000
items to the list of products covered by the Preferential
Trading Arrangement. This brougnt the number of Items accordes trade preferences to over 2,300. Againnt the
background of modest growth in intra-ASEAN trade, ht was
decided to increase from 100 to 150 the number of items offared by each member in each subsequent round ot quarter:
ly negotiations,

Progress was also madw with respect to the five large
ASEAN Industria! crojects. Indonesia's urea project reach.
ed an advanced stage following the approval of a Japanese
loan and the pliant is scheduled to commence operations in
1982. Maisysia’s urea project was under review by Ine
Japenese Governmert preparatory to joan financing
negotiations.

In addition to an ASEAN Rice Reserve established to provide a bufter in the event of food shortages, intra-regional
cooperation for emergencies was extended to an energy
sharing arrangement, whereby indonesia and Malaysia
would make oll available to other regional members on a
priority basis, The central banks of ASEAN countries approved a threeyear extension of the $200 million swap
facility after tts two-year term expired during 1979.

In the South Pacific region, a Sovtn Pacific Forum
Fisheries Convention was formulatec to provide a frame
work for regional cooperation in fisheries management and
control. The South Pacific Conterence directed that a
feasibility study of a regional export stabilization scheme
sould be undertaken by the South Pacific Commission
(SPC) with participation by the South Pacific Sureau for
Economic Cooperation (SPEC),

Cooperation in regional transportation was reflected in
the launching of the Association of South Pacific Airlines
as part of the consultative mechanism for regional airline
interests, and in decisions by the Rogional Shipping Council that the capita! of the Pacitic Forum tine should de increased and that the shipping line should continue to service selected non-profitable routes,

Saveral bilateral cooperation arrangements were con
cluded among DMCs. Pakistan and Bangladesh reached
an agreement to set up & Joint Economic Commission to
strengthen economic anc technical cooperation between
them. Ap agreement was signes between india and the
Republic of Korea to establish joint industrial projects in
third countries, and between india and ‘nconesia to
cocperate In developing steel, cemant and iron industries
and natural gas exploration. Thailand and Malaysia
teached an understanding on the joint exploration and exploltation of natural resources, principally gas and oll,
located on adjacent areas of the continental shelf. These
two countries also agreed tc participate jointly in projects
involving the Golok River which forms part of their common
border.

Developments in International Cooperation
During "978, the latest year for which date are available,
the net flow of external resources to OMCs increased to
$11.0 billion from $8.2 billion in 1977, reversing the deciine
tecorded in the previous year. Despite the rising trend in an

nual net flows to OMCs between 1970 anc 1978 (net tiowsin
1977 and 1976 were below the 1976 level), the share of
OMCs In total net flows to all developing countries fell
sharply from an average of about 24 per cent in.1970 and
1971 to an average of about 13 per cent during 1977 and
1976, Although data are not yet avaliable for 1978, larger
current account Ceficits and an incresse in international
reserves in OMGs curing the year suggest that the total net
flow to OMCs increasod further In 1978.

Efforis to improve world food security had mixed results.
The suspension of negotiations for a new international
grains agreement delayed the adoption of a new sonventior raising the food aks target to a minimum of 10 million
tons — the level recommanded by the 1974 Worle Food
Conterence. The target of 500,000 rons set for 1978 for the
International Emergency Food Reserves was not reached,
though substantial emergency food supplies were provided
through the FAO's World Food Program anc other proorate to a number of DMCs in 1979, A limited agreernent
was ‘eached on ine establishment of nationally held Dut internationally coordinated food stocks, to which
economically betterotf count‘ies aro expecied to con
tribute.

The resources of some major multilateral institutions,
trom which OMCs borrow, were significantly increased durIng 1979, Members of the World Bans agreed to increase its
capital by $40 blllon, thereby doubling ite resources, Ao
tions on 4 $12 bil¥on replenishment of the resources of IDA,
the World Bank's concessions! lending facility, reached an
advanced stage. The Finance Min'sters of OPEC countries
approved an $800 million repienisnment of the OPECSpecial Fund. The IMF resumed SOR sitocations and this
will increase global International reserves by SDA 4 billion
annually during the three-year period beginning In 1979. 4
new IMF Supplementary Financing Faclitty came into
operation when the level of contributions required to activate It was reached in February 1979, and IMF decided to
extend the maximum repayment period uncer Ite Extended
Facility from oight to 10 years. The IMF also adopted new
guidelines which will improve access to its financial
facilities. Under thease guidelines, broad macro-economic
indicators rather than the use of specific policy measures
would form the basis for determining the souncness of natlonal economic policies,

The framework for international trade expansion was
marked by two developments of concern to DMCs. These
were the conclusion of multilateral negotiations under the

* General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) and the out
come of discussions on the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP) taxen up at UNCTAD V. The Tokyo
Round Agreements of GATT offer a lega! basin for accord
Ing preferential treatment to developing countrias and par
| mit thern to establish preferential echernes among them
selves. in addition, the agreements provide for trade
Ideralization through tariff reductions and codes govern
_ ing the use ct non-tariff barriers. The linpact of this pro
posed tramework, open for signature until June 1980, will
depend on the ratification of the agreementa and on how
they are Implemented.

As a follow-up of a decision taken at UNCTAD IV, the integrated Program of Commodities (/PC) made some heacway with respect to two major components: the Common
Fund and International Commodity Agreements. UNCTAD
members reached sufficient agreement on the major
features of the Common Fund to enable the drafting of Its
Articies of Agreement. The proposa! calls for @ target
capitalization of $750 million to tinance activities through
two windows: $400 million for bulferstocks and $360 million

‘for other commodity measures, such as research and devel
opment, product diversitication and productivity im
Provements. Although pledges during the year had not
reached target levels, substantia! financial commitments
Were made, inciuding OPEC's offer to pravide up to $100
million toward their own membership contributions and the
coritributions of the poorest countrics,

An event of considerable significance to several DMCs
Was the conclusion of a now Internationa! Commodity
Agreement (ICA) on natural rubber. This agreement, under
which # bufferstock to be financed by both producers and
Consumers will be established, marked the first succeaaful
hegotiation of a new commodity agreement as part of the
integrated Program tor Commodities under UNCTAD epon
sorship,

Several developments took place in 1979 In the compensatory financing schemes which benefit DMCs. The terms
and conditions of the IMF Compensatory Financing Facillty Were liberalized Sy increasing the maximum amount
avaliable from 75 per cent to 100 per cent of s member's
Quota and by allowing service exports to be covered under
this facitity, The Stabex compensatory finance scheme,
whigh is extended by the European Economic Community
{EEC} to certain African, Caribbean and Pacific developing
countries under the Lomé Convention, was renewed for
‘@nother five-year period, Modifications were also made to It
to enhance its benefits, and they include easing the oond
tlons of qualifications and broadening the number of com
modities covered under the compensatory arrangement.
Furthermore, @ parallel program of compensatory finance
for mineral products, Minex, has been Introduced under the
renegotiated Lomé Convention.

At the Tokyo Summit in June, heads of government of
Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Itoly.
Japan, United Kingdom, and United States reatfirmed thetr
commitment to conserve energy by satting specitic of! import targets through to 1985. They agreed to continue
monitoring oll imports and to hasten developments ct alter.
native energy sources. Other matters of concem to OMCs
included an endorsemant of the World Bank's program of
lending to increase energy production, and # pledge to
sirengthen multilateral agencies to Improve world food production.

UNCTAD V adopted resolutions regarding the naed to improve tha technological capacity of developing countries,
and the United Nations Conference on Science and
Tectinology, which was held in Vienna in August, agreed to
astablish a $280 million fund to assist sclentitic research in

. developing countries and to set up an inter-governmental
Committee to supervise UN's science and technolegy ac
tivities.

The Independent Commission on international Develop
meant Issues (the Brandt Commiaalon) completed its report
after two years of deliberations and consultations. The
Report — which contains proposals for a four-part peckage
comprising an assured fiow of funda to developing countries, an agreement on security of energy supply and con:
servation, a world food program, and reforms in such areas
@5 the monetary system and financing of development —
was expected tc be farmal'y submittoc to the United Nations In earty 1960,

Al @ number of Intemational mestings held curing the
year, the formulation of an appropriate strategy for
development for the 1980s was clscussed, Slow progress
was mace towards echieving the structura! changes in
world economic relations, which the developing countries
seek, to create @ New International Eoonomic Order. The
Arusha Program and Framework for Negotiations, which
emerged from the meeting of Group of 77 Ministers held
prior to UNCTAD V, etressed the objective of collective selltrollance. This objective was reiterated in an UNCTAD V
resolution to mobilize support tor a program of Economic
Cooperation among Developing Countries (ECDC), in which
trade preferences and joint ventures are viewsd as major
olaments.

The theme of self-reliance tor OMCs of the Bank was alfirmed at ESCAP’s 351th Plonary Session where regional
development strategies for the next decade were discuss
ec. It was stressed that the strategy for the 1980s should be
raglistic and framed in terms of the clearly perceived needs
of developing countries; should take into accourt the differences among developing countries; and should provice
for the special needa of landiocked and less developed
countries.

With the close of 1979, the OMCs stand at the threshold
of 8 new decade, with 8 record of considerable achiavements, Despite these, OMCs sili! face serious problems.
The response of DMCs to some of the problems faced during 1979 has been descrived in this chapter, the record of
the Bank's policies and operations In support of tne efforts
of its OMCs is described in subsequent chaptors.

7Lending Operations

IN 1979, the Bank's lending activities recorded a further Incroase In volume and range, Total joan approvals during the
year armounted to $1,282 million as compared with $1,159
miflion in 1978. One-third of the Bank's lending curing the
year waa on concestional terms to the poorer and less
developed member countries, Co-financing and cooperation with other ald agencies significantly added to the
assistance provided by the Bank to Its developing member
countries (DMCs). Technical assistance activities again
recorded a sharp increase of 26.6 per cent over the previous
year.

During the year, a total of $6 loans — inclucing three proprarr: loans and one multiproject toan — for 57 projects in
18 OMCs were approved, compared to 53 loans for 52 pro
| jects In the same number of DMCs In the previous year.

~ Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR) In 1978
, amounted to $835 million, an increase of 7.3 per cent over
the 1978 figure of $778 million. Loans from Special Funds
(SF) amounted to $416 million which represents an increase
of 9.4 per cent over the 1978 concessional lending of $361
Million. in 1879, 65 per cent of SF loans wert to countries
which had a per capita GNP of lesa than $200 In 1976,

During the year, four OMCs received loans exclusively
from OCR: Fiji ($7 million), Republic of Koraa ($160 million),
Malaysia ($79 million} and Singapore [$*5 million).

Four OMGs received loans from both OCR anc SF; In
Gonepia, $235 million ($210 million from OCR and $25
_. Million from SF), Papua New Guinea, $12 million ($6 million
peo from OCR anc $6 million from SF}; Philippines, $222 million

OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Tho South Pacific DMCs received six Bank loans amounting to $26 million, Four of these, totalling $13 million were
from SF and the remaining two of $13 milllon from OCR.
Two S* loans were for power development, another for a
development bank, and the fourth for a multiproject loan, a
naw type of joan package designed to assist smal! island
economies, As of the end of 1979, total Bank joans to South
Pacific DMCs arnounted to $151 million for 34 projects.

The loans approved during the year Included three supplementary loans — $25 million from SF for the Ashuganj
Fertilizer Project in Bangladesh; $8 million from OCR tor
the Bancung Water Supply Project In Indonesia; and $3
million from SF for the Uree Fertilizer Project in Sri Lanka.
Two technica! assistance loans from OCR were also made
— $2.1 million for a Sewage Treatment Project in the
Republic of Korea; and $1.7 million for the Third Mindanse
Irrigation Study in the Philippines.

The average size of loans approved in 1979 dectined
slightly from $21.8 million In 1978 to $21.6 million. The
average size of OCR loans increased from $25.1 million in
1978 to $28.8 million, On the other hand, there was o
substantial fall in the average size of SF loans, from $17.3
million in 1978 to $14.4 million in 1879 because of a larger
number of small loans made during the year.

The total cost of the projects approved in 1979, excluding
six develoament finance institution (DFI) projects, is estimated at $2,630 million, of which Bank financing accounted
for 42 per cent. in addition, the Bank helped mobilize a part
of the remaining project financing required through cofinancing arrangements (see page 22). On the basis of the
Bank's past experience, |t is extinated that the total cost of
the subdloan projects to be financed by the six joans to DFis
will be around $528 million.

By the end of 1979 tne Bank's cumutative lending nad
reached $6,650 million tor 415" projects in 23 OMCs, Of
these, loans totalling $4,687 million were from OCR and

5,963 million from SF,

In addition to financing the foreign exchange costs of
Qoods anc services needed for thene projects, the Bank has
also financed, In apecttic clrounstances, interest anc other
charges during construction os well as a portion cf the
local currency expenditures of some projects. The financ

As regards ical cost financing, tne Bank places privrary
emphasis on a DMC's economic situation, especially its
overall Daiance of payments position anc its ability to
mobilize domestic resources. in 1978, the amount of local
currency expencitures financed was $81.5 million in 18
toans to seven countries, Of Ihis, $33.2 million was trom
OCR and $43.3 million from SF, accounting for 4 per cent
and 11.6 per cent, respectivety, of the loans approved from
OGR and SF in 1979,

in an effort to reduce the heavy depencencse of DMCs an
Imponed energy resources, the Bank provided further sub
stantial assistance for both hydropower and coal development. The development of human resources through improved technical, vocational and general education also
recelved increasing attention from tne Bank. Tota’ Bank
loan approvals for education more thar doubled curing the
year. The Bank alse continued io pay Special attention to
environmental aspects in various projects.

in 1978, the Bank approved three program joans — $11.8

The Bank achieved a high \eve! of co-financing in 1978. A
total of 24 projects involved co-financing, with the cofinanciers providing $447 rrililion and the Bank $723
million,’ This compares with 18 projects co-financed in
1976, for which the co-financiors contributed $424 million
and the Bank $444 million? Of the projects Involving cofinancing in 197%, five were financed by Bank ioans approvod in previous years and 19 by Bank loans approved during

ateBenefits to the Poor

The Bank's DMCs inctuda a disproportionately large
number in which abject poverty is by far the dominant
economic and social condition of the people. in fact, for
over two-thirds of the population In OMCs, per capita income has still to react $100 a year. The poverty of the large
masses of people in these countries manifests itself not
onty in terms of low Income but also in under-nourishment
and |#-nourishment, illiteracy, poor sanitation, low life expectancy at dirtn, and iack of social services and urban
housing

The Bank has helped to raduce poverty in the region principally through lis concessional lending to the poorer and
ass daveloped DMCs. Eligibility for the Bank's corcessional loans |s based on country considerations, speciticalty on a country’s per capita lnoome level and its Gebt repayment capacity. In allocating concessional resources
among eligible DMCs, those that are least developed or
most sariously affected by recent world economic developments have been given first priority. This approach is consistent with the Bank's charter, which enjoins the Bank to
give special regard to the needs of the less developed
OMGs in its operations. in 1979, 85 per cant of the total concessional lending of $416 million went to the poorest DMCe
with a per capita income in ‘978 not exceeding $200.

n the transfer of resources it is recognized that the low
levels of per capita income of the poor DMCs sariously
restrain thelr ability to gamer the comestic savings needed
for development anc reduce their capacity [o absord exter
nal foreign exchange financ'ng. The provision of local cost
financing by the Bank Is Intended to he'p ease those constraints. To meet the growing Gemand for such financing In
the poor DMCs, the Bank decided In 1979 to raise the call
ng of local cost financing trom lis Special Funds resources
from 10 per to 15 per cent of the total proposed landing
from that source. This Is In contrast with the decision to
maintain the ca'ling of 5 per cent in ordinary lending opera
tions, Out of $81.5 million of boca! costs financed by the
Bank |n.1978, nearly 60 per cent was made in Special Fund
toans; 93 per cent of this concessional financing went to
the poorest DMCs.

 

 

 

 

 

At the country level, the Sank's efforts to help the poor
nave been reliected in the jud.cicus selection of projects
for financing and through appropriate project cesign anc
osation. in project selection, the main thrust of ihe Bans's
Operational strategy nas been its assistance to agriculture
and rural development. This strategy will not only bring the
benefits of Bank assistance to the poor in the low-income
OMCs, but will also reduce relative poverty in OMCs with
higher income, like Philippines and Thailand. in pursuance
of this strategy, ihe Bank commissionec an Asian Agricul
tural Survey soon after its establishment. The study was
updated in 1877 with the completion of ine Second Asian
Agricultural Survey, followed by the recently comotetod
Soutn Pactfic Agricultura! Survey, In 1879, after a review of
the Bark's role in the Agriculture and Ruta! Development
sector, the Sank decided to alm at increasing the level of its
ending to this sector by 20 per cent each year during the
next three years. | was also decided during the yaar inal,
within the basec framework of Bank policy, program lending
for this sector would be made more flexible to meet its
Special requirements.

Barktinancec projects in the Agriculture and Aura
Development sector (excluding agroindustry projects)
tecelved 27 per cent of total Bank lending in 1979, and 54
per cent of the Bank's concessional lending. These pro
jects beretit the rural poor by increasing thelr incomes
through increased production, by creating more empioyment opportunities anc by helping to meet thelr basic
needs. The projects will ciiltate more intensive

Projects of this type approved in 1979 Inciuce the Bukidnon irrigation Project in the Philippines which involves con
struction of irtigation facilities, introdustian of soll conser
vation measures and ested isiment of silo! farms and will
thus cirectly benefit some 5,600 farm families. Other
casically irrigetion-type projects, inctuding ine Tulungagung Drainage Project in Indonesia, the South Robri Fresh
Grounawator irrigation Project in Pakistan, the Bico! River
Basin Irrigation Development Project in the Philippines,
and tne Casier Sud Pioneer Agricultural Project in Laos, are
expected to benefit directly anc incirectly about 149,000
poor families.’ The Bank-financed crop intensification pro
grams in two cyclon@-besat districts of Bang!acesh and the
Sahiwa! District of Pakistan will benefit tne poor by raising
ine productivity and incomes of small farmers through the
Supply of fertilizers and other farm inputs and Sy creating
employment for the landiess. Gank assistance to recrass
regional imbatances also contributes 10 the alleviation of
rural poverty in individual OMCs. This is itlustrated by two
Bank loans made in 1974 anc *9/7 for the Pahang Tenggara
Regional Developement Project in Malaysia in witich the
beneficiaries are 250,000 new settlers crawn trom landiess
ans unemployed ladorers anc smaliholders from cisadvan
taged population groups. And a rural credit project in Sri
Lanka will enable jow-income tarmars to obtain for the first
time credits on reasonable terms for purchasing livestock,
wrigation pumps enc farm implements.

The Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Project In Banglodesh typifies ihe Bank's recent efforts in integrates rural
area Gevalopment. The project area Is ruggec, Isolated, anc
has jess than five per cent of arable land (confined to nar

for rudbet anc norticultural crops. About 2,000 families of
fandiess of marginal farmers will be sectied in iness aroas,
and will be provided with basic services such #5 potable
water, schools, heath clinics and access roads. Sinvlar
Settiements for another 300 |ow-income farnilies will be set

Project financing by the Sank in the fisheries and livestock sub sectors beneflis poor fishermen and farmers by
noreasing thelr prodection capacity (and hence their incomes) through larger fish catches and better breeds of
ivestock as wel! ax improving the: nutritiona| standarcs
anc those of other poor peoale through the supaly of cheap
anima) proteins. In the fisheries development loans mace
to Bangladesh, Pakistan ard Pnilippines, Denetits to poor
fishermen ave ensured by determining the eligibility for
Bank assistance on the basis of relative incorne level. In tne

aporoved in 1878.Increasing attention has been directed by the Bank to the
needs of the urban poor, espectally since the estadiistiment
of a Social Infrastructure Olvision in the Bank & year ago.
Bank tinancing of projects in this area le designed to nalp
the urban poor meet their basic needs such as potabe
water supply, simple housing, education, nealth and otner
social services. About 150,000 dwellers in 106 istered
Sum areas in Sargkok will for the first time be providec
with sale water supoly under the Second Bangkox Water
Supply Project. The Banding Water Supply Project in InConesia involves, among cthers, the construction of stand.
pipes to oravide 100,000 low-income people with an ade
Quate suoply of sotnbie water, A total of 6,000 relative’y
small dwelling units in high-rise apartment blocks will be
constructed in several cities of the Republic of Korea anc
sold to low-income people under the Low-Cost Housing
Project. The Bandung Urban Development Pre
Geonesla provices for the sale of small residential piots at
prices within the reach of low-income families, and also in
cludes ihe al and environmental improvement of three
peoory served residential corteastitios,

Apart from courtry considerations and the project eelection approach describec eariler, the Sank also seks to
enhance the impact of its assistance on the economic and
Socia) well-Deing of the poor through appropriate design of
projects. Labor-intensive and lght-capital technologies
have been adopied, where aspropriate, to create additicaal
employment opportunities and promote more even Income
datribution. Projects in the Agriculty nd Aural DevelopMent sector as wel! a6 other project at invove large civil
WOrks are particularly anenabie to this treatment; and the

Chromic and debilitating Cisease thal piagues ihe poor ina
relatively backward area of the southern Philippines — was
incluced as @ project component. To facilitate the involve

development projects approved in 1878 for Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Pailippines. Anc in the Serajgon) integrated
Rural Development Project in Bangladesh, aporoved in
1976, provision was made for the organization of wornen
and rural youth through selected economic activities

This Orie! review highlights the efforts made by the Bank
In the past, and more specifically in 1979, to benefit the
poor. Viewed agains! the enonnous magnitude of the problem of poverty in the region, the Bank's efforts to help the
poor represent only & modest contribution. in the coming
years, the Bank will recouble its efforts io make the
benefits of Its essisiance reach the poor. The gaining of
more operational experience through pos
Bank-tinanced projects and the introduction o
paseline surveys and subsequent periodic monitoring of
projects in the Agricuiture and Rural Development sector
are expected 10 prove partioularty valuadte in these efforts

  

27Sectoral Review

Agriculture and Agro-industry

Lending and technical assistance for Agriculture and
Agro-Industry in 1879 once again ratlectead the high priority
the Bank assigns to this vital development sector. The key
1o alleviating poverty In the region Is to acceleraie the
growth of agticuitura! Incomes and food supply because
the majority of the populations and of the poor live in rural
areas.

Agricultural development siso is an important factor in
incusteal growth: @ large part of domestic consumer demand for industrial products depends on agricultural prosperity, and # significant proportion of manufacturing ac
tivity Is based on agricultural raw materials.

The Bank's efforts in this sector are mainly aimed at increasing the productivity of food anc ather agriculture!
craps through Improvements in irrigation and other produc
tive infrastructure, the supply of agro-inpute and access to
markets and storage facilities,

The Agriculture and Agro-Industry sector covers irrigay
tlon anc rural develaprnent, fisheries, livestock, agricultural
credit and support services, forestry, fertilizer and agro
processing,

in teers of overall Bans lending, this sector received
almost one-third (22.8 per cent) of total loans in 1979, com
pared with 26.8 pet cent in 1978. Similarly, inis sector
received the largest share of the Bank's technica! assis:
tance In 1972 although its snare showed # modest decline
ftom 61.2 per cent It 1978 to $6.2 per cant. Total lending 10
this sector a8 of the end of “979 amounted to $1,772 million
for 132 projects, while technical assistance totalled $32
million for 161 projects.

irrigation and Rural Development: The Sank’s strategy
for assistance continues to place emphasis on an in
tegrated approach to rural development, focusing jointly on
land utilization, water management and expansion of rural
employment, a3 a moans of dealing with the persisting problems of unemployment and underemployment, poverty
and mainutritien among the rural population in DMCs. The
Bank also pays special attention to strengthening rural institutions anc to ensuring increased participation of small
scale farmers and landless workers in Bank-assisied projects.

A Regional Seminar on Irrigation Oevelopmert and
Manegernent, he'd during the year, raviewad the Bank's experience with 41 irrigation projects ass:sted by it In the past
decade. Severs! critical problem areas identified at inis
sorminar were taken into accourt in designing Bank-assisted Irrigation anc rural development projects during the
year, For instance, reflecting the importance of institu
tional anc organizational aspects, the Bank agread to administer, together with (ts $7 million loan for the Casier Sud
Pioneer Agricultural Project in Laos, a technical assistance
grant of $310,000 from the Internationa! Fund for Agricul
tural Development, to strengthen the overall capacity of the
Directorate of Agriculture of the Ministry of Agricviture.
Forestry and irrigation,

Another important concern Is to ensure that the sociceconomic benefits anticipated at the lime of project ap
praisal are realized. In this regard, where practicable the
Bank bulids into the project a benefit-monitoring system
which provides benchmerk data covering demmograpy s,

agricultural and socio-economic conditions in the project
area. Curing the year, @ technical assistance grant of
$50,000 was included for this type of survey along with &
Bank joan of $39 million for the Tulungagung Drainage Project in Indonesia

in an effort to maximize the impact of Its assistance on
the rural poor, the Bank also approved during the year a
$28.5 million joun tor the Chittagong Hill Tracts Developmont Project in Bangladesh. This loan represented tne
Bank's first rural development project In a less developed
region of thal country (see pages 28 and 54). One reiativaly
small joan of $1.7 miltion to the Philippines provided
technical assisiance for the preparation of 8 package of
sovera! krigation orojects for possible Gank financing.

Tne Bank also expandec its program ‘ending for ihe
agricultural sector with two program loans in 1979 — one
for $11.8 million to Bangladesh and anotner for $14 million
to Pakistan. Both ioans supported crop Intensification programs and financed incremental phosphatic fertilizer requirements in specific districts of the recipient countries,
aiong with relevant improvements in fertilizer distribution,
storage and agricultural extension facilities

In 1979, the Bank approved 10 Ioans totalling $230 million
in the Irrigation and Rural Development sud-sector bringing
the cumulative total to 67 loans for $855 million.

Fisheries: [n assisting fisheries development, the Bank
takes into account the opportunity which marine and inianc
fisheries, including aquaculture, offer tor meeting basicnutritional requirements for animal protein, talsing the
foreign exchange eamings of OMCs and, at the same time,
improving the incomes and |iving standards of small-scale
fishermen. The Bank envisages substantial scope for fur
ther develooment of fisheries in the ragion, particutarty as
its DMCs extend thair jurisdiction in respect of fishing activities,

The principal elements of the Bank's framework for
assistance to this sector incluce continued emphasis on
the development of marine (i.e. coastal and offsmore)
tisnaries with increasing attention aise to aquaculture ang
inland fisheres and fisheries resource assessmont and
management (seo page 48).

The Bank made three loans totalling $43 million during
the year as compared with four loans amounting to $68
million In 1978, At the enc of 1979, the Bank had provided s

ota! of $258 million in loans tor 22 fisheries projects, an ecditiona) $742,000 for fisheries components in loans for
three ruta! development projects, and about $2 million tor
17 technica! assistance projects in 11 OMCs,

Uvestock: Livestock is of considerable importance to
tural Communities and toans to this sub-sector can assist
in meeting basic nutritional requirements in OMCs. The
Bank wil! continue te land support for livestock develop
ment with emphasis on imorcving the incomes of
smalinoider farming communities. The major fields of project activities in the future are expected tc be livestock
Gevelopnent — Including pig and poultry — for production
of meat, milk and draft animals, To support these activities,
attention will also be paid to development of feed bane and
improvement of livestock services and training.Ts

During the year, the Bank made four loans for livestock
projects amounting to $53 million as compared with one
loan of $12 million In 1978. At the end of 1979, the Sank nad
provided a tote! of $70 million in loans for seven ‘vestocs
projects In seven DMCs. In ecdition, the Sank had provioed
$4 million for livestock components in joans for six area
development projects and had also approved technical
assistance orants totalling $3 milton for 15 projects in this
Subsector ;

Agro-industry: The Bank continued its support for this
sub-sector in 1679, particularly wiin @ view to raising the
productivity of plantations in botn the public and small
holder sectors through replanting and improved cultural
practices, modernizing the associates processing ine
dustries and provicting facilities for marketing, In this con
nection, ine Sark extendec three loans for cotton processing In Atghanisian, foodgrain storage in Bangladesh, and
for strengthening rice processing incustries in Burma. The
joan to Burma was supported with a technica! essistance
Grant of $150,000 for the establishment of a Post-Harvest
Rice Technology Center.

In addition, two supplementary loans were approves —
one to Bangladesh anc the other te Sri Lanka — to cover @
part of the additional foreign exchange financing needed
for two Bank-assisted ‘fertilizer projects in these countries.
For this sut-sector, five loans totalling $74 million were approved during the year along with six technical assistance
projects totalling $569,000, At the end of 1879, tne Bank hac
provided a total of $386 Millian in ioans for 25 projects.

and programs which are conducive to efficient use and conservation of anergy.

The Bank recognizes that in any sound power system
planning. optimum use must be made of avellable energy
resources. Its efforts, therefore, continue to focus on the
Cavelopment of indigenous energy sources such as hydro
power, natural gas, lignite-coal and geothermal power, and
on projects for the Deneticiation of discovered resources
through downstream activities such as transmission,
distrisution anc, in the case of fuet minerals, in refining
operations.

vimproving the efficiency of energy industries through the
fevabliittation anc moderrization of existing production
and distribution facilities will also continue to recelve Bank
assistance. Moreover, the Bank hopes to play a usetul role
In the development and exploitation of mineral fuel
resources end petroleum fuels, Special attention will be
giver tc comprehensive energy planning by OMCs to cover
all forms of potential energy resources ard demand
management, with specific reterence to pricing and other
incentives for conserving energy and encouraging efficient
resource utPization

Of the 10 projects approved during the yaar, seven were
energy resource development projects whilo three were for
the improved utilization of energy supply facilitias. Energy
resource development projects were Daned on the expioita:
tion of Indigenous resources; four projects (totalling $97
milion) will help increase hydropower generating capacity
by 291.8 MW in four countries: another 150 MW thermal
generating project in Thalland, financed with a Gank joan
of $81.8 million, will use lignite as fuel. The two remaining
projects involve the development of coal mines in Reputric
af Korea and Philippines te increase tue! supplies ‘or
dustrial and household use. These projects will reduce the
dependency of the countries on imparted energy resources
and will result in an estimated total foreign exchange sar
ing of $77 millicn per annum. Likewise, the project in

electrification of rural areas arises trom the impetus that it
Gives to the creation ct small and medium-scale rural in
dustries, to agricultural production through the exsarsion
of pump irrigated areas and to the oroductive capabilities
of the rural population. Similarly, the Third Power Project in

Technica! assistance tor the energy sector In 1979 com
prised six projects, with emphasis on sector planning anc
Institution buliding., A project in Thailand will provide
assistance, together with the United Nations Development
Programme ({UNOP), 19 prepare a master plan for the devolopment and management of the country’s energy sector up
to the year 2000. Two other technical assisiance projects
will enable the public utilities in Papua New Guinea and
Western Samoa to formulate more satistaciory tariff
policies, The fact that both recipients are small DMCs in
the South Pacific is indicative of the importance attached
by the smaller ulfiities to appropriate pricing of tneir sar
vices. Technica! assistance was aso provided for preparing rescurce development projects for possible Bank finan
cing, one in Nepal for hydro-electric power development,
another also in Nepal for implomentation of the transmis
sion project and the third in Bangladesh for determining oxpansion and rehab iitation needs in natural gas.

During 1979, Bank lending to the Energy secter amount9 to $325 million for 10 projects and technical assistance
Qfante totalled $7.5 million for six projects compared to
$249 million for seven projects and $389,700 fer three projects, respectively, in 1978, Total Energy sector tending at
the end of the year amounted to $1,581 million, comprising
84 projects. Of this amount, 58 per cent was for develop:
ment of energy resources and 42 per cent for improved
Utilization of anergy supply facilities Total technical
assistance amounted to $7 million for 34 projects at the
end of 1979, more than half of which was for sectoral planning and institution-Duliding,

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerals and Development Banks

The majority of the Bank's DMCs piace considerable importance on Industriallzation as a strategy for achieving accelerated economic development. Improvements in tne
balance of payments throug’ lrport substitution and/or oxport diversification, greater employment, a more equitable
distribution of Income and wider ownership of tha means of
production are among the benefits scught from industriallzation.

Traditionally, the Bank has helped its OMCs industrialize
by providing finance tor the creation of expansion of indusiria! capacity, The needs of small and medium-scale indusiries are mat through credit lines to development
finance institutions (DFis) and those of large-scale Indusiries through direct lending. More recently, the Bank
has accorded high priority to the identification and
development of nomfue! mineral resources in view of their
potential role in improving foreign exchange warnings and
Birengihening \inkages supporting industrialization programs.

Industry and Non-Fuel Minerale: The activities In this
aector during 1979 wore marxed by the Bank's first program
loen for industry, continued support for Improvament of InGustrial research capabilities and expanded efforts,
through mineral sector missions, to identity potential projects involving neneral resources developrnent.

The program loan of $5.2 million was intended to help
complement the creation of additional capacity in Burma's
cement industry with optimization of efficiency and utiliza
tion of existing plant and equipment through the provision
of essential spare parts and complementary equipment. In34

  
 

rece ars Burma's cement industry has been unable to
meet rising demand and serious shortages are oxpacted
unless the supply is augmented. The program loan will
enabie Sutms to increase cement production by 100,000
m1. annually

The Bank recognizes that industria! research activities
ere essential to the development of appropriate tecnnology
and industria! practices, both of which play an important
part in fortitying Industrialization efforts. In 1879, a $18
million loan was extendes to the Republic of Korea for ex
pending the facilities, and upgracing the capabilities, of
the Koraa institute of Science and Technology (KIST) The
‘oan will help finance applied research work in various in
Custrial disciplines and thus facilitate tne longte
development of more technology intensive industrigs in ine
courury

in the area of non-fuel minerals, the Bans took the initial
step of expanding its operations in the mining suctor Sy
undertaking a mineral sector mission to review the potery
tial and prospects for developing the mineral sector in
Pakistan. Most OMCs are known to hove substantia! uniappod riinaral resources which, if developed, covid become a
source of foreign exchange earnings of Savings.

Apart from helping DMCs exploit thalr potential non-fuel
minera! resources, the Bank will continue to assist in the
cevelopment of thelr institutional capadill as well as
their facilities for conducting gealogical, geophysical and
gecchemical surveys, resource evaluation ans mineral @xploration programs te ciscovar new reserves. Activities in
this area ere expected tc expand In the years ahead.

During the year the Bank extended a third credit line for
$0 million to the Korea Development Finance Corporation
anc e fifth credit line for $39 milton to the Private Develop
mont Corporation of the Pailippines. Significantly, the Bank
also provided during the year its first credit |ines to two
other Dis In thease two countries. a $10 millon credit te the
Citizens National Bark (CNB) In the Republic of Korea anc
a $15 million credit to Philippine investments Systeme
Organization (P/SO). The increasing number of institutions
being used by the Bank as channels for reiencding develop:

particularly when they are rural-Dased or located in de
pressed areas with high rates of unemployment. Boh CNG

areas such 88 agriculture, school and community develop
ment and various services.

During 197% the cevelopment banks sector received six
credit lines totalling $137 million trom the Gark. As of the
end of 1979, the Bank hac approved 52 credit lines for a
total of $979 million to 24 Gevelopment banks in 16 OMCs,
representing 14.7 per cent of total Bank jending

 

 

Transport and Communications

The Bank's DMCs have assigned a major rote tor
transport and communications in promoting socio
economic progress. Accordingly, the Bank's lending to this
secior has been substantialIn Its road projects, the Bank has aimed at provicling low
cost, dependable transpartation facilities to relatively
underdeveloped aroar through rehabilitation and improve
ment of existing facilities, This continued te be the main
thrust of the Bank's activities in 1978. For example, a $27
milllon joan to suppert the Indonesian Government's Road
Betterment Program will finance improvement of about 300
kilometers of the national and provincia! highway network
in Central and East Java and provide urgently needed
bridge facilities to rastore access to certain rural cor
munities experiencing economic hareships due to Sridge
‘al ures.

The Bank also finances projects tor new road consiructhon to facilitate area development, to help integrate the
rural sector Into the total economy and to raise ihe productive capacity and income of the rural population above subsistonce levels. Technical assistance approved in 1978 for
the Marawell Area Roads Development Project in St Lanka
tigured in this category.

Port projects received the major share of the Bank's jer:
ding to the sector in 1978. In general, Bank assistance ‘or
port development has been Gesigned to improve and ex
pand port facilities in DMCs so that increasing volumes of
cargo traffic and trade can be handied, taking into account
the requirements of changing technology In snipping anc
oargo handling

In this perspective, the Bank extended in 1879 a $7
million toan to Fiji to support the renabilitation and
upgrading of wharf facilities at Suva, the country’s largest
port. This will ensure thelr continued usability and allow
thern to accommodate the projected traffic growth over the
medium term, including container traffic,

in addition, a important feature of the Bank's activities
in this sector was the approval of the inter-island Transport
and Telecommunications technical assistance for ihe
Rapublic of Maicives — the first Bank project In that country since it became a member in February 1976

in 1978, four joans totalling $116 milGon were approved in
the Transport and Communications sector, three for ports
projects accounting for 76,5 por cent of the amourt lent,
and the other for a road project. Technica! assistance activities also figured strongly, involving Bank financing of
$1.1 million for seven projects — three for roads, three for
ports and sh'pping, and one for railways.

As of end December 1979, the Bank had made 76 ipans
for 72 projects totalling $1,052 million in this sector. Within
this sector, roads and ports projects recelved the major
share of funding — 545.5 per cent and 30 per cent, respec
tively — foliowed by airports (9 per cent), railways (4.5 per
cent) and telecommunications (1 par cent).

Water Supply and Sewerage

The Bank has been Increasingly involved In this sector
because of the importance of Improved water supply and
sanitation systems to the health and soclo-ecoromic progress of the population, The water anc sewerage systems
of the larger cities In the developing countries of Asia have
deteriorated in recent Gecades because maintenance has
lagged and consumer demand has risen at @ much faster
rate than ihe existing systems could be expanded. in addl

buliding Nood-control dikes.through the Development Finance Corporation of Ceyion,

ion, large-scale population migrations from the countryside to the towns have exacerbated water and sewerage
problems in most DMCs

The Bank has made a significant contribution to impror
ing and expanding water supplies anc reducing tne problems caused by Inadequate and overloaded sewerage
systems which particularly affect the urdan poor. The Bank
has also pald attention to the application of appropriate
technology and service standards in this field, These
aspects of Bank lending were refiected during the year in
three loans for water supply projects in larpe urban areas
end a loan for the preparation of a master plan, feasibility
studies and detailed engineering designs of sewerage
facilities in five large urban anc industrial areas.

These projects were designed in such a way as to ensure
that the operations of the respective authorities in the
weter supply and sewerage sectors would become, over a
pariod of years, financially viable and efficient. To achieve
these objectives, ail five projects financed in 1979 formec
part of, of included ihe pr ‘ation of, long-term master
plans. Appropriate provisions covering tariffs were made to
ensure @ ‘easonabie degree o! project self-financing anc
tuture system expansion. The tarifts tremselves were also
structured in such @ way a8 to facilitate sccess by the poor
to the minimum water supplies ‘or basic health needs.

Five loans totalling $108 million were approved for the
water supply sector in 1979. Total Bank lending for water
supply and sewerage projects as of the end of 1978 reached
$627 million, covering 34 projects in 12 countries.

 

 

Urban Development

The Sank encourages DMCs to adopt a comprenensive
approach to proolerns resulting from the rapic growth of ur
ban areas, and pays particular attention to the needs of tne
poorer segments of urban populations,

Bank operations in this sector emphasize the need for ur
ban development programa to be undertaken on the basis

Seeds ee

of tong-termn master plan studies. For instance, s technica
assistance grant for a study of the integrated urban
developrnent of the Cecca Metropolitan Area in Bangiadesh, approved early in 1978, will lead to the formulation of
@ strategy for tne optimum leve! anc clrection of Dacca’s
future growth.

More than halt of the urban population In most DMCs
reside in slurs, These settiements are characserized Sy
poor senitary services, high poputation censities, substan:
datd and overcrowded dwellings, and inadequate educetlonal and health facilities. The Bandung Urban Development Project In indonesia, approved in 197%, ts designed to
remedy this kind of situation. This project contains “sites
and services", sewerage, ocrainage and solid waste
disposal components which will improve the living environment of part of the city, including areas having the highest
residential density and the poorest sanitary services. These
components form part of a long-term program to cover ine
entire city.

The housing needs of the lowest income groups are met
in various ways. For instance, in the Bandung project, h is
propased to improve existing housing through provision of
services and sites with core houses which can Oe enlarged
later Dy the allottees; and in the Koren Low-Cost Urban
Housing Project, approved by the Bank during the year,
there is provision for iow-coal apartments for rental anc
low-priced houses for sale in instaliments. Cost effec
thveness and use of appropriate technology cetermine the
design and standards of facilities so that they are within
the financtal reach of the target group. The heavy burcen of
housing payments on low-incorne families may Se further
reduced Dy cross subsidization or internal subsidies, as er
visaged in both the Bandung and Korea Housing projects.

The Sank attaches grea! importance to the institutional
aspects of urban Gevelopment. Accordingly. technica’ as
sistance components are incorporated in projects — as in
the case of Bandung Urban Development Project — to im
prove the technical and manageria! capabilities of the localinstitutions responsible ‘or the planning and implementation of future urban projects, and te boost the financial
capabilities of local and city governments.

The Bank has long been Involved in water supply and
seworage projects for urban areas in OMCs, but assistance
for comprehensive urban covelopment started in 1976.
Since than Bank operations in this sector have Sroadened;
in 1978, loans totalling $62 million and $799,000 in technical
istance were provided. Bank jending to this sector at
the end of 1979 totalled $29 million for tour projects.

Education

Education and training systems make an important contribution to all sectors of a country’s economy in terms of
supplying the necessary quantity anc quality of occupethonal silts, The Bank therefore alms to improve the quality
of selected educations! programs which will help augment
manpower resources and upgrade occupational skilis. Em
phasis Is placed on job training! vocational and technical
schools al the secondary level; higher education in certain
selected sclentificttechnological fields (euch as engineeringk anc strongthening technical and vocational teacher
training.

The Bank's education projects have broadened In recent
years, but the emphasis on technical and vocational train
Ing remains. A comprenensive approach Is taken in Bank
assieied education projects, For instance, they provide
consultants for the upgrading of curricula and teaching
materials; student dormitories to ensure that students from
more remote areas can be accommodated at reasonable
costs; staff housing to assist In attracting and retairing
high-quallty staff in competition with industry; and overs0a8 fellowships to Improve key areas such as administraton and training, laboratories, workshops and equipment.

The Bank also recegnizes the relevance of education to
manpower needs and has consistently included, during
project appraisal, studies cf national manpower needs for
projects involving the upgrading of the supply and quality
of educational output. In particular, the Second Vocational
Education Project in Thailand Includes a sector survey to
ansure that the output of trained technicians Is commensurate with the courtry’s manpower cemands. Also, upgrading of technical teacher training has invariably been
built into # project whenever necessary to provide a sound
foundation.

The development of human resources through improved
tecanical and vocational education forms an integral part
of the Bank's growing ro‘e in the region's social develop
ment. The Bank's Increased attention to agriculture and
tural development, expansion of rural employment oppor
tunities anc the establishment of small Industries in rural
Qreas will all call for a corresponding growth in Bank ac
tivities in ihe fields of education and training.

Lending for education projects in 1979 more than doubt
@d to $71 million from $30 million in 1978. The four lean pro
jects approved during the year covered the provinion of
textbook development and printing faciiittes in Pakistan for
Primary anc secondary educational needs, the input of ac
ditional skilts and technica! expertise in Thalland and Pakdsten, teacher training ard improvement of facilities at
polytechnic level In Pakistan and upgrading of facilities at
university level In indonesia. Three technical assistance
grants approved during the year provided the means te

and assisiance in the planning and organizat!on of techn
char training institutions in the Philippines. Cumulative lending to the Education sector at ihe end cf 1979 amounted
to $149 million.

Health

The Bank's involvement in the health sector is relatively
new and necessary reconnaissance surveys were undertaken ouring the year in Nepal, Pakistan, Burma and
Bangladesh, Ouring the year the Bank approved technical
assistance to Nepal for malaria contro! and research ard
training, and to Pakistan for the upgrading of houpitals and
training of paramodical technicians.

in the field of population activities, the approach endorsec by Ine Bank envisages support for family planning programs of OMCs and provides for Incorporation of popula
tion components in Bankfinanced projects In the Health
sector as well as In the other sectors — In particular area
and urban develooment projects (see page 49).

Loan Administration

Efforts continued during the year to streamline the ac
ministration of loans and the supervision of projects. interhal sysioms, procedures and practices were keot under
constant review and necessary changes and improvernents

During 1979, the monitoring and supervision of the pro:
gress of project® were strenginened both in the fled and
within the Bank. In all, 170 oan scministration missions
visited 253 projects during the year, as compared to 136
missions mi 1978. Within the Bank, semi-annual project
foviews were conducted by senior stot! anc Management.
Detailed reviews of progress reports submitted by bor
towers were carried out and senior staf! were alerted on
potential problems or difficulties. A program was initiatec
to prepare mode! Critical Path Method (CPM) natworks for
new projects which will enadle staff to monilot more close
ly the progress of project works. Additionally, quarterly
reports on the outcome anc findings of loan review mip
sions are delng prepared for Boarc Information, The first
suen report covering the fourth quarter of 1979 will be sub
mitted in the first quarter of 1980.

The Bank aisa intensified Its training activities in order to
upgrade the implementation skilis of staf! belonging to pro
jest executing agencies. During the year, the Bank con
ducted six regional seminars: two oF procurement, wo on
project implementation management, one on irrigation
development and management, and one on project imslementation and suparvision for development banks.
Assistance was aiso provided to Thailand anc Insonesia
for organizing and conducting procurement seminars.

Post-Evaluation

Foflowing its establishment in 1976, ihe Post-Evaluation
Office (PEO) corcentrated in 1978 on the formutsticn of
standards and procedures governing the preparation of
Project Performance Audit Aoports (PPARs), PPARs eva

pleted projects indepencentty In terms of their design, im:
plementation and intended objectives. Findings and recom:
mendations cf PPARs are examined by the Bark with s
view to improving Hs fulure operations.

During 1978 FEO circulated to the Boarc two PPARs and
work was substantially completed for three cihers; seven
Post-Evaluation studies wore completed, including threes intensive studies undoriaken by PEO staff and ‘our external
post-eva uations Undertaken by independent outside consultants; @ feport on the review of 19 post-eraiuatian
reports laaued between 1973 and 1978 was substantially
completed; and followup of competed post-evaluation
reports continued

Now that the groundwork for oost-evaiuation activities
has been properly lak and the necessary experience gaired, It is expected that the program of work will achieve
gresier momentum in tuture.

Technical Assistance for DMCs

Ar important slement of the Bank's developmental role
is the provision of technica! aseistance tc OMCs to improve
thelr capanllity to make use of extemal project financing
both from the Bank anc other sources, Technical Assistance grants are financed mainly from the Technical Assis
tance Special Func cf ihe Sank (see page 75); In acdition
the Bank administers technical assistance projects tinanced from other sources such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) ard the European Economic
Community (EEC). \t aiso cooperates with tha Food ang
Agriculture Organization (FAO) on a cost-sharing basis in

 

39providing project preparatory technical assistance in the
agncultural sector.

Although mainty focused on project preparation, the
Bank's technical assistance activities are also clrectec
towards implementation ct development projects in OMCs,
anc to improving the tecnnical, manageria! and organiza.
onal capabilities of OMCs, as well as to establish and
Strengthen the various Covalopment institutionn in those

rice yields on farm land now producing poor crops in cisadvantaged areas. JARI, through its own efforts and in cooperation with rice scientists around [ne worid, has played an
important role in developing improved rice varieties, pfoduction technology and rice-nased cropping systems. The
Institute has beer largely responsible for the so-called
Grean Revolution which has dramatically improvec rice
harvests in developing countries since ine mid-1960s.
These successes, however, have been confined to areas
with good water control and reasonable freedom from
pests and disease. The Green Revolution nae bypassed
termers in disadvantaged areas which arm subject to
floods, drought and adverse soils. As a result, ARI is now
teorienting its research towards tne development of
varieties and production technologies which wit) help In
crease rice yleics in these areas. The Bank's avai
will enable the organization to undertake expanded and intensified research activities in its efforts to reach areas of
low productivity which have yet to Senefit from modern

Bank's Role in Agriculture and Rural Developme

AS a sequel to the Bank's Second Asian Agricultural
Survey (published under the tite “Rural Asia: Challenge
and Opportunity") and in the context of # reassessment of
its rote in agriculture anc rural development, the Board of
Directors decked that the Bank, while ensuring that adeQuate resources will continue to be made avaliable for
other secters, should aim to Increase the absolute lieve! of
ita lending to the agriculture and rural development sector
by 20 per cent each year during the period 1979-1982. The
concemed policy paper identified the following priority
areas for Bank action in its future operations:

1, Providing More and Better Employment for tne Rural

Workforce

Agricultural intensification; The Bank should systema
‘ically support efforts at intensification of land use through
multiple cropping by irrigation, agricultural extension and
Credit services, more research: on raln-fod crops, reduction
of post-harvest joss of agricultural procucts and dives
sification into livestock and tisheries enterprises,

Rural-Basec Industries and Services: The Bank should
continue to assist DMCs in efforts to cevalop rural Industries and services through resource surveys, support ‘or
Non-agricultural vocational training, and financing of agro
Processing indus:rias and rural industries and off-tatm pro
Guction and service activities.

Labor-intensive Construction ang Aural Work The
Bank should endeavor to Increase the employment impact
of construction activities in Bank-assisted projects. in this
Context, ihe Sank should also examine the possibility of
financing labor-intensive rural work schemes as complete

Stevie
sebaiee
im
Ge

 

projects, possibiy in cooperation with othar donors (for ex.
ample, the World Food Frogram).

2. Improving Production and Distribution Systems for

Rural Products

Rural Infrastructure: +The Bank should continue its support for investment in Wrigaticn, drainage, flood control,
land consotidetion and erosion control. It should also sup
Port feecer road networks and sites and services for rural
Industry, as well as the enlargenent of support services
such as extension, input supply, credit, storage, process
Ing, marketing and training.

Research and Extension for Rural Development: The
Bank should continue its suppor: for agricultural research,
Particularly in the form of acaptive research at local level
and in association with extension services to ensure
transmittal of research results to the farm jevel. Particular
attention shoald be paid to rainfed farming, to hitherto
Neglected crops, and to the integration cf crop anc livestock farming. Greater attention should also be given in
tural development projects for extension services, for acthvities of rural women, for promotion of rural industries
@nd enterprises, and for health, nutrition and tamliy plan
ring

3. Training Managers for Rural Cavelopment Programs

The Bank should assist OMCs In designing a systematic
approach 19 meeting their requirements for trained manPower for agriculture and rural development and in meeting
the crucial demand for trained manpower through training
Projects and the incorporation of tralning components in
agricultural end rural development projects.

4. Protecting Vital Eoceystems

The Bark should provide assistance, possibly in
cooperation with other international agencies, for the
Preparation in DMCs of long-term plane tor the efficient
Maintenance of the capacity of lanc and inland waterfesources to yleld energy imainly as food, wood-fuel and
hydropower} on @ sustained basis. The Bank should give
particular attention in its agriculture and rural development
operations to maintaining the protective function of forest
cover on critica’ warersnecs.

5, implementation and Monitoring of Bank Projects

The Bank anculd support des tadie agrarian reforms and
participate more actively in dialogues on such refarms with
OMC Governments and in larger donor groups. In itt
plemacting hs agricultural enc rural development orojects,
the Bank should make Use of existing agencids and instity
tions and should make systematic ettorts to increase their
implementing and project absorptive capacity through oro
vision of consultants and training,

The establishment of cata systems in tne form of pre
project Deseling surveys and subsequent periodical moniforing (6 essential for post-evaluation of complex
agriculture and rural development projects and for to
viding guidance to the Bank in this area

 

Program Lending for the Agriculture and Rural
Development Sector

In August, the Bank cecioed to extenc srogram loans for
agriculture and rura! development within the policies and
provedures on program lending as cefined In Fedruary
1976, subject to the following additional considerations
that (i) th programs are unce en in @ situation of ex
lating under-utilizec capacity arising from shorteges of
foreign exchange for the importation of essential raw
materials, spare parts and balancing ecuigment; (i) such
lending would mainly enable import financing of recurrent
production inputs for @ period not exceeding five years; (11)
ectelerated procurement, including acvance procurement
woule be allowed with 8 view to advancing by one crop
season the commarcement of the program; and (iv) the
country concemed would De eligible to receive similar pro

   

  

 

CONSULTANTS hold 4

gram loans in subsequent years for other areas not already
covered Dy such lending.

Bank Operations In the Fisheries Sector

in the light of the Bank's activities in the fisnerias sector
covering over a decade anc the growing interest on the part
of OMCs In fisheries cavelopment, the Bank prepared s
paper reviewing ite experiance — a paper which will serve
83 @ guide for tne Bank and will provide information to

Ce and outsice agencies.

The various issues which are expected to infivence
future Bank sssistance in fisheries development include
the need for exploiting newly scquived resources under extended Jur sdiction; resource availablity and manage nent;
the relative importance of aquaculture and inland fisneries;
appropriaie technology, emali-scals as compared ia con
morcia! fisheries; post-harvest technology; tre role of loow
institutions; fisheries training and research; tisheries work:
shops and seminars; and procurement anc local cost finan
cing.

The principal elements of the Bank's ‘rarnework for
assistance to tha fisheries sector are: ()j in terms of sectoral emphasis, marine (coastal and offshore) tisheries projects will remain the major recipients of Bank ass/stance
with priority given to small-scale fisheries, However, aque
culture ard intand fishenes projects will also receive
special attention; (i) fisheries resource assessment and
management should be an important area of Bank interest,
end Bank funds should be proviced to support national
governments as well 5 existing regional anc subregicna
fisheries institutions; (if) tisheries projects with ecucation,
training and research a8 major components anould also
receive special attention in the Bank's future activities and
tha Bank should support such promotional activities as
fegiona! seminarsiworksnops om topics of special! rele
vance to fisheries in tne OMCs; ard (iv) the Bank wil! con

Population Activities

Concern over the adverse effecis of rapid population
growth on economic and social Geveiopmant has led many
DMCs te Incorporate population policies into thelr nations
cevelopment plans and to promote family planning. The
Bank recognizes that population aspects Nave a vital bearing on the achievement of OMCs" development objectives.
in the past, the Bank's Involvement in the population act
vities of its OMCs was limited to including family planning
components in a fow rural development projects. In Sep
tember 1978, the Board of Directors examined this Meld of
development activity in order to evolve a systematic
4pproach to assist DMCs in thelr population programs.

As @ result, Bank projects in other sectors — particularly
public health — will, as far as possible, incorporate popula
tion and/or family planning componerts as well as provide
Assistance for population projects per se. The Bank's
assistance will not only Include conventional laments (6.9
the construction of clinics and provision of equipment and
supplies) but also log'stical support, institutions’ sirengitening, extension services, etc

As a large number of multilateral, bilatera! and private
Gonor agencies provide assistance for OMC population pro
grams, the Bank recognizes that interaction and coordina
tion with these agencies is necessary and that, in practice,
Bank financing tor such programe can complement or sup
Plement financing avaliab’e from other sources.

Co-Financing

During the year, the Bank reviewed Its co-financing
policies and practices In the light of ine experience gained
in the past and the prospects of increased co financing in
the future. It was decided that in order to foster economic
growth and investment in the region and enhe tie bry
pact of Its operations, the Bank should play an active role
in encouraging co-financing with all sources, Including the
private sector.

While co-financing with official sources has bean, and
wilt continue to be, predaminant, the Bank looks towaré
diversifying its co-financing sources Dy entering into more
co-financing with export credit and private sources. Taking
into account the terms of financing of various sources and
ihe debt service capacity of DMCs, the Bank wiil consider
co-financing with private sources mainly for projecta in the
middle-income CMCs (I.¢. those naving @ per capita GNP in
1976 of over $250) and also for selected projects in ihe low:
income DMCs (1.4. those having a per capita GNP in 1976 of
$250 and below).

To promote co-financing, the Bans will expand its techialcal assistance operations to cater 10 the needs of the Bank
itsel! as well as potential co-linanciers. Moreover, ine Ban
will communicate and consult, on @ regular basis, with
potential co-financiers in order to acquaint tnem with it~
vestment opporturities in the ragion and help tharn identity
co-financing possibilities with ihe Bank. tn this connection,
@ focal palnt was established in the Country Department,
with the responsibility of coordinating the Bank's oo
financing activities and liaising with various co-financlers.

Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency
Expenditures on Projects

in February 1979, the Gank reviewed Its polity on local
eos: financing which wes introcuced in 1974. The review
confirmed certain general principles, formulated on cour+
try considerations. in Getermining the need and justifica
tion for such financing. The application of trese principles
would Quality the least Gevelopec momber countries and
those most seriously affected by recent world economic
developments. The relatively advanced OMCs may also get
such assistance although in their case It would be small in
amount and limited to certain types of projects. Projects
suitable for iocal cost financing by the Bank would incluge
those with high social value, low foreign exchange corm
ponents and relatively senal! foreign exchange earning
capacity

With the expected Increase in the number of projects
sultaDie for local cost financing, especially under Special
Funds ooerations, it was decided to raise the ceiling on tne
amount of loca! cost fivancing that could be provided from
Special Funds from 10 per cert to 18 per cent of the toral
annual iending from that source. The current ceiling of &
per cent for ‘oca! cost financing on ordinary operations will
remain unchangec

 

  
 

 

 

  

Use of Consultants

Following the cornpietion of the review of the Guidelines
on the Use of Consultants in 1978, revised guidstines wore
adopted during the year, The new guidelines encourage to a
larger axtent tte use of domestic consultants anc con
suitanis from oiner developing countries Inrough, among
others, collaboration arrangements with consultants from
developed member countries. Furihermore, procedures for
selection of individua! consu'tants #3 well as emptasis on
expeditious recruitment of consultants through early cor
pletion of preparatory work and advance issuance of invite
tions for proposais in exceptional cases have been incor
porated in the new guidelines, Also, borrowers may, il they
oreler 16 invite price proposa's together with technical pro
posals, adopt the twoonvelope system.

 

DFi Disbursement Scheme

During the year, stuciies were conducted on measures to
alleviate tre burdens on OF] sub-borowers arising from
t ations in toreign exchange rates and to equalize
these risks among them as far as possidie. The magnitude
of exchange risk burdens depends on the mix of currencies
tecelved by sub-borrowers anc the changes in relative
values of the currencies over the lifetime of tne loan
Several considerations determine ine currency mix usec by
the Bank for disbursements, among which are avoicance of
exchange risks for the Bank in concucting its operations.
ihe Bank's own ced! service requirements and yields. in re
cent years, the shares of hard currencies in the Bank's
Cisbursements or icans from ordinary capita! resources
have risen and exchange losses have been incurred by DFi
sub-borrowers on repayments made. In addition, ovutstand

The DFi sub-borrower has perhaps been affected more
than the borrowers of tha normal project loans from the
Bank. The majority of DF) icans are lor smal! arrounts and
ate disbursed in one of two transactions, laading to concentrations in currency mix. Changes In availability of currencies for disbursornents have jec to different currency
mixes for sub-borrower oven of the same DF! so that cedt
nervice burdens are unevenly spread between borrowers.

A proposal to mitigate the problem, along the lines of
changes in the selection of currencies to be used for
Gisbursement, was clroulated to the Boarc towards the end
of the year. Amang te schemes considered were the use of
@ basket of currencies, each currency with a specitic interest rate. disbursements in the currency of procurement,

ment of tne Asian Development Fund (ADF !1)), which is
designed to provide resources for the Bank's concessional
lending program in the four-year, perlod ending December
1882.

By the and of the year, instruments of Contribution to
ADF |i! of 11 donor countries had bocome effective. With
respect to the first replenishment of ihe Asian Development Fund (ADF Il) the necessary tegisistive action to
enable the United Staten to make available to the Bark ine
last $60 miiiion of Its contribution was stil! awaited.

Ouring the year, the uncommitted partion of Canada’s
contribution to the MultiPurpose Special Fund (MPSF)*
was transferred to ADF, leaving only & sinall balance, re
presenting accumulated net income and otter credit, still
under administration in MPSF, thus oaving the way for the
winding up of MPSF in the course of 1980. Further contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)
wore received during 1979 from seven member countries.

Asian Development Fund
Second Replenishment

In duly 1978, the Board of Governors adopied Resalution
No. 121 authorizing the Bank to receive contributions to the
second replenishment of the Asian Development Fund
(AOF U0 In an aggregate amount equivalert to $2,150 million (at 1 April 1876 exchange rates}. The aggregate
amourt, consisting of a basic replenishment total of $2,000
million plus @ further $150 million ir supplementary contributions, is Intended to cover the Bank's concessional
landing requirements over the four-year period trom 1979 to
1982.

In accordance with the provisions of Resolution No, 121,
ADF lil came into effect on 29 March 1979 when Instruments of Contribution Geposited with the Bank for unQualified contributions surpassed the target figure of
$1,000 million specified in the Resolution. As of the enc of

Under Resolution No, 121, contridutions by Conor countries are required to be made by cepositing with the Bank
unquallfied instruments of Contribution. However, as an
exceptional casa, where an unquailtied commitment can
not be given by a donor country due to Ite legisiative prac

qualification that payment of all installments of its cor
trinution except the first Is subject to budgetary appropriation, but containing an undertaking that It would seek the
necessary budgetary appropriation for the remaining inataliments over the ADF II! replenishment period. This provision was Included in the Resolution to take account of the

Organization

Owing to the increased work load and expanding respon
sibilities of the Bank's administrative staff, the former Administration Department was divided into the Budget, Personnel and Managemert Systems Department (BPMSO}
and the Office of Administrative Sarvices (OAS), effective 1
January 1978.

Broadly speaking, BPMSO fs responsible for ihe management and administration of the Bank's budgetary and
human resources and for the design and assessment cf the
organization and systems within which these resources are
brought together. OAS |s responsibia for bullding operations and serviees; safety and svourity; llalson with ap
propriate agencies of the Pailippine Government for the im
plementation of the Headquarters Agreemert, transporta
tion and commurication services; and general support activities such as procuwement, property control, library, pri
ting and food services. The position of Coordinator of
Special Projects — with responsibility for the identification, assessment, general planning anc overall coordinetion of current and future major projects undertaken by the
Bank — was also established within OAS.

In addition, the position of Adviser, Computer Services,

Slanning and directing the Bank's Computer Program, The
Advisor, Computer Services, or a successor organizational
unit, will also be resporsibie for overall coordination of the
use of information ard data resources for the Bank's operational and administrative functions (see Cornputer Program
section on this page)

Internal Audit

As reported in earlier Annual Reports, the role, powers
and reporting arrangements of the Office of the internal
Auditor (OLA) have been redefined and streamlined, and the
office reorganizad into (a) “Regular Audits Section” and (b)
“Special Aucits Section”. The regular audit activities are
partty based on pre-established checklists, which ensure
that all relevant areas of the Bank's administrative ac
tivities recelw appropriate amount of audit attention
regular intervals, The regular audits are, in principle, of the
“financial audit" type, although efficiency and policy
anpocts raorive an increasing ammount of attention as well
In addition, consultations and cooperation with other Bank
Gepartments and with the Bank's extemal auditors con
stitute significart carts of the activities of the Regular
Audite Section.

The Special Audits Section undertakes in-depth oxamination of particular activities and subjects relating to the
Bank's financial administration, Though many criteria
Setermine the selection of topics for special audits, there
has been @ tendency for special audits to concentrate on
problem areas of the day. The results of each special audit,
comprising findings, analyses, conclusions anc recommen
Cations, are conveyed to Manapoment and departments

    

concerned by separate report, for Information and action
48 appropriate. Currently, coples of such special audit
reports are also conveyed lo the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors, who may review such reports with the
internal Auditor andior representatives of departments com
comed,

Computer Program

Detailed planning for the Bank's computer program
began with the establishment of Computer Services In
January 1979. Concurrently, a senior computer policy group
— the Computer Applications Committoe — was establish:
0 10 guide tne Bank's computer program. At the technical
level, a Computer Program Working Group was constituted
to carry out the detailed work requires for the analysis of information needs ir various functiona! areas of the Bank. It
was decided to adopt 4 centralized, integrated systems approach besed on the premise that date and information on
Bark activities are a major Management and operations
resource which should be used throughout the Bank in a
comprehensive and consistent manner, Duta galhering and
systems studies were initiated during ihe year to analyze
the source documents used, and the outpul reporis
propared, by afl the organizational units of the Bank

These steps will lead to ihe generation of a logical saries
of date bases which will become the repository of the
Bank's informational and data resources. The data bases
will also provide the basis for Cesigning and programming
individual application programs for each functional area.
Action for the acquisition and installation of electronic
data processing (EDP) equipmant anc related systems software is also being initiated in order to obtain the required
computer system at an early date

mediate cata processing needs are being met in such a
manner as not te impede or preempt the centratized cam
puter program.

Otfice Accommodation

During the year the Personne! Division moved into office
apace near ine Bank's Headquarters thus relieving, to «
limites extent, the congestion in ihe Headquarters building.
Early in 1980, a further suostantia’l number of steff are expected to be relocated in additional office space which has
been rented in a Sulicing about 2.6 km. fram tne Bank.
These measures are expected to meet the Bank's re
quiremenis for office space over the next three yours.

Meanwhile, the Philippine Government anc the Bank are
jointly exploring the possibility of constructing anew Head:
quarters bullcing in the proposed Financial Center on the
Manita Bay Reclamation Arsa. This new dullding woule be
planned te meet the Bank's teta! requirements for office
space and anciliary facilities up to the year 2000. In view of
this development, It was dacided not to proceed with pans
tor ine construction of an annex to the existing Heacquarters Duliding. The site which ned been mace available
for this purpose will be used on an interim basis for an
automobile service station facility and parking area.

Bullding Safety Survey

The consultants engaged to prepare detailed cesign
specifications, cost estimates and @ schedule for the implementation of required measures for the imarcvement of
safety Conditions in the duilding continued with thelr work
Curing the year. However, in view of ihe possibility of the
Bank being relocated in a new Heacquarters bdulising
within the next few years, it became necessary to review
the scope af improvements to De undertaken in the present
Headquarters bulicing. A reduced prograin of safety improvemonts and an implementation pian to cover only
essential works are being finailzec with ine consultants in
collaboration with the Philippine Government. Meanwhile,
significant improvements have been undertaken anc imClemented by the Bank trom its own tasources.

Staff Housing Scheme

As the Bank's expatriate slalf continues to face the pro
blem cf obtaining sultadie Nousing at reasonable cost, ine
rontal subsidy scheme |s being continued for another year
(see below), Meanwhile, @ scheme for a long-term solution

rate of turnover; while 77 new professional stat! were appointed, $1 terminated their employment with the Bank In

the supporting staff category, 15¢ appointments were
made anc 47 staff resigned.

The annual review of statf salaries anc benefits was corm
Sucted in the second nal! cf the year. The review recognized that to remedy the statfing problems faced oy the Bank
Guring the preceding year, || was necessary lo restore a
Qraater cagrae of competitiveness between the Bank's
compensation and that of other comparadie organizations.
Te meet this objective, tne Boarc of Directors approved
paneral salary Increases for professional statt anc for supparting staft, both effective from 7 August, as well as a
number of improvements in atatt benefits. To recuce the
burden of steeply rising housing rentals, ine Board approw

Bank's renta? assistance program, effective trom 1 July
1973 to 30 September 1990.

Overview

Introduction

ineteen ninety-eight was a difficult and damaging year for
Asia’s economies. Following 1997’s precipitous falls in the
currency and equity markets of the newly industrialized

economies and Southeast Asian countries, toward the end eee
‘ “de Ps = vans
of 1998, currencies generally stabilized and stock markets seams to aig

recovered. However, throughout the Asian and Pacific region economic Program

HEE Project

growth was sharply curtailed, and the economies of several countries,
notably Indonesia, contracted. The social costs of the Asian financial
crisis became evident, and could yet increase further.

Throughout 1998, the Bank devoted much of its energy to responding to Asia’s unhappy and unprecedented circumstances. It liaised closely
with its members, as well as with the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral agencies to develop and
effect the most appropriate responses.

The Bank continued to emphasize its five strategic objectives: promoting
economic growth, reducing poverty, supporting human development, improving the status of women, and protecting the environment. However,
the sharp change in the socioeconomic environment and outlook meant
reconsideration of the ways of realizing the objectives and of the balance
among them. It meant, in particular, more detailed and extensive work
in the areas of financial market regulation and reform, and of governance. In all its activities, the Bank further consolidated its position as an institution that
provides a broad range of services and advice to
its members, not just financial resources, to help
them restore or improve the living standards of
their peoples.

Total lending in 1998 amounted to about
$6 billion for 57 projects, compared with $9.4 billion the previous year when lending had been
boosted by an exceptionally large financial sector program loan of $4 billion to the Republic of
Korea. The financial sector again received the
largest share of lending (nearly $1.7 billion).
Borrowings amounted to $9.6 billion, the largest
ever in one year.

Cofinancing mobilized from all sources
amounted to about $3 billion for 24 projects—
including $950 million for Thailand’s Export

 

 

The Bank's Social Protection Sector Development Program in Indonesia is

Financing Facility—close to 50 percent of the 4g girls) who otherwise would have to drop out of school because of
Bank’s total lending. This level of cofinancing, financial difficulties. When completed, the program will benefit about 1.52 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Children tend to lose in the
competition for diminishing
resources. Often they are
neglected by busy parents trying
to make both ends meet. The
Bank looks after the welfare of
this vulnerable group by
supporting policy reforms to
develop skills and create jobs for
laid-off workers, and improve
children’s access to health,
education, and other basic social

$9.4 billion for 91 loans in 75 projects. This reflects a decrease of 36.4 percent in dollar amount and 24 percent decrease in number of projects. The
decrease in dollar amount is largely a result of the extraordinarily high
lending level in 1997, owing to a single large financial sector program loan
to the Republic of Korea. In 1998, loans from ordinary capital resources
(OCR) decreased by 35.9 percent to about $4.9 billion, while loans from
ADF decreased by 39.1 percent to $987.1 million.

Of the total lending, loans with government guarantee amounted to
$5.8 billion for 51 projects, comprising about $4.9 billion from OCR and
$987.1 million from ADF. Lending to the private sector without government
guarantee amounted to $136.1 million for seven loans.

Equity investments: The Bank approved six equity investments in the
private sector amounting to $62.4 million. The Bank’s equity operations,
which began in 1983,
reached a cumulative total

of $614.7 million.

$163.2 million were approved. This represents a decrease of about 16.5 percent in number and less than 1 percent increase in amount over the
corresponding 1997 figures of 297 projects for $162 million. Of the 248 technical assistance projects, 55 were for project preparation, 131 were advisory
and operational, and 62 were regional. Of the total technical assistance
approvals, $54.7 million came from the Bank’s own resources, $89.2 million
from the Japan Special Fund, and the remaining $19.3 million from other
bilateral and multilateral sources. During the year, the Board approved the
first technical assistance cluster, on a grant basis, amounting to $3.5 million
to the People’s Republic of China for the promotion of clean technology.
Technical assistance components of loans amounted to $201.2 million.

Forty-three loan projects approved in 1998, involving nearly $3.8 billion, resulted from earlier technical assistance. Of this, over $2.9 billion was
from OCR and $825.6 million from ADF.

Total cost of projects

The 57 projects that received loans during the year involved an estimated total project cost of about $11.7 billion. Bank financing of these
projects in loans and equities was about $6 billion or 52 percent of the
cost. Borrowers and governments provided $2.1 billion or 18 percent.
About $3.3 billion or 28 percent was financed through cofinancing from
official and commercial sources, equity sponsors, and domestic financial
institutions. Project beneficiaries and subborrowers provided about
$300 million or 2 percent of the total cost.

Review of country and sector operations

Twenty-one countries and three regional projects received Bank loans in 1998,
compared with 24 countries in 1997. Among these countries, Indonesia received
the largest amount ($1.8 billion or 30.7 percent), followed by People’s Republic
of China ($1.2 billion or 20.1 percent), Philippines ($855.4 million or 14.3 percent),
Thailand ($630 million or
10.5 percent), India ($250 million or 4.2 percent), Bangladesh
($200.3 million or 3.3 percent),
Sri Lanka ($190 million or
3.2 percent), Viet Nam
($184 million or 3.1 percent),
and Uzbekistan ($120 million
or 2 percent). Three regional
projects received $210 million
(3.5 percent). A little over five
percent of Bank loans went to
the following countries: Nepal
($105 million), Kyrgyz Republic
($65 million), Solomon Islands
($26 million), Lao People’s
Democratic Republic ($20 million), Tajikistan ($20 million),

uring 1998, the Board of Directors continued to support

initiatives that built upon the Bank’s assistance rendered

in 1997 to crisis-affected economies—Indonesia, Philippines,

and Thailand, in particular. The focus of this assistance was

to alleviate the plight of the people affected by the Asian

financial crisis through the provision of social safety net facilities and to

restore economic confidence by providing financial assistance aimed at strengthening financial markets and promoting market stability.

The Board also successfully concluded several significant policy and
operational initiatives that are now being implemented.

General operations

The Board met formally on 48 occasions (including executive sessions) and
held 11 seminars and informal discussions during the year. It approved total
lending of nearly $6 billion for 57 projects. This amount represents loans of
about $4.9 billion from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $987.1 million
from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Equity investments totaled
$62.4 million. Government-guaranteed loans were approved for 51 projects.

Twenty-one countries and three regional projects received Bank loans
in 1998, including Tajikistan, which received its first loan, having become
a member earlier in the year.

In addition to loans, the Board, either directly or through the delegated
authority vested in the President by the Board, approved 248 technical
assistance grants totaling $163.2 million.

During its informal meetings, the Board discussed a broad agenda
of items, including the Bank’s Three-Year Rolling Work Program and
Budget Framework (1998-2000), the country operational strategies, and
the ADB Institute.

Policy issues

In 1998, the Board considered and approved a number of major policy
initiatives designed to improve the social and economic impact of Bank
interventions in its developing member countries (DMCs), to allocate more
efficiently scarce Bank resources, and to enhance the internal effectiveness
of the Bank in delivering its services. Certain policies, such as anticorruption, are of particular relevance to the Bank’s efforts to restore confidence
in crisis-affected Asia. This emphasis is highlighted in this year’s theme
chapter “Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity” (pages 15-36).

Board of Directors

The Boards and Their Functions

he Bank is governed by a Board of

Governors, which, at the end of 1998,
consisted of 57 members representing
41 regional and 16 nonregional. Under
Article 28 of the Bank’s Charter, the Board
of Governors is vested with all the powers of
the Bank. In turn, the Governors delegate
their authority to the Board of Directors,
except for certain powers reserved to them
under the Charter.

The Board of Governors meets formally
once a year for the Bank’s Annual Meeting.

The resolutions approved by the
Board of Governors in 1998 and its
membership are shown in Appendixes 1
and 2, respectively.

Also under Article 28, the Board of
Governors elects a 12-member Board of
Directors, eight elected by regional members and four by nonregional members.
Each Director appoints an Alternate. The
President of the Bank is the Chairperson
of the Board of Directors.

The Board of Directors performs its
duties on a full-time basis at the Bank’s
headquarters in Manila, Philippines, and
meets in regular formal and executive
sessions that the President chairs. The
Directors exercise their authority and functions through their quarterly and annual
supervision of the Bank’s financial statements, their annual approval of the Bank's
administrative budget, and their continuous review and approval of policy documents
and all loan, equity, and technical assistance
operations.

Operational policy development

Anticorruption: In July 1998, the Board reaffirmed its broad work on governance issues with the unanimous approval of the Bank’s Anticorruption
Policy. At the broadest level, the policy is intended to reduce the burden
that widespread, systemic corruption exacts on governments and economies
in the region. More specifically, the Bank’s policy is centered on three
objectives: (i) supporting competitive markets, and efficient, effective, accountable, and transparent public administration; (ii) supporting promising
anticorruption efforts on a case-by-case basis and improving the quality of
the Bank’s dialogue with its DMCs; and (iii) ensuring that Bank projects and
staff adhere to the highest ethical standards. A task force has recently been
formed under the direction of Vice-President (East) to oversee the
implementation of the policy.

Cooperation between ADB and nongovernment organizations: In
April 1998, the Board approved an update of its 1987 Policy on Cooperation
with Nongovernment Organizations (NGOs), bringing the Bank’s policy and
practice on NGO cooperation in line with other elements of its current operational and policy environment. The 1998 policy identifies three broad areas of
cooperation in (i) loan and technical assistance activities, (ii) programming and
country-level work, and (iii) policy development work—and outlines a new
policy framework to support NGO cooperation. Cooperation with NGOs in Bank
activities is an important aspect of stakeholder consultation and participation,
and works in parallel with and complements Bank policies such as governance, anticorruption, information dissemination, and inspection.

Gender and development: In June 1998, the Board approved the gender
and development policy to replace its 1985 Policy on the Role of Women in
Development. The new policy operationalizes the Bank’s strategic development objective of improving the status of women by ensuring that gender
considerations are addressed in all Bank activities, including its macroeconomic and sector work. For example, country briefing papers on women will
be prepared as background documents to all country operational strategy studies,
and separate gender strategies will be prepared, indicating how the Bank will
promote its gender and development policy in the respective DMCs. Gender
analysis will be conducted for all Bank projects to ensure that gender concerns
are mainstreamed into all Bank projects. Consistent with the Bank’s defined
role as a broad-based development institution, greater emphasis will be given
to policy reform and capacity building in gender and development areas.

Graduation policy for the Bank’s DMCs: In December 1998, the
Board approved the graduation policy for the Bank’s DMCs. The policy
provides a framework for classifying DMCs according to their levels of
development, and for graduating them across successive country groupings
when they achieve identified graduation criteria. The framework enables
differentiation in operational guidelines across country groups in terms of
(i) degree of eligibility of DMCs for ADF and OCR borrowing; (ii) applicable
ceiling on project cost-sharing; and (iii) norms for government contribution
to technical assistance costs.Indigenous peoples: In April 1998, as a response to the potential
vulnerability of indigenous peoples in the development process, and the need
to ensure that they have opportunities to participate in and benefit equally
from Bank-financed development, the Board approved the policy on indigenous peoples. The policy spells out clear mechanisms for accurate, objective
analysis of the circumstances of indigenous peoples, and ensures that Bank
initiatives are conceived, planned, and implemented with the informed consent
of the affected communities, and include respect for indigenous peoples’
dignity, human rights, and cultural identity.

Review of the loan terms for ADF: In December 1998, the Board
approved the recommendations in the document “Review of the Loan Terms
for the Asian Development Fund” and amended the loan terms as follows:
(i) for project loans, i.e., other than quick-disbursing program loans: 32-year
maturity including an 8-year grace period, 1 percent interest charge per
annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum during the
amortization period, and equal amortization; (ii) for quick-disbursing program loans: 24-year maturity including an 8-year grace period, 1 percent
interest charge per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per
annum during the amortization period, and equal amortization; (iii) the
service charge will be redesignated as an interest charge and will include a
portion to cover administrative expenses and a portion that does not; and
(iv) the redesignation of the service charge and the amended loan terms will
take effect from 1 January 1999 and apply only to new loans.

Institutional development

Membership: In April 1998, the Board of Governors agreed to the membership of Tajikistan, bringing to 57 the number of Bank members. Also in 1998,
the Board of Governors approved Turkmenistan’s application for membership.

Board committees
Audit Committee

The Audit Committee held 20 meetings during 1998. It reviewed the achievements of 1997 and the work programs for 1998 of the Postevaluation Office
(renamed as the Operations Evaluation Office on 12 January 1999) and the
Office of the General Auditor, as well as several topics related to the sound
governance of the Bank and its efficient and effective functioning. Among
these topics were the role and terms of reference of the Audit Committee,
the audit procedures for internal Bank procurement, the Bank’s loan-loss
provisioning policies for both ADF and OCR loans, the recently implemented project performance management system and the project performance report, and year 2000 computer issues. The Committee reviewed
eight project performance audit reports, two technical assistance performance audit reports, three impact evaluation studies, and four special studies
(see box on page 12). To ensure that ADB Institute costs were appropriately

charged against the Institute, it also requested and discussed a review of the
allocation of costs for the Institute.

The Committee reviewed the draft 1997 Financial Statements with the
Bank’s outside auditors (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) and recommended their
approval by the Board of Directors. The Committee discussed the outside
auditors’ achievements in 1997 and their audit plan for 1998.

In its annual report to the Board of Directors for 1997-1998, the
Committee noted the importance of sound financial governance within the
Bank; and in this context, it recommended that the Chairperson of the
Board of Directors initiate an update of the terms of reference of the Audit
Committee of the Board for final approval by the Board of Directors. The
Committee highlighted the need for continuous objective monitoring and
evaluation of the Bank’s portfolio performance, and requested that the
funding and approval procedures for Postevaluation Office activities be reviewed
to ensure its independence in selecting and funding appropriate evaluations.

Budget Review Committee

The Budget Review Committee was convened in November 1998 to
review the Bank’s operations during the year and Management’s budget
proposal for 1999. It discussed the work achievements for 1998, and the
work plans for 1999 of the Bank’s departments and offices, including
those of the ADB Institute.

The Committee noted the Bank’s response to the Asian financial crisis
and approval of a large amount of loans to crisis-ridden countries, and
welcomed assurances that the Bank would focus more attention on the
adverse impact of the crisis on social sectors and the provision of necessary
safety nets. The Committee recommended that the Bank initiate a study in
1999 to examine the budget and organizational implications of the Bank’s
response to the crisis and lessons to be learned from it. To protect against
a recurrence of such a crisis, the Committee recommended that the Bank
devote more attention to corporate governance issues, and noted that the
Bank may need to recruit commercial and investment bankers for possible future activities in restructuring banks. The Committee noted the
Bank’s initiatives in providing assistance for regional economic monitoring; however, it recommended that the Bank regularly review the use of
its internal resources for this function.

The Committee reviewed the initiatives taken by the Bank to implement all policies approved by the Board. It especially noted the initiatives
to promote regional cooperation on anticorruption efforts, as well as to
mainstream and publicize the Anticorruption Policy within the Bank and
provide budgetary resources to implement the policy, including in-house
training seminars. The Committee recommended that the Bank discuss these
policies with government officials during country programming exercises.

The Committee noted the Bank’s continuous efforts to support sustainable economic development in its DMCs and acknowledged the Bank’s efforts
to make prudent use of its resources and exercise budgetary discipline. It
reviewed the efforts made to spring-clean the Bank’s loan portfolios, and
recommended that this be an ongoing process to generate savings from both
OCR and ADF loans. The Committee cautioned against overprogramming,and urged the Bank to set realistic performance-based lending levels consistent
with available resources. It also stressed the need for greater prioritization of
the Bank’s technical assistance activities. The Committee noted that the
Bank had developed a strategy for enhancing staff productivity, and had acted
on poor staff performance through involuntary separation of 25 professional
staff. At the same time, the Committee welcomed Management's proposal to
augment the Bank’s operational capacity by creating 15 new professional staff
positions and redeploying 14 professional staff positions to its operations
departments. The Committee noted that certain professional staff benefits
would be rationalized effective 1 January 1999, and looked forward to a
comprehensive review of the professional staff compensation package. It
recommended that the Bank initiate a risk analysis of its staff retirement plan.

Finally, the Committee recommended that the Board approve the proposed administrative budget for 1999, authorizing an expenditure of $207 million (Appendix 8). The Committee noted that this budget, which includes a
contingency of | percent, represents an increase of 2.4 percent over the 1998
revised estimate, which is the lowest nominal budget growth in the Bank’s
history. This administrative budget would support $7.8 billion for lending,
including private sector operations, $162 million for technical assistance operations, and $3.4 million for cofinancing programs in 1999, with an increase
of 15 new professional staff positions.

Inspection Committee

In 1998, the Committee discussed its first request for review of a project,
received in 1997, and decided in this instance that the request was not
eligible for inspection.

As stipulated in the Board
paper on the inspection policy,
a review of the operations of
the Inspection Committee and
related inspection procedures,
as well as consideration of their
application to the Bank’s private sector operations, was
started in 1998 for completion
in the first quarter of 1999,

Directors’ visits

The Board of Directors undertook two group visits in 1998: the first to the
Maldives and Pakistan from 21 February to 8 March; and the second to
Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal from 23 August to 5 September. Such annual
visits enable Board members to gain greater understanding of the development experience and needs not only of the DMC visited but, more generally,
also of the region as a whole, and to become better acquainted with the Bank’s
activities in its DMCs. In all countries visited, the Board had wide-ranging
policy discussions with government ministers and officials, business representatives, women’s associations, and NGOs, and took the opportunity to visit
the sites of Bank-financed projects. In the case of the Bangladesh visit, the
Board members were able to observe firsthand the devastation of the September
1998 floods. The Board delegation offered to support a request for emergency
Bank assistance, which was approved in December 1998.

n Pakistan, the Board delegation had the honor of meeting the President,
His Excellency Rafiq Tarar; the then Minister of Finance and Economic
Affairs, Honorable Sartaj Aziz; and other key officials of the Government.

Governance in Asia:
From Crisis to Opportunity

“At the core of our dark experience lies the ugly truth that there was an
absence of transparency, accountability, public interest, and public
responsibility.”!

ssues of governance are at the center of many of the most pressing
challenges confronting countries throughout the Asian and Pacific
region today. In East” and Southeast Asia,’ the need for greater transparency and accountability in regulating the financial sector has been
one of the key problems behind the currency turmoil, corporate bankruptcies, and falling stock markets that have plagued the region since July
1997. In South Asia,* issues of restricting the reach of state intervention and
improving the delivery of basic services, such as health care and education,
are high on the agenda. Economies in transition in Central? and Southeast
Asia are grappling with redefining the role of the state, shifting the balance
between central and local power, and providing civil service employees with
appropriate skills for managing a market economy. In the Pacific,® issues of
public sector efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability are particularly
important for ensuring the long-term viability of small economies.

Each nation’s path to good governance is different, depending on culture, geography, political and administrative traditions, economic conditions, and many other factors. The scope of activities allocated to the public
and private sectors diverges markedly. Variation in scale is also enormous.
Many of the institutions and practices that work effectively in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC), with its 1.2 billion people, will not be relevant
in Nauru, with its population of 10,000.

Yet governments share many features. They face similar responsibilities
in that they need to establish a basic policy framework, provide critical goods
and services, protect and administer the rule of law, and advance social
equity. In executing these responsibilities, they need to perform a variety of
similar tasks, such as organizing themselves to formulate and coordinate

Box 1. Does Governance Matter?
Empirical Evidence from Japanese
Foreign Direct Investment Flows

Ao examining the locational determinants of Japanese foreign direct
investment shows that the quality of governance in a country has a significant impact
on the decision of Japanese private firms on
whether to make investments in the country. Other factors are shown to exert an
influence on this decision, namely, the
exchange rate, wage rate, size of the local
market, inflation, quality and depth of
infrastructure (as proxied by the level of
electricity generation per person), availability of skilled labor (as measured by the
enrollment rate for secondary education),
and presence of Japanese firms in the country. The authors use a conditional logit model
to establish statistically that all these factors (including the quality of governance)
affect the probability that Japanese firms
will opt to locate facilities in a country.
The quality of governance was constructed from a weighted average of five
indicators with values that were derived from
responses of businessmen to structured surveys: government repudiation of contracts,
risk of expropriation, corruption, law and
order tradition, and bureaucratic quality.
The authors also show that governance
plays a relatively more important role in the
decision in sectors that are more capital- and
technology-intensive. This is consistent with
the theory that weak rule of law discourages
investments that include large sunk costs.

specific policies, and mobilizing human and financial resources to implement
their decisions. They need to focus on core public tasks. They need proper
incentives to perform these tasks as efficiently and effectively as possible
in a responsive, transparent, and predictable fashion, and with clear
strategic focus and appropriate participation. They need to confront
corruption from the highest level.

The Bank’s approach to helping its developing member countries (DMCs)
improve governance practices, which was codified in the August 1995 Board
paper, Governance: Sound Development Management, has sought to overcome problems of diversity by articulating a set of basic principles to be
advanced in a wide variety of settings. This approach builds on the recommendations of the Bank’s task force on improving project quality to ensure
that Bank projects help build sustainable public sector capacity in DMCs.’
The July 1998 Board-approved Anticorruption Policy shows further deepening
of the Bank’s thinking in the governance area.

This chapter provides an overview of the Bank’s thinking on good
governance and capacity building, gives examples of how these ideas have
been put to use in helping DMCs carry out governance reforms, and concludes
with some thoughts on the next steps.

What is governance?

Governance is a simple concept at heart: good governance is good government. The concept relates to the quality of the relationship between government and the citizens whom it exists to serve and protect. The Bank defines
governance as the manner in which power is exercised in the management
of a country’s social and economic resources for development. Put more
simply, governance means the way those with power use that power. Governance has, therefore, political and economic dimensions. Issues of political
governance include the mechanisms by which the public’s political preferences are ascertained and leaders chosen. These are fundamental governance
concerns, but are generally outside the scope of the Bank’s work. But economic governance—sound development management—is at the core of sustainable development. This is supported by empirical evidence (Box 1) that
the quality of governance has a significant impact on investment and growth.

The instrumental nature of governance implies that the four governance
“pillars” (summarized in Box 2) are universally applicable regardless of the economic orientation, strategic priorities, or policy choices of the government in
question. However, their application must be country-specific and solidly grounded
in the economic, social, and administrative capacity realities of the country.

Also, while it would be misleading to identify key problems and suggest
solutions without first conducting detailed assessments of the governance
landscape in each country, it is possible to illustrate the general governance

he four key components of governance
are accountabilty, transparency, predictability, and participation.
Accountability is the capacity to call
officials to account for their actions. Effective accountability has two components:
“answerability” and consequences. “Answerability” is the requirement to respond periodically to questions concerning one’s official
actions. There is also a need for predictable
and meaningful consequences, without
which accountability is only a timeconsuming formality. In addition, both internal (administrative) and external
accountability are needed. Particularly with
the dramatic improvements in information
and communication technology, external
accountability through feedback from service users and the citizenry can now be
obtained at low cost and for a greater variety of government activities, and is an
essential adjunct to improving efficiency
and effectiveness of public service delivery.
Transparency entails low-cost access
to relevant information. Reliable and timely

Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity 17

 

economic and financial information is a
must for the public (normally through the
filter of responsible media). It is essential
not only that information be provided, but
also that it be relevant and understandable. (Dumping on the private sector vast
amounts of raw economic information does
not improve transparency.)

Predictability results primarily from laws
and regulations that are clear, known in
advance, and uniformly and effectively
enforced. Lack of predictability makes it
difficult for public officials to plan for the
provision of services (and is an excellent
alibi for nonperformance). Predictability of
government economic actions is also needed
as an indicator on which the private sector
can rely to make its own production, marketing, and investment decisions. Most importantly, to be predictable, the application
of economic regulations must be effective,
fair, and uniform.

Participation is needed to obtain reliable
information and to serve as a reality check
and watchdog for government action. Among

challenge in different types of country circumstances. Although some of the
challenges listed under one type may apply to others, Table 1 (page 18)
suggests priority concerns being addressed in each set of countries. In addition,
challenges such as controlling corruption and improving civil service salaries

cut across most of the region.

Development organizations and governments the world over widely
share the views embodied in the four governance pillars, although each has
its own approach in applying them. This consensus on governance has been
accompanied by recognition of the costs of and damages from corruption,
and the adoption by many international organizations of robust anticorruption measures. For example, in December 1996, the United Nations General
Assembly passed the Declaration Against Corruption and Bribery in
International Commercial Transactions. In December 1997, a landmark
convention against bribery was negotiated under the aegis of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), making bribery of
foreign officials a crime at par with bribery of national officials. Because
corruption is by definition two-sided, this convergence between the emphasis
on combating corruption in the developing countries and the Anti-Bribery
Treaty offers a historic opportunity to reduce drastically the negative impact
of corruption on development. In 1998, the ADB’s Board of Directors approved
the Anticorruption Policy, which is congruent with that of the World Bank

and other regional development banks.

other things, participation by external entities is needed as a spur to government operational efficiency, and feedback by users
of public services is necessary for monitoring access to and quality of the services.
Empirical evidence suggests that a
strong civil society plays a critical role in
advancing good governance.! Improving
formal rules and organizations without any
change in informal customs and ways of
doing business avails little; importing procedures and mechanisms without reference
to the incentive and local capacity framework is likely to be fruitless; interacting
only with central government or, indeed,
only with government, is not conducive to
good implementation of reforms. Above
all, governance intervention should
encourage the formation of social capital,
ie., the stock of trust and information
exchange at the base of civil society.

The role of governance in the Bank’s response
to the Asian financial crisis

“East Asia reeled. The world paused. The Bank acted.”®

The financial crisis that erupted in mid-1997 quickly spread to other Southeast
and East Asian economies. The worldwide repercussions of the crisis required
a coordinated approach. The Bank acted, therefore, in concert with other
organizations and institutions, to introduce fundamental reforms in governance
and the manner of economic management.

Governance-oriented interventions in crisis-affected countries

Bank assistance to the countries worst hit by the crisis—Indonesia, Republic
of Korea, and Thailand—has also focused on governance. In Indonesia, the
centerpiece of Bank assistance is the Financial Governance Reforms: Sector
Development Program loan of $1.5 billion, which supports a major streamlining of the regulatory framework and provides for transparency in the banking subsector and other reforms (Box 3). Fiscal decentralization is being
further encouraged through a Community and Local Government Support
Sector Development Program of $300 million; this is currently at an advanced
stage of preparation. In the Republic of Korea, the Bank provided a $4 billion
Financial Sector Program loan to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)led multilateral assistance package. The loan supports the restructuring of
financial institutions, combined with strengthening regulation and supervision, and with measures to liberalize the capital market and develop it further

for ADB President Mitsuo Sato, Manila, 14 January 1999.(Box 4). In Thailand, two sizeable loans have major governance components. The Financial Markets Reform Program loan of $300 million
underpins fundamental reforms for transparency and accountability in
the financial sector; and the Social Sector Program loan of $500 million
supports, among other things, the administrative decentralization of health
and education services (Box 5).

Governance-oriented assistance to other countries

The years 1997 and 1998 also saw an expansion of Bank activities in countries
in the Asian and Pacific region in various aspects of public institutions and
the public/private interface. Of course, some interventions were under way
well before the onset of the Asian financial crisis, but the crisis gave them
added impetus. Interventions have ranged from corporate governance in the
Kyrgyz Republic to public administration diagnosis in Nepal; civil service
reform strategies in Pakistan; governance reviews for Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam; anticorruption in Indonesia (in conjunction with the Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program
loan); urban governance in the Philippines; public sector interventions in the
Pacific; and more. Some illustrations are provided in Box 6.

Bank assistance to its Pacific DMCs has broadened in scope since the
formulation of the 1996 Strategy for the Pacific: Policies and Programs for
Sustainable Growth. Working in consultation and agreement with governments, the Bank has taken the lead role in the aid community as a catalyst
and facilitator of policy reform and capacity building in development
management, while retaining the traditional role of project financier.
Economic reform programs in seven Pacific DMCs (Cook Islands, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon Islands,
and Vanuatu) have been undertaken with Bank technical and financial
assistance during 1996-1998.

These programs aim at generating sustainable economic growth through
the creation of a leaner, more efficient public sector, and a better enabling
environment for the private sector. Program effectiveness in improving governance and the economic policy framework is expected, in turn, to increase
the effectiveness of project-based and sector-specific lending. To improve
Bank interventions in the Pacific DMCs, the Bank established an interdepartmental task force to review the design, implementation, and impact of
its program loans and associated policy reforms. Lessons learned from the
review will influence Bank assistance, especially to the Pacific DMCs, in the
fields of policy reform and governance.

There is no doubt that in 1999 and beyond, both the geographic coverage
and the scope of Bank financial and technical assistance for governance and
public management (including anticorruption) will widen even further.

Interventions beyond the crisis
Nineteen ninety-eight was a landmark and eventful year in many ways

beyond the crisis. The Bank’s Board of Directors approved policies that
essentially complete the policy framework for governance and public

Reforms in Indonesia

he Asian financial crisis had a

major impact on Indonesia, with the
rupiah depreciating more than 70 percent
against the US dollar since July 1997. This
depreciation has adversely affected the
economy and there is an urgent need to
restore confidence through financial governance reforms. The Government is now implementing a program of policies and institutional
measures to strengthen governance in the
financial and corporate sectors and in the area
of public sector financial management.

The Bank approved on 25 June 1998 a
total of $1.5 billion to Indonesia for the
Financial Governance Reforms: Sector
Development Program. The overall objective of the program is to improve the
governance of the financial and public
sectors resource allocation through
(i) adoption of good practices in financial
governance, (ii) increased disclosure and
transparency of financial information, and
(iii) strengthened legal and regulatory
frameworks of the financial sector. The
goal is to build up credible financial institutions and prudent regulation that will help
restore investment flows.

The program involves assessing the
financial status and, where feasible, restructuring of existing banks; strengthening the
supervisory capacity of Bank Indonesia; rationalizing the supervision and regulation
of nonbank financial institutions, and the
legal and regulatory environment to facilitate debt recovery and structural adjustment;
improving accountability and transparency
in both the public and private sectors; implementing anticorruption and antimoney
laundering measures; improving fiscal
management; strengthening the Capital
Market Supervisory Agency; and establishing a secondary mortgage facility. The
program—which is being coordinated with
the overall ADB/International Monetary
Fund/World Bank policy package—will be
supplemented with support to specific
financial institutions, and capacity-building
assistance to sector institutions.20 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

Box 4. Financial and Corporate Sector Reforms and Governance in the Republic of Korea

n December 1997, an International

Monetary Fund (IMF)-led assistance
package of $58 billion was provided to
the Republic of Korea to tackle an immediate balance-of-payments crisis, as well
as address the more fundamental issues in
the financial and corporate sectors. The
package included a $4 billion Financial
Sector Program loan (FSPL) from ADB.
The FSPL contributed to the initiation of
reform measures designed to address four
issues: (i) restructuring financial institutions,
(ii) recapitalizing financial institutions,
(iii) strengthening prudential regulation
and supervision, and (iv) capital market liberalization and development. The
goal is to establish transparent, arms’ length
relationships among the Government, the
banks, and the conglomerates, and thus
restore investor confidence in the economy
of the Republic of Korea.

 

While resolution of nonperforming
loans and recapitalization of financial
institutions have been the immediate
concerns of the Government and external
funding agencies, the institutionalization
of sound business practices has been
emphasized equally to ensure sustainability of the reforms over the long term.
The FSPL emphasized improving governance standards in the financial sector, including strengthening prudential
regulation and supervision.

The large volume of nonperforming
loans in the financial sector is closely
linked to the structural problems in
the corporate sector. The widespread
excess capacities in the country’s industry sector reflect the previous questionable business decisions of the large
conglomerates (chaebols). Lasting solutions to the economic crisis and the

financial sector problems cannot be
realized unless the corporate sector is
significantly restructured.

As part of the IMF-led assistance package, the Government initiated several measures to rectify weaknesses in corporate governance. The Government has now made
compulsory the appointment of outside directors to the boards of listed companies. It
has passed a law prohibiting companies
from issuing new cross-guarantees, and
requiring all such existing guarantees to
be terminated by April 2000. Financial
institutions are now required by the
Financial Supervisory Commission to provide quarterly reports on their holdings
of cross-guarantees. The Government has
also announced that, beginning in 1999,
financial statements of companies will be
prepared and audited in accordance with
international standards and practices.

management. The Bank intensified its efforts at disseminating the lessons of international experience in public management and—most important for the future of the Bank as a broad-based development
institution—managed to strengthen internal capacity significantly. In
the process, partnerships with other multilateral finance institutions (particularly IMF and the World Bank) have become even closer, because
an enhanced ADB role in governance is intended to lead to greater
development impact of all external assistance to this vast and extraordinarily varied region. Policy framework, disseminating the lessons of
experience, and enhancing the Bank’s capacity for governance work—
the key building blocks for an enhanced Bank role in governance and
public management—are reviewed briefly below.

Policy framework

The Bank’s 1995 governance policy provided a sound basis for its future
work. This work was carried forward through the adoption of policies that
gave tangible content to the principles embodied in the governance framework. Directly related to governance and public management, Board papers
were prepared on participatory development and anticorruption, !° and elements of good governance were increasingly reflected in other Board policies
on crosscutting issues, such as indigenous peoples, and gender and development. Governance issues have also started to permeate traditional sector

$500 million Social Sector Program

loan in Thailand is part of the Bank’s
$1.2 billion contribution to the $17.2 billion IMF-led rescue package. The loan and
the related $2.1 million technical assistance
grant take a dual approach to (i) mitigate
the short-term social impact of the crisis
and (ii) implement structural reforms to
increase economic competitiveness in
Thailand and to bring governance systems
in line with the country’s 1997 Constitution.
To mitigate the social impact of the crisis,
creative partnerships are being built between
the Government and civil society to maintain
access to health, education, and nutrition.

Structural reforms are being undertaken in health and education, and in labor
market policies. For example, health
financing reforms being considered include
capping the civil service medical benefits

system, streamlining the Social Security
and Workmen’s Compensation systems, improving the targeting of the Low-Income
Card Scheme, and increasing insurance
coverage for the unemployed. Long-term
health reforms will include better integration of curative, preventive, and educational activities; increasing the role of
provinces, districts, and communities in
public health care provision; and corporatizing a public sector hospital. The redeployment of health personnel will also
require many changes in the administrative and incentive structures of the Ministry
of Public Health.

Educational management and finaneing reforms will include explicit operational
plans for decentralizing four functional
areas: (i) education policy and planning,
(ii) budget and procurement management,

Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity 21

 

(iii) personnel systems, and (iv) curriculum
development and planning. Reforms are
being designed to increase autonomy for
vocational training institutions and universities, introduce a new personnel management system for school teachers
outside the civil service personnel structures, issue a clear statement on the role
of the Government vis-A-vis the private
sector in the education sector, and
downsize the Ministry of Education
administrative staff by 25 percent.

In labor markets and welfare, there
will be better targeting of poverty programs
by linking budget allocations explicitly to
poverty incidence. In addition, there is a
rethinking of the legal framework, organization, and coordination practices of all
agencies dealing with welfare, labor, and
training issues.

work, as demonstrated in the policies currently being developed for integrated
water management, urban development, health, nutrition, and education.

Law and development: The Bank’s law and development activities
promote legal reforms,!! building on empirical findings that a policy, legal,
and regulatory environment, which secures property rights and enforces
contracts, is supportive of economic growth and poverty reduction.!? Although
law and development activities have a general focus on the development of
legal and regulatory frameworks that support private sector development
(Box 7), they take into account the need for “ethnically conscious interventions into the market” with a view to spreading market-generated wealth."

Participation: People are at the heart of development; they are not only
the ultimate beneficiaries, but are also the agents of development. Since
development is both for and by the people, they need to have access to the
institutions that promote it. Participation, as a component of the Bank’s
governance policy, implies that people will have the opportunity to improve
the design and implementation of public programs and projects.

ndia: Gujarat Public Sector Resource

Management Program (in combination
with technical assistance for reforming
public finances and restructuring stateowned enterprises [SOEs])

The State of Gujarat in India faces
wide-ranging structural challenges in the
public finance area because of stagnation
in resource mobilization, weak fiscal
management, growing inefficiency of SOEs,
and lack of support for efficient infrastructure. The Bank’s program loan of $250 million, approved in 1996 as the first
subnational operation in India, supports
the Government of Gujarat in augmenting
domestic resource mobilization, improving the allocation and efficiency of public
resources, and reducing the Government's
role in commercial activities while promoting market-oriented policies to enhance
private sector participation in physical
infrastructure. To support the program loan,
the Bank provided technical assistance to
strengthen institutional capacities for budget policy, planning, and modernizing tax
administration to improve transparency and
accountability. An additional technical
assistance of $600,000 approved in 1996—
Restructuring Program for State-Owned

Enterprises in Gujarat—is aimed at
strengthening the technical secretariat
charged with restructuring the SOEs.

Kyrgyz Republic: Corporate Governance and
Enterprise Reform Program Loan
Subsidized government loans to private and public enterprises caused a huge
drain on the Kyrgyz Republic’s budget.
Inefficiencies in insolvency procedures
allow nonviable enterprises to operate, and
lack of regulatory sanctions means that
management of many enterprises functions improperly. The Bank’s Corporate
Governance and Enterprise Reform
Program loan of $40 million, approved in
1997, aims to develop and implement
guidelines to improve corporate governance, including statutory mechanisms
to ensure enforcement. Internal enterprise efficiency will be improved by the
introduction of better management practices, and long-term competitiveness will
be enhanced by requiring enterprises to
seek new financing arrangements on commercial terms, without the benefit of
government guarantees. The legal framework, including the court system, will be
strengthened to expedite liquidation or

restructuring of nonviable enterprises.
Sector capacity building will include a
public information and education project
and will reinforce stakeholders’ rights
and obligations.

Samoa: Financial Sector Program

Improved governance calls for competitive markets with efficient, effective,
accountable, and transparent public sector management. This is the aim of the
Bank’s Financial Sector Program loan of
$7.5 million approved in 1998 to Samoa.
Direct monetary controls, interest rate controls, rigid loan rates and credit growth
ceilings, and the existence of inefficient
SOEs placed constraints on Samoa’s economic development. The Government concluded that this called for comprehensive
financial sector reform. The loan is assisting the Government to implement the
reform program by liberalizing the financial
sector; adopting indirect instruments of
monetary management; enabling Samoa’s
central bank to effectively manage liquidity
through open market operations; strengthening the prudential and regulatory frameworks; and, equally important, privatizing
and corporatizing public utilities.

The Bank’s Framework on Mainstreaming Participatory Development
Processes defines participatory development, notes its importance to the
Bank, and tells how Bank staff, in collaboration with DMC counterparts, can
support it. Additionally, it shows how participatory processes can be systematically incorporated in the Bank’s business processes, and what modifications are required in the Bank’s procedures, policies, and practices to mainstream
participatory development in the Bank’s work. Participatory development as
a key to the Bank’s thinking is elaborated in Box 8.

Anticorruption—a key dimension of the governance agenda: The
Anticorruption Policy deserves special attention, owing to the corrosive
effect of corruption on Asian and Pacific economies, and its central role in
weakening governance institutions that contributed to the Asian financial
crisis. The Board of Directors approved the Bank’s Anticorruption Policy on
2 July 1998, exactly one year after the onset of the crisis (Box 9).

The Bank’s Anticorruption Policy rests on conclusive evidence that
systemic corruption exacts a heavy price from developing economies by, for
example, reducing investment, increasing capital costs, and increasing thetime business executives need to spend negotiating with government
officials.!* It is fully compatible with the policies of other multilateral financial
institutions, including those of the World Bank,! and is complemented by
the OECD Anti-Bribery Treaty that took effect in December 1998. The
Treaty, among other things, makes bribery of foreign officials a crime at par
with bribery of national officials, and is thus a fundamental advance over
earlier practices. Thus, for the first time in contemporary history, this convergence of policies and circumstances offers the opportunity to effectively
combat corruption at both public and private levels, and to substantially
reduce its burden on the peoples of the Asian and Pacific region.

Corruption can be defined briefly as the use of public or private office
for personal gain. Samples of corrupt activities of greatest interest to the
Bank include

¢ design or selection of uneconomical projects because of opportunities for kickbacks and patronage;

* procurement fraud;

¢ illicit payments to government officials to facilitate access to goods,
services, or information to which the public is not entitled, to deny
the public access to goods and services to which it is legally entitled, or to prevent the application of rules and regulations in a
fair and consistent manner;

© misappropriation of confidential information for personal gain,
such as using knowledge about public transportation routings to
invest in real estate that is likely to appreciate;

¢ deliberate disclosure of false or misleading information on the
financial status of corporations;

¢ theft or embezzlement of public property and monies;

* ~ sale of official posts or promotions, or nepotism; and

* extortion and the abuse of public office, such as using the threat
of a tax audit or legal sanctions to extract personal favors.

Experience demonstrates that significant progress can be made in the
struggle against corruption if the proper legal, institutional, and policy frameworks are in place. The Bank’s policy is “zero tolerance.”

The first objective is convergent with the public sector management
agenda, consisting of actions to make markets competitive and supporting
improvements in public administration. For example, strengthening audit
functions can improve resource allocation while making embezzlement more
easily detected; instituting procurement reform can reduce costs while making
fraud more difficult to perpetrate; improving procedures for recruitment and
promotion can build capacity while helping reduce patronage and nepotism;
and, most importantly, streamlining regulations can improve public management while reducing opportunities for corruption.

In pursuing the second objective, Bank assistance will be guided by
three considerations: (i) the nature of the country request, (ii) the consistency

Box 7. Bank Activities in
Law and Development

I n 1997 and 1998, the Bank’s law and development activities supported operations
in almost all areas, such as energy regulation, promotion of participation in agriculture
and forestry, reform of banking and capital
market laws, and strengthening of bankruptcy and liquidation regulation.

Apart from the legal components of
sector loan and technical assistance operations, the Bank’s law and development
activities comprise specific law-related technical assistance projects, which increasingly
focus on issues facing its developing member countries’ legal systems as a whole.

The creation of in-country capacity for
continuing legal education is an important
feature of the Bank’s law and development
activities. In the transitional economies, the
main focus of capacity building has been to
prepare government lawyers and members
of the judiciary to administer newly enacted
laws and regulations and to adjudicate
disputes relating to such new laws.

One systemic issue common to all
economies is the lack of adequate systems
for dissemination of information about laws
to the public. This issue is being addressed
under the Bank’s technical assistance in the
People’s Republic of China and through
regional technical assistance for improving
access to legal information, particularly comparative legal reform materials to government lawyers and parliamentary draftsmen
via the Internet.24 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

Box 8. Strengthening Participatory Development

Pamiseation has always been impor
tant to the Bank—it is after all a

development finance institution owned by

57 members, with a portfolio of projects

covering virtually every aspect of develop
ment. But with the approval of the governance policy in 1995 and its subsequent

implementation in Bank activities, the im
portance of stakeholder participation has

been highlighted. In 1996, the Bank established a focal point for participation in its

Social Development Division, Office of

Environment and Social Development, and

issued guidelines on mainstreaming par
ticipatory development processes. The following resulted from these guidelines.

(i) A conceptual framework that
defines participatory development
was prepared.

(ii) A new generation of Bank operations
is being designed in a participatory
manner from the beginning (examples

 

(iii)

are the People’s Republic of China
Hebei Roads Development Project
loan and the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic Shifting Cultivation Technical Assistance Project).

Beyond loans and technical assistance, there is an increasing trend
toward greater participation in the
formulation of Bank policies. A
broader range of stakeholders is
being consulted on new policy development issues such as water,
health, and education.
Participation is increasingly being incorporated in the Bank’s business processes, as demonstrated in the ongoing review of the technical assistance
and loan processing cycle and of country programming. An illustration is
the extensive participation undertaken in the country operational
strategy study for the Philippines.

(v) Participation-related training programs
are being developed for Bank staff.
For example, the Bank pilot-tested a
field-based workshop on community
development in India, where Bank mission leaders learned from nongovernment organizations, local governments,
and community members.

(vi) Participation is encouraged through
the Bank’s Policy on Confidentiality
and Disclosure of Information, and
the establishment of the Inspection
Panel to investigate complaints from
groups affected by the Bank’s operations.

The Bank subsequently approved on

19 July 1996 a regional technical assis
tance for $300,000 to facilitate and

support a variety of small-scale participatory capacity-building activities for

11 countries and covering 10 subsectors.of the request with the Bank’s country operational strategy and efforts in the
field of governance and public management, and (iii) the Bank’s expertise.

If the Bank’s efforts to reduce illicit behavior by outside entities are to
be credible, it is essential that Bank staff be beyond reproach, and that the
Bank’s internal regulations and procedures support the highest ethical standards. Toward this end, the third pillar of the Bank’s Anticorruption Policy
calls for a range of actions to consider issues of corruption more explicitly,
use independent internal mechanisms to address allegations of corruption,
improve the quality of supervision of Bank loans and grants, and ensure that
Bank staff are familiar with the policy and act in a manner consistent with
both the letter and the spirit of it.

In its anticorruption activities, the Bank is cooperating closely with
other international multilateral and bilateral organizations in supporting
international and country-specific efforts to combat corruption.'° It will also
work with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) on various international
efforts to control corruption, and on specific anticorruption initiatives within
a particular country. Mechanisms for Bank staff to report corruption are in
place, and specific training for anticorruption efforts is being initiated.

Disseminating the lessons of experience

Dissemination is another key building block for an enhanced role in governance, and the Bank has undertaken a variety of internal and external
dissemination initiatives since early 1997, including a seminar on governance at the 1997 Annual Meeting in Fukuoka and one on regulatory issues
at the 1998 Annual Meeting in Geneva.!’ A range of regional technical
assistance (RETA)!® grants has been a valuable instrument for the Bank, and
has proven especially useful in the initial phase of the governance agenda.
Topics covered by these RETAs include governance and development in
South Asia; sharing best practices in municipal governance, and enhancing municipal service delivery capability; case studies on the functions
of cabinet offices in selected DMCs; meetings of Chief Justices and
Ministers of Justice; workshop on NGOs in development; and audit
training program for Supreme Audit Institutions. In addition, several
technical assistance activities for specific DMCs have dealt with core governance issues (examples are shown in Box 10).

16 A working group of all multilateral development banks has been formed to ensure cooperation and mutually supportive efforts.

17 A seminar on public financial management and accountability will be held at the 1999
Annual Meeting in Manila.

18 These are (i) RETA 5611: Megacities Management in Asia and the Pacific, approved on
22 December 1994; (ii) RETA 5646: Regional Study on Urban Infrastructure Finance,
approved on 10 October 1995; (iii) RETA 5664: Governance and Development in South
Asia and Other DMCs, approved on 22 December 1995; (iv) RETA 5685: Capacity Building
for Development Management, approved on 16 May 1996; (v) RETA 5688: Regional LongTerm Audit Training Program for Members of the Asian Organization of Supreme Audit
Institutions, approved on 13 June 1996; (vi) RETA 5764: Enhancing Municipal Service
Delivery Capability in Selected DMCs, approved on 24 December 1997; and (vii) RETA
5768: Definition of Key Governance Themes and Priorities in the Asian and Pacific Region,
approved on 31 December 1997.

Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity 2526 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

The Bank’s approach rests on both relevance and technical soundness:
(i) public sector management reforms do not travel well, and innovations
must be carefully assessed in light of the specific country’s characteristics and
administrative capacity; and (ii) the risk of ad hoc or contradictory advice
must be avoided through wide consultation with other institutions concerned,
in the DMCs and elsewhere. For example, the Bank’s public expenditure
management handbook, currently nearing completion, has benefited from
the advice of technical reviewers from the World Bank, IMF, United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), and OECD. Also, the Bank has proceeded from general issues to more concrete topics. Thus, the initial dissemination of broad problems of governance and development has provided the
basis for more focused events on fiscal transparency and financial accountability.

Enhancing the Bank’s capacity for governance work

The Bank has identified six key areas of governance, for which it is acquiring
an internal core capacity: (i) participation, civil society, and social capital;
(ii) law and development; (iii) public/private interface; (iv) sector and project
work; (v) core government functions at the national level; and (vi) decentralization. Ongoing program and sector development program loans with
governance components are listed in the table on page 28. As mentioned
earlier, anticorruption efforts can and must be incorporated in all governance areas, as appropriate to the circumstances of the specific country.

Box 9. The Bank’s Anticorruption Policy

rom Central Asia, through South,

Southeast and East Asia, and into the
Pacific, issues of corruption have risen to
the top of the development agenda. Many
have credited corruption and cronyism with
playing a major role in the Asian financial
crisis. A growing body of empirical evidence
indicates that corruption—the use of public or private office for personal gain—has
a strong negative impact on economic and
social growth. Various studies have indicated that corruption has added 20100 percent! to the cost of procuring
government goods and services in several
Asian countries. Corruption can lead foreign investors to look for more transparent
and predictable sites.

To extend the Bank’s ongoing work
on governance, the Board of Directors
unanimously approved the Anticorruption
Policy on 2 July 1998. The policy is intended to reduce the burden that widespread, systemic corruption exacts from the

governments and economies of the region.
Specifically, the Bank’s policy is centered
upon three objectives:

(i) supporting competitive markets, and
efficient, effective, accountable, and
transparent public administration;

(ii) supporting promising anticorruption
efforts on a case-by-case basis and
improving the quality of the Bank’s
dialogue with its developing member
countries on a range of governance
issues, including corruption; and

(iii) ensuring that the Bank’s staff,
projects, and programs all adhere to
the highest ethical standards.

A task force has been established to
oversee the policy’s implementation. Bank
procurement guidelines have been changed
to allow for loan cancellation, blacklisting,
and the right for audit, and to require full
disclosure of all fees and commissions. The
Bank has set up an internal Anticorruption
Unit within the Office of the General

Auditor to investigate cases of fraud and
corruption. New staff guidelines addressing anticorruption issues have been issued.
A series of training programs for Bank staff
have been initiated, and the Bank is supporting research in areas such as accounting institutions and improving public
expenditure management. The Bank is moving to promote anticorruption issues in country programming and to improve project
monitoring and supervision. The Bank is
hosting a number of global and regional
anticorruption initiatives, including the
next meeting of the Multilateral Development Bank Coordinating Committee on
Governance, Corruption, and Capacity
Building, and a joint conference with the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development on the relevance of the
Anti-Bribery Treaty to Asia.

Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity 27

 

Participation, civil society, and social capital: Mainstreaming participation in the Bank entails modifying the conceptual framework
on participation, based on lessons from the field; operational support in projects, sector work, and country strategies; work on
policies, guidelines, and procedures; training and information sharing;
capacity building in DMCs to strengthen participatory approaches;
and networking with other development finance institutions, NGOs,
and DMC-based organizations. The piloting of participatory
approaches in Bank operations is continuing.

Law and development: A common
theme in the Bank’s dialogue with
many DMCs is the need to address
systemic problems that undermine the
efficiency and, ultimately, the legitimacy of legal, judicial, and law enforcement institutions. Laws need to
be enforced fairly. Predictability, one
of the four pillars of governance discussed earlier, relies largely on a legal
and judicial framework that is clear,
uniform, public, and robust. Among
the systemic problems found in many
developing countries are delays in
court hearings; poor physical infrastructure; low status of judges, and
terms and conditions under which
they work; weak judicial accountability mechanisms which, in some
countries, permit widespread buying
of favorable verdicts (particularly in
the rural areas); lack of trained support staff and case management systems; and poor state of legal education
and training. Accordingly, assistance
on specific project-related law reforms
also takes into account the need for
development of institutional capacity of the legal and judicial systems.

Corporate governance and the publicprivate interface: Regulatory issues are
relevant in every sector, and the
development impact of Bank assistance will depend to a major extent
on the existence of a sound balance
between the public and private interests in the sector in question. While
the public-private interface is too
diverse to be amenable to meaningful

Box 10. Technical Assistance in Governance

and Public Management

eople’s Republic of China: Study of
Extrabudgetary Expenditures and
Revenues
This technical assistance for
$600,000, approved in December 1996,
is helping the Government identify the
responsibilities that various levels of
the Government will assume under the
fiscal reform program announced in
March 1994. It will also help the Government redefine the concept and
scope of the extrabudgetary funds
(EBF) and self-raised funds (SRF), and
reinforce the management and distribution of these resources to ensure that
expenditure responsibilities are adequately funded and a minimum level
of service delivery prevails across the
various levels of Government. The
technical assistance is expected to rationalize intergovernmental revenue
and expenditure assignment, especially
at the subprovincial levels, and consolidate budgets to incorporate many
of the resources now managed by the

Government as EBF and SRF.

Sri Lanka: Institutional Modernization of
the Ministry of Finance and Planning
The quality of public administration in Sri Lanka needs strengthening.
The Bank’s intervention strategy for
public administration and public sector reform is based on the assessment
of the reform experience of recent years.
Elements of an overall public sector
reform and strengthening program were

proposed to the Government in
November 1997. This includes support to institutional modernization of
key aspects of public expenditure management. Technical discussions with
the Ministry of Finance and Planning
(MOFP) revealed specific opportunities for significant improvements in
public financial management.

The Bank approved in July 1998 a
small-scale technical assistance for
$148,000 for institutional modernization of MOFP to improve specific
functions of MOFP identified as
important and amenable to rapid
improvement. It is also expected to
help MOFP define the scope and modalities for further institutional modernization of the public finance
apparatus. The technical assistance will
assist MOFP to (i) create a centralized
payroll management system; (ii) improve cash management systems to
minimize the opportunity cost of idle
balances; (iii) define options to automate
pension payments; (iv) strengthen public investment programming, particularly to improve its integration with
recurrent budget and, hence, with the
medium-term economic framework;
and (v) define MOFP’s role and limitations in the provision of management and organizational advice to
central and subnational government
entities. These activities would also
systematically involve sector ministries
and agencies.28 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

generalizations, the main goal is a regulatory framework that is
suited to the characteristics of the sector in question and that
protects identified public interests while minimizing private transaction costs. A good regulatory framework does this by fostering
accountability, transparency, and predictability in the formulation
and application of the rules and regulations (as in the case of
Indonesia’s Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development
Program loan, Box 3). This is especially necessary for issues of
corporate governance of public enterprises, which must reflect the
general principles of good private management as well as the interests
of the state as owner, in furtherance of some public aim. The
general influence on good governance of market-based and other
nongovernment mechanisms is also important. First, contestability,
ie., the possibility of market entry, can sometimes be as effective
as actual competition to stimulate good public sector management.
(A lively and competent private audit capacity has implications for
the efficiency of public audit; a competitive private labor market
influences positively human resource management in the public
sector; an efficient financial market helps foster public financial
accountability; and so on.) Second, actual competition is optimal
for the effectiveness of the public-private interface.!?

(iv) Governance considerations in sector and project work: Governance
aspects of sector and project operations can be incorporated in the
Bank’s work through improvements in project approach and design
rather than through radically different projects. Rarely will a sector
strategy or a project have governance improvements per se as its
central focus. However, all sector strategies and projects should
consider the possibility of strengthening accountability mechanisms, reducing the cost of information, or improving predictability—even if no particular action turns out to be appropriate to the
situation at hand. Thus, more effective incorporation of governance considerations at the sector and project levels should flow
from individual manager’s leadership, a better-equipped staff, and
career incentives consistent with the time and effort required.

(v) Core government functions at the national level: Empirical evidence
underlines the strong link between capable government and economic growth.?° Technical assistance or program lending can help
DMCs in areas such as (a) revenue administration; (b) public
expenditure management, from budget formulation through budget
execution and audit; and (c) public administration and civil service, including policy coordination and machinery of government.
Public expenditure management can be further subdivided between

of build-operate-transfer projects has sometimes led to excessive tariffs or overcapacity.

the “upstream” issues of budget formulation (including the link to
the overall fiscal and macroeconomic framework) and the “downstream” issues of budget execution and monitoring, including procurement and audit.

(vi) Decentralization: Priorities for Bank support include (a) promoting
intergovernment fiscal relations and finance; (b) strengthening
government institutions at the subnational level; and (c) enhancing
the delivery of critical municipal services. Many Asian governments
have developed or are starting to implement ambitious decentralization schemes. Although such initiatives hold long-term promise
for more responsive and effective service delivery, in the near term
there is a critical need for assistance in developing an appropriate division of labor among central, regional, and municipal
governments. This is a particular concern in settings with limited administrative and financial capacity and low levels of
accountability. If decentralization means only a shift in the
control of resources to local institutions monopolizing taskrelated roles, service delivery performance may suffer from low
capacity and weak accountability. A more promising model
would be to promote networks of service delivery partners,
including central and local government agencies, private businesses, and NGOs. By increasing the number and diversity of
partners, accountability will be increased, risk reduced, and
public sector tasks better adapted to local needs.”!

The Bank is fully committed to its transformation into a broad-based
development institution, of which governance is a core dimension. While
the transformation in Bank operations is well under way, to be sustainable
it requires, among other things, appropriate organizational arrangements,
and a small core of specialist staff in the various areas of public sector
management and institutional development. Some specialist staff have been
brought on board already, and the required core should be in place by the
end of 1999. The new organizational arrangements revolve around a
Governance and Public Management Cluster,’’ which assembles all Bank
specialists in the area (including focal points from each operational department and from central units). Governance is too important to be marginalized
or isolated into any single office at the Bank. It must become an integral
part of all analytical, lending, and technical assistance activities. Hence, at

21 John M. Cohen and Stephen B. Peterson, “Administrative Decentralization: A New Framework for Improved Governance, Accountability and Performance,” Development Discussion
Paper No. 582 (Harvard University, 1997).

22 The cluster is intended as a mechanism to prevent fragmentation of efforts as well as to
make Bank activities cost-effective, by (i) giving the members a venue for professional
interaction; (ii) providing the Bank with quality control advice, guidance in training and
recruitment, and leadership in applied research and dissemination activities; (iii) serving
as a focal point for partnership with other institutions, and as a mechanism to soften
boundaries among the Bank’s departments and offices; and (iv) making the Bank specialists
available for work throughout Asia. The cluster is coordinated by the Senior Advisor for
Governance and Public Management in the Strategy and Policy Office.the top of the immediate agenda is the mainstreaming of governance activities into the Bank’s operational departments. At the same time, the Bank
is ensuring that governance considerations are appropriately incorporated
into other policies being formulated and is actively monitoring implementation of the governance and anticorruption policies.

The Bank is well aware that its external credibility is partly a function
of the internal adjustments it makes to adapt to its new role as a broad-based
development institution. Thus, in addition to recruiting specialist staff and
introducing efficient organizational arrangements for governance, the Bank
is making all necessary efforts to mainstream governance considerations
throughout the institution, and to streamline the Bank’s own business processes and operational procedures. In particular, the Bank has strengthened
its procurement policy, has updated its Code of Conduct for staff, and
created independent reporting mechanisms to address allegations of corruption among Bank staff and in Bank operations, and is improving the quality
of oversight and management of its loans and technical assistance.

One may anticipate that, by the end of 1999, the Bank will be well on
its way to assuming a lead role for governance and public management in
the Asian and Pacific region. Given the delicate nature of the topics and
the vastness of the problems and of the region, the Bank will also use to
the maximum all possibilities for constructive partnership with other
institutions. It is expected that the enhanced role of the Bank in this
area will not only raise the effectiveness of its own assistance, but also
facilitate efforts by its partners to improve the impact of all external assistance
to the countries of the region.

Next steps

The Bank reacted quickly to the Asian financial crisis by supporting banking,
financial sector, and corporate governance reforms; fiscal decentralization;
and structural reforms in health, education, and labor market policies. Aside
from the response to the crisis, new governance policies are in place, specialized staff are being recruited, and Bank loans and technical assistance are
increasingly targeted at improving governance in DMCs.

The basis for concerted and successful assistance has been laid. For this
initial progress to be consolidated and expanded, progress in three priority
areas is needed in the medium term: (i) better diagnostic tools and drawing
on knowledge of good practice, (ii) improved implementation processes for
governance reforms, and (iii) tracking evolving notions of good practice.

(i) Better diagnostic tools and drawing on knowledge of good practice: All
governments need some basic capabilities to carry out essential
functions effectively. The Bank needs to draw on appropriate knowledge, including manuals and guiding principles, to define good
practices that most DMCs should consider. Diagnostic tools can
help DMCs monitor their governance reforms.

As noted at the outset of this chapter, the application of models evolved
elsewhere has historically led to major problems in countries that have very

different income levels, implementation capacities, and institutional landscapes. Careful and realistic assessment is needed of the costs and benefits
of possible institutional innovations, in light of the characteristics and
administrative capacity of the individual country. The Bank can build on
recent work of other international organizations, as it pulls together knowledge
about good practices and diagnostic tools in this complex area.’

The main efforts at external dissemination of good practice will revolve
in 1999 and 2000 around a series of in-country workshops on public expenditure management, civil service/public administration, and local government, eventually covering every DMC in the Asian and Pacific region. The
Bank’s Strategy and Policy Office is producing manuals and handbooks for
these workshops in cooperation with staff of OECD, and with the advice of
individual experts from other major international financial institutions and
academia. Also, accountability institutions and mechanisms in different
countries will be reviewed. Finally, several new technical assistance operations are ongoing or under preparation (Box 11).

(ii) Improved implementation processes for governance reforms: As manuals and diagnostic tools are developed and governments set strategies for organizational development and policy reform, the second
priority for medium-term improvement is the processes for carrying
out these strategies. The Bank needs better processes for addressing
governance concerns in its projects, and for anticipating and dealing
with crosscutting governance issues affecting the Bank’s project
portfolio in each DMC.

Too often the Bank and other development partners invest large sums
to design institutional reforms that are not effectively implemented.’4 Again,
the Bank is fortunate to be able to build on recent work by other
organizations.’° The following are the lessons of this work.

P ublic Expenditure Management and
Public Administration!

The objective of this regional technical assistance (RETA) is to improve the
practice of public administration, with specific emphasis on expenditure management,
among Bank members. It supports work in
three areas: (i) strengthening public
expenditure programming and financial
management, (ii) reviewing key aspects of
public administration and civil service
reform, and (iii) describing the main issues
and options for effective local governance.

Three sets of outputs are expected:
(i) a public expenditure management
manual, (ii) a public administration and civil
service guidebook, and (iii) a local governance sourcebook. They are to be produced
by Bank staff, in collaboration with the ADB
Institute and in consultation with top international experts in the respective areas
from major international organizations as
well as academia. These manuals will be
the basis for in-country workshops for upper

and middle-level managers in developing
member countries, to be conducted in 1999
and 2000, and will eventually cover all countries of the region.

Accountability Mechanisms in the Asian and
Pacific Region?

While the Bank is already active in
strengthening several key accountability
institutions such as Supreme Audit
Institutions, this RETA will systematically
examine the various institutional mechanisms for advancing managerial, legal, and
public accountability. Detailed case studies will be compiled, including analysis of
several core and line accountability functions, and the agencies or departments that
provide them; review of central mechanisms for policy coordination and imple
mentation; and examination of the functioning of key institutions such as anticorruption agencies and ombudsman offices.

A number of governance strategy studies are also being initiated, to serve both as

inputs into country strategies and as the
basis for constructive interventions suited
to the requests and specific characteristics
of each country. Studies for the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic and Viet Nam are
under way; those for Cambodia and Thailand
will be initiated in early 1999. Finally, the
RETA will support a joint ADB/
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development seminar on anticorruption, covering both the internal aspects of
the issue and the likely contribution from
the Anti-Bribery Treaty.

* Governance reforms should take place within the context of a
comprehensive vision that is coherent, owned, and public.

¢ Reforms should be sequenced in ways that consider underlying
political opportunities and constraints.

© Organizational changes are only likely to take hold if fully understood and supported by the stakeholders concerned. External agents
can suggest improvements based on their knowledge of good practice from other countries, but the leadership of the change process
should be from those that will have to live with the changes.

One might say that DMCs need to adopt the “Noah Principle” of
management: “No more prizes for predicting rain; only prizes for building the
ark.”*° The difficulty is in finding leverage points that can be empowered to
bring about the required changes in practice. Some of the steps needed are
as follows.

¢ Identify leverage point(s) in each country, which might be a
government ministry, parliament, the judiciary, ombudsman’s commission, NGO, women’s rights group, local government body, or
religious organization.

* Select leverage points based on demonstrated commitment to good
governance, and leadership potential for changes that can ripple
through government and civil society.

¢ Build capabilities of leverage points through advice and proper
incentives, including training on strategy and systems, action planning workshops, access to knowledge about best practices, and
links to professional networks.

This will be a two-tiered approach. The first tier will be the leverage
point. The Bank will proactively seek this out, based on the criteria above.
The second tier will be weaker organizations that have not yet demonstrated
their commitment and effective contribution to good governance principles.
The Bank will directly support the first tier, and use it as a catalyst for change
of the second tier. This assumes that commitment in the second tier is best
forged by national leverage points, rather than directly by the Bank.

(iii) Tracking evolving notions of good practices: The Asian financial
crisis shows that change can be rapid and unpredictable at the
dawn of the 21“ century. Institutional forms that have worked in
the past are being continuously challenged and reinvented. Governments cannot be left behind in this change process. Some of
the institutional forms best suited to achieving good governance
will be changing. The Bank will be tracking these trends, and
advising DMCs on them.

The explosive growth of electronic networks is already facilitating
new forms of citizen participation in governance, and new organizational
forms. For example, an increasingly common form of business organization is set up around individuals and small businesses linked by the
Internet. Tasks are carried out by independent contractors without layers

26 David Osborne and Peter Plastrik, Banishing Bureaucracy (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley,
1997), 245.of managers, deadlines, budgets, and other traditional control systems of
bureaucratic hierarchies. This emerging organizational form is perhaps
best understood from a metaphor.

“When we look up in the sky and see a flock of birds flying
in formation, we tend to assume that the bird in front is the leader
and is somehow determining the organization of all the other birds.
In fact, biologists tell us, each bird is following a simple set of
rules—behavioral standards—that result in the emergence of the
organization. The bird in front is no more important than a bird
at the back or a bird in the middle. They are all equally essential
to the pattern that they’re forming.””’

These and other changes are already encouraging nations to adhere to
global standards to compete for trade and investment. Some aspects of
sovereignty, such as those related to economic regulation and public accountability, are becoming structured around international instruments. Even
though these are normally legally nonbinding, there are still agreed mechanisms for surveillance and compliance.?®

No one can predict the speed or the extent to which these changes will
alter the face of governance in DMCs. Yet it is necessary to conceive of
completely new organizational landscapes where underlying good governance values will not only likely prevail, but also where the way governments
carry out their business drastically changes. The Bank will work to keep its
governance policies, manuals, and diagnostic tools fully up to date on emerging
practices from the region and beyond, and draw from these practices to give
DMCs support appropriate to their cultural, historical, and economic situations.

Governance institutions are also changing. Many governments are
changing the way they do business, forming partnerships, contractual
arrangements, and electronic networks with private businesses, NGOs, and
individual citizens to develop public policies and deliver public services. As
these trends continue, large, hierarchical government organizations in DMCs
may give way to smaller, network-facilitating groups, joining with various
partners to carry out particular tasks, all of whom can work together because
they follow the agreed “rules of the game.”

Governance in Asia: From Crisis to Opportunity 3536 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Summary and conclusions

Issues of governance are at the center of challenges facing the Bank’s DMCs.
Over the last five years, the Bank has deepened its thinking on governance
matters, including legal and judicial reform, combating corruption, and banking
and financial sector strengthening. This thinking, and the underlying policies
based on it, helped the Bank to respond quickly to the Asian financial crisis.

The Bank will further deepen its understanding of the basic principles
of good governance, and evolve notions of good governance practice. It will
help DMCs adapt these ideas to local conditions, and help them manage the
tisks of complex governance reforms.

Future government organizations may look very different from those we
see today, but the basic principles will stay the same. As Republic of Korea
President Kim Dae-jung recently pointed out,

“Looking back on the past year of reform, I can draw one
important conclusion. It is that introducing new laws and institutions alone is not enough. Reform can succeed only when these
institutional changes are accompanied by changes in people’s attitude.
This is the real test.”

Conference on Democracy, Market Economy and Development, February 1999.Operational Priorities 37

Operational Priorities

Strategic development objectives

he Bank’s strategic development objectives continue to embody its overriding mission in the Asian and Pacific region: to
promote economic growth, reduce poverty, support human development, improve the status of women, and protect the
environment. These objectives, which were endorsed by the
Board of Directors in 1995, set the goals for Bank operations under its
Medium-Term Strategic Framework 1995-1998. Charts on the Number of
Public Sector Projects by Primary Strategic Development Objective, 19911998 and Volume of Public Lending by Primary Strategic Development
Objective, 1991-1998 indicate the distribution of the strategic development
objectives among Bank projects during the eight-year period. To achieve
these objectives, the Bank has been focusing on the following operational
priorities: (i) policy support, (ii) capacity building for development management, (iii) support for physical and social infrastructure, (iv) private sector ‘Development Human Development
development, and (v) regional cooperation. It is increasingly recognized that a
a good policy environment and efficient institutions are the necessary con- : : .
ditions for effective Bank assistance and project implementation. Be end
In 1998, the environment for realizing these strategic development ot 1098 a d ,
objectives changed. First, the extent and implications of the ongoing financial crisis significantly changed the region’s socioeconomic environment and
the Bank’s assessment of that environment. Unlike in prior years, “generally
strong economic growth with increased flows of private investment based on
an overriding confidence in regional governments” could no longer be a
planning assumption. Neither could it be said that the development process
is led by the private sector, at least not in the medium term. The Bank’s role
to assist its developing member countries (DMCs) in expediting their policy
reforms and restoring investor confidence will become increasingly important.
At the same time, the Bank’s own institutional environment has changed.
Increasingly tight constraints on its financial resources require more careful
assessment of how the Bank can continue to meet its DMCs’ needs. A country
assistance plan cannot be formulated without consideration of the mediumterm availability of ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Asian Development
Fund (ADF) resources. Management of net cash requirements can no longer
be based on a historical projection of disbursement profiles, but must take
explicit account of the shift toward quick-disbursing program lending as
a result of the Bank’s emergency assistance for the crisis-affected DMCs.
In general, Bank financial planning and resource mobilization can no longer
be viewed as a support function but need to be fully integrated as part of
mainstream operational decision making.
Second, stakeholders’ objectives have been refocused. The Board of
Directors represents the Bank’s primary stakeholders: DMCs and donor

 

Economic Growth:38 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

countries. Borrowers directly affected by the ongoing crisis are, by necessity,
narrowing their focus on immediate priorities such as social safety nets, bank
and enterprise restructuring, and realistic medium-term recovery plans. DMCs
only indirectly affected by the crisis are also paying sharper attention to the
management of their financial and public sectors, while sustaining their
ongoing programs in the productive and social infrastructure sectors. All
development organizations are now increasingly concerned with issues of
governance and anticorruption, as well as crisis alleviation and recovery.

Third, financial resources are much more constrained. The lending and
borrowing headroom of OCR has been reduced as a result of the unforeseen
assistance provided to the crisis-affected DMCs. As a result, the Bank’s
capital adequacy needs to be reviewed. In the case of ADF, exchange rate
movements have reduced the commitment authority. The issue of commitment risk may need to be reexamined in the future.

Fourth, factors undermining sustained economic transformation must
be addressed. The transformation that has been experienced by a significant
number of DMCs is giving way to new challenges. These include expediting
structural reforms, improving governance, combating corruption, widening
political and social inclusiveness, and assuming greater environmental
responsibility. These new challenges are faced by the part of the region’s
population that has not benefited much from the economic expansion in
Asia, namely, the region’s rural and poor people who suffer from traditional
economic and social problems of developing countries. At the same time,
the countries that directly benefited from the expansion but are now feeling
the impact of the financial crisis need to include crisis alleviation and
recovery in their development agenda. In this, for example, the Bank could
support governments in restructuring the financial markets and banking
subsector, and providing social safety nets to restore investor confidence and
expedite the recovery process.

Given the above changes in the Bank’s operating environment, the
following strategic priorities are being pursued.

(i) The Bank has broadened its role beyond being a project financier in each DMC but, at the same time, is exercising much
more selectivity in sectors, issues, and projects to maximize
both project quality and the development impact of the Bank’s
scarce resources. This requires the development of well-focused
sector strategies at the country level.

(ii) The Bank is concentrating on its areas of strength, such as dealing
with crosscutting issues on environment and social development,
and supporting policy reforms in the areas of transition from
centrally planned to market economies. It is introducing institutional reforms, particularly through capacity building and the
promotion of good governance practices; DMCs’ resource mobilization is being encouraged through the development of wellfunctioning financial markets, cofinancing, promotion of private
sector, provision of public infrastructure, and formulation and
arrangement of infrastructure funds. Subregional economic
cooperation is also encouraged.

(iii) The allocation of Bank resources is being based on a closer review
of critical needs, performance, and absorptive capacity.Operational Priorities 39

(iv) The Bank is continuing its efforts to improve portfolio management, including “spring-cleaning” aimed at canceling nonperforming
loans, and allocating adequate staff and budget resources to ensure
that project administration action plans are accomplished.

(v) The Bank is working to ensure effective implementation, at the
country level, of the following recently approved Bank operational
policies: involuntary resettlement, cooperation with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), indigenous peoples, gender and
development, good governance, and anticorruption; as well as the
new policies on graduation and ADF allocation among DMCs. To
this end, Policy Coordination Units have been set up in the Bank’s
Programs Departments to mainstream crosscutting issues and
strengthen coordination of Bank operations.

(vi) Where possible, the Bank is pursuing a project financing strategy that maximizes recipient financing and cofinancing for Bankassisted projects.

(vii) The Bank is an active catalyst in assisting DMCs in arranging
cofinancing through effective use of the Bank’s complementary
financing scheme (CFS) and guarantee facilities.

Sustained growth in the region can be achieved only if there is

stable and robust private sector development. The Bank will continue to assist the DMC governments in creating a market-friendly
environment for private sector development.

 

Promoting economic growth

The Bank views economic growth as a fundamental and necessary approach
to achieving economic development and reducing poverty, but at the same
time invests in social development and environmental protection as a means
for improving the living conditions and quality of life of the region’s peoples.

Growth projects are now increasingly designed to achieve the overarching
objective of reducing poverty in each DMC, or incorporating project components targeted at poverty reduction.

In 1998, the Bank lent $3.2 billion for 20 projects with economic growth
as the primary objective. This represents about 41 percent of the total project
number and 56 percent of the total lending volume in the public sector. !
Policy-based program lending accounted for 51.6 percent of the OCR ($2.5 bil- —
lion) and 12.4 percent of the ADF resources ($122 million) in 1998. ce La ea

; : : ae I 1998

The Bank’s growth projects in 1998 contributed significantly to the |
Bank’s strategic objectives in each sector.

In the agriculture and natural resource sector, the Bank financed two
projects with economic growth as the primary objective—the Second
Agriculture Program loan in Nepal and the Fisheries Development Project
in Papua New Guinea—for a total of $56.5 million. For more details on the
agriculture and natural resource sector, see box on page 40 and the section on
the agriculture and natural resource sector in Table 12 in the Statistical Annex.

The Bank financed two energy sector projects, excluding a private
sector project, in 1998 for a total of $400 million: the Yunnan Dachaoshan
Power Transmission Project in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
the Power Sector Restructuring Program in the Philippines. Both had economic40 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

growth as their primary objective. In 1998, the Bank also engaged in policy
dialogues with a number of its DMCs regarding their energy sector programs
(see box on page 41 for highlights of these discussions).

In 1998, nine projects with economic growth as their primary objective
for a total of $1,160 million were financed in the transport and communications
sector; these exclude a private sector project. Projects included the Phnom
Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project, the first Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) project; the Second Road Rehabilitation Project in the
Krygyz Republic; road improvement projects in Sri Lanka and Viet Nam;
road and railway rehabilitation projects in Uzbekistan; and the ChengduNanchong Expressway, Changchun-Harbin Expressway (Hashuang), and
Changchun-Harbin Expressway (Changyu) projects in the PRC.

In 1998, in the financial sector, the Bank focused on the regulatory
framework, capital markets, corporate governance, and bank restructuring

(see box on page 43).

Bank Support for Agriculture and Natural Resources

Ne ninety-eight was marked by
two important events: a deepening
regional financial crisis, and extreme weather
patterns attributed to the El Nifio and
La Nifia phenomena. These twin developments highlighted the need for sustainable
growth in the agriculture and natural
resource sector, to absorb labor, reduce poverty in rural areas, and serve as a foundation for economic recovery.

With industry sector output stagnating or shrinking, some developing member

 

countries (DMCs) are experiencing urbanto-rural migration, as unemployed workers
seek their livelihood in agriculture. However,
fiscal austerity measures have restricted the
ability of DMCs to respond by stimulating
the rural economy with increased agricultural extension services and support for rural
enterprise development. This increased pressure in rural areas has served to highlight
weaknesses in the policies and institutions
of the rural economies in DMCs.

The crisis was exacerbated by
abnormal weather conditions in 1998.
Drought conditions in Indonesia, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, and some Pacific
countries led to a fall in food production.
At the same time, severe floods in
Bangladesh and the People’s Republic of
China reduced food and export crop production, and destroyed rural infrastructure.

The Bank’s overall strategy in the
agriculture sector reflects a long-term commitment to increasing farm income,
improving agricultural productivity through
critical policy reforms, and improving government institutions while reducing
dependence on them, by promoting market
efficiency, private sector participation, decentralization, and sustainable use of natural resources. In the public sector, technical
assistance and loans focus on strengthening
the institutions involved in agriculture,
water, and forests, and improving the

physical infrastructure for irrigation and
farm-to-market links. At the community
level, Bank operations focus on greater participation by resource users in the management and maintenance of resources, and
on extension services. These activities
directly reduce the burden on DMC
governments facing fiscal constraints
during the crisis.

The Bank’s 1998 program addressed
rural poverty through microfinance and
agrarian reform projects and technical
assistance designed to broaden incomegenerating opportunities, diversify rural
economies, and empower women. In rural
areas hard hit by inclement weather, the
Bank provided emergency assistance in
support of food production and infrastructure rehabilitation.

Environmental concerns are also
integrated in the program for agriculture
and natural resources. For example, the
Bank emphasizes the adoption of a river
basin approach to water resource development and use.

In 1998, loans to the agriculture and
natural resource sector totaled $420.9 million for 12 projects in 6 countries. In addition, 31 technical assistance grants were
approved, amounting to $30.4 million, in
support of project preparation, institutional
strengthening, research activities, policy
reform, and services enhancement.Reducing poverty

The magnitude of the task of addressing poverty in the Asian and Pacific
region is immense. Poverty remains a serious condition for what now is
approaching one billion people, a significant number of whom live in
abject poverty. The financial crisis in several countries in the region has
added to the problem.

The Bank works toward realizing its strategic objective of poverty reduction
through targeted assistance that combines support for economic growth
and the creation of employment- and income-generating opportunities.
It uses initiatives that will improve access to services such as health care,
education, and family planning, along with broader initiatives focused on
crosscutting concerns, such as gender equity and environmental protection and improvement.

Consideration of poverty issues is integral to the Bank’s operations, in
programming processes, loan and technical assistance work, and policy
development. At the country level, the Bank provides specific support for
policy reform that results in more opportunities for the poor and a policy
environment that more effectively supports poverty reduction.

Target groups in poverty reduction include the landless, small farmers,
upland communities, and disadvantaged groups in both urban and rural
areas. Operational areas that have the most direct bearing on poverty reduction
include rural development, microfinance, social services delivery, education,
urban development, irrigation, and disaster rehabilitation. Poverty issues are
central concerns in both country programming processes as well as in loan
and technical assistance activities.

Eighteen of the Bank’s 50 public sector projects in 1998 (this number
excludes private sector and engineering technical assistance loans) included
poverty reduction as a primary or secondary objective. Projects with poverty
reduction as a primary objective included the Rural Livelihood Project in
Bangladesh and the Agrarian Reform Communities Project in the
Philippines. One technical assistance project approved during the year
provides specific support for regional consultations on strategies for reducing poverty. Other technical assistance projects approved during the
year address various aspects of poverty reduction, within the context of
project operations as well as events such as the Asian financial crisis, and
in the context of policy guidance for individual DMCs.

During 1998, the Bank examined its strategies and policies that address
poverty reduction, with a view to establishing a specific poverty reduction
policy. As part of this process, the Bank began an intensive internal review
and held external consultations with government officials, other development institutions, NGOs, and communities.

The Bank continues to shift its focus of project design, monitoring, and
evaluation away from an emphasis on inputs, toward outputs, benefits, and
impact. To this end, the Bank continued to evaluate and measure the effects
of its operations on poverty reduction.

The Bank is an active participant in international efforts toward poverty
reduction, such as the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest and the
second international Microcredit Summit.

rs
Policy Dialogue
in the Energy Sector

Prowwine the proactive steps taken to
assist power subsector restructuring in the
Philippines, similar steps were taken in
Indonesia through extensive policy dialogue.
Policy dialogue was also held in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC). This dialogue
focused on promoting specific investments
for power plant rehabilitation and adopting
clean coal technologies. Continued emphasis was placed on strengthening the enabling
environment in the PRC for private sector
participation in power generation.

In addition, the Bank continued to promote good governance and institutional
reforms in its energy sector operations. For
example, the Bank continued to arrange
annual donor coordination meetings in
Bangladesh to promote reform and restructuring of the electric power and hydrocarbon
subsectors. In the hydrocarbon subsector,
the Bank provided technical assistance to
fully unbundle gas subsector operations, promote private sector participation in gas transmission, and eventually privatize gas
distribution system facilities. Efforts to improve Bangladesh’s electric power system
operations are continuing with the scheduled transfer of assets from the old statutory
authorities to newly established corporatized
entities. The Bank continued to play an
important role in energy sector operations
in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)!
through its five Electric Power Forums (one
in 1998), as well as through its newly established biannual Experts Group meetings on
Power Interconnection and Trade among
the GMS countries. In Sri Lanka, the Bank
took a lead role in conducting an energy
sector strategy study, which recommends
reform and restructuring of the power
subsector and the introduction of private
sector participation in generation.

Policy Dialogue in the Transport
and Communications Sector

n 1998, in the transport and com
munications sector, significant emphasis
was placed on supporting sector policy and
institutional reforms to enhance the sustainability of the projects. Private sector participation in the financing and operation of
the projects was also emphasized.

In addition, in its policy dialogues with
the governments of its developing member
countries, the Bank stressed institutional
reform through the introduction of
corporatization, commercialization, or
privatization. The Bank also emphasized
setting tariffs, based on commercial pricing
policies, to encourage commercialization in
the railway and port subsectors. For the road
subsector, policy dialogue focused on road
maintenance sustainability, road user
charges, and road safety.

   

The Bank not only builds transport
infrastructure with the help of the private
Sector, but also promotes road safety
and traffic management.

Supporting human development

The Asian and Pacific region has made significant progress in improving
human development indicators, although many shortcomings remain to be
addressed. The incidence of illiteracy, infant and child mortality, and maternal
mortality are high in some countries in the region. Many children still are
not enrolled in school, or they drop out before completing their primary
education. Women and other vulnerable groups still lack access to such basic
necessities as basic education, adequate water supply and sanitation, housing,
and primary health care. Investments in human development are essential
to promoting sustainable economic development and improving the lives of
the poor in the region. The Bank supports human development through
loans and technical assistance, institutional strengthening and capacity building,
and policy reforms. In 1998, the Bank continued to support human development through investments in education, health and nutrition, water supply
and sanitation, and urban development and housing (details on each sector
are provided in the boxes). Out of a total of 50 public sector projects approved
in 1998, excluding private sector and engineering technical assistance loans,
12 projects were for social infrastructure, with human development as their
primary aim. As part of the consultative process for preparing an education
sector policy paper, to be submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration in 1999, the Bank convened a seminar under an ongoing regional
technical assistance to review the status of education in the Asian and
Pacific region and to identify policy trends and issues. The results of the
seminar are incorporated in the education sector policy working paper.
As a key element of the Bank’s efforts to strengthen its support for
human development, a health sector policy working paper was discussed by
the Board of Directors. The paper strongly emphasizes the link between
investment in primary health care, and economic growth and productivity.
It reviews the status of health in the region, analyzes the main issues,
identifies priorities for Bank support, and provides a framework to guide the
Bank in future investment in the sector. The Bank’s overall approach is to
assist DMCs to ensure that their citizens have broad access to primary health
care, which includes preventive, promotive, and curative services that are
efficacious, cost-effective, and affordable. It is the intention that the Bank
would increase its health sector operations based on five strategic considerations: (i) improving the health of the poor, women, and indigenous
groups; (ii) focusing on achieving measurable results; (iii) testing innovative
approaches; (iv) encouraging governments to take a more active role in
health sector reform; and (v) strengthening health management capacity.
Urbanization is strongly linked to economic growth and has positively
contributed to the gains made in many DMCs. At the same time, the rapid
rate of urbanization has overwhelmed those tasked with managing urban
areas, particularly the poorer countries in the region. Measures to improve
the management and operation of urban services benefit both local and
national economies, enhance the quality of life, and reduce urban poverty.
It is within this context that the Bank encourages an integrated approach
to urban development, extending assistance in the subsectors of water supply
and sanitation, solid waste management, flood control, drainage, roads,Operational Priorities 43

urban transport, land development, slum improvement, and housing for lowincome communities.

The Bank pursues a strategy of sustainable urban development that aims
to strengthen the institutional capacity, capability, and operational efficiency of agencies and institutions responsible for the delivery, management,
and maintenance of urban services. Bank projects emphasize measures to
mobilize local resources through improved revenue collection, cost recovery,
user charges, private sector participation, and contracting out of public
services. Innovative techniques and approaches in these areas are introduced
through the Bank’s technical assistance and training activities.

In recent years, the Bank has done considerable work on megacity management and urban infrastructure finance, and investment programs for environmental rehabilitation are being formulated in Metro Manila and Shanghai.

Improving the status of women

The Bank recognizes that improving the status of women is integral to
achieving its other strategic development objectives, such as poverty reduction, economic growth, and the development of a healthier and better
educated society. Investments that benefit women are widely acknowledged
as crucial to development. Poor health, low levels of education and training,
and limited access to resources not only limit the quality of life for
women, but also limit the contribution of women to economic growth,
efficiency, and the sustainability of development. Policies and investments that improve the status of women have specific benefits, such as
improved public health, lower infant and maternal mortality, lower fertility
rates, increased life expectancy, and reduced welfare costs.

Bank Support for the Financial Sector

le the financial sector, the Bank focused on the following areas in 1998.

Regulatory framework: The Bank
worked to enhance transparency/accountability and restore investor confidence by
strengthening financial sector supervision
and prudential norms supported by an
independent regulatory authority. Standards for capital adequacy, loan classification, and loan-loss provisioning should be
consistent with international standards. A
legal framework, such as bankruptcy and
foreclosure laws, needs to be put in place
for resolving nonperforming loans of distressed financial institutions. Liberalization
of foreign investment rules on foreign ownership of banks and corporations is being
encouraged in parallel with banking and
corporate sector restructuring.

Capital markets: Recognizing that the
lack of long-term capital markets in Asia
caused excessive reliance on foreign
short-term capital, it is important in the
long term to mobilize domestic saving
and develop long-term capital markets
(stocks and bonds), with particular emphasis on the government bond market
as a benchmark. This will diversify the
source of capital, reduce the risk of capital flight, stabilize the supply of capital,
and improve the allocative efficiency of
the financial markets.

Corporate governance: Greater efforts
were directed at improving financial and
corporate governance through information
disclosure and stricter accounting standards.
Enhancing transparency and accountability in private and public corporations ensures

better corporate monitoring by the capital
market and reduces the risks of corruption
and fraudulent transactions. In addition,
introduction of new corporate laws will
increase competition and realign interests of corporate management and shareholders through the restructuring of
boards of directors and/or management.
The legal process of bankruptcy and foreclosure of collateral remains weak and needs
substantial improvements.

Bank restructuring: Banks dominate
financial intermediation in Asia, and the
banking subsector is tightly linked to almost all other sectors of the economy. This
subsector is a key area where the Bank can
leverage the impact of its assistance. In light
of the crisis, major banking subsector
restructuring has been under way.44 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

In 1998, the Bank revised its 1985 Women in Development policy. The new
Policy on Gender and Development—approved by the Board of Directors in June
1998—provides the framework for the Bank’s renewed emphasis and commitment to improving the status of women and to promoting gender equity
in its DMCs. It also provides the institutional framework, initiatives, and
mechanisms for achieving that commitment. For more on this policy, see page 50.

During the year, four projects were approved with improving the status
of women as a primary or secondary objective. The Basic Education (Girls)
Project (Lao People’s Democratic Republic [Lao PDR]) and the Vocational
and Technical Education Project (Viet Nam) were designed to have direct
positive impact on the enrollment and retention of girls and women, especially
in ethnic minority communities. Gender analyses for these projects highlighted that, while the desire for girls’ education on the part of the parents

Bank Support for Education

he Bank continued its support for

education, especially basic education,
with an emphasis on improving quality and
access and on strengthening decentralized
management of education. New Bank
projects were approved for several countries, with a major focus on developing
strategies and providing resources to help
cope with the effects of the Asian financial
crisis on education. Loans to Indonesia and
Thailand aimed to mitigate the impact of
the financial crisis on the most vulnerable
groups. In Indonesia, the Social Protection Sector Development Program provides
funds for an innovative, locally managed
program of block grants to poor schools to
maintain the quality of education, and
scholarships for poor students in junior

 

secondary schools to help them remain in
school. In Thailand, under the Social Sector Program, a scholarship program was
established and a student loan scheme
expanded to reduce the incidence of student dropouts. In addition, through the
Social Sector Program, the Bank is supporting policy reforms to improve the quality of education through better allocation
of resources and to decentralize education
management to make it more responsive
to local needs. In the Kyrgyz Republic, a
multisector project to support social service delivery and finance provides resources
for rehabilitation of rural primary schools
and for improving the management capacity of community-based organizations
involved in local schools. A project in the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(Lao PDR) helps to implement a comprehensive strategy to increase the enrollment
and retention of girls in basic education.
The Early Childhood Development Project
in the Philippines is the Bank’s first project
designed to support this critical phase of
the human life cycle. A project to assist
the Vietnamese Government restructure
the country’s vocational and technical education and training system—to make it
more responsive to the needs of the private sector—will include upgrading 15 key
technical schools throughout Viet Nam.
Technical projects
addressed a variety of needs, including

assistance

project preparation, education development plans, sector strategy studies, and
capacity building for education management and reform. Technical assistance,
aimed at strengthening national capacity to prepare education development
plans, was provided for the Lao PDR and
Sri Lanka. Capacity building for the management and reform of education—
especially decentralized management—was
the focus of technical assistance provided
to Indonesia, Maldives, Philippines,
Thailand, and Viet Nam. As part of its
overall support for efforts to mitigate the
effects of the financial crisis on vulnerable groups, the Bank provided technical assistance to Indonesia for developing
capacity in the management of programs
for street children. A large technical assistance project in Indonesia is establishing
a monitoring system for the school block
grant and scholarship program using nongovernment organizations to collect data
to determine whether Tesources are
reaching intended beneficiaries on time.
A technical assistance for the Philippines
is supporting a major education subsector
strategy review that will help determine
future lending priorities.

In 1998, the Bank also financed a
regional technical assistance to develop
capacity to address the education needs
of ethnic minorities in the Greater
Mekong Subregion.is high, significant barriers to girls’ education exist. These projects focus on
providing expanded access to improved, relevant education for girls and
women that would contribute to the improvement of women’s status and
human development in the long term. The Rural Livelihood Project
(Bangladesh) and Rural Microfinance Project (Nepal) are both aimed at
expanding women’s income-generating opportunities by providing them with
access to credit. The projects also build on women’s empowerment by organizing
women and raising awareness through social preparation and training. These
projects will elevate women’s status in general and more specifically, improve
their mobility, participation in decision-making processes, reproductive health,
and understanding of legal issues.

Technical assistance projects in 1998 that focused on women’s concerns
include those in the areas of primary health care expansion, and education
and skills development. In addition, Bank-supported social sector initiatives

Bank Support for Health and Nutrition

B™ lending for the health and nutrition subsector in 1998 was primarily in the context of multisector projects.
Emphasis was given to decentralizing primary
health care service delivery and to improving local capacity to manage health care
programs. As in the case of education, much
attention was focused on ensuring that basic
health and nutrition services for the poor did
not deteriorate during the Asian financial
crisis. Indonesia’s Social Protection Sector
Development Program supports policy reform
with regard to the decentralization and
targeting of basic health care. It also funds a
program of block grants to health centers to
ensure that affordable health services for the
poor will continue to be available, in particular services for children and pregnant women.
The program supports more active outreach
activities by village midwives to identify
pregnant women and infants at risk and to
ensure timely assistance, and provides supplementary and complementary feeding for
infants and young children. In the Kyrgyz
Republic, a multisector project on social
service delivery and finance supports rehabilitation of rural health centers and hospitals, and capacity building for decentralized
management of health programs. In the
Philippines, the Early Childhood Development Project seeks to improve the health
and nutritional status of young children by
enabling local government units to deliver

better services for children under six years
of age. Thailand’s Social Sector Program
supports reforms to improve the technical, managerial, and allocative efficiency
in the health subsector and to facilitate
access of disadvantaged groups, including women, children, and the unemployed, to basic health services.

Technical assistance facilitated the
preparation of investment projects, supported
sector analysis, and developed planning and
management capacity. Project preparatory
technical assistance in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic and Viet Nam supports the planning of primary and rural
health projects. In the Philippines, a technical assistance is supporting a health
subsector strategy review, in collaboration
with the World Bank and other agencies,
to help the Government define its development priorities. Technical assistance was
provided for Thailand to undertake a study
of health management and financing. A
regional technical assistance for the Greater
Mekong Subregion is helping develop
capacity to address the health needs of
ethnic minority populations. Another regional technical assistance is undertaking
a study of nutritional status and strategies
in the Asian and Pacific region as part of
the process of preparing the Bank's first
nutrition policy paper, which is expected
to be completed in 1999.

Bank Support for Water Supply and Sanitation

A vailability of safe drinking water and
appropriate sanitation facilities is
essential to people’s health and well-being,
yet is out of reach of many people in the
Asian and Pacific region. The Bank’s main
objective is to increase the provision of
reliable and safe drinking water and sanitation services, meeting basic needs in a
cost-effective, sustainable, and affordable
manner. Water supply and sanitation components are often included in integrated
urban development projects to provide a
balanced package of development benefits
aimed at human development, improving
gender equity, and protecting the environment. The Bank emphasizes the participation of community and nongovernment
organizations in project selection, design,
and implementation, and promotes the
involvement of the private sector in management and maintenance. Support is also

extended to the institutions and agencies
concerned to improve the efficiency of
delivery, operation and maintenance,
financial management, cost recovery, and
other measures for long-term sustainability.

In 1998, a loan was approved for the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) to help
solve an acute shortage of potable water
and severe water pollution problems in
Fuzhou City in Fujian Province. In Nepal,
an engineering loan was approved to prepare a project to increase the water supply
in Kathmandu Valley by tapping the
Melamchi River and by artificial groundwater recharging. A supplementary loan
was approved to help finance the completion of a major wastewater management
project in Thailand and to strengthen monitoring systems, promote industrial pollution
prevention, and develop a clean technology transfer program.

During 1998, PRC, Indonesia,
Kyrgyz Republic, and Nepal were recipients of technical assistance in the water
supply and sanitation subsector. In the
PRC, technical assistance was approved
to develop a strategic plan for wastewater management and pollution control
for the Hai River Basin over the next
15 years, and improve water quality management for Suzhou Creek in Shanghai.
In Nepal, technical assistance was
approved to promote reforms to facilitate the private sector management of
Kathmandu Valley's water supply, and
to ensure the sustainability of existing
and future water supplies. Project preparatory technical assistance was approved
to develop water supply and sanitation
projects in PRC, Fiji, Indonesia, Kyrgyz
Republic, and Nepal.

in Indonesia and Thailand in response to the Asian financial crisis feature
(i) mechanisms to monitor the welfare of women and to ensure their access
to essential social services; (ii) block grants to support health centers, especially
those delivering motherhood services; (iii) supplementary feeding for children, pregnant women, and breast-feeding mothers; and (iv) job placement
and retraining opportunities for retrenched female workers.

In 1998, work commenced on a proposed regional technical assistance—
Enhancing Gender and Development Capacity in DMCs—one of the initiatives included in the new policy. It is aimed at achieving quality improvements
in the implementation of Bank-financed loans and technical assistance,
while simultaneously building the gender capacity of executing agencies in
DMCs. The technical assistance will place local gender specialists in six of
the Bank’s resident missions (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam) for three years to assist both the executing
agencies and the Bank in mainstreaming gender equity issues into Bankfinanced projects. The primary functions of the gender and development
specialists will be to (i) provide gender capacity-building assistance to executing
agencies and resident mission staff to enhance their capacity to mainstream
gender equity in the implementation and administration of projects; (ii) prepare
and conduct in-country workshops to sensitize DMC policymakers and planners to gender and development issues; (iii) provide technical assistance
particular to gender issues when administering Bank-financed projects that
target women or mainstream gender concerns; (iv) assist with programming
and selected project processing missions to integrate gender considerations;
and (v) facilitate communication on gender issues among the Bank, DMC
governments, funding agencies, and NGOs.In March 1998, the Bank, for the first time, celebrated International
Women’s Day with a week-long program of activities. The celebration was
aimed at drawing attention to the concerns, needs, and aspirations of women
in the Asian and Pacific region. Representatives from the public and private
sectors, volunteer groups and NGOs, Manila-based funding agencies, other
organizations concerned, and Bank staff participated in the activities which
included (i) a Library exhibit on the theme “Gender and Development in
Asia: Current Status, Emerging Issues”; (ii) seminars delivered by three distinguished experts in the field of gender and development; and (iii) an
exhibit mounted by Philippine-based NGOs.

Protecting the environment

Promoting sustainable development and environmental protection are key
strategic development objectives of the Bank. In 1998, the Bank assisted many
DMCs in building their capacity and reforming their policies in the field of
environment, and helped specific DMCs such as Indonesia and Thailand by
conducting a study that would predict the impact of the financial crisis on
the environment. The Bank also promoted regional and subregional efforts
to address transboundary environmental concerns such as climate change,
acid rain, and the impact of atmospheric haze brought about by forest fires.

In 1998, the Bank provided various technical assistance grants and loans.
For example, in the PRC, a technical assistance cluster was given to help
improve national-level policies, institutional capacity, and financing mechanisms for the promotion and application of clean technologies to achieve
sustainable development. Another technical assistance to the PRC focuses on
strengthening staff capacity to formulate environmental laws for enforcement
at the provincial level. In the Lao PDR, the Bank provided technical assistance
to strengthen environmental and social management capacity in the energy
and transport sectors. In Thailand, Bank technical assistance focuses on the
promotion of market-based instruments for environmental management.

To equip DMCs in the region with the required technical capacity to
prevent forest fires, the Bank also assisted in strengthening the capacity of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to implement and monitor its
regional haze action plan through better management policies and enforcement, operational mechanisms, and regional institutional capacity. This regional
technical assistance complemented and reinforced a national-level initiative
in Indonesia through an advisory technical assistance. The Bank also provided a regional technical assistance to prepare a strategic environmental
framework that promotes the integration of environmental considerations in
economic development planning and implementation within the GMS.
Assistance was also granted to review, modify, and test environmental quality
indicators in selected sector and project-level investments to improve the
measurement of environmental quality with respect to development impact.
The Bank has initiated the preparation of The Asian Environment Outlook,
a major publication expected to provide policy prescriptions to its DMCs.

A regional technical assistance was also provided to enable the Bank and
mayors of selected megacities in the DMCs to participate in the Mayors’ Asia
Environmental Summit and present their policies, programs, and experiences
in the sustainable development of megacities in the Bank’s DMCs.

Bank Support for Urban
Development and Housing

n 1998, a Bank loan was approved for
Bhutan to improve urban infrastructure,
such as drainage, river channel improvement,
roads and bridges, footpaths, and parking
areas, and provide implementation assistance
and training. India’s priority investments in
the urban subsector are being supported
through an approved loan for Rajasthan for
an integrated urban infrastructure project
that includes water supply and sanitation,
sewerage, solid waste management, road improvement and traffic management, and slum
upgrading. A loan was approved for Kiribati
for the improvement of water supply and
sanitation, and solid waste management
facilities. A loan was approved for the Kyrgyz
Republic for a flood emergency rehabilitation
project to restore public infrastructure damaged by severe floods and landslides. In the
Philippines, an integrated urban development project loan was approved to assist
eight local governments improve access to
the quality of urban physical infrastructure in the Clark Special Economic Zone,
as well as to strengthen planning and
administrative capacities. A loan was also
approved for Sri Lanka for an urban
development and low-income housing
sector project that will address deficiencies in infrastructure and delivery of services in as many as 27 secondary towns,
as well as increase the access of low-income
households to market-based finance.
Technical assistance in the urban
subsector was approved for Bangladesh,
Bhutan, People’s Republic of China, Cook
Islands, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Mongolia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Samoa.
Advisory technical assistance was directed
at institutional strengthening and capacity
building, promoting good urban governance,
and formulating sustainable urban strategies
and policies. In addition, technical assistance
was approved to prepare urban development
projects for Bangladesh, India, and
Philippines. Regional technical assistance was
approved to prepare urban development
projects for Bangladesh, Cook Islands, India,
and Philippines.48 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

In 1998, the Bank approved 10 loan projects and programs with environmental objectives, totaling about $850 million. Projects with primary
environmental objectives include the Sundarbans Biodiversity Conservation
Project in Bangladesh; the Central Sulawesi Integrated Area Development
and Conservation Project in Indonesia; the Metro Manila Air Quality
Improvement Sector Development Program with the associated air pollution
control facility investment loan and technical assistance; and supplementary
assistance for the Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management Project in Thailand.
Of the total loan amount provided for environment projects, almost $300 million was intended for the improvement of air quality in Metro Manila.

Projects approved in 1998 were reviewed for their environmental impact,
and mitigation and enhancement measures were designed as appropriate.
Sixteen summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) reports were
circulated to the Board of Directors, and 37 summary initial environmental
examination (SIEE) reports were prepared. Bank staff trained in environmental assessment also participated in loan review and postevaluation missions to ensure timely and appropriate compliance by project proponents of
suggested environmental mitigation measures.

During the year, the Bank continued to undertake several resource
center activities. Through workshops, seminars, conferences, and environment forums, the Bank helped in raising the environmental awareness of
DMCs and Bank staff. Several publications were also prepared, covering the
Asian experience on the use of environmental economics as a decision tool,
including such topics as environment profiles of the Central Asian republics,
environmental compliance and enforcement, an environmental impact
assessment training manual, protected area management strategies, and the
Bank’s and its DMCs’ performance five years after the United Nations
Conference on Environment and Development. The Bank’s environmental
guidelines were updated and several special studies were undertaken as part
of its resource center work. A study was initiated on eco-labeling practices
and their implications in trade competitiveness and environmental management in selected DMCs. A study to improve the environmental and social
coverage during project implementation was completed.

The Bank continued to work on several other important crosscutting
issues. A Bankwide effort resulted in a draft policy paper on water that
involved extensive internal, regional, and subregional consultations. The
policy paper will be submitted for consideration of the Bank’s Board of
Directors in 1999. Several principles and recommendations, resulting from
the consultations, are already being applied in the Bank’s operations in the
water subsector. A study on Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters: A Review
of Lessons Learned and Emerging Issues was completed during the year and
a revision of the Bank’s existing policies on disaster will be undertaken in
1999, after consultation with selected DMCs.

An overarching policy on sustainable development is currently being
prepared, taking into consideration the various Bank policies on environment, social development, various sectors, and related issues. A study on
further streamlining environmental and social development policies and
procedures has been made, the report of which is currently under review.
The Bank also hosted the first regional consultative meeting to discuss the
role of regional institutions in catalyzing sustainable development.Also in 1998, the Bank actively participated in selected seminars,
workshops, and meetings within and outside the region, including the
Consultative Meeting Among Regional Institutions on Sustainable
Development in New York; the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Assembly
in New Delhi; the GEF Council Meeting in Washington, DC; and the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Fourth Meeting
of the Conference of the Parties in Buenos Aires.

Policies

In 1998, the Board of Directors approved a number policies on the Bank’s
strategic planning, operations, and finances. Included among these were the
Anticorruption Policy, Cooperation Between the Asian Development Bank
and Nongovernment Organizations, Graduation Policy, Policy on Gender
and Development, and Policy on Indigenous Peoples.

Anticorruption

With the unanimous approval of the Anticorruption Policy by the Bank’s
Board of Directors in July, the Bank’s governance work has expanded to
include an important subset of issues relating to enhancing transparency and
integrity in government operations. The Anticorruption Policy has three
major elements: (i) supporting competitive markets and effective public
administration, in the belief that such preventive measures will be the most
effective way to combat corruption; (ii) responding to specific DMC requests
for anticorruption assistance on a case-by-case basis; and (iii) ensuring that
Bank staff and projects adhere to the highest ethical standards.

A high-level task force, chaired by the Vice-President (East), was formed
for implementing the Anticorruption Policy. Subsequent work has focused
on drafting operational guidelines for staff and establishing independent channels
for reporting and investigating allegations of corruption. In June 1998, explicit
anticorruption provisions were introduced for the first time into a Bank loan
with the signing of a package of three loans totaling $1.5 billion for the
Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program to Indonesia.

Cooperation with nongovernment organizations

The policy Cooperation Between the Asian Development Bank and Nongovernment Organizations was approved in 1998. Updating and revising the
Bank’s 1987 NGO policy, the new policy outlines a broader framework for
cooperation with NGOs in Bank operations and defines specific initiatives to
be pursued. The thrust of the new policy is to recognize the capacities of
NGOs and the many roles NGOs play in development, and to identify areas
where common interests and complementarity between the Bank and NGOs
exist. The new policy was developed in close consultation with NGOs.
For the Bank, cooperation with NGOs encompasses efforts and initiatives to develop and expand relationships with NGOs, and to support NGO
participation in Bank operations. Cooperation with NGOs is an increasingly
important aspect of Bank operations in country programming processes, loan

and effectively.

and technical assistance operations, and policy development activities. The
Bank’s expanding cooperation with NGOs is a reflection of the position of
NGOs as significant players in development processes.

Gender and development

The Bank’s policy on women in development was adopted in 1985. In 1998,
the Bank adopted the new Policy on Gender and Development. The shift from
a “women in development” to a “gender and development” approach enables
an analysis of the role of women in the context of their
overall lives and their broader social relations. Rather
than an exclusive focus on women, the gender and development approach recognizes that improving the status of
women requires analysis of the relations between men and
women, and the cooperation and concurrence of men. A
gender-focused approach seeks to redress gender inequity
through strategic, broad-based, multifaceted solutions.

The Bank’s Policy on Gender and Development looks
at gender as a crosscutting issue with relevance to and
influencing all economic, social, and political processes.
Mainstreaming is adopted as the key strategy in promoting gender equity. The gender and development framework facilitates and enables the Bank to incorporate gender
concerns in all its programs and projects, including
macroeconomic and sector studies.

Some of the mechanisms embodied in the policy are
(i) developing a Gender and Development Action Plan, (ii) increasing inhouse capacity for addressing gender and development issues, (iii) enhancing
gender capacity in the Bank’s executing agencies, (iv) setting up a regional
technical assistance to fund gender and development initiatives on a grant
basis, (v) producing a database and manual on best practices, and (vi) creating
an external forum on gender and development.

Graduation policy for the Bank’s DMCs

As a broad-based multilateral development finance institution, the Bank has
an important role to play in facilitating the transition of DMCs from dependence on official concessional assistance to reliance on private capital. With
the approval of A Graduation Policy for the Bank’s DMCs in December
1998, the Bank now has in place a guiding framework for this transition
process. The graduation policy encompasses changes in the terms, levels, and
types of development assistance provided to DMCs as they progress across
the development spectrum. The policy covers graduation of DMCs both
from ADF and from regular Bank assistance.

Under the policy, DMCs’ eligibility for and graduation from ADF are
based on a decision matrix that is underpinned by two main country criteria:
(i) per capita gross national product (GNP) with the current threshold set
at $925 at 1997 prices, and (ii) debt repayment capacity for OCR borrowing.
The former three-tier classification of borrowing DMCs has now been modified
to a four-tier structure comprising groups A, Bl, B2, and C (see box onClassification of Countries). The policy also extends downstream to allow
graduation from regular Bank assistance based on (i) per capita GNP with
the current threshold set at $5,445 at 1997 prices; (ii) creditworthiness for
commercial borrowing; and (iii) stage of development of economic and social
institutions. Implementation of the policy framework has resulted in seven
DMCs (Pakistan was already receiving ADF-OCR blend) moving from ADFonly to ADF-OCR blend, with the opportunity to avail of limited amounts
of OCR, mainly for revenue-earning projects. Four DMCs have graduated
from ADF borrowing and another four have formally graduated from regular
Bank assistance. Periodic reviews of DMCs’ readiness for graduation are
mandated under the policy.

Appropriate modifications have also been made in the operational guidelines for ceilings on Bank financing of project costs. In addition, new norms
have been prescribed for government contribution to costs of technical assistance.

Indigenous peoples

In 1998, the Bank approved its Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Recognizing
the real and potential vulnerability of indigenous peoples in development
processes, the policy requires that for development interventions it supports
or assists, the Bank will ensure that affected indigenous peoples are at least
as well off as they would have been in the absence of the intervention, or
that adequate and appropriate compensation is provided. The policy works
to ensure the quality of opportunity for indigenous peoples, and that interventions affecting them are (i) consistent with the needs and aspirations of
affected peoples; (ii) compatible in substance and structure with affected
peoples’ cultural, social, and economic institutions; and (iii) conceived, planned,
and implemented with the informed participation of affected communities.
The policy on indigenous peoples was developed in close consultation with
representatives of indigenous peoples’ communities in the Bank’s DMCs.

When an intervention has a negative impact on indigenous peoples, an
indigenous peoples’ plan must be prepared. This plan would address issues
and concerns related to affected populations and, as appropriate, would
examine measures to avoid or mitigate negative effects, or outline compensation and assistance to be provided when negative effects cannot be avoided.
The indigenous peoples’ plan would become an integral part of the intervention’s
design and would include specific provisions to measure success in
implementation as well as in delivery of benefits.

The Bank and nongovernment organizations

The Bank seeks to cooperate with competent NGOs that have substantial
knowledge in their areas of operation and with which cooperation would be
appropriate and mutually beneficial. Cooperation with NGOs is undertaken to strengthen the effectiveness, sustainability, and quality of the
development services the Bank provides. The Bank recognizes the range
of roles that NGOs have assumed, from the delivery of development services
to policy advocacy. Where desirable and appropriate, the Bank works to
promote interaction between governments and NGOs and to support

Classification of Countries

revised classification system for the

Bank’s developing member countries
(DMCs) was approved by the Board of
Directors in December 1998, which will take
effect on 1 January 1999. Under the revised
system, two criteria—per capita gross national
product and debt repayment capacity—were
used to determine the classification of borrowing DMCs into Groups A, B1, B2, and C.
This classification system determines the
(i) degree of eligibility to borrow from the
Asian Development Fund (ADF); (ii) applicable ceiling on Bank financing; and
(iii) minimum share of government contribution to technical assistance costs.

Group A includes Afghanistan, Bhutan,
Cambodia, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic,

Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu.

Group B1 includes Bangladesh, Cook

government-NGO cooperation in national development efforts. Operational
sectors in which the Bank and NGOs have achieved the greatest degree of
cooperation include agriculture and rural development, urban development
and provision of urban services, water supply and sanitation, health and
population, education and training, and provision of microcredit. Cooperation
with NGOs is being realized in physical infrastructure projects, especially in
addressing the social impact such projects may have. The scope of cooperation
with NGOs in loan and technical assistance operations is broadening, with
NGOs increasingly becoming involved in upstream project activities, such as
project design and social and environmental analyses. Consultation with
NGOs is becoming a part of the Bank’s operations evaluation activities.

Cooperation with NGOs is expanding in country programming and
policy development processes. In several DMCs, NGO consultation has
become a part of the development of operational strategies and country
assistance plans. Similarly, NGO involvement has been incorporated in
sector studies and country economic work. During 1998, the Bank began
implementing technical assistance that addresses, among other things, new
approaches to NGO participation in the country programming process.

Consultation with NGOs is an important aspect of the development of
the Bank’s operational policies and the review of such policies. Policies approved
during 1998 as well as those being developed all include close consultation
with NGOs as a central element of the policy development process.

In 1998, 27 of the Bank’s public sector project approvals, or 53 percent,
included the involvement of NGOs in some significant way. A similar trend
was apparent in technical assistance operations. The role of NGOs in loans
and technical assistance includes consultation in project identification
and design, and responsibility for the implementation of specific components of projects, and in some cases of entire projects. In 1998, sectors
that reflected the most significant cooperation with NGOs were agriculture and natural resources, and social infrastructure. There was significant NGO involvement in multisector projects, including emergency
rehabilitation projects and projects developed as country-level responses
to the financial crisis. Countries that reflected the largest number of
projects with NGO involvement were the Philippines (five); Nepal (four);
and Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka (three each).

Law and development

In recent years, the Bank has worked closely with its DMCs in addressing
legal and regulatory reforms considered necessary to foster sustainable
development. The Bank’s law and development program took on a new
dimension in 1998, as legal and regulatory reforms became a central element in
DMCs’ responses to the Asian financial crisis and in the Bank’s assistance to
those countries affected. Such crisis-related assistance complemented the Bank’s
ongoing law and development assistance in 23 DMCs in support of the Bank’s
five strategic objectives of promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, supporting human development, improving the status of women, and protecting
the environment. In 1998, law and development assistance was provided to
Bank DMCs to support policy changes, build capacity for developmentOperational Priorities 53

management, improve services from both the public and private sectors, and
strengthen regional cooperation through 11 program loans, 3 technical assistance loans, numerous project loans, and 65 technical assistance operations.

The Bank’s assistance to DMCs affected by the crisis in its earliest days
focused on reforms of their legal and policy frameworks for regulation of
financial institutions, and of their financial and capital markets.

The Financial Markets Reform Program for Thailand deals with problems arising from nonperforming loans to finance companies, and rehabilitation of unliquidated finance companies by improving the legal framework
for debt recovery. The program required enacting an amended Bankruptcy
Law, ensuring autonomy of the Securities and Exchange Commission, increasing
accountability of the Stock Exchange of Thailand, preparing a Corporatization
Law allowing conversion of existing state-owned enterprises to privatized
companies, and enacting amendments to the Alien Business Law to permit
participation of foreign and majority foreign-owned domestic securities companies in securities brokerage and dealership businesses.

The Financial Sector Program for the Republic of Korea involved the
reform of significant financial sector laws and regulatory policies. The program
involved amendments to the Bank of Korea Act to guarantee the operational
independence and autonomy of the Bank of Korea, the passage of an act for
the establishment of the Financial Supervisory Institution to consolidate
supervision of all commercial and specialized banks, and the issuance of
guidelines reforming the insurance industry. In August 1998, the Republic
of Korea’s Bank Supervisory Authority, after reviewing prudential standards
in accordance with the requirements of the program, announced revised core

Capacity Building in Drafting Legislation: National Securities and Land Administration Laws in the PRC

ubsequent to the onset of the Asian

financial crisis in mid-1997, the Bank
provided technical assistance to strengthen
securities laws in its developing member
countries. One such technical assistance
grant financed legislative drafting support
for the Securities Law, approved by the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) on
29 December 1998 after six years of preparatory work. Under this technical assistance, the Bank’s Office of the General
Counsel provided staff lawyers and consultants who participated in discussions during a three-day seminar in Beijing in
September 1998 and an International
Symposium in October 1998. The symposium, which was covered by television and
print media, provided a forum for discussion of the draft Securities Law by international and domestic experts, as well as
representatives of the Government and the

general public prior to submission of the
draft law to the National People’s Congress.
The Securities Law (i) strengthens the
legal framework for the PRC securities
market, (ii) increases transparency and
accountability of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission, (iii) facilitates
disclosure-based initial public offerings, and
(iv) prohibits such practices as insider trading and brokerage firms mixing their own
and clients’ money to trade shares.
Pursuant to the Bank’s strategic
objectives of protecting the environment
and supporting human development, the
Bank also provided technical assistance to
the PRC to train staff of the Environmental
Protection and Natural Resources
Conservation Committee of the National
People’s Congress and to provide assistance in drafting a new land administration law. Enacted in 1998 soon after a

symposium supported by a Bank technical
assistance, the Land Administration Law
deals with the ownership of and right to
use land, overall planning for land utilization, protection of cultivated land, use
of land for construction, and supervision
of land administration statutes and regulations. Consistent with advice provided
under this legislative capacity-building
technical assistance, the new Land
Administration Law increases levels of
resettlement fees to be paid to people
who are losing productive land. Training
provided also improved the processes for
adjusting contracts and resolving disputes, including permitting parties not
accepting the decision of the local
government under the Land Administration Law to file a lawsuit within 30 days
after receiving notification of the
Government’s decision.54 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

The Role of Law and Legal Institutions in Asian Economic Development: 1960-1995

A mbisisciplinary study financed
under a Bank regional technical
assistance evaluated change in the legal
systems of six Asian economies (People’s
Republic of China; India; Japan; Republic
of Korea; Malaysia; and Taipei,China)
during 1960-1995, and examined the
causal relationships between legal change
and economic and social development.
Broadly, the study validated a basic
premise upon which governments have
acted in both transitional and liberalizing economies in enacting significant law
reforms: that law is important to private
sector development and, in particular,
to the development of financial and capital markets. The study also observed a
rise in the use of the courts as economic
activities intensified, increased use of the
courts to challenge governmental action,
and an increase in the frequency with
which private parties were successful in

their disputes with government. These
are signs of the growing importance of
legal remedies as economies become more
complex and impersonal, and of the growing use of the legal system to enhance
the accountability of government.

The findings of the study have
important implications for the law reform
policies and for externally assisted legal
technical assistance programs of the Bank's
developing member countries: (i) economic
law reform must take into account existing laws, their actual use, and the overall
economic policy and institutional framework in which they function; (ii) effective
congruence is necessary between prevailing economic policies and economic law
reforms if such legal reforms are to be
effective; and (iii) effective law reform
requires pursuit of a broadly consultative
lawmaking process. The study points to
the need for collaboration between lawyers

and economists in the design of law and
development programs. By demonstrating
that the effectiveness of economic laws
depends on the prevailing economic policy
environment and on the institutional framework for enforcement of laws, the study is
likely to reinforce the growing recognition
among funding agencies of the need to
move beyond the narrow focus on particular laws and their content, to a more systematic approach that takes into account
broader economic policies and institutional
frameworks, and the functioning of the
broader legal and judicial system in which
laws must operate, and be administered
and enforced.

The study, copublished by the Bank
and the Oxford University Press, will be
released in 1999. An executive summary is
also available on the Bank's Internet web
site (http://www.adb.org) and from the
Office of the General Counsel.

principles relating to the treatment of financial assets and the revision of
loan classification criteria. Also, in furtherance of the program loan’s objectives, the Republic of Korea’s National Assembly enacted at end-1998 the
Mortgage-Backed Securitization Companies Act.

The Bank’s 1998 Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development
Program in Indonesia addressed bankruptcy law reforms, and secured transactions law reforms and reforms to Indonesia’s anticorruption legislation and
regulations. Pursuant to this reform program, the Government enacted the
1998 Banking Law and approved regulations providing a framework for bank
mergers and acquisitions, as well as for liquidation of commercial banks.
Bank Indonesia also issued new guidelines concerning information to be
included in annual reports by commercial banks and approved new loan-loss
regulations. A 1998 Presidential Decree established the State Ministry for
the Empowerment of State Enterprises, which will commence performance
audits and recommend measures to improve accountability and transparency. Under a parallel technical assistance loan, the Bank is making available
financing to the Government for training of bankruptcy personnel and for
development of a secured transactions registration system.

Focusing on the importance to the crisis-affected DMCs of effective
bankruptcy regimes to provide structure and process for the rehabilitation
and restructuring of insolvent companies, and the liquidation of those companies
that are incapable of rehabilitation, the Bank approved in 1998 a regional
technical assistance on Insolvency Law Reform. The technical assistance
brought together government officials responsible for bankruptcy law reformand bankruptcy administrators, bankers, leading insolvency practitioners
from the legal and accounting professions, and academic experts to consider
recent experiences with insolvency law reforms in the Asian and Pacific
region. The legal and regulatory elements of the Bank’s response to the
financial crisis were shaped in part by two Bank-sponsored studies conducted
in 1998: “The Role of Law and Legal Institutions in Asian Economic
Development, 1960-1995” and “A Review of the Law and Development
Activities of the Asian Development Bank.”

The first study, “The Role of Law and Legal Institutions in Asian
Economic Development, 1960-1995” (publication to be released in 1999),
reports on the results of a major Bank-commissioned examination of the role
that economic laws and legal institutions played in the economic development of six Asian economies during a 35-year period of dynamic economic
growth (see box). It found that law played an important role in facilitating
economic development, particularly when governments pursued economic
policies that fostered free markets and reduced the role of government as
a primary decision maker in the economy.

The second Bank study, “A Review of the Law and Development Activities
of the Asian Development Bank,” reviews the current law and development
assistance of the Bank and sets forth a strategy for its further evolution in
the years immediately ahead. The study was presented in an 18 February
1998 Information Paper to the Bank’s Board of Directors. The information
paper placed the Bank’s law and development program within the context
of the Bank’s 1995 governance policy and documented its relevance to the
economy, to private sector development, and in the public sector, to the
accountability of governments. The
relevance of law to private sector
economic development was analyzed
and is, in part, captured in the ac
companying table.

The information paper emphasizes the need for further assistance
in developing legal frameworks for
the market economy and for a systematic approach to legal reform.
The paper recognizes that the
effectiveness of laws depends on the
quality of government legal personnel and the operation of legal and
judicial institutions, in addition to
the quality of the law enacted.

Illustrative of this more systematic approach to the effectiveness
of the legal system is the 1998 Bank
technical assistance grant to
Mongolia, which focuses on the
development of local institutions
capable of retraining public sector
lawyers in a transitional economy.

for development of its faculty and teaching program and of its management. About 200 Mongolian public sector lawyers (including judges,
prosecutors, and legislative draftsmen) will be trained in the first two years
of the Bank’s assistance.

The Bank continues to play a lead role in fostering interchanges in the
field of law and development among DMCs, funding agencies, academics,
and other interested parties. LAW-DEV, the Bank-sponsored Internet forum,
provides a daily link for the communication of ideas and information among
more than 600 participants in 40 countries. The Bank’s Law and Development
publications—including Law and Development at the Asian Development Bank,
Law and Development Bulletin, and Law and Development: An Asian
Bibliography—are important sources of information about DMC law reform
activities and donor technical assistance in the field.

Private sector development

Bank support for private sector development in the DMCs is based on the
belief that the private sector can make a major contribution to efficient
economic growth. The past few years have witnessed the changing roles of
governments and the private sector in the DMCs. Increasingly, the private
sector is being encouraged to play an expanded role in development as
governments progressively assume the role of catalysts and regulators of
development. In support, the Bank is moving on two fronts: (i) assisting
DMC governments through policy dialogue, technical assistance, and program lending to create an enabling environment for private sector development; and (ii) participating directly in the financing of private sector projects
to provide assistance to commercial investors and lenders.

An efficient and effective financial sector is an important condition for
private sector development. In 1998, the Bank continued to take initiatives
in helping its crisis-affected DMCs strengthen their financial systems to
assure a sustainable flow of resources to the private sector. For instance, the
Bank approved a $1.5 billion financial package for Indonesia to support
reforms of governance of its financial sector. This Indonesian reform program
is designed to assist in restructuring the financial sector, and restore its
ability to play a crucial role in the effective mobilization and efficient allocation of resources for investment. Under the program, the Government will
implement comprehensive policy and institutional measures, such as the
adoption of best practices in banking and capital market regulation, supervision, and management.

The financial crisis has made access to credit difficult for private businesses, even for exporters who should be leading the recovery process. In
Thailand, the Bank addressed the liquidity problem of private sector exporters with the approval in 1998 of a $1 billion loan for the Export Financing
Facility. This facility consists of two loans to the Export-Import Bank of
Thailand: a $50 million loan from ADB, and a $950 million loan from a
syndicate of international banks. The syndicated loan is partially guaranteed
by ADB. The facility was the first major term financing for Thailand sinceit was hit by the financial crisis in mid-1997. The loan facility will provide
preshipment financing and term funding for the modernization and replacement of existing export-producing facilities.

With physical infrastructure bottlenecks constraining growth, DMC
governments are exerting efforts to encourage private sector participation
in the provision of physical infrastructure services. One form of Bank support
for these efforts is through assistance for sector restructuring and privatization
programs. In the Philippines, the Bank approved in 1998 a $300 million loan
to the Government for a power sector restructuring program. The program
is designed to transfer ownership of generation to the private sector. Such
privatization will shift the financial burden of power sector development
from the public sector to the private sector. An accompanying technical
assistance grant will fund a study of electricity pricing and regulatory policy
in a competitive environment. Moving the power sector to the competitive
world of private business is expected to lead to more efficiency in generation
and distribution and lower electricity charges for consumers.

Through various technical assistance grants, the Bank is also helping
DMCs identify the scope for private sector participation in infrastructure
development and formulate appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks to
facilitate private investment. In 1998, the Bank approved technical assistance
grants for the study of private sector participation in such areas as gas transmission in Bangladesh and port development in the Maldives. A Bank-funded
study of the road subsector in the PRC, which was completed in 1998,
concluded that construction risk is best left to the public sector but that when
traffic grows to a sufficient level, leasing or securitization can be considered
to mobilize private capital for the transport sector. A Bank-sponsored regional
workshop held in Manila in December 1998 brought together government
officials, bankers, and private sector developers to discuss the results of a
Bank-funded study on developing best practices for promoting private investment in power, port, airport, expressway, and water supply development.

Availability of skilled manpower is an important condition for the private
sector to flourish in any given country. To help Viet Nam train workers for
the private sector, the Bank approved in 1998 a loan of $54 million to the
Government for a project that will orient the country’s vocational and
technical education system toward the changing needs of the private sector.
The project will help meet the growing demand for skilled workers and
production technicians in the industry sector as it becomes the dominant
area in Viet Nam’s rapidly changing economy.

The Asian financial crisis continued to make the financing of new
private sector projects in 1998 difficult as the receding economies of the
region cast doubt on the need for and affordability of added capacity in
power and other physical infrastructure facilities. In addition, the resources
of the Bank for private sector operations had to be devoted more to managing the Bank’s private sector portfolio, which was adversely affected by the
crisis. Notwithstanding, the Bank succeeded in catalyzing two private sector
infrastructure projects (a telecommunications system in Bangladesh and a
power plant in the PRC) and two financial sector projects (a secondary
mortgage facility in Indonesia and a credit enhancement facility for a
development bank in Sri Lanka). Together with its restructuring efforts, the
Bank approved a total of eight private sector operations involving a total

Private Power Deal
Wins International Awards

he Bank-financed Meizhou Wan Power

project in Fujian Province, People’s
Republic of China, won two awards for
excellence despite the difficult market
environment in 1998. The awards were given
by the International Finance Review (“Asian
Project Finance Loan of the Year”), and by
Project Finance International (PFI) (“Power
Deal of the Year—Asia Pacific Awards 1998”)
in its PFI Yearbook 1999.

The project, now well under way, is for
the construction of a 720-megawatt coalfired power plant on the Zhongmen
Peninsula, and will serve industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural users.

The Bank supported the project
through difficult periods, including after the
onset of the Asian financial crisis. Fortunately, a truly international lead manager
group consisting of Banque Paribas, Bank of
America, Credit Suisse First Boston, and
Tokai Bank, Ltd. had been committed with
the Bank’s active involvement to help find
creative solutions to the challenge of providing debt financing totaling up to $566 million. In addition, the export credit agencies
of France and Spain played an important
role by providing various credit schemes
related to equipment supply. The key factor
in making the awards, according to the two
publications, was the ability of the project
to sell down a high percentage of the debt
in the current climate, which in turn relates
to solid project fundamentals. Alongside the
Bank’s direct loan, participating banks
accepted pro rata shares of the Bank’s
complementary financing scheme loan, the
two export credit tranches, the commercial
loan, and a working capital facility. The
project contributed to the creation of a legal
framework for wholly foreign-owned infrastructure projects; and a detailed tariff formula was negotiated, allowing cost recovery
and a reasonable return on the investment.

commitment of $198.5 million, comprising $136.1 million of loans and
$62.4 million of equity investments. For details, see Tables 17-19 in the
Statistical Annex. Direct assistance by the Bank for these projects is expected
to facilitate investments totaling $1.9 billion, an amount which is nine times
the Bank’s own funding commitment.

The tight loan syndication market brought about by the financial crisis
made the Bank’s catalytic role key to the success in closing the limitedrecourse debt financing for the Meizhou Wan Power project, a 720-megawatt
coal-fired generating plant to be built in the Fujian Province of the PRC. The
project is one of the first wholly foreign-owned power projects in the PRC
based on build-operate-transfer (BOT) principles. It will help meet demand
and reduce acute power shortages, while improving voltage and frequency
stability of the power distribution system, and reducing reliance in Fujian
Province on hydroelectric power, which is heavily dependent on seasonal
rainfall. Insufficient power is regarded as a major constraint to economic
growth in the area. The Bank’s support for the $828.5 million project consists
of a $50 million direct loan and equity investment, and a $150 million loan
funded by international banks under the complementary financing scheme.
The Meizhou Wan Power project has set a benchmark for project financing
in the PRC on contractual and financing documentation. The loan syndication success has won for the project two press awards for 1998 (see box).

The Bank also helped a private joint venture in Bangladesh undertake
a financially viable project that has significant economic merits and for
which normal sources of commercial finances were not available. The project
represents the first significant private investment in the country’s telecommunications subsector, which is underdeveloped and has a high level of
unmet demand. Costing a total of $153.8 million, the project involves the
construction and operation of a nationwide cellular telephone system, which
will provide common cellular services in the main cities and village pay
telephone services in rural areas. These telecommunications services will
contribute to the economic development of Bangladesh; improve health,
education, and government services; and strengthen cultural and social ties.
The project will be undertaken by GrameenPhone Limited, a joint venture
between a well-established Norwegian telephone operator and a telecommunications company controlled by Grameen Bank of Bangladesh. The Bank’s
support, consisting of a $16.7 million loan and a $1.6 million equity commitment, was an important component of a financing package from a group
of four multilateral and bilateral funding agencies.

To help mobilize international capital for the private sector in
Sri Lanka, the Bank approved a $70 million credit enhancement facility
for the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), one of two
local development banks providing term loans to private enterprises in
the growing manufacturing subsector of the country. The facility consists
of a direct loan of $5 million without a government guarantee and a
partial credit guarantee for the principal repayments on a floating rate
note issue of $65 million by DFCC. The facility will give DFCC access
to international funding and enable it to meet the investment requirements of manufacturing enterprises while the domestic capital market
has yet to develop sufficiently. The Bank guarantee, which will be
counterguaranteed by the Government, is needed because local borrowerscannot, at present, access the international financial market without
such credit enhancement.

Part of the $1.5 billion financial package approved in 1998 for financial
governance reforms in Indonesia was a $3 million equity commitment for the
establishment of the first company to be licensed as a secondary mortgage
facility under a regulatory framework, which was developed with Bank technical assistance. The facility is expected to help develop the bond market
in the country. A Bank loan of $47 million coursed through the Government
was also approved to provide additional funding resources to the facility.

Managing the Bank’s private sector porfolio has been particularly difficult, with the Asian financial crisis exacerbating the situation. In 1998, two
regional financial projects in the Bank’s private sector portfolio had to be
supported with liquidity funding and fresh capital commitments. One is the
Asian Securitization and Infrastructure Assurance Limited (ASIA Limited), a regional financial company specializing in bond insurance and
securitization services. The commercial attractiveness of ASIA Limited
was adversely affected by the deterioration in the credit quality and the
associated downgrade in the sovereign ratings of the crisis-hit DMCs. An
additional capital commitment from the Bank and ASIA Limited’s other
shareholders was needed to restore confidence in the company’s credit
enhancing capacity. Liquidity, long-term funding support, wide restructuring of the company, and change of management were required by the
Asian Finance and Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC), a regional
company providing finance for medium-sized industrial projects across a
range of DMCs. Bank support was needed to help AFIC overcome the effects
of nonperforming exposures to projects in crisis-hit DMCs.

A third project in the Bank’s private sector portfolio that required
restructuring in 1998 was Primo Oleochemicals Inc., a manufacturing firm
employing new technology for producing exportable chemicals from coconut
produced by millions of farmers in the Philippines. An additional loan and
equity commitment from the Bank and the other lenders and shareholders
to support the restructuring enabled the firm to start commercial operations
after considerable delays because of market and technical problems.

The Bank is in an advantageous position to help prepare BOT projects
for competitive bidding to private developers, and to process assistance to
governments and the private sector to assure the successful implementation
of such projects. With its public sector and private sector operations playing
complementary roles, the Bank is able to take an integrated approach to a
development challenge. In Bangladesh, for example, as part of an effort to
overcome an impediment to the development of a growth corridor, the Bank
provided technical assistance to the Government for developing a gas-fired
power project on BOT basis. The project was successfully awarded in 1998
to the lowest bidder, and the Bank has started processing a loan without
government guarantee for the private sector company that will undertake
the project. As a complementary project, the Bank will extend a public
sector loan to the Government for funding the transmission line that will
distribute power from the generating plant.

Another example of the Bank’s success in assisting DMCs prepare BOT
projects is the water supply project in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan
Province in the PRC. Following a Bank-sponsored seminar that brought

together senior government officials, bankers, and private sector water operators
in Beijing, the Bank provided the PRC with technical assistance to prepare
a pilot BOT water supply project to be awarded on the basis of a transparent
international competitive bidding. Another technical assistance grant from
the Bank helped the Government conduct a water pricing study that served
as basis for the new guidelines for water tariffs issued in late 1998. The bidding
process was completed in 1998 and the project was awarded to a consortium
of French and Japanese companies. The resulting BOT project is now being
processed for direct financing under the Bank’s private sector operations.
Another BOT project in the PRC—a power plant in Changsa, Hunan Province—
was also bid out successfully in 1998 with technical assistance from the Bank,
and is now being processed as a private sector project by the Bank.

The Bank’s role in resource transfers

The net transfer of resources! from the Bank to the DMCs increased
from $3.8 billion in 1997 to $4.2 billion in 1998. This increase was
caused mainly by the additional disbursement for the Financial Sector
Program loans to the Republic of Korea and Indonesia. For details, see
Tables 39-41 in the Statistical Annex.

Of the total net transfer, $3.4 billion was from OCR and $875.9 million
was from ADF.

Loan disbursements reached $6.8 billion, compared with $6.5 billion in
1997. Disbursements from OCR increased by 6 percent. Disbursements from
ADF decreased by 0.9 percent, compared with 1997. For details, see Table 21
in the Statistical Annex.

The disbursement ratio,” including program loans, increased to 29.3 percent from 25.2 percent in 1997.

By volume of net flow, Republic of Korea, Indonesia, People’s Republic
of China, and Thailand were the top four beneficiaries of net transfers
from the Bank.

Cofinancing and guarantee operations

The Bank actively pursued its role as a leading catalyst in mobilizing financial
resources to its DMCs through its cofinancing and guarantee operations.
Given the financial adjustments being undertaken in the region as a result
of the financial crisis, the Bank took initiatives to help stabilize the economies
of its DMCs that have suffered from the financial crisis, and restore investor
confidence through cofinancing operations as well as direct lending to its
DMCs. The importance of cofinancing was more pronounced in 1998 because
it made long-term financing possible for some DMCs that could not otherwise

become effective during the year; excludes private sector loans.have obtained financing due to heightened risk perceptions. Cofinancing
activities have been fully integrated into the Bank’s operational processes
of country strategy formulation, programming, and project processing.

In 1998, cofinancing mobilized from all sources amounted to nearly
$3 billion for 24 projects, close to 50 percent of the Bank’s total lending of
about $6 billion. This level of cofinancing for the year was significant in view
of the difficult market conditions resulting from the financial crisis. It represents a 67 percent increase over the $1.8 billion? achieved in 1997. Some
of the important cofinancing operations during the year include (i) a $950 million syndicated loan for the Export Financing Facility to Thailand;* (ii) a
$526 million multitranche cofinancing for the Fujian Pacific Electric Co.
Ltd. in the PRC; and (iii) the first floating rate note (FRN) cofinancing of
$65 million for the Credit Enhancement Facility for Private Enterprises in
Sri Lanka. Projects in the financial, energy, and transport and communications sectors accounted for 34 percent, 32 percent, and 17 percent, respectively, of the cofinancing volume in 1998. In terms of the number of projects
that received cofinancing, the transport and communications sector had
seven, followed by the social infrastructure sector with six, and the energy
and agriculture and natural resource sectors with three each. Cofinancing
came from official, export credit, and commercial sources. For details, see
Table 16 in the Statistical Annex.

Eleven DMCs received cofinancing in 1998, with Thailand as the top
recipient with $950 million, followed by the PRC with $948 million, Philippines
with $683 million, and Viet Nam with $152 million.

During 1970-1998, a total of 496 Bank-assisted loan projects and programs attracted cumulative total cofinancing of $29.6 billion. This amount
consists of $19.7 billion from official sources, $5.2 billion from commercial
sources, and $4.7 billion from export credit sources. The energy sector
accounts for $14 billion or 47 percent; followed by transport and communications, $4.8 billion or 16 percent; agriculture and natural resources,
$3.7 billion or 13 percent; and other sectors, $7.1 billion or 24 percent.

Official cofinancing

Cofinancing from bilateral and multilateral funding agencies amounted to
nearly $1 billion or 33 percent of total cofinancing in 1998, a decrease of
17 percent from $1.2 billion in 1997. Sixteen projects received official development assistance funds in 1998, compared with 30 in 1997. This decrease
is mainly because of the lower lending programs in Cambodia, India, and
Pakistan. Bilateral sources contributed $914 million or 92 percent of official
sources, while multilateral sources contributed $77.2 million or 8 percent.
Bilateral cofinancing support was received from eight countries: Australia,
Canada, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom (UK), and United
States (US). Japan continued to be the largest source of official cofinancing

with a total of $842.1 million for seven projects, comprising $518.1 million
from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), $300 million from
the Export-Import Bank of Japan (JEXIM), and $24 million from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency. This amount included two projects in
the Philippines cofinanced by JEXIM and OECF under the New Miyazawa
Initiative. Multilateral agencies, including Nordic Development Fund and
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for
International Development, provided parallel cofinancing.

The Bank actively pursued cofinancing from official donors for technical
assistance. This included annual contributions to the Japan Special Fund
(JSF) and untied grants from bilateral sources. The mode of cofinancing used
was normally exclusive or joint-financing arrangements. During 1998, untied
grants from bilateral sources where the Bank acted as grant administrator
amounted to $6.9 million. Donors from bilateral sources included the governments of Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, New Zealand, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and US. In addition, multilateral agencies, including ADB Institute, Global Environment Facility, United Nations Development
Programme, and World Bank, provided a total of $12.4 million in untied
grants, which are being administered by the Bank. For details, see GrantFinanced Technical Assistance from Other Sources, 1998 on page 5.

Under the JSF program financed by the Government of Japan, a total
of $89.2 million for 116 technical assistance projects was financed on an
untied basis in 1998, accounting for 55 percent of all technical assistance
approvals. For details, see Japan Special Fund Technical Assistance by Sector,
1998 on page 161.

During 1998, the Government of Switzerland committed to make available
to the Bank additional contributions to finance, on an untied basis, technical
assistance projects under channel financing arrangements administered by the
Bank. Italy also agreed to consider establishing a similar channel financing
arrangement with the Bank. In addition, the Bank assisted some DMCs in
obtaining grant financing on a parallel basis complementary to Bank loans.

Commercial cofinancing and guarantee operations

As a result of continued Bankwide efforts to seek commercial funding,
cofinancing from market sources increased to $1.8 billion in 1998 from
$591.9 million in 1997, and accounted for 60 percent of total cofinancing
mobilized in 1998. The share of commercial cofinancing in total cofinancing
exceeded that of official cofinancing for the first time, and it is expected that
the relative share of commercial cofinancing will remain larger than that of
official cofinancing in the future. During the year, eight transactions were
completed, including six loans arranged for public sector borrowers, one
FRN, and one loan arranged for private sector borrowers. Two commercial
cofinancing transactions were arranged with the support of the Bank’s partial
credit guarantee: a $65 million, 10-year FRN for the Sri Lanka Credit
Enhancement Facility for Private Enterprises, and a $950 million, five-year
syndicated loan facility for the Thailand Export Financing Facility. The
guarantee for the former covered the bullet repayment at year 10. The
guarantee for the latter covered the principal repayments and interest payments for the first three years, extendable to the fourth year if Thailand doesnot achieve the expected investment grade rating at the end of the third
year. Given the uncertain market conditions, the Bank expects an increase
in the use of credit enhancements, including guarantees, in its future
commercial cofinancing transactions.

Export credit cofinancing

Cofinancing amounted to $128.4 million, and was provided by export credit
agencies from France and Spain for a private BOT power project in the PRC.

Portfolio management
Administration

A total of 489 projects were under administration as of end-1998, comprising
435 projects in the public sector and 54 projects in the private sector. Of
the public sector projects, implementation progress was satisfactory for
364 projects, including 21 projects highly satisfactory. These projects conformed to implementation schedules and project costs, and complied with
loan covenants and submission dates of audited financial statements. Thirtyfive projects were rated partly satisfactory and 36 were unsatisfactory,
experiencing implementation or operational problems. In terms of the likelihood of achieving development objectives, as jointly rated by the Bank and
the executing agencies, 402 projects were rated satisfactory, including
13 projects as highly satisfactory, while 26 projects were rated partly satisfactory and the remaining 7 projects unsatisfactory. These ratings resulted
from an assessment of the development outcomes, impacts, or benefits expected
from various project components and outputs.

Altogether, 861 project administration reviews, including private sector
loan and multiproject reviews, were fielded to assess the progress of projects
and to discuss problems, if any, with executing agencies. A total of 9,307 persondays were spent on these project reviews, which translates into an average
of 15 person-days per project.

The Bank’s 11 regional and resident missions provided support to executing
agencies in project administration and strengthening of project implementation. Monthly meetings were held to review and discuss project implementation performance, and executing agencies were assisted with the Bank’s
guidelines for procurement and on the use of consultants, disbursements,
audit requirements, and other operational matters. To date, administration
of a total of 142 loans for 136 projects has been delegated to the five resident
missions—Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan—and the South Pacific
Regional Mission. More responsibility will be delegated to them commensurate with their project implementation administration capacity.

Country portfolio review missions were undertaken in 15 DMCs to
discuss implementation problems, cross-sectoral issues, and remedial measures with senior government officials. In particular, the portfolios in Indonesia,
Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Thailand were restructured
for better management, resulting in the cancellation of $1.4 billion of the
total net loan proceeds ($9.3 billion) involving 111 projects.

number of reports prepared as of end-1998 to 816. For details, see Table 24
in the Statistical Annex.

As in earlier years, project administration procedures continued to be
revised in light of the Bank’s strategic plan. In 1998, the project performance report (PPR), which replaced the project administration committee
(PAC) notes, was implemented Bankwide. The PPR introduced new project
rating criteria that are more stringent and consistent. Computer systems
continued to be upgraded for better monitoring and evaluation of benefits.
Most notably, a user-friendly client/server-based project processing information system became operational, and several Bankwide reports, which
were formerly produced in hardcopy format, were made available on-line.
These reports include Quarterly Procurement Statistics, Technical Assistance
Implementation Status, and Contract Awards and Disbursement Statistics.
Fourteen seminars and workshops were held to enhance the implementation capabilities of executing agencies. These activities benefited a total of
492 senior and middle-level officials.

Contract awards

During 1998, contracts totaling $5.8 billion (excluding contracts for technical assistance projects) were awarded by executing agencies in DMCs for
consulting services and procurement of goods, related services, and civil
works. This represented a 2.6 percent decrease from 1997. Consultancy
contracts under loan projects totaled $157.3 million, and involved 267 consulting contracts (125 international and 142 domestic). For details, see
Tables 25-30 in the Statistical Annex.

For technical assistance projects, contracts were awarded for
consultancy services, amounting to $135.4 million and involving 152 consulting firms and 489 individual consultants. For details, see Tables 31
and 32 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements

The 1998 loan disbursements—$6.8 billion—exceeded the year’s target
of $5.6 billion by 21.4 percent, and 1997 figures by 4.8 percent. Of the 1998
total, OCR disbursements amounted to $5.6 billion and ADF disbursements to $1.1 billion, representing 83.1 percent and 16.9 percent of the
total amount, respectively.

Private sector investment portfolio

The Bank’s private sector investment portfolio at the end of 1998 totaled
$1.1 billion, up by 3 percent from about $1 billion in 1997. The increase of
$26 million was the net result of new approvals, disbursements, repayments,
disposals, cancellations, prepayments, write-offs, and currency translation
adjustments. Of the total portfolio, 60 percent was in loans amounting to
$631 million and $412 million in equity investments.

The 1998 total portfolio consisted of $655 million in disbursed investments and $388 million in undisbursed commitments. The disbursed invest- Portfolio Distribution by Sector," 1998

in investment funds, along with their corresponding fund management companies. These funds comprised venture capital funds, mutual funds, private
equity funds, and larger funds that provide equity and/or debt financing to
infrastructure projects. Investments in funds enable the Bank to leverage its
own resources available to support private investment. The balance of the
portfolio (21 percent) consisted of loans and equity investments in manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries. Bank support for these sectors
started in the mid-1980s when several DMC governments began to encourage the private sector to undertake large industrial ventures, particularly
with foreign technology and investment.

At the end of 1998, the total portfolio included loans and equity
investments in 100 companies, comprising 84 country-specific companies in
13 DMCs and 16 regional financial entities and funds. The net reduction
in the number of companies in the portfolio from 104 in 1997 was the result
of the addition of five new companies, the cancellation of one investment,
the full disposal of two investments, and the write-down of six relatively
small nonperforming accounts. Of the 100 companies comprising the portfolio, 59 were operating profitably, 9 were in various stages of implementation, and 32 were underperforming. The underperfoming companies include
those that became problematic because of the Asian financial crisis and
those whose problems were exacerbated by the crisis. These underperforming
investments are being closely supervised and a few of them were the subject
of workout efforts in 1998.

Interest and other income earned on the private sector portfolio in 1998
totaled $30 million, compared with $29 million in 1997. Dividends received
amounted to $18.2 million (7.4 percent yield), a threefold increase from the
previous year’s $5.9 million (2.7 percent yield). This hefty growth in dividend receipts was due mainly to a BOT power project that started to pay66 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

dividends in 1998. Capital gains made on equity divestments during the year
amounted to $3.7 million, up by 12 percent from $3.3 million in 1997.

The continuing adverse impact of the financial crisis resulted in increased
loss provisions in 1998 for the affected investments. Thus, the allowance for
possible losses on impaired loans and equity investments rose by 25 percent
to $114.9 million at the end of 1998 from $91.6 million in 1997. This loss
allowance represented 13.2 percent of the disbursed portfolio at the end of
1998, compared with 9.3 percent in 1997.

Performance evaluation and development impact

In line with the Bank’s increasing concern about the effectiveness of its
development assistance, the Postevaluation Office (PEO)® undertook various activities in 1998 aimed at enhancing Bank operations. A major initiative was the preparation of the first country assistance program evaluation
(CAPE), which reviews the Bank’s overall assistance to a DMC. It was also
during the year that the PPR was institutionalized to replace the PAC notes
as the document to be used in recording the implementation progress and
potential achievement of development objectives for all ongoing projects.
Together with the Central Operations Services Office, PEO acted as the
focal point for monitoring progress and providing assistance in accomplishing
PPRs. Projects staff were also provided relevant training on a limited scale.
PEO recently enhanced its feedback system by launching on the Internet a
web page on evaluation findings and lessons. Links with the web sites of
other international funding organizations provide an easy way of sharing
evaluation information with DMCs as well as the general public.

PEO plays a coordinating role for evaluation by all operational units
within the Bank to facilitate lesson learning. PEO is increasingly looking
at larger units than the traditional single completed project or program.

In 1998, PEO completed 44 evaluation reports comprising 21 project
performance audit reports (PPARs), 4 technical assistance performance audit
reports, 3 impact evaluation studies, 4 reevaluation studies, 5 special evaluation studies, 2 technical assistance completion reports, 1 CAPE, 1 sector
synthesis, the Twentieth Annual Review of Evaluation Reports, the 1998 Annual
Performance Evaluation Program and Review of 1997 Activities (APEP), and
the Seventeenth Report of Postevaluation Abstracts.

Project performance audit reports

Half of PEO’s efforts in 1998 were directed toward PPARs. Selected to reflect
the variety of the Bank’s loan portfolio, 21 projects were so covered. Of these,
16 were ADF-only countries and 5 were ADF-OCR blend countries. See
Classification of Countries box on page 51. By sector, there were 10 projects
in agriculture and natural resources, 4 in transport and communications, 3 in
energy, 2 in social infrastructure, and 2 in the financial sector.

completed projects to (i) provide accountability to its shareholders, and
(ii) distill lessons of experience with a view
to improving the design of future projects
and the quality and development impact
of its lending to its developing member
countries. A two-step evaluation system is
followed. The first step consists of the preparation of project/program completion reports (PCRs) for all completed projects/
programs by the operational divisions responsible for their processing and implementation, the principle being that for most
effective learning and impact on future
operations, the initial evaluation should
be carried out by those who have been
directly involved. To ensure an independent
evaluation, the second step consists of the
preparation of project/program performance
audit reports (PPARs) by the Postevaluation
Office (PEO). The PPAR is an evaluation
of the effectiveness and sustainability of a
project/program in achieving its objectives.

The PPAR audits the PCR for adequacy
and integrity, and focuses on specific issues
meriting closer attention.

On the basis of implementation experience, expected performance, and development impact, projects are classified as
generally successful, partly successful, or unsuccessful. A project is generally successful
if it is expected to be economically viable or
can generate socioeconomic benefits commensurate with original expectations and/
or costs incurred. A project is partly successful if its benefits are believed to be sustainable at reduced levels, with reasonable
prospects for improvement if remedial
actions are taken. If a project is not technically and/or economically viable, it is classified as unsuccessful. Such classification
made at the time of the PPAR may be revised during subsequent reevaluation. A
partly successful project is not to be viewed
as an unsuccessful project; and, by the nature of the Bank’s development mission,
unsuccessful projects are expected.

Cumulatively, by the end of the year, 521 PPARs had been prepared for

Evaluation is undertaken by PEO
not only through the preparation of PPARs
but also through evaluation studies that
are aimed at more intensive analysis of
particular issues or subjects of broader
relevance to the Bank’s operations, practices, and procedures. These comprise
impact evaluation, reevaluation, and
special studies.

Impact evaluation provides insights into
the extent to which the benefits of Bank
lending in a particular sector are spread
and sustained.

Reevaluation focuses in-depth analyses on project impact and sustainability
about five years after the PPAR stage.

Special studies provide intensive analyses of particular issues, or comprehensive
reviews of evaluation findings in a specific
country or sector.

Evaluation by the PEO has been
expanded to include the Bank’s technical
assistance operations.

542 projects and programs covering all major sectors and subsectors in
26 DMCs.’ Of these, 57 percent were classified as generally successful, 32 percent as partly successful, and 11 percent as unsuccessful; two were not rated.

Of the 21 projects evaluated during the year, 9 (43 percent) were classified as generally successful, another 9 as partly successful, and 3 (14 percent) as unsuccessful. Given the small sample size by sector of this year’s
evaluated projects, an annual comparison of performance was not attempted.

Except for one unsuccessful project, those in the agriculture sector were
either generally or partly successful. Success was enhanced by appropriate
questioning of design and by making alterations during implementation.
Some problems could have been foreseen, such as the difficulty of dealing
with multiple government agencies, the poor capacity of executing agencies, insufficient attention to benefit monitoring and evaluation, and
inadequate provision for operation and maintenance after loan closing.
Several projects demonstrated the importance of considering the capacities,
needs, and priorities of target groups.

Three transport projects were successful because their designs were
based on adequate investigations and use of good construction practices and
materials. The designs also allowed for flexibility in making modifications

too sophisticated and import-dependent.

The two projects in the social infrastructure sector were partly successful,
having both design and implementation deficiencies. An agricultural education project in the Philippines neither properly considered the aspirations of
potential students nor institutionalized benefit monitoring and evaluation.
The other project, the Second Health and Population Project in Pakistan, did
not heed the lessons learned from the first such project in the country.

The two financial sector projects were classified as partly successful.
Both achieved the objective of providing much-needed foreign currency to
the recipient institutions. However, subproject performance was mixed,
particularly in terms of repayment. The key areas of credit analysis, risk
evaluation, ongoing portfolio monitoring, and loan collection needed attention.

Total project costs of all the evaluated projects had originally been
estimated at $1.1 billion. Actual costs upon completion came to $1 billion—
lower by less than 3 percent. The total loan amount for all was estimated
at $507.7 million, while the actual loans disbursed totaled about 4 percent
lower, at $486.1 million. The factors responsible for underruns in both
project costs and Bank financing included scaling down of original scope,
overestimation of costs during appraisal, depreciation of the local currency
against the dollar, and underutilization of credit lines. Projects classified as
generally successful accounted for 65 percent of actual project costs and
50 percent of loan amounts disbursed, showing that
larger projects tend to perform better.

design specifications should be sufficiently detailed to ensure the allocation of appropriate resources; and (v) whenever considerable delays are

commercial viability and debt servicing capacity.

Technical assistance performance audit reports

In line with PEO’s recent initiative to assess the Bank’s technical assistance
operations by evaluating a cluster of technical assistance, four technical
assistance performance audit reports were prepared in 1998. They relate to
four advisory technical assistance grants for strengthening the capacity of the
Ministry of Finance in Bhutan; five for supporting the development of financial
intermediation through institutional strengthening or subsector studies in
the PRC; nine in the power subsector in India—the first evaluation report
prepared for that subsector in the country; and three on capacity building
in the financial sector of Viet Nam.

In Bhutan, except for the technical assistance that aimed to undertake
final modifications of a previous technical assistance, the others covered by
the review performed less satisfactorily; the lack of institutional analysis and
performance criteria impeded both their design and effectiveness. In the
PRC, two technical assistance grants were generally successful and three
partly successful; performance varied depending on the initial conditions of
the targeted institutions and subsectors, appropriateness of design, and performance of the consultants. In India, seven of the technical assistance
grants fully achieved their objectives in terms of policy/plan development,
institutional support, and capacity building. Of these, four are currently
being administered and are contributing substantially to the ongoing reform
process in Gujarat—demonstrating the Bank’s leverage in accelerating the
reform process. In Viet Nam, the three technical assistance grants contributed significantly to capacity building and institutional development; however, some of the specific objectives of two of these—Strategic Development
Plan for a Money Market and Operationalization of the Debt Management
and Financial Analysis System—were not fully met.

Impact evaluation studies

During the year, PEO carried out three such studies. A study in Bangladesh
assessed the adequacy, implementation experience, and operational performance of 32 project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) grants in the
agriculture and natural resource sector, as well as their impact and effectiveness in contributing to the performance of ensuing projects. A study of
secondary science education projects in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan

Operational Priorities 6970 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Economic and Social Benefits of Selected Projects

Mn of the projects evaluated in 1998
were found to have provided tangible economic and social benefits. Some
addressed crosscutting issues such as poverty reduction, gender and development,
and environmental protection.

Under the Highland Livestock and
Development Project in Bhutan, dairy and
marketing development enabled farmers
to double their average income from the
sale of livestock products. Also, the
project benefited farmers in remote areas
through the provision of solar panels for
the generation of electricity.

The Irrigated Command Area
Development Project in Indonesia had a
positive impact on the environment. Drainage improvement measures undertaken in
selected flood-prone areas and localized

 

The Bank continues to evaluate its projects to determine their impact on targeted

swamps in Bengkulu reduced the incidence
of malaria and permitted year-round
productive use of frequently flooded land
and reclaimed areas.

In Pakistan, 72 percent of the users of
the primary health care facilities established
under the Second Health and Population
Project were women and children. The
project contributed to better child spacing
and improved women’s health, and enabled
women to engage in additional economic
activities. The participation of midwives
and rural female health workers highlights
the advantages of employing the services
of women in family planning activities.

The project to expand the Fauji
Fertilizer Co. Ltd. in Pakistan has created
substantial employment opportunities for
the local population near the site and in
other areas where companies providing
support services to the fertilizer industry
are based. Local inhabitants have also benefited from the plant’s various social programs, including funds provided for a local
government school and a medical clinic.

The construction of small-scale communal irrigation systems, rural roads, and
foot bridges, as well as the provision of
support services under the Highland
Agriculture Development Project in the

Philippines, resulted in increased cropping
intensity in vegetable-growing areas and
an increase in yields and farmed area in
rice-growing areas. The roads have
hastened the introduction of more profitable vegetable crops.

In Sri Lanka, the Secondary Towns
Power Distribution Project reduced system losses and improved the quality of
electricity supply. The shift to electricity
is believed to have reduced the potential
for fires and resultant injuries from storing
kerosene or maintaining a standby diesel
generator. Street lighting is claimed to have
improved security.

focused on the projects’ impact on institutions, graduates, and the policy and
management environment. The third study looked at Bank assistance to the
power subsector in Pacific DMCs.

The Bangladesh study found that PPTAs tend to produce a project
design based on a predetermined project concept, rather than being a feasibility
study to develop a project to achieve certain outcomes. There was minimal
transfer of skills through most PPTAs, and the executing agencies generally
did not improve their capacity to design projects themselves. The study on
science education projects showed that, while the projects improved the
institutional capacities of science education centers and secondary schools,
such improvement did not always filter down to the students in terms of better
learning achievements in science and related subjects. The main constraint
continued to be suboptimal classroom conditions. Despite their shortcomings,
the projects helped make the administrative and policy environments moreconducive to science education, and provided important building blocks for
the long-term development of the secondary education system as a whole.
The final study showed that, other than in Fiji, power projects in Pacific
DMCs have had limited direct development impact largely because of
institutional weaknesses. The utilities are generally poorly managed and
have financial problems. The successful projects are highly correlated
with strong and adaptable institutions, and the failures, with weak institutions. The use of financial covenants alone to secure reforms apparently has been the wrong approach to dealing with structural problems such
as tariffs and lack of autonomy.

All three studies point to the need to strengthen technical assistance,
both project preparatory and advisory, and to further improve loan projects.
Specifically, PPTAs should undertake rigorous institutional capacity studies, develop executing agencies, be participatory, identify and analyze
project risks, and incorporate project performance indicators. Advisory
technical assistance should focus on improving (i) operation and maintenance, (ii) standards of safety and environmental protection, (iii) efficiency
and lower costs, (iv) management capacity for both administration and
planning, (v) reporting and increased transparency of operations, and
(vi) measurement of performance.

Reevaluation studies

Reevaluation studies were undertaken for two projects each in the agriculture and education sectors.

Reevaluation of the Sabah/Sarawak Fisheries Infrastructure Project in
Malaysia was conducted six years after its PPAR, which was done within a
year of project completion. At that time, both subprojects were assessed as
generally successful based on the expectations that there would be no adverse
environmental or social impact, and that the project would be sustainable
and all project facilities fully utilized by 1997. These expectations did not
materialize, though, and the facilities were still underutilized at the time of
reevaluation. The project’s contribution to fisheries output in Sabah has
been limited, and in Sarawak very small, and its rating on reevaluation was
therefore unsuccessful. The failure of the original PEO evaluation to identify
trends correctly highlights the usefulness of undertaking a reevaluation several years after the original evaluation.

The Palawan Integrated Area Development Project in the Philippines
was classified as partly successful both in the PPAR and at reevaluation. The
lower-than-anticipated project impact and the low sustainability of some
project benefits reflect important design weaknesses, including inadequate
information and database; inadequate consideration of existing farming systems; limited consultation with intended beneficiaries and other stakeholders;
and failure to recognize sociological and institutional constraints and the risk of
a sudden shift to high-technology, multitier cropping systems. Except for the
ports and malaria eradication components, which were by and large successful,
the operational success and the impact on farm incomes of the other components
such as irrigation, agricultural intensification and diversification, and livestock
were below targets and continue to decline. The socioeconomic impact of the
project, though positive, has been less than expected.

The Technical and Vocational Education Project in the Philippines had not
been evaluated in a PPAR, but was selected for study to assess its long-term
sustainability and impact. The project aimed to improve planning and
management of the subsector, promote research and curriculum development, institute in-service training for teaching and nonteaching staff, and
enable technical education institutions (TEIs) to deliver an improved training program for middle-level technicians. It was completed in 1989 and was
assessed in the PCR to have contributed to upgrading the quality of middlelevel technical human resources required for social and economic development. However, the project was rated only partly successful by the reevaluation
study. It improved the physical and human resources of the TEIs, but did
not contribute to better management of the subsector. Reevaluation highlighted the importance of locating a TEI close to relevant industries to
facilitate interaction between it and industries, thus ensuring the relevance
of the program content, minimizing the cost to students of on-the-job training, and facilitating their eventual employment.

Reevaluation of the Second Vocational Education Project in Thailand
confirmed the generally successful rating in the PPAR. The project not only
contributed to Thailand’s industrial development in the past two decades,
but also expanded the technical and vocational education system in the
country. It helped the Government to provide equitable access to quality
technical education for more balanced national growth. Sustainability is
assured by the institutional and policy frameworks in which technical and
vocational education is now viewed and implemented in the country. The
success and quality of upgrading technical education and vocational training
in Thailand underline the importance of providing assistance and policy
guidelines over the long term in the education subsector.

Special evaluation studies

Five special evaluation studies were carried out. The study of port projects
in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines reviewed the Bank’s operational policies and strategies in the subsector by assessing the effectiveness
of past Bank-funded port projects in these countries. It identified the changes
in the transport sector and the port subsector, particularly those that would
affect future Bank lending. The results show that the considerable amount
of infrastructure provided has allowed the ports to grow in response to
rapidly growing traffic. However, the need for Bank support of such capital
investment has declined as the private sector has demonstrated a willingness
to participate where the returns are reasonable. The study highlights the
need for a new approach for Bank assistance to the subsector that looks
beyond the provision of physical infrastructure, facilities, and equipment to
the efficiency with which these assets are used and the ability of ports management to provide services that facilitate trade.

The study on the operation and maintenance of road facilities and their
impact on project sustainability reviewed 40 Bank-assisted road projects in
five countries—PRC, Fiji, Lao PDR, Nepal, and Thailand. The Bank’s experience
in these countries shows that paucity of funds for operation and maintenance
leads to weak institutional capacities reflected in the lack of adequate management information systems and the shortage of skilled staff. However, evenOperational Priorities "3

with insufficient funds, operation and maintenance receives better attention
in countries with stronger economies and/or with a better developed road
network such as PRC, Fiji, and Thailand. For weaker economies, an option
for dealing with such costs is to construct well-designed roads that require
less maintenance. Operation and maintenance can then focus more on operational
aspects, particularly road safety and traffic management, that can gain public
support easily as their impacts are immediate and highly visible. The study
recommends that DMCs and the Bank strengthen their efforts in road financing
and cost-recovery measures, institutional programs, standardization of maintenance equipment, linking disbursement with adherence to loan covenants, and
participation of road users and beneficiaries.

An evaluation of the Bank’s midterm review
process for project lending was conducted to
determine whether it should be retained. The
findings show that the midterm review is the only
mechanism available for taking corrective action
during project implementation, thus playing an
important role in the Bank’s efforts toward improving project quality. However, this potential
was found to be underused because of limited
staff resources and mission budgets. While a properly structured midterm review requires significantly more resources than a regular review, there
are proportionately greater benefits in the form of
reduced implementation costs. The Bank should
earmark resources for project administration over
and above the current allocation if an effective
midterm review system is to be established. All
loan agreements should specify a milestone or
date at which a decision should be made on whether
a midterm review is needed. A position paper
would be prepared at that time to assess project
progress and to identify relevant issues, including
terms of reference for the review. Preparatory work
for the review should involve the executing/implementing agencies, ministries of finance and planning, and other stakeholders. The study also
recommends that such reviews question the relevance of project objectives in light of the changing conditions, consider social and environmental
aspects, and compare them with the original
environmental impact assessment (EIA) and related covenants specified in the loan documents.

A study of the factors affecting project performance in the agriculture and social infrastructure sectors was an attempt at using statistical
techniques to identify explanatory variables for
success and failure specific to these sectors. The - <
major findings of the study are as follows: The Bank’s Policy on Indigenous Peoples ensures that they participate in and

schedule and disbursement levels is insufficient to improve projects in these
sectors; (ii) both project-specific and external factors that impact significantly
on project performance should be given equal attention; (iii) a policy environment favorable to project operation, government commitment to a project,
and provision of counterpart funds can improve project performance significantly; and (iv) project success in the sectors depends on the executing
agency's capability to supervise project implementation and to use facilities
properly, and on its commitment to maintenance and repair. The study also
suggests a need for a critical review of Bank policies and practices relating
to PPTAs to enhance their contribution to project performance.

the PRC showed a positive trend when

A study of the environmental mitigation
measures in selected Bank-financed projects
focused on two thermal energy generation
projects each in PRC, India, Indonesia, and
Philippines, and two urban development projects
in Indonesia. These four countries account for
about half of all Bank lending in the power
sector. The study found that the EIA process
required by the Bank has often resulted in
successful identification and mitigation of major
environmental problems. The projects studied
generally complied with the environmental protection regulations and guidelines of their
respective DMCs, although the mandates and
capacities of the environmental management
agencies (EMAs) to regulate and monitor
environmental mitigation measures (EMMs)
seemed low. EMMs were often designed after
the site and the technologies for the plant had
been selected. Some of the study’s major recommendations are as follows: (i) the Bank
should consider more detailed itemizing and
earmarking of greater portions of project
financing to implement EMMs; (ii) the Bank
needs to develop and implement an EMM evaluation and reporting system for sensitive projects;
(iii) the Bank should promote regular external
audits of large power plants to ensure compliance with regulations, and should continue to
develop the institutional capacities, as well as
the enforcement, compliance, and monitoring
capabilities of EMAs; and (iv) the EIA should
be done during the feasibility stage, prior to
finalizing the site and type of technology.

Country assistance program evaluation
In 1998, PEO reviewed the Bank’s assistance

program in the PRC from 1987 to 1997 and
assessed the relevance, efficacy, andeffectiveness of past Bank operations there. This initial CAPE assessed the
relevance of the Bank’s strategy in terms of the needs of the PRC and the
constraints that narrow the choice of strategic options. At the beginning,
the financial and industry sectors dominated the Bank’s operations in the
country; over the years, the transport and communications, energy, and
environment sectors have become the main areas of concentration. Overall, the quality of the Bank’s portfolio in the agriculture, financial, and
industry sectors revealed mixed results. In contrast, the completed projects
in energy and infrastructure indicated a positive trend. The major recommendations of the evaluation are as follows: (i) the country operational strategy should provide a better basis for evaluation of success,
while the country assistance plan should reflect the directions provided
by the strategy; (ii) the Bank should support the recently established
Inspectorate under the State Development Planning Commission to
improve development impact and project quality; (iii) although the PRC
has considerable strengths in the areas of project planning and preparation, the Bank needs to apply diligence in reviewing and accepting
projects; (iv) the Bank’s technical assistance program in the PRC should
be more focused and managed more effectively; (v) high-level policy
dialogue between the Bank and the PRC is needed to agree on better
linkage between technical assistance and loans; (vi) the Bank should
consider classifying social safety net projects as poverty projects; and
(vii) the Bank should broaden its approach in the environment subsector to
cover preservation of the natural environment, especially living natural
resources.

Annual performance evaluation program

This year’s APEP focused on the activities of various departments and offices
as they relate to project and portfolio performance, with a view to providing
more effective feedback from Bankwide assessment of project performance
for improving project quality. It provided both a review of activities in 1997,
together with activities for 1998, and an update of actions on recommendations made under earlier APEPs. A key conclusion of this year’s review
is that the most important action the Bank can take to improve portfolio
performance and project outcomes is to strengthen the quality of its own
project supervision. This requires an improved performance measurement
and monitoring system, which the introduction of the PPR and the project
performance management system (PPMS) targets. Almost as important is
the need for more thorough and comprehensive economic and sector analyses to help improve project identification and design. The other recommendations are (i) support for the interdepartmental working group
recommendations on improving the country operational strategy/assistance
plan process and country portfolio review missions (CPRMs), including the
establishment of performance targets; (ii) systematic evaluation of the country operational strategy and reassessment of its relevance on a yearly basis
through the country assistance plan exercise; and (iii) support for the proposed guidelines for the CPRM, which cover the need for a review of sector
and policy issues affecting portfolio performance, and for developing appropriate
performance indicators, an area where more work is needed.

Strengthening the performance evaluation capability of DMCs

In 1998, PEO administered three technical assistance grants aimed at developing
or strengthening the PPMS in Nepal, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, and one
technical assistance to the PRC for strengthening evaluation capacity. The
technical assistance completion report (TCR) prepared in 1998 on the evaluation of Bank assistance to DMCs for benefit monitoring and evaluation
(BME) highlighted the need to improve BME by establishing conceptual
clarity and changing the terminology itself to reflect the revised concept.
The technical assistance resulted in initiating a shift to the PPMS as the
Bank’s approach to monitoring and evaluating projects. Following the technical assistance, all new projects under processing are expected to have a
PPMS properly built into them. A handbook on the PPMS as a practical
guide for Bank staff and DMC counterparts was developed to facilitate the
shift to the new system. The TCR on the study of project planning and
management in the PRC highlights the effectiveness of conducting workshops to share development experiences of best practices in project planning
and management among the Bank’s member countries. Such workshops not
only enhance project quality but also strengthen partnership among DMCs,
and between the Bank and its DMCs.

Feedback of postevaluation findings

The computerized postevaluation information system, which was made
accessible on-line to Bank staff in 1997, was expanded. By the fourth quarter
of 1998, PEO had operationalized web sites to enhance the current feedback
system. An Internet page enables external downloading of documents, and
advanced searches for information in evaluation reports. It contains links
with the web sites of other organizations and provides an easy way of sharing
evaluation information with DMCs as well as the general public. A new
Internet facility enables keyword searching and easier access within the Bank
to PEO’s extensive existing database of evaluation results.Regional Highlights 7

Developing Asia

he slowdown in Asian growth—that began with the export

deceleration of 1996 and worsened with the 1997 currency

crisis—turned into a widespread regional contraction in 1998.

Economic growth in developing Asia at over 1 percent was

the lowest since the post-World War II period. Net private
capital flows to developing Asia, which reached nearly $170 billion in 1996,
fell to an estimated $16 billion in 1998, according to information released by
the Institute of International Finance, Inc. The data reflect a net outflow of
$30 billion in 1998 from Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines,
and Thailand. This brought about a financial crunch that led central banks
into monetary contraction, reducing domestic demand and exacerbating the
problem of nonperforming assets in the banking subsector. Although currencies
remained depreciated well below their precrisis levels, export earnings did not
respond to the exchange rate stimulus. Contributing factors included the
decline in export prices, especially in dollar terms; the severe import
compression that adversely affected exports; and the tight export credit
faced by companies, particularly small and medium enterprises.

Factors that contributed to the protracted nature of the crisis were
pegged exchange rates, financial sector fragility, and weak governance capability.
Southeast Asia remained at the center of the crisis, with Indonesia suffering
a large economic contraction, and Malaysia and Thailand experiencing substantial declines. Of the four newly industrialized economies (NIEs), only
Taipei,China weathered the storm without major damage. The economy of
the Republic of Korea suffered a major contraction. Hong Kong, China; and
Singapore were unable to avoid the impact of the regional slowdown on their
trade- and financial services-based economies. The crisis revealed that a
careful sequencing of reforms was necessary. Countries that strengthened
their financial sector prior to the adoption of capital account convertibility
fared better during the crisis. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the
economies in South Asia, which were less exposed to international capital
flows or had exchange controls, did relatively better than the rest of the
Asian and Pacific region. Growth in the Central Asian republics was constrained by the Asian and Russian crises. The Pacific economies continued
to experience economic difficulties in 1998.

Currency devaluations drove up inflation rates in several crisis-affected
Asian countries. Across Asia, the average rate of consumer price inflation
rose to over 8 percent from 4.7 percent in 1997. The rupiah’s sharp depreciation against the United States (US) dollar in late 1997 resulted in doubledigit inflation in Indonesia. More moderate depreciations in the Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand also prompted increases in inflation.78 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Elsewhere—notably in Hong Kong, China—monetary contractions
implemented to defend the currency exerted deflationary pressures.
Current accounts improved throughout the region as a result
of severe import contraction and the slowdown in economic activity.
From an approximate balance in 1997, Asia’s aggregate current
account moved to a surplus in 1998. Most of that improvement
came from reduced imports rather than increased exports.
Weak banking and governance systems contributed to Asia’s
initial vulnerability to capital flow reversals. Loss of confidence
in the banking system converted the currency depreciation into
a full-blown financial crisis. Financial sector and governance reforms
are progressing in the Republic of Korea and Thailand and, to
some extent, in Indonesia. The ratio of nonperforming loans to
total lending continued to rise in 1998. This was an expected
result of restructuring efforts of the banking subsector; however,
some progress was made in reducing their levels in the latter half

of 1998. The 20-30 percent regional nonperforming loan ratio

represented an equivalent percentage of output, as financial leverage

in Asian economies remained at about 100 percent of their gross
domestic product (GDP). Affected countries have been hard pressed to
clear the wave of defaults prompted by liquidity shortages, currency and
maturity mismatches, directed and connected lending, and weak prudential
standards and financial supervision.

In the first round of responses to the crisis, many countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilateral
development banks, adopted conventional strategies to reverse capital outflows, such as tightening monetary and fiscal policies, implementing financial
and other structural reforms, and floating exchange rates. However, the
social cost of these policy packages has induced a rethinking of those strategies. As the crisis continued, the most seriously affected countries, in
consultation with IMF, adopted less austere and more interventionist economic
policies to stimulate domestic demand. In September 1998, Malaysia adopted
a different policy stance: it imposed capital controls and fixed its exchange
rate at 3.8 ringgit to the US dollar. The PRC and Viet Nam also tightened
existing exchange controls. The Government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region took the exceptional step of intervening in the stock
and futures markets to deter currency manipulation.

The crisis has led to widespread bankruptcies and severe cutbacks in
public outlays on social services, including education and health. As a
result, unemployment has soared, household incomes have fallen dramatically, and human development indicators in the most seriously affected
countries have declined sharply. Without social safety nets to rely on,
the poor have suffered disproportionately from the Asian financial crisis.
During the two decades of rapid growth that preceded the crisis, the
average poverty rate in East Asia and Southeast Asia fell from 60 percent
to 26 percent. This represents a substantial increase in average living
standards for the more than 1.6 billion people living in the region.
However, since the crisis struck in mid-1997, unemployment, inflation,
and reductions in social services have combined to reduce effective
income for tens of millions. The impact of the crisis has been hardestRegional Highlights 79

on Indonesia’s poor, but lower-income groups in the Philippines, Thailand,
and elsewhere have also been adversely affected.

The global economy

The world economy grew at a much slower pace in 1998, at 2.2 percent
compared with 4.2 percent in 1997. This decline in growth was mainly because of sharp falls in output of emerging market economies, following months
of financial turbulence. Economic conditions in continental Europe and North
America remained favorable until the middle of 1998. By the middle of the
third quarter, the financial markets in the developed countries began to be
affected by the Asian financial crisis. In addition, Russia suffered from severe
financial distress in August 1998, and several Latin American countries were
affected by the contagion. Japan’s economic situation continued to deteriorate despite efforts by the Government to pump prime the economy.
Commodity prices fell by 25 percent in 1998 and are now at their lowest
levels in nominal terms since 1986, and in real terms since the early 1970s.
This is further aggravating the slump in some developing countries that are
dependent on exports of primary commodities. This development, however,
has had a favorable impact on inflation rates. Oil prices have been depressed
by market conditions of oversupply and weak Asian demand. Demand growth
was further muted by the sluggish world economy, coupled with mild winter
weather. Oil prices averaged $14 per barrel in 1998, significantly below the
$19 per barrel in 1997. Non-oil commodity prices declined by 16 percent in
1998 and are now at their lowest levels since 1986. The price of industrial
materials declined by 20 percent, reflecting the slump in economic activity
in the NIEs and the decline in industrial production in Japan. World prices

of foodstuffs fell by 14 percent in 1998. The world grain market was characterized
by good harvests in the US and stagnant import demand.

Although the effects of the contagion have tempered growth in the
developed economies of the world, the major economic blocs of North
America and Western Europe are not in recession. The European Union
economy grew by 3 percent during the first half of the year and the US
economy expanded by 4 percent over the same period. However, exports
from both regions are being affected by the recession in developing countries.
It is estimated that the Japanese economy will contract further by 2.2 percent in FY1998/99 (ending 31 March) from 0.4 percent in FY1997/98. The
main reasons for the downturn of the Japanese economy are the deterioration of the financial system and a shortfall in effective demand.

Newly industrialized economies

The crisis engulfed developing Asia’s richest economies in 1998, including the
financial centers of Hong Kong, China; and Singapore. Sharp drops in regional
trade, tourism, and financial activity slowed both economies; and the currencies and stock markets came under tremendous pressure. The generally conservative Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the stock
and futures markets in August 1998. Singapore adopted measures in the
second half of 1998 to reduce labor costs and stimulate domestic demand. The
Republic of Korea took firm steps to stabilize the financial markets, causing
the won to strengthen in the second half of 1998. Taipei,China was able to
resist the regional contagion because of a strong financial system, substantial
foreign reserves, and flexible factor markets.

Aggregate growth for the NIEs was negative, and two of the four
economies suffered recessions in 1998. Only Taipei,China managed a
Hong Kong, China : substantial growth of 4.8 percent. The Republic of Korea’s recession was
worse than anticipated. At the end of 1998, annual output fell by 5.5 percent. GDP growth in Hong Kong, China was negative 5.1 percent, while
Singapore’s GDP growth was 1.5 percent.

Reductions in export demand contributed to the contractions in
Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; and Singapore in 1998. In Hong Kong,
China; and the Republic of Korea, outflows of foreign capital forced up
domestic interest rates, thus reducing domestic demand. But investment
increased in Taipei,China, due in part to opportunities arising from privatization
of public utilities, expansion of the airline industry, and the preemptive
devaluation of the currency. The private sector accounted for all of Taipei,China’s
investment growth of about 20 percent. A strong banking system made
Taipei,China more resistant to the financial contagion than most of its neighbors.

Inflationary experiences in the NIEs in 1998 were mixed. While the
Republic of Korea faced rising prices as a result of the won’s depreciation,
Hong Kong, China had lower inflation in 1998 than in 1997, largely
because of a steep drop in asset prices. Singapore experienced asset price
deflation together with some currency depreciation, while Taipei,China
registered a moderate increase in inflation.

The poor export performance of the NIEs in 1998 largely reflected weak
demand from other crisis-affected Asian economies. Weak global demand

Republic of Koreafor electronic products also hurt exports from the NIEs. However, currency
depreciation and reduced domestic demand caused imports to contract,
resulting in trade and current account surpluses.

The number of bad loans in the financial systems increased because of
the impact of high interest rates on weak financial institutions. The two
regional financial centers experienced massive stock market swings, with
Hong Kong, China’s Hang Seng Index and the Singapore Straits Times Index
dropping by more than 30 percent and 40 percent, respectively, in 1998.
Financial links to affected countries contributed to those stock market drops.

Hong Kong, China
Economic performance

Economic growth: Despite sporadic speculative attacks, the Hong Kong
dollar has remained stable since the regional currency crisis began in mid1997. However, by the very nature of its currency board monetary system,
the stability of the exchange rate has been accompanied by high interest
rates, depressed asset prices, and a severe contraction in aggregate demand
and GDP. For the first time since Hong Kong, China adopted the currency
board arrangement in 1983, GDP contracted by 5.1 percent in 1998. The
sharp contraction in GDP led to an increase in the average unemployment
rate from 2.2 percent in 1997 to 4.7 percent in 1998.

Hong Kong, China’s stock market remained depressed in 1998. The
Hang Seng Index, which was at its peak of 16,000 in mid-1997 before the
Asian crisis erupted, declined to a five-year low of around 6,600 in August
1998. However, since then the index has picked up somewhat due partly to
a $15 billion intervention in the stock market by the HKMA. Property prices
also declined, with apartment prices and rentals, and commercial property
and office rentals all below their 1997 peaks. Property prices have declined
by over 40 percent since the Asian crisis. But as in the case of the stock
market, property prices increased toward the end of 1998, due mainly to the
introduction of various incentive schemes for residential property purchases.
The economic slowdown and declines in asset prices adversely affected
the banking subsector. Although the proportion of nonperforming loans of
banks in Hong Kong, China is low by regional standards, it increased from
less than 2 percent before the Asian crisis to 7 percent by the end of
1998. Banks in Hong Kong, China are well regulated and, on average,
well capitalized with the banks’ capital in the range of 15-20 percent of
their assets. Consequently, the main impact of the increase in nonperforming
loans was on the profitability and not on the solvency of banks. Net profits
of the listed banks declined by an average of one third in the first half
of 1998, in comparison with a year earlier.
Inflation: The stable exchange rate, high interest rates, and economic
recession led to a steady decline in inflation. Average inflation declined from
5.9 percent in 1997 to 2.8 percent in 1998.

External sector: Dollar earnings from merchandise exports declined by
7.5 percent in nominal terms in 1998. Much of this decline was because of
the lack of import demand from Japan and from the crisis-affected economies

 

 

Regional Highlights 8182 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

in the region. A weakening in exports to the PRC also contributed to the
poor export performance. With the contraction in GDP, merchandise imports
also declined by 11.6 percent in nominal terms in 1998. This led to a
substantial fall in the trade deficit. As regards services trade, exports declined
especially because of subdued demand for trade-related and other business
services in the region. Reflecting the depressed economy, imports of services
also declined in 1998. Overall, with foreign exchange reserves of $89.6 billion, Hong Kong, China’s external payments position is comfortable.

Domestic policies: The fixed exchange rate maintained under the
currency board system has served Hong Kong, China well for more than a
decade and a half. It has also withstood speculative attacks since the Asian
crisis erupted in mid-1997. The key challenge for the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is to facilitate an economic recovery
from the current recession without at the same time abandoning the currency board arrangement and the fixed exchange rate.

The pace of recovery will depend crucially on the external environment.
From the Government's side, the recovery can be facilitated by improving
the international competitiveness of the economy. Among other things, this
would require further downward adjustment in domestic costs. As
Hong Kong, China has a flexible labor market, wage declines are expected
to contribute to a downward adjustment in costs. However, as the economy
is dominated by the services sector, domestic property prices in general and
office rentals in particular play an important role in determining the costs
of operating the services sector business. The decline in office rentals and
property prices in the last year and a half should improve the international
competitiveness of the economy.

cent for many years, surged to 6.8 percent in 1998.

Inflation: The inflation rate rose to 7.5 percent in 1998 from 4.5 percent in 1997. The increase in prices was partly because of the depreciation
of the won, resulting in higher import prices.

Total 81 6,338.3 100.0External sector: After depreciating by about 50 percent against the US
dollar in January-February 1998, the won (W) stabilized at around W1,200 per
dollar toward the end of 1998. The sharp depreciation of the won has not
yet resulted in growth in exports. The dollar value of exports, which grew
by 6.7 percent in 1997, declined by 4.9 percent in 1998, marking the first
decline in the last three decades. The unprecedented economic recession has
caused a sharper decline in imports than in exports. The dollar value of
imports, which fell by 2.2 percent in 1997, declined by 36.1 percent in 1998,
resulting in a current account surplus of about $40 billion or 13 percent of
GDP. Usable foreign exchange reserves, which were dangerously low at
$8.9 billion in December 1997, increased to $48.5 billion (more than six
months’ import cover) by end-1998. External debt declined slightly to $152 billion by the end of 1998 from about $158 billion in December 1997. However,
the share of short-term debt in total external debt has declined from 40 percent in December 1997 to 21 percent in December 1998.

Domestic policies: As the won-dollar exchange rate stabilized, the
Government shifted to a less restrictive fiscal and monetary stance in mid1998 to stimulate the economy. In the supplementary budget presented in
August 1998, the fiscal deficit for 1998 was revised to about 5 percent of
GDP from the initial target deficit of 1.7 percent fixed in April 1998. Shortterm interest rates were 6-8 percent at the end of 1998, compared with over
25 percent in 1997. To cushion the adverse effects of worsening unemployment,
the Government strengthened its social safety net programs, including
providing unemployment benefits, public works, and job training. The
1998 budget provided W5.7 trillion ($4.7 billion) for financing these
programs. During the year, the Government undertook several measures
to reform the financial sector and initiate the restructuring of the corporate
subsector. Financial sector reform focused on (i) restructuring financial institutions; (ii) strengthening prudential regulation and supervision; and
(iii) capital market liberalization. Under the restructuring program, several
nonviable financial institutions were closed; the operations of several
troubled financial institutions were suspended; some banks were merged;
and a publicly funded bank recapitalization and depositor protection program was implemented. To strengthen financial sector governance, internationally comparable prudential norms for loan classification, loan-loss
provisioning, capital adequacy, and information disclosure were introduced and strengthened. The supervisory apparatus for the financial
sector was revamped, and a new regulatory body, the Financial Supervisory
Commission, was established. The capital market was liberalized by opening
up many sectors to foreign direct investment (FDI), removing the ceiling
on foreign equity holdings in domestic companies, encouraging foreign
investment in domestic bonds and short-term money market instruments
without restrictions, and allowing hostile mergers and acquisitions of
domestic companies by foreigners.

Bank operations
Against the backdrop of the currency and liquidity crisis faced by the Republic

of Korea, the Bank approved a $4 billion Financial Sector Program loan (FSPL)
and a related technical assistance loan of $15 million on 19 December 1997.

The first three tranches of the loan, amounting to $3.7 billion, have

January 1998, and $0.7 billion in December 1998.

Project implementation: The FSPL for $4 billion was to be disbursed
in four tranches. The release of the first three tranches amounting to $3.7 billion
left a balance of $300 million, which is scheduled to be released in
December 1999. The Bank has closely monitored implementation of the
program and the overall progress has been substantial.

Singapore
Economic performance

Economic growth: Bettering pessimistic midyear expectations, Singapore
achieved economic growth of 1.5 percent in 1998, compared with 7.8 percent in 1997. Nevertheless, despite sound economic fundamentals, Singapore
was not spared from the contagion. The Asian financial crisis has cut demand
for Singapore’s electronic products, as well as chemicals and refined
petroleum. Stimulative government spending, however, led to an increase
in construction output. The decline in regional trade flows reduced the
demand for shipping services. Tourism also declined as the regional recession affected incomes. The country’s financial sector, however, expanded
slightly as some international banks bolstered their Singapore operations.
Low growth caused the unemployment rate to rise to 4.5 percent—its
highest level since the recession in 1986.

Inflation: The Singapore dollar appreciated slightly against the US
dollar in 1998, permitting the Monetary Authority of Singapore to adopt a
more expansionary monetary policy in the latter part of the year. However,
with the low level of demand, the relaxation in monetary policy did not
provoke any inflationary pressures. Annual average inflation has been kept
at 1.4 percent since 1993. In 1998, Singapore actually experienced a mild
deflation as consumer prices fell by 1.5 percent.

External sector: Aside from the collapse of regional demand, a slowdown in the key export markets of the European Union and the US also
dampened export growth. Exports contracted by 5.6 percent in 1998, while
imports fell by 9 percent. As a result, Singapore’s current account surplus
increased to 18.2 percent of GDP. As did most of its neighbors, Singapore
experienced substantial capital outflows in 1998, equivalent to about 13 percent of GDP. However, the large current account surplus enabled the country to maintain its stock of foreign reserves at around $73 billion.

Domestic policies: Low growth reduced revenues by about 1.3 percent
of GDP, resulting in a budget deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 1998. The
Government bolstered the fiscal stimulus in the middle of the year by increasing
outlays on infrastructure, providing rebates on property tax, and expanding
credit for small businesses. To make the economy more competitive, following devaluations of neighboring currencies, the Government persuaded workers
and employers to agree on a broad wage reduction to keep down unit labor
costs. To counter the negative effects of the wage reduction on domestic
demand, the required contributions to the national pension fund was reducedRegional Highlights 85

from 40 to 30 percent of wages. Toward the end of the year, the Monetary
Authority moved to reduce interest rates.

Taipei,China
Economic performance

Economic growth: Taipei,China was also affected by the Asian financial
crisis, particularly in terms of weakening export demand. Consequently, real
GDP growth slowed to 4.8 percent in 1998 from 6.8 percent in 1997.
Taipei,China’s economy is structurally sound, with an industrial base that
is, for the most part, internationally competitive, adaptable, and relatively
unburdened by foreign debt. The financial sector is generally well supervised
and has a low nonperforming loan ratio of less than 5 percent. These factors
have underpinned a prolonged period of strong growth in per capita GDP
and generated consistent surpluses on the trade and current accounts, thereby
boosting international reserves. There are reports, however, that in recent
months, Taipei,China’s industry sector and export growth has been affected
by the overall weak market conditions.

Inflation: Inflation rose to 1.7 percent, which is modest by international
standards. Both wholesale and consumer price indexes showed moderate
increases. Low international raw material prices and decreasing tariff rates,
as well as stable nontraded goods prices with respect to housing and transport
and communications, have helped create a low inflation environment.

External sector: The economic slowdown in the region affected
Taipei,China’s trade performance last year. As about half of Taipei,China’s
exports are for Asian markets, its exports fell by 9.4 percent in 1998 on a
customs basis. With domestic consumption and investment adversely affected
by the economic downturn, imports also declined. Despite declining exports,
Taipei,China continuously generated surpluses in its merchandise trade account
and its current account, and maintained the steady growth of its foreign
exchange reserves. Taipei,China’s $90 billion foreign exchange reserves,
which were almost double the $54 billion external debt, provided a solid
basis for maintaining the external account balances.

Domestic policies: The Government undertook a number of measures
to minimize the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis. Under the
precondition of price and exchange rate stability, an expansionary monetary policy was implemented to support the medium- and long-term
funds needed for public sector infrastructure and private investment, to
reduce the cost of funds of businesses, and to boost domestic demand.
An expansionary fiscal policy was also implemented, which increased
public spending by 5 percent to accelerate public sector construction and
to shore up economic growth. Given the modest external debt and the
solid foreign exchange reserves of the country, there is scope for stimulating growth through expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, without
endangering the exchange rate stability. With the increasing financial
difficulties in some corporations, the Government has provided economic
relief packages, including exhorting financial institutions to roll over
expired loans to troubled firms for another six months. In addition,86 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

People’s Republic of China

Economic performance

Economic growth: Amidst the unprecedented financial crisis faced by Asia
in 1998, the PRC has been one of the few bright spots. The PRC’s economic
performance continued to be robust. Despite a major slowdown in exports
and severe floods that adversely affected agriculture sector production,
according to official sources, GDP grew by 7.8 percent, close to the
Government’s 8 percent growth target. The PRC was able to maintain strong
economic growth in the face of a slowdown in exports and weak domestic
consumption demand. This was because the Government followed a strategy
of generating growth by stimulating domestic demand, especially investment,
by easing monetary policy, and by implementing a fiscal stimulus package
that increased public investment in infrastructure.

The People’s Bank of China, the central bank, eased monetary policy
by reducing both the statutory cash reserve requirements and interest rates.
The key component of the Government’s growth strategy was a large public
investment stimulus package that was announced in the second quarter of
1998. The total package consisted of about yuan (Y)200 billion ($24 billion,
or about 2.4 percent of 1998 GDP) of additional public investment to be
implemented during 1998 and 1999. Half of this investment was financed
through the issue of special treasury bonds by the Central Government and
the remainder by bank credit.

Inflation: Despite expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, excess
capacities in the industry sector and the overall deflationary trends in Asia
put downward pressure on domestic prices. On average, consumer prices
declined by 0.8 percent in 1998.

External sector: Although the Asian financial crisis has not had a major
direct effect on the PRC’s economic performance, it adversely affected the
country’s exports in 1998. In 1997, exports increased by about 21 percent
and accounted for 2-3 percentage points of the growth in GDP. In 1998,
largely because of the severe recession in Asia, exports grew by only 0.5 percent. Although exports to Europe and North America increased, exports to
Asia declined in 1998. In 1998, imports declined by 1.5 percent. Despite the
slowdown in exports, the PRC had a $44 billion external trade surplus and
a $25 billion current account surplus.

In contrast to the experience in other emerging markets of capital
outflows in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, the PRC’s realized
FDI of $45 billion in 1998 was slightly higher than the level in 1997. By
December 1998, at $145 billion, the country’s official foreign exchange
reserves were more than its $138 billion external debt. Despite much speculation of a possible devaluation of the renminbi, the comfortable externalRegional Highlights 87

payments position and other macroeconomic parameters enabled the
Government to stand by its public statements not to devalue the currency.
This was a major contribution to containing the Asian contagion.

Domestic policies: Except for leading to a slowdown in exports, the
Asian financial crisis has not yet had a direct impact on the PRC. In terms
of the basic macroeconomic parameters, the PRC does not
appear to be vulnerable to external shocks. In addition, the
cautious approach of the PRC’s policymakers to external sector liberalization should enable the country to avoid the financial crisis experienced by other Asian economies. Coupled
with robust macroeconomic parameters, the cautious policy
approach toward capital account liberalization has enabled
the country to avoid the contagion effects of the crisis. However, some of the structural weaknesses in the Southeast and
East Asian economies are also evident in the PRC. The structural vulnerabilities are most evident in two areas: the financial sector and the state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

Over the last two decades, the PRC has made considerable
progress in establishing the foundations for a modern financial
system. Despite these impressive achievements, there are
weaknesses in the country’s financial sector. The key issues

 

To ensure project quality, technical assistance
that need to be addressed include (i) prudential norms, risk management is provided to prepare detailed engineering,

practices, and financial soundness of the banking system; (ii) institutional including designs, specifications, cost

capacity of the central bank to manage and supervise the financial sector; estimates, sectoral surveys, on master: plans,

(iii) development of the regulatory framework for nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs); and (iv) reform and development of the capital markets.
Since the four state commercial banks dominate the financial sector, strengthening them is a crucial component of the financial sector reform strategy.

In 1998, the Government took a major policy initiative to increase the
capital adequacy ratios of the four state banks to 8 percent. Special state
treasury bonds worth Y271 billion (about $32 billion) were issued to provide
funds for the recapitalization of the four banks. The Government has also
initiated measures to introduce stricter prudential norms and internationally comparable risk management methods among banks. On the other
hand, the Government has shown the political will not to provide funds to
bail out some of the ailing NBFls financial institutions. The legal framework
for the capital market was significantly improved with the passage of the
new Securities Law in December 1998.

Many problems in the financial sector are related to ailing SOEs that
have large volumes of loans from the financial sector, especially from banks.
Restructuring and reforming these enterprises are needed to improve industrial efficiency, maintain high levels of economic growth, and prevent the
further worsening of the position of financial institutions. The Government is placing high priority on SOE reform. Its long-term goals in SOE
reform are threefold: (i) concentrate state resources in a core group of
1,000 companies that will dominate the PRC’s major sectors and allow
them to compete on a global scale; (ii) reduce the role of government
in commercial decision making of SOEs by separating the business operations under ministries from their policy and regulatory functions; and
(iii) dispose of the remaining SOEs.88 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the PRC emphasizes four broad objectives: (i) improve economic efficiency; (ii) promote
economic growth to reduce poverty in the interior provinces; (iii) enhance
environmental protection and natural resource management; and
(iv) improve monetary policy formulation, and prudential financial
supervision and regulation.

Market-based approaches are being used to improve economic efficiency in all sectors in which the Bank operates by (i) improving the policy,
legal, and regulatory frameworks so that they are more suited to a market
economy; (ii) using the pricing mechanism to provide market-based signals
that encourage service users and providers to improve efficiency, allocate
better the use of scarce resources and capacity, recover operating and capital
costs and some of the external costs related to congestion and pollution, and
create the conditions necessary for private sector investment; (iii) encouraging competition and promoting the growth of the nonstate sector to improve
efficiency and provide better services and more choices for users; (iv) commercializing operators so that they respond to market forces; and (v) helping
expedite the implementation of macroeconomic structural reforms to remove
economic inefficiencies. Improving economic efficiency also requires investments to remove infrastructure constraints, especially in energy, transport
and communications, and water supply/conservation; adopt appropriate
technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution; and modernize the financial sector to meet the needs of a market economy.

While all provinces have benefited to some degree from the reform
process and the accompanying economic growth, the interior provinces have
lagged behind those on the coast. The interior provinces have fewer natural
trade and investment partners, poorer infrastructure, weaker managerial
skills, and smaller numbers of trained labor.

To help address these problems, the Bank’s strategy includes the following initiatives: (i) promote market-based policy changes in the interior

People’s Republic of China: provinces to attract more foreign and domestic investment; (ii) create con
Cumulative Bank Lending ditions to foster growth in the interior provinces such as providing adequate

Total 71 8,166.7 100.0 Strengthening environmental protection and natural resource manage
ment is the third objective of the Bank’s operational strategy. There are
serious environmental problems in the PRC, particularly in urban areas onthe east coast. These problems are primarily caused by the large heavy
industry sector that uses outdated, polluting technology, and coal as a major
energy source. The Bank’s strategy for promoting environmental protection
and natural resource management, which is aligned closely with the PRC’s
objectives for sustainable economic development, focuses on (i) improving
the policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks to strengthen environmental
management; (ii) building capacity of key agencies, including the National
Environmental Protection Agency, the State Science and Technology
Commission, and local environmental protection bureaus; (iii) improving
the quality of the environment in selected urban centers; (iv) promoting the
efficient utilization and conservation of soil, water, and marine resources;
and (v) promoting the use of cleaner, more energy-efficient process technology, and clean coal technology for industrial production and power generation.

Policy dialogue: The policy dialogue in 1998 between the Government
and the Bank covered a broad range of areas to support the PRC’s operational program. At the macro level, the Bank is supporting financial sector
reforms through new and ongoing technical assistance grants. In 1998,
discussions in the area of financial sector reforms focused on strengthening
the supervision capabilities of the central bank, liquidity risk systems, and
risk management systems, and introducing pension reform in the country.
As part of the ongoing Bank assistance in strengthening governance in the
financial sector, issues addressed were related to developing a national payments system, policies affecting foreign and joint venture banks, social security, off-budget revenues and expenditures, municipal finance, and reforming
the rural cooperative system. Enterprise reform to increase commercialization and responsiveness to market forces was promoted in the context of
individual projects, as well as for providing broader assistance to address
issues related to restructuring insolvent state enterprises. Strengthening
environmental management continues to be a major element of the Bank’s
policy dialogue in the PRC. Environmental issues addressed in 1998 included
the use of market-based instruments for environmental management, building capacity related to environmental impact assessment procedures, strengthening provincial environmental legislation, and developing alternative clean
energy sources (including wind power, other renewables, and coal-bed methane
production). The Bank is also promoting clean technology development
through a phased, multicomponent cross-agency technical assistance cluster.
Through both technical assistance and policy dialogue linked to specific loan
projects, the Bank also promoted energy conservation and price adjustments
to provide incentives for energy conservation. To help mobilize the resources
necessary to finance the huge infrastructure expenditures that are needed
in the PRC, the Bank is actively promoting tariff adjustments, alternative
sources of financing, such as build-operate-transfer, and leasing and
securitization schemes in the transport, energy, and water resource sectors.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank’s assistance program for the
PRC for 1998-2000 has been finalized in the context of the emerging economic challenges and within the overall framework of the Bank’s operational
strategy. In particular, it was designed to assist the Government in its efforts
to accelerate infrastructure investment and address some of the structural
issues in the financial and SOE sectors. The Bank continues its support for
developing the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks in the financial

Regional Highlights 89

Annual, 1994-199890 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

sector; and in strengthening specific financial intermediaries. Reform of the
pension system, development of the domestic bond market, and SOE reform
are other areas to which the Bank’s assistance is directed.

Reflecting the strategic objectives of its assistance package, the Bank’s
lending is heavily weighed in favor of the physical infrastructure subsector.
Eight loans totaling $1.2 billion were approved in 1998. These include seven
public sector loans: five were for transport ($960 million), and one each for
energy ($100 million) and social infrastructure ($102 million); and a private
sector loan also for the energy sector ($40 million). Thirty-three technical
assistance grants were approved in 1998, amounting to $23.5 million. Of
these, 10 were for the preparation of new projects. The remaining 23 technical assistance grants were advisory and aimed at sustainable development
of land and water resources, clean technology development, strengthening
legislation and improving legal systems, capacity building for several government agencies, and development of a regional road sector strategy.

In helping the Government address the issues relating to the financial
sector, SOE reform, and pension reform, the Bank’s program relies on the
technical assistance modality. The Bank addresses issues relating to the
development of the capital market, modernization of the infrastructure for
the financial sector, strengthening of smaller banks and other financial
institutions, and pension reform.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1986, the PRC
has received a total of 71 loans, of which 23 had been closed and 48 remained
active by the end of 1998. Contracts worth $538.6 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts to $4.5 billion.
The contract award ratio for 1998 was 17.6 percent.! Disbursements for the
year totaled $831.3 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $4.2 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 25.6 percent.”

The PRC portfolio performed generally well. Several factors have contributed to good performance: (i) strong technical capabilities of the executing agencies and government agencies, (ii) strong ownership of the projects,
(iii) clear accountability for project implementation for loan repayment, and
(iv) financing responsibility for loan repayment. Despite overall satisfactory
performance of the PRC projects, the portfolio also faced several difficulties.
These include (i) securing counterpart funds in a timely manner, aggravated
by cost overruns because of domestic inflation; (ii) high cost of domestic
borrowing; (iii) asynchronized project processing of the Government with
the Bank; and (iv) the Government's internal approval procedures. A recent
postevaluation report also suggests that there is a need for continuing efforts
to improve development impact and project quality in the PRC. The Bankwide
implementation of the project performance report system in November 1998

be awarded under newly approved and signed loans during the period is added to the

ratio is 26.7 percent.

amount available at the beginning of the year plus the loan amounts of newly approved loans
that have become effective during the year, excluding private sector loans. The Bankwide
disbursement ratio is 29.3 percent.is expected to help monitor the achievement of development objectives.
Also, in 1998, the PRC transferred the official “window” to the Bank from
the People’s Bank of China to the Ministry of Finance. To ensure smooth
project implementation in the future, the Bank has been providing training
seminars to enhance the capacity of the executing agencies, and technical
assistance to develop the national bidding law, policies, and regulatory
framework for the contracting industry.

Mongolia
Economic performance

Economic growth: The overall economic performance in 1998 remained
positive, as real GDP expanded by 3.5 percent for the year. Although down
from 4 percent in 1997, such growth performance was remarkable in the face
of the negative impact of the Asian and Russian crises and sharp decline in
world prices for principal exports. The agriculture and industry sectors,
together accounting for about 71 percent of GDP, contributed substantially
to the positive economic growth in 1998 as Mongolia countered the negative
impact of depressed world prices for copper, gold, and cashmere by increasing
their volume of production. Parallel with these developments, social indicators improved: the number of unemployed persons declined by about
14 percent, infant mortality decreased, and the overall number of reported
crimes declined in the course of the year.

Inflation: Price inflation continued its downward path in 1998. The
consumer price index (CPI) rose by 6 percent in December 1998, compared
with 17.5 percent a year ago. Factors contributing to this downward path
included the relative stability of the tugrik (Tug), and the continued tight
monetary policy implemented by the Bank of Mongolia during the year.

External sector: The continuing depressed state of international prices
for Mongolia’s main exports—gold, copper, and cashmere—offset the increased
volume of production of these commodities, contributing to a 17.5 percent
reduction in export earnings. At the same time, a relatively stable tugrik
contributed to a 7 percent increase in imports. As a result, the trade deficit
widened to $107 million in 1998, compared with a surplus of about $30 million in 1997. The current account balance moved from a surplus of about
$13 million to a deficit of $124 million in 1998. This led to a substantial
drawing down of the country’s international reserves from $90 million at
end-1997 to $80 million at end-1998. External debt is estimated at
$686.5 million (66.5 percent of GDP) at end-1998, compared with $605 million (63.7 percent of GDP) at end-1997. Mongolia’s policy of prudent borrowing at concessional terms in recent years has kept the debt service ratio
at its 1997 level of 6 percent of export earnings.

Domestic policies: Fiscal performance in 1998 was disappointing. The
Central Government’s deficit widened to Tug89.8 billion (10 percent of
GDP) in 1998, compared with Tug65 billion (8.6 percent of GDP) in 1997.
This occurred because the Government’s tax collection declined because of
a sharp fall in corporate tax collections, and efforts at cutting current
expenditure were not successful. However, the Bank of Mongolia remained

Regional Highlights 9192. ANNUAL REPORT 1998

committed to maintaining a tight monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation
under control and the domestic currency stable. Political instability during
1998 substantially weakened the Government's efforts to continue the
reform process. This slowed the pace of planned reform and restructuring
efforts under the IMF Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF),
the Bank’s Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL), and the Government’s
Public Administration Reform Project.

 

Mongolia: Bank operations

(as of 31 December 1998) Operational strategy: The Bank’s existing operational strategy for Mongolia
Nae was prepared in 1994. It aimed at facilitating Mongolia’s transition to a market
Skccor Loans $Million % economy by (i) creating an environment in which a competitive efficient
market economy can flourish; (ii) upgrading the human resources and skills

- Policy dialogue: The policy dialogue on the design and scope of actions
Total 19 377.5 100.0 needed under the Bank’s ongoing FSPL slowed in 1998. With the budgetary

 

and banking situation deteriorating, the Bank and the Government continue
to coordinate efforts to reform and restructure insolvent and distressed
banks, with those of IMF under its ESAF.

Loans and technical assistance: Further processing of loans and
technical assistance proposed for 1998 was postponed pending the passage of required legislation and a confirmation of the Government’s
Annual, 1994-1998 priorities. As a result, no loan to Mongolia was approved in 1998. The
Bank approved seven technical assistance grants totaling $3.1 million.
The political situation also led to the Government’s noncompliance with
some loan covenants on existing loans.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1991, Mongolia
has received a total of 19 loans, of which 15 were still active at the end of
1998. During the year, contracts amounting to $18.5 million were awarded,
bringing the cumulative total to $276.8 million. The contract award ratio
for 1998 was 19.1 percent, and disbursements amounted to $32 million,
resulting in a cumulative total of $242.1 million and a disbursement ratio
of 20.3 percent. Mongolia’s already limited absorptive capacity for assistance
contracted further in 1998, reflecting the political turmoil. Major issues of
project implementation, including the limited capacity of executing agencies, delays and noncompliance with submission of audited financial statements, and the increasingly difficult availability of counterpart funds continued
or intensified in 1998. Efforts at improving Mongolia’s absorptive capacity—
including efforts to strengthen the linkage between the public investment
program and the budgetary allocations, develop efficient project implementation and monitoring systems and procedures, and increase focus on project
quality—have been identified. Their implementation, however, awaits the
return of political stability in Mongolia.During the 1998 country portfolio review, the 1997 action plan agreed
with the Government was reviewed. Substantial progress was made related
to the issues on delays in loan signing and effectiveness, caused by delays
in receiving parliamentary approval and ratification. To resolve the issues
related to delays and noncompliance with submission of audited financial
statements, the Bank provided a technical assistance for capacity building
in project accounting in Mongolia. A Project Accounting Manual was
created under this technical assistance and was adopted in September
1998 as an official document of the Government. In addition, two technical assistance grants—for improving accounting and auditing systems
and for the development of procurement legislation and guidelines—
were approved by the Bank and are being implemented to help develop
the accounting and auditing systems, as well as procurement guidelines
in Mongolia. Successful implementation of the technical assistance will
help the Government facilitate the implementation of Bank-financed
projects in a more accountable and transparent manner.

Central Asian republics

Economic recovery in the Central Asian republics (CARs) slowed in 1998
because of the weakness in world commodity markets, the Asian contagion,
and the Russian economic and financial crises. Because the CARs and Russia
shared a common economic system before 1991 and still maintain close
economic ties, the Russian financial crisis that erupted in August 1998 has
exerted a profound negative impact on the subregion. This is being transmitted to the CARs through the volume of merchandise trade, inflows of foreign
investment, stability of exchange rates, and external debt service obligations.
The adverse impact of these external shocks is further compounded by the high
degree of economic interdependence among the CARs themselves. The decline
in world commodity prices—a result of continued weakness in global demand—
severely affected export earnings in 1998, since the CARs rely heavily on
commodity exports. Prices of major export commodities of the CARs, such
as oil and gas, ferrous and nonferrous metals, cotton, and grain, have declined
significantly, with oil prices dropping to 38 percent during the year.

The combined effects of these events are severe but are not uniformly
distributed among the four countries. Real GDP in Kazakhstan contracted
by 1.5 percent from 2.1 percent growth in the previous year, hurt by the
precipitous fall in crude oil prices and the decline in Russian demand. The
substantial decline in growth in the Kyrgyz Republic from 9.9 percent in 1997
to 1.8 percent in 1998 was partly attributed to considerable crop damage
resulting in lower agriculture sector growth. Apart from the adverse external
environment, growth in Uzbekistan was also dampened by a disappointing
cotton harvest. In contrast, Tajikistan continued to achieve significant progress
in macroeconomic adjustment in 1998, with GDP growing by 4 percent.

Tighter monetary policies had some beneficial effect on the subregion’s
high inflation rates, with price increases ranging from 2 to 23 percent in 1998.
However, the CARs, with the exception of the Kyrgyz Republic, suffered
from rising budget deficits. The Kyrgyz Republic managed a fiscal contraction through vigorous implementation of tax and budget reforms.

The primary objective of the Bank’s
operational strategy in the Central Asian
republics is their transition from centrally
planned to market-based economies.

In the difficult transition from centrally planned to market economies,
Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic have made significant progress in
privatization, agrarian reform, governance, and banking reform. Tajikistan
and Uzbekistan still face difficulties in restructuring and privatizing the SOEs
and in reforming financial institutions. Their similar experiences in the
transition period after 1991 have brought forth the need for closer regional
economic cooperation among these countries. Specifically, because the CARs
are located geographically remote from markets in other parts of the world,
there is potential resource complementarity among them. This implies large
potential gains from economies of scale and scope, and more efficient use
of resources based on a more integrated regional market. Turkmenistan’s
membership application was approved by the Board of Governors in 1998.
Upon its capital subscription, five CARs will be members of the Bank.

Kazakhstan
Economic performance

Economic growth: The economic expansion achieved in 1997 started to slow
during the first half of 1998. The slowdown was mainly attributed to a decline
in exports, caused by the weakened world commodity markets. The price of
crude oil, Kazakhstan’s major export, fell by 35 percent in the first nine
months of 1998, while prices of other important export items, such as metals
and wheat, also dropped by 10-30 percent. There was a general decrease in
the production index of many subsectors of the industry sector during the same
period. Apart from the drought, the agriculture sector was also constrained
by a lack of access to financial resources, insufficient input use, and underinvestment. Construction activities, boosted in 1997 by the building and
refurbishing of the new capital, also slowed because of increased budgetary
difficulties. The economic slowdown turned into a major contraction with the
onset of the Russian economic crisis in mid-August. This crisis affected Kazakhstan
severely since Russia is its leading trade partner. Consequently, growth for 1998
contracted by 1.5 percent, following a 2.1 percent expansion in 1997.

Inflation: In 1998, end-of-period inflation fell to 1.9 percent from
11.3 percent in 1997. While the nominal exchange rate to the US dollar
depreciated slightly, the tenge continued to appreciate in real terms because
of Kazakhstan’s higher inflation rate. The economic crisis in Russia put
tremendous pressure on the tenge to depreciate. The National Bank of
Kazakhstan spent $600 million defending the currency.

External sector: Due mainly to the falling commodity prices, exports
fell for the first time since 1995. During the first half of 1998, the trade
balance was in deficit equivalent to 4 percent of GDP due mainly to a fall
in exports. Compared with the same period in 1997, exports decreased by
6 percent, characterized by a decline in deliveries to the former Soviet
republics. Since 40 percent of Kazakhstan’s total trade is with Russia, the
Russian crisis further increased the trade deficit toward the end of the year.
The current account deficit stood at about 6.7 percent of GDP at midyear,
significantly higher than previous trends. FDI in the oil, gas, and metal
subsectors has played a major role in financing the current account deficitin the past. However, discouraged by the Russian crisis, FDI suffered a
substantial decline in 1998. International reserves by the end of 1998 were
about $2 billion (three months of imports) and external debt was almost
$4 billion or 17.9 percent of GDP.

Domestic policies: Since the deterioration of the economic situation
in the third quarter, the Government has focused on crisis control and
management. Spending has been cut further, which would lead to more
reductions in government structure and staffing. While these measures may
be necessary for restoring the fiscal balance in times of crisis, it is imperative
to maintain policy stability during the process. The Government has been
engaged in drawing up development strategies, guided by “Kazakhstan-2030,”
unveiled in October 1997, to tap the country’s vast mineral and hydrocarbon
resources and use them efficiently for long-term development. One of the
main priorities will have to be the restructuring of loss-making SOEs, which
by 1998 made up over 50 percent of all enterprises, a 7 percent increase over
last year. Restructuring these enterprises would also benefit the development
of a capital market, which is crucial to the success of second-generation
reforms, such as the pension reform initiated in 1997.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The main objectives of the operational strategy for
Kazakhstan include (i) encouraging the transition to a market-based economy
by supporting the Government’s reform agenda, promoting institutional change,
and strengthening social protection; (ii) promoting the rehabilitation of the
environment; (iii) strengthening the long-term potential for sustainable growth;
and (iv) encouraging the creation of a new output structure and new production
capacity through private sector investment. Cofinancing with other funding
agencies is sought to address difficulties in sourcing local counterpart funds.

Kazakhstan’s development needs are vast, but the Bank’s resources and
experience in working with the country are limited. Moreover, other funding
agencies provide extensive support and technical assistance. Therefore, Bank
activities will focus on a limited number of strategic sectors and subsectors:
(i) strengthening the management of reform at the Central Government and
local government levels; (ii) infrastructure, especially rehabilitation projects;
(iii) education and training; (iv) industry, focusing on the problems of mediumsized enterprise reform; and (v) agriculture. In implementing this strategy,
a number of considerations must be addressed, including coordination with
other multilateral finance institutions.

Policy dialogue: There was a hiatus in new loan and technical assistance
operations in Kazakhstan in 1998. This resulted mainly because of considerable delay in the formulation of the Government’s public investment program and external borrowing strategy. As such, no new areas
of policy dialogue were initiated.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were approved for Kazakhstan
in 1998. A technical assistance grant of $840,000 was approved for public
information and education in support of pension reform.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1994, Kazakhstan
has received a total of 10 loans, of which 3 had been closed and 7 were still
active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $117 million were awarded during

Economic performance

in May and June, the agriculture sector registered a 4.1 percent growth, with
a modest increase in livestock production. The strength of the agriculture
sector is largely attributed to improvements in the policy environment. The
industry and construction sectors, which posted a high 20 percent growth
in 1997 because of production in the Kumtor gold mine, contracted in 1998,
with the construction subsector falling by about 48 percent. The transport
and communications sector declined substantially, but total services still
posted respectable growth in 1998. The Russian crisis that erupted in August
1998 contributed significantly to the general economic slowdown.

Inflation: Because of the tight monetary policy, average inflation was
brought down further to 12.1 percent in 1998, compared with 25.5 percent
in 1997. However, the Russian crisis pushed the som to depreciate against the
US dollar by about 34 percent between mid-August and end-1998. In defending
the som, the National Bank expended about 12 percent of its reserves.

External sector: In 1998, imports far outgrew exports, resulting in an
increase in the trade deficit to $151 million in 1998 from just $15 million a
year earlier. The economic contraction in Russia and neighboring countries,
especially Kazakhstan—both major trading partners of the Kyrgyz Republic—
caused Kyrgyz exports to decrease and its imports to increase. The current
account deficit more than doubled from that in 1997. The worsening of the
current account underlines the fragile nature of the country’s external balance, which relies primarily on official external transfers for financing. By mid1998, international reserves declined to $173 million (imports of about two
and two-fifths months) from $196 million (three months of imports) at the
end of 1997, while external debt stood at $1.4 billion or 77.5 percent of GDP.

Domestic policies: The Kyrgyz Republic continued with its policies of
macro stabilization and structural reforms. In mid-October 1998, it became
the first country among the former Soviet republics to privatize land. This,
together with other positive policy measures in the sector, will give major
impetus to agriculture sector development. The country also became a formal member of the World Trade Organization in December 1998. On the
fiscal front, the Government succeeded in further reducing the budget deficit
by improving tax collection and rationalizing expenditures.Bank operations

Operational strategy: The primary objective of the operational strategy is
to facilitate the country’s transition to a market economy, and to help the
country build a solid base for sustainable development. The basic elements
of the strategy include (i) supporting the Government’s reform agenda,
encouraging institutional change, and strengthening social protection;
(ii) arresting the rapid deterioration of economic potential by investing in
physical infrastructure and human development; and (iii) encouraging the
creation of a new output structure and new production capacity through
private sector investment and job creation. The strategy concentrates the
Bank’s operations on four priority areas: (i) improvements in the provision
of public services, particularly social services provided by local governments,
and management of reform by the Central Government; (ii) agriculture,
including rural finance; (iii) human development; and (iv) infrastructure,
especially in the road and energy sectors.

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government
focused on supporting policy and institutional reforms in the infrastructure
and social sectors. Key policy areas addressed included (i) establishing
appropriate funding and cost-recovery mechanisms in the road subsector;
(ii) developing and pilot-testing reforms in the delivery of health and
education services at the provincial level; and (iii) establishing an efficient
and sustainable system of pensions.

Loans and technical assistance: Three loans totaling $65 million were
approved for the Kyrgyz Republic: $50 million for the transport and communications sector, and two multisector projects totaling $15 million. The
Bank also approved seven technical assistance grants totaling $3.9 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1994, the Kyrgyz
Republic has received a total of 12 loans, of which one had been closed and
11 remained active by the end of 1998. Contracts worth $29.4 million were
awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts to
$185.7 million. The contract award ratio for 1998 was 20.7 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $43.3 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $155.4 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 32.6 percent.

A country project implementation and administration seminar was
held in August 1998 to familiarize executing agency staff with the Bank’s
procedures and guidelines on procurement, use of consultants, and disbursements. In processing the Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project
approved during the year, particular attention was paid to ensuring
expeditious project implementation.

Tajikistan

Economic performance

Economic growth: After independence in 1991, Tajikistan experienced an
economic crisis because of the combined effects of the breakup of the former

Soviet Union, the civil war (1992-1997), and a series of heavy floods. In
response to the severe economic difficulties, the Government undertook

stabilization and structural reform programs to restore economic growth and
reduce macroeconomic imbalances. A peace agreement was signed in June
1997, providing a basis for national reconciliation and implementing the
stabilization and structural reform programs. After a persistent decline by
almost 60 percent from 1991 to 1996, GDP increased by 1.7 percent in 1997,
the first year of positive growth since independence. Economic growth
accelerated to 4 percent in 1998, but was constrained by the adverse effects
of the Russian crisis and the decline in world commodity prices. In 1998,
agriculture sector output expanded because of increased cotton production,
while industry sector production rebounded from very low levels. Services
sector output expanded as a result of the strong supply response of private
traders and privatized small enterprises to price and trade liberalization.

Inflation: Inflation declined sharply from 160 percent in 1997 to
7 percent in 1998. The Government’s tight fiscal and monetary policies
and an increase in agriculture sector output were the major factors
responsible for the reduction in inflation.

External sector: The balance-of-payments situation deteriorated in 1998,
mainly because of the effects of the weak world commodity markets and the
Russian crisis that reduced export demand. The current account deficit rose
from 5.5 percent of GDP in 1997 to 7.2 percent in 1998, resulting from a
worsening trade account. Total exports for 1998 fell below the 1997 level
as export earnings from cotton and aluminum—
Tajikistan’s two principal export commodities—
contracted because of the declining world prices.
Imports for 1998 stagnated at their 1997 levels,
mainly because of lack of financing. The capital
account registered a surplus in 1998 as increased
disbursements from the international aid community offset the decline in FDI. Although international reserves tripled from $30 million 1997
to $91 million by the end of 1998, this was just
enough to finance nearly two months of imports.
External debt was $1.3 billion or 102.3 percent of
GDP. The exchange rate was under strong pressure as a large amount of Russian rubles flowed
into Tajikistan for conversion (via Tajik rubles)
into US dollars. The national currency depreciated by over 10 percent in 1998.

Domestic policies: Since the signing of the
peace agreement in June 1997, the Government
has adopted tight fiscal and monetary policies to reduce the budget deficit
and bring down inflation. Measures have been taken to raise government
revenues and rationalize public expenditures. As a result, the state budget
deficit, on a cash basis, was reduced from 11 percent of GDP in 1995 to
3.3 percent per annum during 1997-1998. The authorities have also made
efforts to control the growth of credit and money supply. Major measures
undertaken included restricting the extension of credit to the Government
and SOEs, raising the refinancing rate, introducing treasury bills and credit
auctions, and strengthening bank regulations and supervision. In light of
growing pressure on the exchange rate, the central bank stepped up itsinterventions and spent about 20 percent of gross foreign reserves to defend
the Tajik ruble during August-October 1998. Some progress was made on
structural reforms. This included price liberalization—by which price controls on almost all commodities were eliminated—and the abolition of the
state orders system. A liberal trade and exchange system has been established as trade restrictions were dismantled, export duties were removed,
and import duties were unified at a maximum rate of 5 percent. Land
reform has been undertaken to allow farmers to have transferable land
use rights, among others. The privatization of small SOEs has accelerated
after some delays, and work has begun on the privatization of mediumand large-sized SOEs. A bank restructuring program was recently developed with assistance from IMF and the World Bank, and initial steps have
been taken toward legal and institutional reforms.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s interim operational strategy for Tajikistan
was endorsed by the Board of Directors on 9 October 1998. The overriding
objectives of the strategy are to (i) facilitate the country’s transition to a
market economy, (ii) assist in its postconflict reconstruction efforts, and
(iii) provide support for natural disaster rehabilitation. Bank assistance will
be extended in support of policy reforms, institution building, and investment
operations. Bank operations will pay attention to promoting the development
of small- and medium-sized enterprises and reducing poverty, particularly for
households headed by women and communities in remote mountainous areas.

Taking into account the Bank’s resource constraints, the strategy
focuses the Bank’s country assistance on a few priority sectors to maximize its development impact. In view of the Government’s development
priorities and the activities of other funding agencies, Bank assistance
in the near term will concentrate on three priority areas: (i) agriculture
and agroprocessing; (ii) infrastructure rehabilitation, especially roads and
power; and (iii) education. Involvement in these sectors builds on the
Bank’s experience gained from similar operations in other republics of
the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.

Policy dialogue: Extensive discussions were held with the Government
on reforming the transport and energy sectors in the context of the development of the Bank-financed Postconflict Infrastructure Program. The objective
of the program is to promote economic recovery and growth by addressing
key constraints to the functioning of the transport and energy sectors through
support for market-based policies and institutional reforms. The program will
assist the Government in (i) creating an enabling framework for the delivery
of market-based transport and energy services; (ii) improving management
efficiency of the transport and energy sectors by restructuring key institutions; separating regulatory and operational functions of the transport and
energy sectors; (iii) improving corporate governance; (iv) implementing market
pricing and user pays principles to improve cost recovery; (v) promoting
competition; and (vi) establishing systems for public participation in the
reform process and for addressing adjustment costs.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank’s first loan to Tajikistan
amounting to $20 million was approved in 1998 for the Postconflict Infrastructure

Regional Highlights 99100 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Program to support reforms in the transport and energy sectors. The Bank
also approved two technical assistance grants, totaling $1.65 million.

Project implementation: Implementation of the Bank’s program of
assistance will commence in 1999, following the approval of the first loan
for the Postconflict Infrastructure Program amounting to $20 million, and
technical assistance grants in the final quarter of 1998.

Uzbekistan
Economic performance

Economic growth: Official statistics show that Uzbekistan’s economy grew
by 4.4 percent in 1998 (staff estimates 2.8 percent), compared with the
5.2 percent increase in 1997. The slowdown of economic growth in 1998
resulted mainly from a disappointing cotton harvest and two external shocks.
The first was a sharp decline in 1998 in the world commodity prices of cotton
and gold, Uzbekistan’s two major export commodities. This resulted in a
drop in its export earnings. Second, the Asian and Russian crises adversely
affected the Uzbekistan economy as both reduced the external demand for
Uzbekistan’s exports and the inflow of foreign investment. Production of
cotton, the country’s principal agricultural crop, fell by 2 percent in 1998,
largely because of poor weather conditions and an inappropriate incentive
system in the cotton subsector. In 1998, agriculture sector output increased
by 4 percent and industry sector output expanded by 5.8 percent, slower
than their respective growth rates of 5.8 percent and 6.5 percent in 1997.
Growth of the services sector also slowed in 1998 as the Government's policy
of restricting imports of consumer goods stifled private trading activities.

Inflation: The official inflation rate for 1998 declined to 22.8 percent
from 28 percent in 1997. The reduction reflected the Government's tight
monetary policy stance. However, inflationary pressure rose in the second
half of 1998 as public sector wages and benefits were raised by 50 percent
in July, and the official US dollar exchange rate depreciated by over 30 percent in 1998 largely as a result of the Russian crisis.

External sector: The balance-of-payments situation came under pressure
in 1998 after an improvement in 1997. The current account deficit for 1998
was 3.6 percent of GDP, compared with 4 percent in 1997, but this was
achieved mainly through import compression rather than export expansion.
Total exports in value terms declined in 1998 as export earnings of cotton
and gold fell because of the declining world prices of these two commodities.
The crisis unfolding in Russia, Uzbekistan’s major trading partner, lowered
its demand for Uzbekistan’s exports. Imports for 1998 were compressed by the
existing government restriction on foreign trade and exchange and an increase
in grain production that reduced the need for grain imports. Foreign exchange
reserves decreased to $925 million (equivalent to four months of imports) in
1998 because of a loss in the value of gold reserves and for financing public
sector deficit. External debt was $2.8 billion or 17.9 percent of GDP.

Domestic policies: The Government maintained a tight monetary policy
to contain inflation; consequently, the growth of money supply was reduced
in 1998. However, the fiscal policy stance was relaxed in 1998. While a newtax code and several tax policy changes designed to enhance government
revenues became effective in January, government expenditures expanded
because of increased spending on wages and benefits. Moreover, conscious
of the need to minimize the social costs of the transition from a centrally
planned to a market economy, the Government continued to allocate fiscal
resources for providing social services and protecting vulnerable groups, thus
imposing an additional burden on the budget. The consolidated state budget
deficit for 1998 was equivalent to 2.3 percent of GDP. The Government
adhered to a gradual approach to structural reform and limited reforms were
undertaken in 1998. A working group was set up in March to develop a
timetable for completing the reform agenda. A new land law was enacted
in July, aimed at improving land use rights and giving greater security of
tenure to individual farmers. While foreign exchange restrictions remained
in force, several modifications to the foreign exchange system were introduced in July. These included (i) abolishing the 12 percent limit on the
spread between the commercial bank rate and the official exchange rate;
(ii) allowing foreign exchange receipts from centralized exports, except for
cotton and gold, and nontraditional exports to be surrendered to the
central bank at the commercial bank rate, rather than at the originally
required official exchange rate; and (iii) permitting commercial banks to
buy foreign exchange from the central bank at the commercial bank rate.
To reduce the fiscal deficit, a government decree was issued in September
1998 requesting all government ministries and agencies to cut employment
by 25 percent beginning in January 1999.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The objective of the Bank’s interim operational strategy for Uzbekistan is to assist the Government in its efforts to further the
transition to a market economy. The strategy emphasizes (i) the provision
of support for policy reforms, (ii) capacity building, (iii) institutional strengthening, and (iv) financing investments that promote growth, improve efficiency, and rehabilitate deteriorating infrastructure. The Bank’s assistance
program in the near term is sharply focused on three priority areas:
(i) agriculture, including financial support for small- and medium-sized agroindustrial enterprises; (ii) infrastructure, especially rehabilitation in the road
and railway subsectors; and (iii) education. Technical assistance is geared
toward laying the groundwork for future sector lending programs, institutional strengthening, and capacity building.

Policy dialogue: In 1998, the Bank held extensive discussions with the
Government on policy reforms and major issues in the agriculture sector, and
road and railway subsectors. In agriculture, dialogue focused on issues regarding
(i) developing a state procurement system for cotton and grain; (ii) increasing
farmers’ incentives in cotton production, and rural and trade financing;
(iii) encouraging private sector participation in input supply, machinery services,
output processing, marketing, and trade; (iv) commercializing state marketing agencies; and (v) restructuring farm debt. In the road subsector, dialogue
addressed (i) restructuring the road subsector institutions to separate
government functions from the service delivery and implementation functions, and create a competitive environment; (ii) establishing an enabling

implementing it in a selected road corridor; (iv) setting up a financial framework to increase financing for the development and maintenance of the road
network through improved cost recovery, and appropriate tax administration; and (v) developing human resources and institutional capacity. In the
railway subsector, policy dialogue continued to focus on the following reforms:
(i) regulatory framework; (ii) restructuring of the Uzbekistan Temir Yullari
(UTY) into cost/profit centers (business units); (iii) separation of ancillary
operations from the transportation business of the railways; (iv) institutional
strengthening of UTY’s financial accounting systems and business plans;
(v) introduction of pricing policies aimed at full cost recovery and responsiveness to market conditions; and (vi) downsizing of staff and assets for
efficient and sustainable operations.

Loans and technical assistance: Two loans amounting to $120 million
in the road and railway subsectors were approved in 1998. Six technical
assistance grants amounting to $4.7 million were also approved. One of these
was for the preparation of a new project for improving grain productivity.

Project implementation: The Basic Education Textbook Development
Project for $40 million, approved in December 1997, became effective
in August 1998. Two new loans amounting to $120 million were still
waiting to become effective. Contract awards during the year amounted
to $1.4 million. Disbursements amounted to $1.9 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 2.1 percent. The Uzbekistan Resident Mission
became fully operational in early 1998, and started to contribute toward
expediting project implementation.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia’s economies remained at the vortex of the Asian financial
crisis in 1998. Civil unrest and an unexpected change of government in
Indonesia heightened the sense of instability, as the subregion’s largest country
struggled to regain its economic footing. First to experience a drain in its
foreign exchange reserves in July 1997, Thailand moved decisively to reverse
capital outflows in 1998 through financial and other structural reforms.
Malaysia chose a different path, shutting down capital flows and expanding
the Government’s economic role in an attempt to shield the domestic economy
from the volatility of international capital flows. Having participated to a
lesser degree in the economic boom than its neighbors, the Philippines
experienced a weaker contagion effect, while the countries of the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) other than Thailand (i.e., Cambodia, PRC,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic [Lao PDR], Myanmar, and Viet Nam)
were even less affected but also suffered export demand shocks.

After 4 percent growth in 1997, the economy of the Southeast Asian
subregion contracted by 8 percent, underperforming even the most pessimistic expectations for the year. Over $30 billion fled Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, and Thailand in 1997 and 1998. Indonesia continued to bear
the brunt of the crisis as exports and investments collapsed, reducing output
by 13.7 percent. Malaysia at first appeared to avoid the worst effects of theRegional Highlights 103

crisis, but poor agriculture sector performance, loss of asset values as a result
of the ringgit’s depreciation against the US dollar, and capital outflows late
in the year brought growth down to negative 6.2 percent. Thailand implemented
a series of financial reforms but still suffered 8 percent contraction.

Growth in Cambodia was interrupted by the combined effects of political uncertainties and the regional economic downturn. Growth in the Lao
PDR and Viet Nam slowed compared with the previous year: the Lao PDR
was hurt by the baht’s depreciation and a decline in Thai investment, and
Viet Nam suffered from a decline in FDI from the NIEs. In the Philippines,
tight monetary policy to defend the peso constrained investment demand,
while poor agriculture sector performance limited growth from the supply
side. The Philippines’ relatively low level of financial leverage, about 60 per- Malaysia
cent of GDP, and continued strong export demand cushioned the economy
from the worst effects of the crisis.

Inflation in Southeast Asia in 1998 increased almost fivefold from the
previous year, driven by currency devaluations and, in some cases, food price
increases arising from the impact of the drought caused by the El Nifio
phenomenon. Indonesia—stricken by shortages of basic products and import
price increases—contributed most to the subregional price increase. Fiscal
constraints limited the ability of governments to cushion the effects of \
depreciation, resulting in higher food, gas, and electricity prices. aig 4 2. ___1—__i_

Exchange rate stabilization remained a major economic objective for
Southeast Asian countries in 1998. The Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, be
Philippine peso, and Thai baht all dropped to their lowest levels against the
US dollar during the first half of 1998. However, these currencies recovered 7
much lost ground and stabilized by the end of the year. The crisis also
prompted moderate devaluations of the Vietnamese dong, and a larger i Philipines
devaluation of the currencies of Cambodia and the Lao PDR.

The corporate and banking subsectors continued to deteriorate, particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia. Nonperforming loans increased, and many Thailand
financial institutions found themselves insolvent. At the end of 1998, Indonesia
had the highest level of nonperfoming loans at 35 percent of loans outstanding
or more, followed by Thailand at more than 30 percent, Malaysia at 25 percent,
and Philippines at 10 percent or more. In some cases, tight monetary policy
exacerbated loan default problems. Short-term interest rates in Indonesia rose
as high as 60 percent, forcing bank and corporate defaults. In Malaysia, the
central bank’s policy of limiting domestic credit expansion to 12-15 percent
resulted in a complete lending freeze by several domestic banks. In the face
of widespread defaults by borrowers, the central bank in Thailand tightened
the criteria for commercial bank lending to corporate clients.

The crisis created a dilemma for the monetary authorities in Southeast Asian countries. Defending their currencies required them to maintain relatively high interest rates, but that worsened the financial condition
of banks and firms. Through the end of the year, Indonesia held on to
high interest rates, while Malaysia and Thailand gradually lowered their
key rates, albeit for different reasons. Malaysia’s currency controls allowed the central bank to lower rates without prompting further attacks
on the currency. Thailand, on the other hand, gained some breathing
space from investors through implementation of financial and structural
reforms. Viet Nam also tightened its already stringent capital restrictions,

Lao PDR

 

Indonesia
\

Viet Nam_104 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

requiring certain companies to convert 80 percent of their foreign exchange
holdings into domestic currency.

The social cost of the crisis in Southeast Asia has been substantial. About
16-20 percent of Indonesia’s population of over 200 million were estimated
to be living in poverty in 1998, up from 11 percent in 1996. Unemployment
rates rose to 5.5 percent in Indonesia, 9.6 percent in the Philippines, and
5.3 percent in Thailand. Measures to mitigate the social impact of the crisis
included the creation of temporary jobs, provision of affordable education and
training facilities, and free or subsidized distribution of basic goods. The large
cost of these programs contributed to widening budget deficits in 1998.

The economic slowdown caused a significant import contraction, which
bolstered current accounts throughout Southeast Asia. For the first time in
a decade, the aggregate current account for the subregion registered a surplus. While export revenues weakened as some creditors refused to roll over
trade loans, export volumes started to pick up in the second quarter of 1998,
possibly pointing the way to an export recovery.

Cambodia

Economic performance

Economic growth: Economic expansion in 1998 faltered because of the
combined effects of election-related political uncertainties, a deepening Asian
financial crisis, and severe weather disturbances. Preliminary indications of
no real GDP growth in 1998 were based on expected real agriculture sector
growth of about 1.4 percent, no growth in industry sector, and a services
sector contraction of 1.7 percent. Agriculture sector growth was constrained
by drought conditions. Continued garment subsector expansion provided
some strength in industry, but this was offset by a severe contraction in
construction. A weak tourism subsector hurt the performance of the services
sector. Investments fell because of a drop in foreign aid because of the political
stalemate, and a decline in FDI arising from the regional economic downturn.

Inflation: Inflation was about 14.8 percent in 1998, up from about
8 percent in 1997. The depreciation of the riel against the US dollar and
regional currencies—nearly 30 percent against the Thai baht—contributed to
this increase in inflation as did a rise in net claims on the Government, as a result
of the weak budget position caused by low revenues and loss of aid.

External sector: The overall balance-of-payments surplus narrowed
in 1998 because of the prolonged regional downturn and continued
political uncertainty. Despite a 40 percent increase in garment exports,
the current account deficit, excluding transfers, widened from 8.4 percent of GDP to 9.1 percent as wood export and tourism earnings fell. The
capital account surplus fell in 1998 because of a 20 percent drop in FDI.
There was also a large negative errors and omissions balance, possibly the
result of unrecorded capital outflows and imports. Gross official reserves
improved from $266 million (over three months’ import cover) in 1996
to $324 million (nearly three-and-a-half months’ import cover) in 1998
because the Bank for International Settlements released $117 million in
long-frozen gold reserves.Domestic policies: Although policy reform was limited because of political
problems, the formation of the new Government in late 1998 sent a positive
signal that Cambodia was ready to tackle difficult economic reforms. Improving
forestry management, fiscal reform, downsizing the military, reducing corruption,
and enhancing the private sector environment are on the Government’s
agenda. Several funding agencies signaled willingness to resume operations in
Cambodia, but stressed the need for progress in the implementation of reforms.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy in Cambodia is focused
on (i) building capacity for good governance and project management through
an integrated program of technical assistance and sector program lending
activities; (ii) human development as a national priority, with emphasis on
the provision of basic health and education services, especially in rural areas;
(iii) promoting economic growth as the principal means of creating employment and reducing poverty; and (iv) natural resource conservation and
environmental protection as critical inputs for sustainable development,
taking account of the Government's limited financial and technical resources.

Policy dialogue: In light of Cambodia’s nascent stage of economic
development and transition to a market economy, it was essential for the
Bank to continue dialogue with the Government on macroeconomic management, particularly public investment planning, and policy reform in the
agriculture, financial, trade, and industry sectors. The Bank also continued
its assistance in strengthening good governance practices in Cambodia in
various areas such as external auditing, public procurement, project accounting, external aid management, and national account statistics.

Loans and technical assistance: In late 1998, a $40 million loan, a
component of the GMS: Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project,
was approved. Two technical assistance grants were approved for $1.4 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Cambodia
has received a total of 11 loans, of which 9 were still active at the end of
1998. Contracts amounting to $29.1 million were awarded, bringing the
cumulative total to $158.5 million. The contract award ratio for 1998 was
21.2 percent. Disbursements in 1998 totaled over $29.3 million, with cumulative disbursements totaling $126.1 million. The disbursement ratio for
1998 was 21.5 percent, which is a vast improvement over the 1997 ratio of
6.9 percent. A seminar on project implementation was held in the country
to help improve understanding of the Bank’s policies and procedures.

In 1996 and 1997, project implementation in Cambodia was slow as a result
of (i) an increasing number of new projects, which were under initial stages of
project implementation; (ii) adverse political situation; (iii) delayed recruitment and ineffective use of consultants; (iv) shortage of skilled staff; (v) delayed
release of counterpart funds; (vi) lack of knowledge of the Bank’s and
Government's operational policies and procedures; and (vii) slow approval
procedures of the Government. In 1998, the implementation performance in
Cambodia improved through important steps taken by the Government and
the Bank. These include (i) an improved political situation; (ii) issuance of
the Project Accounting Manual to government agencies to clarify the fund flow
and budget management policies and procedures; (iii) strengthened institutional

Indonesia
Economic performance

Economic growth: Indonesia is battling its worst recession in 35 years. Real
GDP contracted by 13.7 percent for the whole of 1998, in sharp contrast
to the 8 percent average growth rate in 1995 and 1996. The banking and
corporate subsectors continued to reel under a huge debt overhang, and the
budget has been strained by the social consequences of the crisis. The severe
economic contraction has substantially increased poverty incidence. Households compensated for declining real income by sending additional members
to work, as reflected in a surge in the labor force. The weakening labor
market, however, has been accompanied by an increase in unemployment.
Inflation: Inflation measured by changes in the CPI rose by 78 percent
by end-1998. The rise in prices was felt in every category from food to
transportation with foodstuffs contributing the highest increase. The rise in
food prices was sparked by significantly lower rice supplies and inefficient
management of the food distribution system. The volatility of the domestic
currency heightened. The monetary authority tightened its monetary policy
to stabilize both the rupiah and the inflation rate. Credit was squeezed and
bank lending was virtually at a standstill.

External sector: The current account surplus in FY1998/99 (ending
31 March) is estimated at 1.1 percent of GDP. This is in contrast to a
precrisis (FY1996/97) deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP. A higher trade surplus
is expected because of a contraction of imports rather than an improvement
in export revenues, which are expected to remain flat. Some exports grew
in volume terms but failed to generate a substantial increase in revenues
because of depressed world commodity prices. Net international reserves at
$14.1 billion were sufficient to finance about six months of goods imports
at end-1998. External debt is estimated at $138 billion.

Domestic policies: A tight monetary stance since the second quarter
of 1998 has kept credit growth at virtually zero and the other monetary
aggregates on target since June. With increasing signs of a decline in inflation and strengthening of the rupiah, monetary policy was relaxed somewhat
in late 1998. The new Government initiated or completed important legislation
during the year, including the Banking Restructuring Law, the Competition
Law, a new Central Bank Law, and the Anticorruption Law. The budget
deficit in FY 1998/99 is estimated at 4.7 percent of GDP and for the first time
in recent years, public dissaving has occurred. However, for the first six
months of the fiscal year, a small surplus was realized. This is mainly because
of a surge in revenues from income tax, reflecting withholding tax on interest
income, and lagging development expenditures. The slow disbursement of
development expenditures is partly because of greater prudence exercised by
project officials in the face of public awareness of corruption related to
project disbursements. The banking system is technically insolvent, with aRegional Highlights 107

negative net worth estimated at around a third of GDP. Restructuring and
revitalizing the banking subsector is among the most important priorities of
the Government. Economic recovery cannot begin without resumption in
bank lending to the real sectors. The Government has taken commendable
steps in recent months to restructure the banking subsector. The passage of
amendments to the Banking Restructuring Law has strengthened the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Agency’s (IBRA) legal powers to deal with the restructuring process. Fifty-four troubled banks are under IBRA control. More than
half of these banks are in advanced stages of resolution. In September, the
Government announced a major recapitalization scheme for private banks,
excluding joint venture banks. The bank restructuring costs will be financed
through bond issues and sale of assets transferred to IBRA. In September 1998,
the Jakarta Initiative was launched to facilitate corporate debt restructuring.
ADB, together with the World Bank, is providing technical assistance to
support the activities of the Jakarta Initiative.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: In response to the deepening financial crisis, the Bank
has reviewed its operational priorities in consultation with the Government The Asian financial crisis has prompted many
and adopted an interim strategy to guide its operations during urban residents to migrate to the rural areas.
1998-1999. The Bank’s interim strategy has three dimensions:
(i) support the Government in pursuing policy reforms and in restructuring the financial sector; (ii) support a select number of
sectors, including trade, industry—especially small and medium
enterprises—and energy; and (iii) support social safety net programs to mitigate the social impact of the crisis. Successful implementation of reforms in these priority sectors will help restore
public confidence and pave the way for a return to more sustainable growth. The Bank’s assistance will strengthen measures for
efficient use of resources for social protection and poverty reduction. The Bank places greater emphasis on managing the loan
portfolio to Indonesia to ensure its continued relevance in the
current situation. The Bank pursues the interim strategic agenda
in close coordination with other bilateral and multilateral agencies.
Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue during the year
continued to focus on the Government's strategy for economic
reforms and mitigation of the impact of the crisis. The Bank
actively participated with IMF and the World Bank in the joint
review of the implementation of the Government’s program for
macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. In the financial
sector, the Bank carried out policy discussions with the Government on banking sector restructuring, capital markets, and public
financial management. The policy dialogue resulted in the formulation of a substantial reform agenda for the Financial Governance
Reforms: Sector Development Program supported by the Bank.
The key reforms aim at (i) adopting improved financial governance
practices that conform to international standards; (ii) increasing
the disclosure and transparency of financial information; and
(iii) strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks. The program108 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

includes significant anticorruption components, including modernization of
public sector management and institutional strengthening of the State Audit
Agency. The Bank has placed an extended mission in Indonesia to provide
further day-to-day advice to the Government for program implementation.
In the social sectors, the Bank also engaged in policy dialogue with the
Government on effective utilization of public resources for primary education and preventive health care, and to protect vulnerable groups against
the adverse impact of the crisis. The policy dialogue led to the formulation
of the Social Protection Sector Development Program supported by the
Bank. The policy dialogue also addressed issues of effective involvement of
the community and civil society in monitoring and evaluating program
implementation, thereby maximizing public accountability, and simplification of the funds flow mechanism with a view to minimizing leakages. In the
agriculture and natural resource sector, the policy dialogue continued to
focus on involving local governments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs),

 

Indonesia: and communities in conserving and managing the country’s natural re

for 1998 was 21.2 percent. Total disbursements for the year amounted to
$1.1 billion, with cumulative disbursements, including interest during construction and private sector loans, reaching $9.3 billion. The disbursement
ratio for 1998 was 19.4 percent. Project implementation was adversely affected
by the financial crisis and the fiscal constraint faced by the Government.
However, contract awards and disbursements for 1998 substantially increased from the corresponding figures in 1997 because of large disbursements under two program loans approved during the year. In 1998, the
Bank and the Government jointly undertook a comprehensive portfolio
review to streamline the Bank’s existing loan portfolio to respond better
to the changed development priorities in the crisis period, to alleviate
the budgetary burden of counterpart funds, and ensure timely implementation of priority projects. The comprehensive portfolio review identified
a surplus of loan proceeds amounting to $1.1 billion, of which $975.7 million
was subsequently canceled from the portfolio. ADB and the World Bank
jointly conducted a country portfolio performance review to discuss with
the Government measures to further improve the performance of project

Resident Mission greater responsibility for project administration, including
disbursement functions for all public sector loans. Also, the Bank organized
a seminar in Indonesia to familiarize executing agency staff with Bank
procedures and guidelines on the use of consultants.

Lao People’s Democratic Republic
Economic performance

Economic growth: The Lao PDR sustained positive real economic growth
in 1998 despite the deep recessions experienced by some of its major
economic partners (Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand). The trend,
however, has resulted in a gradual slowing of the economy from its 1994 real
GDP growth rate of 8.1 percent to 6.9 percent in 1997 and about 4 percent
in 1998. Agriculture sector growth declined in 1998 as drought conditions partially offset benefits from increases in irrigated land, from
12,000 hectares (ha) in 1996 to 50,000 ha in 1998. Led by the garment and
hydropower subsectors, the growth of real value added in industry recovered in 1998. The services sector registered moderate growth resulting
from a small increase in the tourism subsector.

Inflation: The average inflation rate accelerated from 19.3 percent in
1997 to around 90 percent in 1998. The kip depreciated against the US dollar
by over 50 percent in 1998 and by over 40 percent against the Thai baht.
The inflation was because of a rise in food prices brought about by the
drought, exchange rate depreciation, and an expansionary monetary policy.

External sector: The weakness of the Lao PDR’s balance-of-payments
position continued in 1998, with the current account deficit estimated to be
over 17 percent of GDP. Export performance was mixed as continued weakness in exports of wood products to regional markets was balanced against
some strength in garment exports to western markets, electricity exports, and
tourism. The depreciation of the kip has not stimulated export performance,
partly because of weak regional demand. In the capital account, FDI continued to lag as the Lao PDR’s traditional sources of investment (Malaysia and
Thailand) continued to suffer economic and financial difficulties. Official
reserves were the equivalent of a little over two months of imports in the third
quarter of 1998 compared with two-and-a-half months in 1997.

Domestic policies: The FY1997/98 (ending 30 September) budgets
presented to the National Assembly by the Government included several
new fiscal measures designed to enhance revenues and reduce reliance
on trade taxes. Delays in implementation, however, resulted in poor
fiscal performance in 1998. Some structural reform progress was made in
the banking subsector with the reorganization and increased autonomy
of the state-owned commercial banks. Efforts by the Bank of the Lao PDR
(BoL) to control the money supply continued to be hampered by widespread circulation of US dollars and Thai baht in the country. To combat
inflationary credit expansion, BoL introduced several policy measures in
1998, including sales of treasury and BoL bills, and minimum deposit
rates. These measures had minimal effect.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the Lao PDR
recognizes that, at the present stage of economic development, it is appropriate to (i) continue emphasizing economic growth with crosscutting social
and environmental objectives (sustainable economic growth is essential for
raising the level of national income); (ii) address directly poverty reduction
in a more concerted and focused manner (this requires sound economic
policies and reform measures); and (iii) strengthen the financial sector. In
parallel, the Bank is increasing its focus on agriculture and rural development to facilitate the transition toward a market economy. By extending the
transport and communications, and energy infrastructure to selected rural
areas, the Bank assists in providing the necessary rural infrastructure for
economic and social development. It also enhances governance by focusing
on government accounting and auditing systems to raise the efficiency of
public sector management activities. The Bank is also facilitating subregional
cooperation to enhance market opportunities for this landlocked country.

Policy dialogue: The Bank’s policy dialogue with the Government has
focused on two major areas: financial sector reforms and energy sector issues.
Policy dialogue has focused on the continuous need to strengthen the commercial banks and encourage transparent operations under prudential regulations. During 1998, a large step toward advancing good governance issues
was initiated when the Bank assisted the Government in establishing the
National Audit Office. The Office will, among other activities, formulate
guidelines for auditing government ministries and external loans and projects.
In addition, a Bank-supported technical assistance will help draft auditing
regulations. The Bank is increasingly becoming a facilitator for hydropower
development in the Lao PDR, while at the same time ensuring that environmental and social considerations are taken into account during project
design and implementation. The Bank plans to support capacity-building
activities to strengthen the social infrastructure sector and environmental
management in the Lao PDR. Policy dialogue has also led to the formulation
and development of national procurement guidelines and regulations, which
will assist in the transparency of procurement-related activities.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan amounting to $20 million
was approved in 1998 for Basic Education (Girls) Project. Nine technical
assistance grants were approved totaling $4.8 million, of which two were for
project preparation and the rest were advisory in nature.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, the Lao PDR
has received a total of 43 loans, of which 27 had been closed and 16 were
still active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $56.1 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total contracts to $597 million. The
contract award ratio for 1998 was 32 percent. Disbursements for the year
totaled $66 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $517.8 million.
The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 24.2 percent.

In recent years, project implementation performance in the Lao PDR
has been generally good, as a result of the efficient implementation of
projects by qualified counterpart staff in the physical infrastructure and
power subsectors. However, it is expected that project implementation may
become more difficult as the Bank shifts to a loan portfolio with a largernumber of social infrastructure projects that are traditionally more complex
to implement. The Government recently took several important steps to
ensure smooth project implementation in the future by (i) decentralizing
project implementation responsibilities for some projects to the provincial
level; (ii) streamlining the internal approval procedures for road projects;
and (iii) issuing an interministerial decision to adopt, as an official government
document, the Project Accounting Manual to clarify the internal fund flow,
and budget management policies and procedures.

In addition, the impact of the Asian financial crisis has started to put
a severe strain on the Government’s ability to fulfill its counterpart funding
requirements. Faced with these challenges, the Government and the Bank
agreed to take more proactive measures to further improve the environment
for smoother project implementation.

Malaysia
Economic performance

Economic growth: It is now clear that Malaysia has been severely affected
by the Asian financial crisis. By August 1998, Malaysia was in the grip of
a severe economic recession. Real GDP contracted by 6.2 percent in 1998
as output of all major sectors of the economy declined. The serious weakening of economic performance was led by a sharp contraction in the construction and manufacturing subsectors. Agriculture sector output declined
because of supply constraints. Malaysia suffered from the combined impact
of (i) a steep depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit against the US dollar,
(ii) sharp increases in short-term domestic interest rates, and (iii) a decline
in the stock market index. This was exacerbated by the substantial exposure
of the banking system to the property subsector and the stock market.
Nonperforming loans increased from the precrisis level of less than 5 percent
of total outstanding loans to about 16 percent by September 1998.

Inflation: The CPI rose 5.3 percent in 1998. The inflationary pressures that were on the upswing during the first half of the year moderated
in the second half.

External sector: The current account of the balance of payments is
estimated to record a significant surplus in 1998. This was largely because of
the substantial decline in imports of goods and nonfactor services in 1998,
reflecting the impact of contraction in domestic demand and selective importsubstitution measures. Although Malaysia’s export performance was generally
weak in 1998, the export value in US dollars has picked up since October
to record double-digit annualized rate of growth in December 1998. The
outflow of short-term capital, which began in mid-1997 following the onset
of the Asian financial crisis, continued into 1998. Nevertheless, as a result
of the large surplus in the current account of the balance of payments, the
net international reserves rose significantly from $21.7 billion at end-1997 to
$26.2 billion by end-1998, which is sufficient to finance over five-and-a-half
months of retained imports. External debt was $33.8 billion at end-1998.

Domestic policies: Malaysia’s favorable initial macroeconomic conditions, relatively strong financial system, and low external debt exposure shaped

the Government’s response to the crisis in the early stages. The crisis proved
to be more protracted than earlier envisaged, and weaknesses in the financial
and corporate subsectors gradually assumed serious dimensions. By the first
quarter of 1998, the Government had further tightened its monetary and fiscal
policies, increased reliance on market-based monetary instruments, and
undertook a series of measures aimed at proactively addressing financial and
corporate subsector weaknesses. A moderation of inflationary trends after
June, an emergence of a significant surplus in the current account, and an
increasing slant in policy making toward self-reliance to deal with the crisis
have laid the basis for a shift in the policy approaches of the Government.
In July 1998, the Government declared its intention to revive the economy
by relaxing its monetary and fiscal policies. The National Economic Recovery
Plan, released in July 1998, is the cornerstone of the new policy framework.
Measures that seek to boost liquidity flows in the economy, encourage banks
to resume lending activities, and mitigate the severe cash crunch confronting
the corporate subsector, have been adopted by the Government.

To stem further the economic slide and minimize the adverse impact of
the financial crisis, the Government adopted a cautiously expansionary fiscal
policy. In March, while continuing with the policy of maintaining a surplus

development, (ii) reducing socioeconomic disparity across states and regions
of the country, (iii) promoting sustainable environmental management, and
(iv) supporting capacity building in selected areas. Following the onset of
the effects of the financial crisis, the Bank is considering the possibility of
revising the strategy to help the Government deal with the crisis. Provision
of social safety nets and financial sector adjustment are two key areas of
concern for the Bank in the proposed review of the strategy.

Policy dialogue: Although the financial sector in Malaysia is relatively
better developed with a diverse range of products and players, compared with
other DMCs, the ongoing crisis has revealed fundamental weaknesses in the
sector. The Bank is exploring various ways to assist the Government in this
area. The Bank worked closely with the Government to help develop Malaysia’s
skills delivery system for meeting the long-term skills demand necessary to
support development for a globally competitive industry sector. Policy dialogue
in this area focused on (i) institutional strengthening of the skills delivery
system, (ii) developing national occupational skills standards, (iii) increasing
public/private sector cooperation in the delivery of technical education and
skills training, (iv) enhancing labor market information systems, and (v) enabling
greater participation of part-time workers and women in the labor force.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans or technical assistance projects
were approved in 1998.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Malaysia
has received a total of 76 loans, of which 67 had been closed and 9 were
still active at the end of 1998. Contract awards during the year amounted
to $47.1 million, bringing cumulative contract awards to $1.3 billion. The
contract award ratio for the same period was 23.9 percent. Disbursements
in 1998 amounted to $60.7 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to
$1.3 billion. The disbursement ratio was 22.6 percent.

Project implementation experienced initial delays because of the long
time generally taken for loan effectiveness, as well as subsequent procurement delays because of lack of familiarity with the Bank’s guidelines and
procedures. Further, the pace of implementation slowed and suffered from
budget setbacks, as well as from a shortage of qualified technical staff.

Myanmar
Economic performance

Economic growth: Myanmar's economic growth has slowed in recent years.
Real GDP growth slowed from 6.4 percent in FY1996/97 (ending 31 March)
to 5.7 percent in FY1997/98 and is expected to slow to about 5 percent in
FY1998/99. The economic downturn is largely attributable to the weak
performance of the agriculture sector, which accounts for more than one
third of GDP. In addition to unfavorable weather, the country has suffered
from a shortage of agriculture sector inputs induced by foreign exchange
constraints. Agriculture sector growth was estimated to be 2.6 percent; the
industry sector growth was 5.4 percent and services subsector was 7 percent.
Myanmar continues to face structural problems that have prevented the
economy from achieving macroeconomic stability and higher growth. However, concerted efforts are being undertaken to increase the participation of
private entrepreneurs in the agriculture sector. Myanmar's accession to ASEAN
in 1997 was expected to increase trade and FDI. However, before Myanmar

financial crisis, particularly in terms of slower FDI inflows. (as of 31 December 1998)
Inflation: In addition to a fiscal deficit and expansionary monetary
policy, a decline in agriculture sector production led to an increase in com- No. of
modity and food prices. The inflation rate rose by around 30-40 percent in Sector Loans $Million %
FY1997/98 and FY1998/99. Agriculture and

Domestic policies: The most critical economic policy issue is the dual Industry and
exchange rate system. Affected by the Asian financial crisis, the parallel Nonfuel Minerals 2 214 4.0

deficit, which results from a small tax base. There has been no inflow of114 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

international assistance since 1988 and the Government has been using
public sector credit to finance physical infrastructure and social infrastructure sector development. This has contributed to inflationary pressure.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank continued to monitor economic developments
in Myanmar. An operational strategy will be formulated when appropriate.

Loans and technical assistance: No loan has been provided to Myanmar
since 1986 and no technical assistance since 1987.

Project implementation: All 32 loans approved for the country prior
to 1986 were closed by end-1998 and no contract awards or disbursements were made in 1998. During the year, the Bank closed a loan, which
had been approved in 1986 but was inactive after initial disbursement
of a small amount, and canceled the unused balance; the loan was kept
open until 1998 at the Government’s request.

Philippines
Economic performance

Economic growth: The Asian financial crisis and the El Nifio phenomenon have interrupted the steady growth experienced since the mid1990s. GDP contracted by 0.5 percent in 1998, a sharp drop from the
5.2 percent growth posted in 1997. This is the result of weak industry
sector performance, which contracted by 1.7 percent in 1998, and a
6.6 percent contraction in the agriculture sector because of the El Nifio
phenomenon during the first half of the year and the destructive typhoons
during the second half. The economic slowdown in 1998 led to increased
unemployment and contractions in levels of saving and investments.

Inflation: Average inflation rate rose to 9.7 percent in 1998, compared
with 5.9 percent in 1997 despite flagging demand, owing to sharp supply
contractions and high import costs.

External sector: Export growth continued to be robust despite contraction in major Asian markets. This provided demand stimulus to the economy.
A sharp contraction in imports, because of the peso depreciation and economic slowdown, was witnessed in 1998, leading to improvements in the trade
and current account deficits, with a near balance achieved in the current
account in January-November 1998, However, reduced net capital inflows
resulted in inadequate buildup of gross foreign exchange reserves, which stood
at $10.8 billion (equivalent to nearly three months’ imports) at the end of
1998. Although the level of reserves has declined from the precrisis March
1997 level of about $12 billion, imports have similarly declined. The current
level of reserves, sufficient for nearly three months of imports of goods and
services, needs to be built up. Despite the crisis, external debt and its servicing
remained at manageable levels. Although external debt had risen to $46.4 billion by September 1998 from $41.9 billion at the end of 1996, the share of
short-term debt in total external debt was only 17.2 percent. The debt
service ratio stood at 11.9 percent in 1998, down from 12.7 percent in 1996.Domestic policies: The Government adopted an expansionary fiscal
policy to ease the impact of the Asian financial crisis. The fiscal deficit
increased to the equivalent of 2.8 percent of GNP for the consolidated public
sector during the first three quarters of 1998 and to 1.8 percent for the
national government for the year. The wider deficit is caused mainly by
reduced revenues resulting from slower imports and corporate income, and
for the most part higher expenditures because of increased debt service costs
arising from the currency depreciation and higher interest rates.

Monetary policy was tightened following the currency depreciation in
July 1997, which led to high interest rates. Interest rates, both nominal and
real, were lower in 1998 than in the previous year. Domestic credit in
November 1998 was only 1 percent higher than that in November 1997.

In the area of financial and capital markets,
reforms have been ongoing since the late 1980s.
Reforms include better supervision and adoption
of higher prudential standards, and stricter controls over lending to nonpriority sectors. The
Philippines entered the crisis with better initial
conditions in the financial sector, compared with
some of its neighbors. Further measures have been
initiated that have strengthened the capacity of
the Philippines to cope with the Asian financial
crisis. With the floating of the peso in July 1997,
the interest rate initially came to be used as an
instrument for checking capital flight. Later, with
the external situation stabilizing, a policy of
reducing interest rates was followed to ease corporate distress emanating from high debt service
costs and to spur private investment activity.

The new administration’s initial policy statements include an emphasis on observing fiscal discipline, ensuring price stability, encouraging economic revival through lowering interest rates, maintaining
the competitiveness of the peso, and promoting exports. To reduce poverty
and manage the social impact of the current economic disruptions, high
priority has been accorded to agriculture and rural development and strengthening of safety nets. The new administration has assigned top priority to
governance issues, particularly anticorruption. It has also placed high priority
on environmental protection and mitigation of the social impact of the crisis.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for the Philippines
was revised in April 1998. The new strategy takes into account the operational priorities emerging from the Asian financial crisis. The strategy gives
increased emphasis to poverty reduction and social development. In particular, the strategy stresses (i) promotion of equitable growth; (ii) better provision of basic social services, including health and education; and
(iii) management and protection of the environment. The promotion of
equitable growth is to be achieved through increased attention to rural
development, a more balanced regional development particularly focused on

southern Philippines, and policies and programs to improve the country’s
infrastructure with greater private sector participation. In health and
education, the emphasis is mainly on improving people’s access to primary health care and basic education. Environmental protection focuses
on the management of natural resources and the urban environment.
The new strategy also gives high priority to capacity building at the local
government level for development management.
Policy dialogue: In 1998, the Bank addressed a wide range of policy
issues in the context of preparing two fast-disbursing loans—the Power
Sector Restructuring Program and the Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement
Sector Development Program. For these loans, discussions focused on improving
economic efficiency through removing impediments to competition, increasing transparency, providing an enabling environment for private sector
participation, improving regulatory mechanisms, and strengthening the
enforcement of laws and regulations. In the context of preparing the Southern
Philippines: Philippines Irrigation Sector Project, the Bank’s policy dialogue with the
Cumulative Bank Lending Government focused on the crucial issue of sustaining irrigation assets through
(as of 31 December 1998) the levy of an irrigation service fee. The Bank has continued to support

lion), education ($77.5 million), urban development ($24.3 million), agriculture ($153.2 million), and a sector development program on
environment ($296 million). The record lending volume reflected the
Bank’s response to the Government’s request for fast-disbursing assistance to deal with the economic difficulties arising from the financial
crisis. In 1998, the Bank also approved two loans amounting to $4.4 million under its private sector operations. In addition, the Bank approved
11 technical assistance grants amounting to $6.7 million, of which one
was for the preparation of a new project.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, the Philippines
has received a total of 172 loans, of which 114 had been closed and 58 were
still active at the end of 1998. Contract awards in 1998 totaled $324.3 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $4.4 billion. The contract award ratio for
1998 was 18 percent. Total disbursements for the year amounted to $368.1 million and cumulative disbursements reached $4.6 billion. The disbursement
ratio for 1998 was 17.7 percent. The high disbursements indicate the efforts
of the Bank to deliver the fast-disbursing assistance requested by the Government.
A portfolio review was conducted jointly by the Bank and the Government
with a special focus on assessing the possible impact of the financial crisis on
project implementation. The review confirmed the priority of Bank-financed

Total 172 7,286.3 100.0projects in the country. It also identified for cancellation loan saving arising

Thailand

Economic performance

Economic growth: Although the stabilization program adopted by the
Government immediately after the onset of the 1997 currency crisis
restored exchange rate stability, the economic downturn deepened in
1998. Real GDP declined further by 8 percent after a 0.4 percent contraction in 1997. Domestic demand contracted sharply, particularly private
consumption and investment, owing to the fall in real income and wealth,
increasing unemployment, prevailing uncertainty and risk, and a credit
crunch. Private consumption contracted by 14.2 percent in 1998 mainly
because of a decline in household purchasing power because of massive
layoffs, asset price deflation, and decreased consumer credits. Private
investment dropped sharply by 40 percent in 1998 compared with a
decrease of 24.8 percent in 1997, reflecting the severe demand contraction and tight liquidity conditions. The economic recession resulted in
a historically high unemployment rate of 5.3 percent.

Inflation: Inflation averaged 9.7 percent in the first half of 1998,
reflecting the baht depreciation, a rise in import prices, and tax increases.
However, as the recession worsened and the baht stabilized during the
second half of 1998, inflationary pressure subsided. The inflation rate for
1998 was contained at around 8 percent.

External sector: Export recovery has been weak. While the volume of
exports increased steadily, the dollar value of exports contracted by 6.6 percent. Imports decreased by 32.3 percent in value. Consequently, the
current account balance improved dramatically, posting a surplus of
11.5 percent of GDP from a deficit of 2 percent in 1997. The capital
account remained in deficit, despite substantial FDI inflows, largely because
of external debt repayments and offshore swap settlements. Official international reserves increased to a comfortable level of $29.5 billion at
the end of 1998. External debt was $85.8 billion as of November 1998.
The average exchange rate in 1998 was about baht (B)41.

Domestic policies: The adjustment program supported by IMF helped
restore macroeconomic stability, but the fiscal and monetary targets were
unduly contractionary. To stimulate the economy, the fiscal deficit target
has been relaxed several times since the beginning of 1998, especially during
the last quarter of 1998. The central government deficit for 1998 increased
to about 2.5 percent of GDP from 0.9 percent in 1997. To alleviate the
negative impact of the crisis, including unemployment, the Government
allocated additional funds for strengthening the country’s social safety nets
during 1998. Monetary policy was also relaxed to ease the liquidity shortage
and allow a reduction in interest rates. The interbank and deposit rates
declined in the third quarter, and lending rates finally showed a downward

trend in the last quarter of 1998. This represents somewhat easier liquidity
conditions in the market. However, financial institutions have become

loan classification and provisioning requirements. To promote reorganization and recapitalization of financial institutions, and encourage lending to

balanced, and sustainable long-term growth; and (iii) poverty reduction and
improvements in the quality of life. To attain these objectives, the Bank will
use a combination of program and project loans, cofinancing (including
guarantee operations), technical assistance, and economic and sector work
that focuses on the financial, social infrastructure, and agriculture sectors.
The strategy will also attempt to mainstream crosscutting concerns, governance issues, and private sector development.

Annual, 1994-1998 Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue continued to focus on reform programs, including in the financial and social infrastructure sectors, in light
of the financial crisis in the country. These reform programs, which were
formulated immediately after the onset of the crisis, are now being implemented. In the Financial Markets Reform Program loan, the agreed
policy matrix, including strengthening of the authority of the Securities
and Exchange Commission, is being closely monitored. In the Social
Sector Program loan, the ministries concerned have identified and started
implementing a number of schemes, including vocational training, job
creation, student loans, scholarship administration, and subsidized health
care, especially for displaced worker households. Policy priority has now
shifted from short-term emergency measures to economic recovery measures. The Bank is actively pursuing a program of policy and institutional
reforms in the agriculture sector.

Loans and technical assistance: Two new loans and one supplementary loan totaling $630 million were approved in 1998 for social sector reform
($500 million), an export financing facility ($50 million), and wastewater
management ($80 million, supplementary). A partial guarantee for a
$950 million syndicated commercial loan for the export financing facility is
additional. The first two loans and the guarantee were extended to reduce
the adverse impact of the crisis and revitalize the economy. Technical assistance
grants totaling $2.9 million for five projects were also approved.

Total 80 4,984.3 100.0Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Thailand
has received a total of 80 loans, of which 64 had been closed and 16 were
under administration at the end of 1998. Contracts amounting to
$500.7 million were awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative
value to $3.4 billion. The contract award ratio for 1998 was 30.8 percent.
Disbursements during the year totaled $563.7 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $3.3 billion. Because of the program loan, the
disbursement ratio for 1998 was 38.4 percent.

A substantial portion of the contract awards and disbursements for 1998
was related to the release of the first tranche in the amount of $300 million
for the Social Sector Program loan approved in March 1998.

Assistance to exporters to help raise the much-needed foreign exchange
was provided through the Export Financing Facility, set up with the participation of 68 international financial institutions.

Cutbacks in the Government’s budget allocation were effected in
the first phase of the stabilization process, causing difficulties in meeting
existing project implementation targets. During the second quarter, the
Government and the Bank jointly assessed the performance of the existing
loan project portfolio to restructure it as necessary, focusing on highpriority projects, and to improve implementation performance. Substantial loan saving was realized out of this exercise and $88.5 million were
subsequently canceled from the loan portfolio. The level of counterpart
funds improved toward the end of the year.

Viet Nam

Economic performance

Economic growth: Viet Nam is one of the few countries in Southeast Asia
that continued to grow in the midst of the Asian financial crisis. The
economy, however, was not completely spared from the adverse effects of
the regional turmoil that affected exports and foreign investment flows, and
dampened real GDP growth to 5.8 percent during 1998, according to official
statistics (staff estimates 4 percent). Adversely affected by natural calamities,
growth in the agriculture sector was less than 3 percent. Rice output, however, further increased, and rice exports reached 3.8 million tons, making
Viet Nam the second largest world exporter of rice after Thailand. The
industry sector continued to expand, underpinned by manufacturing subsector
growth. The construction subsector was adversely affected by the sharp
reduction of FDI inflows and the fiscal austerity measures adopted by the
Government. Services sector growth also fell as tourism and related services
experienced a downturn in activity.

Inflation: End of period consumer price inflation jumped to slightly over
9 percent in 1998, from 3.6 percent in 1997. The pressure of higher rice and
other food prices, and of a 14 percent devaluation of the Vietnamese dong
against the US dollar, contributed significantly to the rise in inflation. The
conduct of monetary policy continued to remain prudent in 1998.

External sector: Merchandise exports, which had grown by 22 percent
in 1997 to nearly $9 billion, expanded by a modest 3.9 percent in 1998.

Crude oil exports expanded considerably in volume to make up for lower
international prices. Export contracts for a record 3.8 million tons of rice
were signed in 1998. Import growth was constrained by slower economic
growth, dong depreciation, and a number of temporary administrative
restrictions, leading to a 2.3 percent fall in merchandise imports in 1998. As
a result, the current account deficit shrank from 6.8 percent of GDP in 1997
to about 4 percent in 1998. Capital inflows declined because of the significant fall in FDI inflows, causing some pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
Net international reserves as of November 1998 stood at $1.6 billion, approximately the same level as at end-1997. Total external debt in convertible
currencies is estimated at $12.5 billion at the end of 1998. In addition, the
country has nonconvertible currency debt, largely denominated in rubles.

Domestic policies: While Viet Nam continued to develop the legal and
regulatory frameworks that are needed for the functioning of the private
sector and of a market economy, such reforms can be further accelerated.

Subregion: Phnom, Peah-Ho Chi Minh City Hichway Prec, (ii) infrastructure development, (iii) rural development, (iv) human devel
opment, and (v) environmental and natural resource management.

Policy dialogue: A vital component of the Bank’s operations in
Viet Nam is to encourage policy and structural reforms to improve public
sector efficiency and develop the private sector. The Bank’s first policy-based
loan to support the Government's Agriculture Sector Program has been
concluded successfully. The major achievement of this program is the
Annual, 1994-1998 enhancement of market orientation and economic efficiency through trade
liberalization in input and output markets. Another policy-based loan in the
financial sector is under implementation, and aims at facilitating policy
reforms to increase the efficiency of the banking subsector. In addition to
program lending, policy dialogue is an important feature in all loan projects.
Dialogue includes support for increased efficiency through tariff reform and
other measures to increase cost recovery and strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning within state-owned utilities. Policy dialogue
also plays an important role in promoting good governance and for improving
natural resource management and environmental protection.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank approved three loans totaling $284 million for the transport sector ($230 million for two loans),Regional Highlights 121

including the $100 million loan component of the GMS: Phnom Penh to
Ho Chi Minh City Highway Project and social infrastructure sector ($54 million). Eleven technical assistance grants totaling $5.9 million were also
approved, four of which were for project preparation.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Viet Nam
has received a total of 34 loans, of which 12 had been closed and 22 were
still active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $212.2 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts to $566 million.
The contract award ratio for 1998 was 18.4 percent. Disbursements for the
year totaled $127.8 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $382.5 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 14.2 percent.

Since 1996, project implementation has improved significantly in
Viet Nam. The overall disbursement ratio for ongoing loans in Viet Nam
has almost tripled, from less than 5 percent in 1996 to 14.2 percent in 1998.
In 1997, the Government took steps to improve the efficiency of its internal
procedures. The Government synchronized the loan processing cycle with
the Bank, decentralized the decision-making authority to some extent, and
issued interministerial circulars to further improve the management and
resettlement of official development assistance (ODA). The new circulars,
in particular, resolved some of the critical issues raised by the Bank, which
include allowing project management units to have direct access to imprest
accounts and guaranteeing sufficient counterpart funds for ODA-financed
projects. It is expected that there would be a greater emphasis on cooperation with neighboring countries in the GMS with the approval of the two
Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City highway loans.

of some agriculture sector goods. The decline in Pakistani reserves, resulting r
from sanctions imposed by major donors, prompted a 20 percent depreciation of the Pakistani rupee. This contributed to a price rise of 7.8 percent,

despite the overall slowdown in economic activity. In Sri Lanka, the rupee
depreciated by over 9 percent, leading to inflation of 9.4 percent.

Restrictions on trade finance reduced the amount of capital available
to fund current account deficits in South Asia. Bangladesh—relatively
unaffected by either the Asian financial crisis or the impact of nuclear test
sanctions—reduced the current account deficit from 1.7 percent of GDP
in the previous year to about 1.1 percent of GDP in FY1997/98. In the case
of India, export growth slowed but imports grew very little as the fall in world
oil prices reduced the import bill for that commodity by 25 percent. The
country’s current account deficit contracted to about 1 percent of GDP.
Difficulties in accessing global capital markets compelled Pakistan to reduce its current account deficit by more than half to about 3 percent of
GDP. Sri Lanka’s current account deficit deteriorated slightly to 3 percent
of GDP in 1998 because of increased imports.

Bangladesh

Economic performance

Economic growth: GDP growth for FY1997/98 (ending 30 June) was 5.7 percent, slightly lower than the 5.9 percent achieved in FY1996/97. Despite a
decline in food crop production because of bad weather conditions, industry
sector growth made a strong recovery from the disappointing performance in
the previous year. On the fiscal front, revenue collection increased by about
11 percent. Implementation of projects under the annual development plan
was behind target, which also resulted in lower-than-expected aid disbursement. The growth prospects of the Bangladesh economy in FY1998/99 were
interrupted by the devastating floods in July-September 1998, which covered
68 percent of the country. Flood-induced expenditures—including additional
food grain imports and postflood rehabilitation spending—and the shortfalls
in current revenue collection because of disruption in economic activities are
expected to increase the budget deficit by about 1 percent of GDP.

Inflation: The inflation rate rose to 7 percent in FY1997/98 from 2.6 percent in the previous year, because of poor food crop production and the
impact of salary increases of government employees.

External sector: The impact of the turbulence in the Asian financial
markets on the Bangladesh economy has been limited so far. Export performance improved noticeably, with the growth rate reaching 16.8 percent in
FY1997/98. The garment and knitwear subsectors accounted for almost the
entire increase in exports. Imports, on the other hand, grew slightly by
5.3 percent. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.1 percent of GDP,
the lowest level in the 1990s. There are some concerns about the low level
of foreign exchange reserves, which by the end of FY1997/98 had declined
to $1.75 billion or equivalent to less than three months of imports.

Domestic policies: In 1998, some progress was made in addressing the
structural problems of the economy. Several initiatives were taken in the
past year to address the difficulties of the banking system. Strong measures
were used by the Bangladesh central bank to address the problem of huge
outstanding nonperforming loans. The Financial Loan Court Act was amendedRegional Highlights 123

to empower loan courts in enforcing the recovery of debts. Restrictions were
imposed on the rescheduling of overdue loans. Furthermore, efforts have
been made to develop a fair, transparent, and efficient capital market. A
series of reforms, including strengthening of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and stock exchange automation, was implemented. The
Government adjusted several administered prices such as fertilizer, petroleum, and electricity for reducing the budget deficit. Some progress was made
in opening up the physical infrastructure and energy sectors for private
investment. But the pace of economic reforms in banking subsector restructuring, public enterprise management, and trade—all critical for stimulating Bangladesh:

growth and building investor confidence—remains slow. Cumulative Bank Lending

Policy dialogue: In 1998, policy dialogue focused on (i) improving the
management of environment and forests, (ii) strengthening microcredit systems,
(iii) intensifying the structural reform of the energy sector, and (iv) improving
the management of the port system. The Sundarbans Biodiversity Conservation Project (cofinanced with the Global Environment Facility) will provide an integrated and sustainable approach to preserve the world’s largest
mangrove forest. In the microcredit subsector, the Rural Livelihood Project
will support a pilot effort to make microcredit self-sustaining by mobilizing
saving through a bank for the landless poor. Energy sector reform continues
to focus on unbundling sector institutions, increasing commercialization,
and creating an enduring environment for greater private sector investment.
Recent discoveries of significant natural gas reserves have highlighted the
need for reform and institutional strengthening. The port subsector is the
commercial lifeline of Bangladesh, and policy dialogue is directed toward its
more efficient commercial management.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1998, the Bank provided four loans
amounting to $200.3 million, including a multisector loan ($104 million) for
flood damage rehabilitation, two in the agriculture and natural resource
sector ($79.6 million), and a private sector loan without government guarantee in the telecommunications subsector ($16.7 million). The Bank also
approved 13 technical assistance grants totaling $17 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1973, Bangladesh
has received a total of 133 loans, of which 92 had been closed and 41 were
still active at the end of 1998.

Contracts worth $282.7 million were awarded during the year, bringing

for 1998 was 25.1 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $230.5 million,

Persistent delays in the recruitment of consultants continued to affect
project implementation. A special arrangement was agreed upon, under which
the Bank will directly assist the Government, on a trial basis, in recruiting
consultants financed from loans approved in 1998. Bank assistance will be
limited to undertaking the selection of consultants, including evaluation and
ranking technical proposals. Contract award and disbursement performance
were adversely affected because of dislocations caused by the floods. A project
implementation and administration seminar was conducted by the Bank to
train executing agency staff on Bank policies, procedures, and guidelines for
procurement of civil works, goods and services, and disbursements. In addition, the Bangladesh Resident Mission held workshops and seminars to train
counterpart staff in planning, monitoring, and implementing projects.

Bhutan
Economic performance

Economic growth: Bhutan continued to experience strong growth in
output in FY1996/97 (ending 30 June), with real GDP growth reaching
5.4 percent. Growth in FY1997/98 was 5.6 percent, even without the
major industrial projects—the commissioning of the ferro-alloy plant and
the expansion of power and concrete production. However, GNP per
capita reached only $430 in 1997.

Inflation: Inflation increased slightly in FY1997/98 to 9 percent from
7 percent in the previous year. Money supply growth of 42 percent—a large
increase from the 30 percent growth rate in the last three fiscal years—was
because of the rising levels of net foreign assets from inflows of foreign aid.
Domestic credit to the Government was cut to counteract the inflationary
impact of aid flows. While the continued monetization of the economy has
been sufficient to absorb current monetary growth, future money supply
growth at the current rates may prove inflationary.

External sector: The dollar value of exports grew by 12 percent in
FY1997/98, much higher than the previous year’s rate of 2 percent. In
addition, slower import growth resulted in a decline in both the trade deficit
from 9 percent of GDP to 7 percent, and the current account deficit from
16 percent of GDP to 12 percent. Bhutan maintained a slight trade surplus
with India, the country’s main trading partner; but bilateral trade in services
resulted in a current account deficit. Capital flows, mostly in the form of aid
for infrastructure investments, were more than sufficient to cover the current account deficit, resulting in an overall balance-of-payments surplus of
more than 12 percent of GDP. This boost in reserves gave Bhutan enough
foreign currency at the end of the fiscal year to cover almost 19 months of
imports. External debt, mainly from multilateral development agencies,
continues to be small. At the end of FY1997/98, total public external debt
was 34 percent of GDP. However, this is because of a decline in nonconvertible
currency debt, as convertible currency debt has been rising over time. Debt
service in FY1997/98 was about 11 percent of merchandise export earnings.Regional Highlights 125

Domestic policies: The Government continues to conduct a prudent
fiscal policy, with current revenues exceeding current expenditures in
FY1997/98. Inflows of foreign grants in excess of development expenditures
led to an overall budget surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP, compared with a
2.4 percent deficit in the previous year. However, this apparent improvement in the country’s fiscal stance was due mainly to a decline in capital
expenditures The process of decentralizing public administration reached an
important milestone this year when the King withdrew as chairperson of the
Council of Ministers in July. The National Assembly elected new cabinet
members, who will chair the Council on a rotating basis. At the same time,
the National Assembly has been empowered to dismiss the King, with a vote
of no confidence. Before these political reforms, the King was the absolute
ruler of Bhutan, although he ruled the country in a consultative manner.

Bank operations

Bhutan:
Cumulative Bank Lending
(as of 31 December 1998)

Operational strategy: In Bhutan, the Bank will continue to play the role
of lender of last resort and as catalyst for mobilizing external resources, on
a grant basis whenever possible, to soften the terms of lending. The opera

institutional strengthening, as well as on preparation of priority development Industry and

projects. The Bank will also assist the Government in promoting privatization Nonfuel Minerals 1 12 18

and private sector participation in infrastructure projects. The Bank’s strat- Tail a a noed

egy also recognizes Bhutan’s strong commitment to preserve its environment
and all Bank assistance is compatible with this objective.

Policy dialogue: The promotion of private sector activities is the key
policy objective associated with the Bank’s operational strategy in Bhutan,
which is to support economic diversification. The objective is consistent
with a key challenge envisaged in the Government’s Eighth Plan, which
emphasizes the promotion of private sector development by removing
policy-related impediments and providing technical support. The Bank
will continue to support the country’s efforts to provide an enabling
policy environment for private sector growth through liberalization of
external trade, regulation of foreign exchange and foreign investment,
rationalization of the financial sector, preparation of more transparent
legislation that would govern business practices, and tariff reform. The
Bank will also assist the Government in promoting privatization and
private sector participation in physical infrastructure projects.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank provided a loan for urban
infrastructure improvement in the two main cities of Thimphu and
Phuentsholing, amounting to $5.7 million. Four technical assistance grants
amounting to $2.2 million were also approved.126 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1982, Bhutan
has received a total of 14 loans, of which 9 had been closed and 5 were still
active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $3.2 million were awarded during
the year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts to $45.9 million. The
contract award ratio for 1998 was 20.8 percent. Disbursements for the year
totaled $4.3 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $45.2 million.
The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 33.1 percent.

A number of issues that continued to impede portfolio performance in
Bhutan were discussed with the Government in November 1998 during the
country portfolio review and a time-bound action plan was agreed to resolve
them. Although the implementation of ongoing projects has improved, there
are still some common implementation issues impeding timely project implementation. These issues include human development constraints, inadequate
staff numbers and skills, and weak procurement and contracting regulations.
To upgrade project implementation in Bhutan, the Bank provided assistance
to improve the regulatory framework for the procurement and contracting
industry. This has been successfully completed and the new regulations have
been put into practice since 1 July 1998. The Bank will provide further
assistance to enhance the institutional capacity of the Construction
Development Board to administer procurement and contracting procedures more
efficiently. A computerized management
information system will be created under
this assistance to improve the administration of contracting and procurement
regulations in Bhutan. This will help the
Government increase its capacity to enforce
accountability among contractors.

India
Economic performance

Economic growth: The Indian economy
grew at 5.8 percent in FY1998/99. While
this was better than the performance in
FY1997/98, it was lower than the average
GDP growth rate of 7.7 percent during
FY1994/95-FY 1996/97. Food grain production for FY1998/99 is estimated to be about
SHRentHenIg "ThE rOMACLIIY, CARACIE?. OF 195 million tons. Indications are that the
enterprises, including skills upgrading, isvamong growth rate in the agriculture sector would be about 5.3 percent. In FY1998/
the vital operating objectives of the Bank. 99, the industry sector was adversely affected by low consumer demand,
subdued export demand, and persistent infrastructure constraints. On the
basis of preliminary data for the first nine months of FY1998/99, it is unlikely
that the industry sector will reach the previous year's growth rate of 5.9 percent for the whole year. In the private sector, business confidence—both
domestic and foreign—has been less buoyant during FY1998/99, compared
with FY1997/98. In the public sector, government revenue continued to fallshort of the budgeted target as a result of the slowing economy. Fiscal deficit
in FY1998/99 increased to 6.5 percent of GDP because of the shortfall in tax
revenue and higher transfers to states because of small savings schemes.

Inflation: The rate of inflation for FY1998/99, measured by the average
wholesale price index (WPI), is expected to be around 7 percent, compared
with 4.8 percent in FY1997/98. The sharp rise in inflation was because of
an exceptional spurt in prices of agricultural commodities arising from shortfalls in production. However, the underlying inflation rate has remained
modest as indicated by the subdued trends in wholesale prices of manufactures, which account for 57 percent weight in the WPI. In terms of the CPI
for industrial workers, prices also increased on a year-on-year basis to 14.4 percent in FY1998/99 from 6.9 percent recorded in FY1997/98.

External sector: During the first three quarters of FY1998/99, exports
contracted by almost 3 percent, compared with the corresponding period in
FY1997/98, reflecting lower external demand, a worsening of India’s export
competitiveness, and emerging infrastructure bottlenecks. Preliminary data
indicate that imports have grown by 7.1 percent on a year-on-year basis
during the first three quarters of FY1998/99. The growth in imports was
partly because of increased imports of non-oil commodities, mainly gold. The
current account deficit in FY1997/98 widened to 1.6 percent of GDP. In
FY1998/99, it is likely to be even higher than the FY1997/98 level. FDI,
which increased by 18.6 percent in FY1997/98, has fallen by 38 percent in
the first three quarters of FY1998/99. There was a net outflow of about
$700 million of foreign portfolio capital from April to December 1998, compared with $1.8 billion net inflow in FY1997/98, partly as a result of contagion from the financial crisis that affected all emerging markets in Asia.
Yet India’s more positive external position and conservative monetary policy
helped the country increase reserves to the relatively comfortable level of
$30.4 billion by the end of January 1999, sufficient to finance seven months
of imports. India’s external debt at end-September 1998 stood at $95.2 billion, of which short-term debt is 3.7 percent.

Domestic policies: Following earlier progress in gradually reducing the
fiscal deficit, the Government’s efforts at fiscal consolidation have been less
effective than expected in recent years because of lower-than-expected revenue
collections, slow progress in reducing subsidies, and delayed implementation
of the Government's plan for disinvestment of SOEs. Nonetheless, there has
been a number of reforms undertaken in the past few months. In October
1998, India’s Prime Minister announced that the insurance subsector would
be opened, for the first time, to the private sector. The Insurance Regulatory
Authority bill was submitted to the Parliament in December 1998 for approval.
In another effort to boost capital market development, the Government
approved amendments to the Companies Act of 1956, which allow companies to buy back their own shares up to 25 percent of paid-up capital and
reserves. An ordinance in this regard was promulgated on 31 October 1998.
In a significant move to rationalize utility tariffs and provide transparent
procedures for tariff reform, the Parliament approved the Electricity Laws
(Amendment) Bill in July 1998, aiming to provide an enabling environment
for the establishment of a Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and
State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. In another significant development, the Government introduced an ordinance in January 1999 repealing

Regional Highlights 127128 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act. Assuming this is subsequently endorsed by Parliament, this could have a very significant impact
on urban development. In an effort to slow money supply expansion
while giving a strong push to economic growth, the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) targeted the growth of money supply at 15-15.5 percent for
FY1998/99. RBI continued with reform measures to provide greater flexibility to banks and deepen financial sector reforms.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for India is designed to help the Government promote employment and reduce poverty
through support for improved efficiency and higher sustainable economic
growth. These objectives are to be accomplished by (i) improving the supplyside efficiency of the economy; (ii) developing and improving the policy,
institutional, and regulatory frameworks to enhance the efficiency of
public sector operations; (iii) encouraging private sector investment through
an improved incentive framework; and (iv) supporting improved public
resource mobilization and management at the state level. While support
for financial and capital market reforms continues to be an important area
of Bank activities, the Bank is also providing critical support in the in
No. of frastructure sector. Consistent with its overall strategy, the Bank’s
Sector Loans $ Million % operational program is guided by the principle of selectivity in both
7 a sectoral and geographical aspects. At the sector level, assistance has

Pradesh Public Resource Management Program loan, intensive policy dialogue was undertaken with the State of Madhya Pradesh, the second state
selected for state-level operations. The program loan will support structural
Annual, 1994-1998 reform in Madhya Pradesh and will focus on improving efficiency in the public
sector, including SOEs, and on strengthening social sector expenditure. It will
also seek to promote greater participation of the private sector in infrastructure
development. The Bank has also played an active role in promoting increased
commercialization in the energy, transport, financial, and social infrastructure
sectors to improve efficiency and encourage increased private sector participation. Policy dialogue was undertaken in close consultation with the IMF,
World Bank Group, and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.

Loans and technical assistance: International sanctions imposed against
new lending by multilateral finance institutions in the wake of nuclear tests
conducted by India in May 1998, affected the Bank’s operations in 1998. As
a result, only one loan amounting to $250 million for the Rajasthan UrbanInfrastructure Development Project was approved. In addition, the Bank
provided five technical assistance grants totaling $4.5 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, India has
received a total of 52 loans, of which 20 had been closed and 32 were still
active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $487.7 million were awarded
during the year, bringing the cumulative total of contracts to $4.7 billion.
The contract award ratio for 1998 was 12.8 percent. Disbursements for the
year totaled $620.4 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $4.4 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 32.9 percent.

Despite the improved loan portfolio in 1998, some projects continued
to suffer from project implementation delays. These included delays in the
award of procurement contracts and recruitment of consultants, slow release
of funds, and late submission of audited accounts. The Bank continued its
assistance by holding regular dialogue with the Government and executing
agencies, training of executing agency staff by the India Resident Mission,
and conducting seminars on project implementation management. A seminar on project implementation and administration was conducted during the
year. A country portfolio review was undertaken to identify implementation
constraints and to agree on suitable actions for their resolution through the
implementation of an action plan.

Maldives
Economic performance

Economic growth: The growth rate in 1997 was 6.2 percent, accompanied
by 7.6 percent inflation, and the growth rate for 1998 is estimated at around
6.8 percent, buoyed mostly by the continued increase in tourist arrivals and
higher international fish prices. The budget deficit, excluding grants, has been
reduced from 24 percent of GDP to around 7 percent during the period 19931998. Fiscal revenues, of which over 90 percent come from import duties and
tourism taxes, remain vulnerable to external developments.

Inflation: The Government’s continued prudent fiscal and monetary
policies helped reduce the inflation rate from 7.6 percent in 1997 to about
negative 2.2 percent in 1998. The increased volumes of imports, particularly
those of consumer goods at the fixed dollar/rufiyaa (Rf) exchange rate, and
increased fish production (the principal food item in the CPI) also helped
in bringing down the inflation rate.

External sector: The Maldives has not been significantly affected by the
Asian financial crisis. There have been no signs of instability in the financial
sector, and the exchange rate has remained pegged at Rf11.8 to the US dollar
for the fourth consecutive year. The current account deficit further deteriorated
in 1998, after registering a small deficit in 1997. This is because of the surge
in imports, associated with development investment in the tourism subsector.
The rising current account deficit is, however, offset by stronger capital
account inflows; this has led to an overall balance-of-payments surplus. The
external position remains satisfactory, with reserves estimated at $128 million, equivalent to more than four months of imports at end-1998. External
debt is estimated at $189 million at end-1998.

Domestic policies: In recent years, tariff reform and partial liberalization of domestic interest rates were introduced. To streamline tax collection,
the Government established the Department of Inland Revenue in 1996 and
the Revenue Board in 1997, and is working toward the introduction in the
coming years of a business profit tax and a property rental value tax to
broaden the current tax base.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The operational strategy for the Maldives aims to
promote (i) regional development to help achieve a more equitable and costeffective distribution of basic economic and social services, and to help ease
the substantial population pressures being placed on the central region of
the country; (ii) human development to address the critical shortage of
skilled labor; and (iii) improvement of public sector management to achieve
higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in the area of financial management. Environmental issues are also being addressed essentially
through mainstreaming in Bank-assisted projects.

Policy dialogue: Policy and institutional matters concerning the longterm development of postsecondary education were the main focus of the
Bank’s dialogue with the Government in 1998. However, important discussions were also continued in the areas of audit, legal development, regional
planning, and private sector participation in the operation of Malé Port.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan amounting to $6.3 million
was approved during 1998 for postsecondary education development.
The Bank also approved three technical assistance grants amounting to
$1.5 million. Technical assistance was provided to the Government to
further strengthen the country’s capacity to prepare national accounts
and to provide advisory assistance in the areas of postsecondary education planning and management, and the identification of the scope for
private sector participation in the ports subsector. A country program review
was conducted jointly with the Government.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member of the Bank in
1978, the Maldives has received a total of eight loans, of which six had been
closed and two were still active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth
$950,000 were awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative total to
$34.9 million. The contract award ratio for 1998 was 7.7 percent. Disbursements amounted to $404,000 in 1998, with cumulative disbursements reaching $34.2 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 5.7 percent. The
contract award and disbursement ratios are indicative of the intermittent
and relatively low level of lending to the country.

Nepal
Economic performance
Economic growth: The overall economic performance in FY1997/98 (end
ing 15 July) further deteriorated because of an erosion in the export base
and weaknesses in resource mobilization. Political instability since 1994 hasresulted in six changes of government leadership. The frequent changes in
government leadership have hampered the implementation of development
activities, thereby adversely affecting the growth potential of the economy.
Real GDP growth in FY1997/98 slowed to 1.9 percent, compared with 4 percent in FY1996/97 and 5.3 percent in FY1995/96. The slowdown is particularly evident in the agriculture and industry sectors. Agriculture sector growth
has been traditionally determined by the monsoon patterns, and the low
growth rate of 1.1 percent in FY1997/98 was mainly because of untimely
rainfall. Decline in industry sector growth to 0.2 percent was observed across
all subsectors, with construction and utilities experiencing contraction of
activities over the past year. The services sector grew by 4.6 percent, up from
4 percent in FY1996/97, mainly because of modest recovery in community
and social services, and of finance and real estate.

Inflation: Consumer price inflation declined further to 4 percent in
FY1997/98 from 7.8 percent in the previous year, mainly reflecting the stable
prices in food and beverages as well as price developments in India. Because
of open-border trading with India, price developments and exchange rate
movements in Nepal often reflect closely those in India. Therefore, the
Nepali rupee’s exchange rate depreciated in line with the Indian rupee by
almost 9 percent against the US dollar during FY 1997/98. The exchange rate
was directly affected by the depreciation of the Indian rupee because of their
close linkage. The Nepali rupee depreciated by almost 9 percent against the
US dollar during FY1997/98 and exerted inflationary pressure on the economy.

External sector: Total export growth continued to recover in
FY1997/98 with a 12 percent increase, compared with sluggish growth during
the past three years. Imports, however, declined by 13 percent, following a
recovery of 22 percent growth in FY1996/97. The trade deficit in
FY1997/98 decreased further to 21 percent of GDP because of the continued
recovery in export growth and the decline in imports. A substantial decline
of remittances during FY1997/98, after the surge in FY1996/97, contributed to the deterioration in the services account. Nevertheless, the
current account deficit was further reduced by 9 percent to $419 million,
or 8.8 percent of GDP in FY1997/98. Inflows of official grants and
concessional aid continued to finance a substantial portion of the current
account deficit in FY1997/98. The capital account balance was sufficient
to cover the current account deficit, leaving a balance-of-payments surplus
of $103 million for FY1997/98. Foreign exchange reserves grew to $712 million by the end of FY1997/98, equivalent to about six months of imports
of goods and services. The debt service ratio was contained below 8 percent of exports; however, the outstanding external debt remained high at
more than 50 percent of GDP, while the debt service ratio reached 9 percent
of exports of goods and nonfactor services.

Domestic policies: Despite substantial development efforts and generous financial support by external agencies, Nepal’s economy has not yet
achieved the growth momentum required for a sustained increase in per
capita income in light of the high rates of population growth. As a result,
Nepal continues to be plagued with high poverty incidence and low social
indicators. High population growth, poverty, and slow economic growth
have put increasing pressure on the country’s natural resource base, aggravating the country’s environmental problems. Recognizing the crucial

Regional Highlights 131132 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

importance of proper environmental management and of effective implementation of the existing environmental policy and legal frameworks, the
Government has in recent years adopted a more systematic approach for
environmental protection. While the resource requirements have been emphasized in the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan and the Agricultural
Perspective Plan (APP), there is a lack of policy and reform measures to
support the effective delivery of necessary services, including the financial
sector and institutional development. Nepal’s structural reform program has
been seriously delayed because of frequent changes in government leadership
during the past four years. There is an urgent need to align and implement
the reform agenda for realizing the targets and objectives under the Ninth
Plan, including the APP. The Government's efforts to pursue a consensus to
reinvigorate the reform process and reinstill fiscal discipline and investor

Nepal: confidence will be the immediate priorities.

of the Bank’s assistance among other donors in the country; and (iii) the
development impact of the Bank’s assistance. The revision exercise includes
a thorough review and assessment of the Bank’s past development experience in Nepal. The revised operational strategy is expected to address the
issue of absorptive capacity in terms of institutional and fiscal concerns. The
current trend of declining revenue mobilization has serious implications on
‘Annual, 1994-1998 the country’s capabilities to provide counterpart funds and sustain development activities after project completion. The persistent high incidence of
poverty and low social and human development indicators, despite generous
donor support, require a clear vision and strategy for future Bank assistance.

Policy dialogue: The impact of the Asian financial crisis depends on
the insulation capabilities of the Indian economy, which will be translated
immediately to Nepal because of their pegged currencies. It is, therefore,
most important to focus on consolidating resources and improving effectiveness and efficiency of existing investments, rather than on formulating new
commitments which will further weaken the limited capacities of development
administration, and the physical and social infrastructure. Measures are urgently
needed to address the structural weaknesses of the economy, particularly in
the financial sector, and utilization of external assistance. Sustained improvement of the trade deficit in the medium term will require substantial efforts
to improve the institutional and policy environment, enabling further development of export items and destinations. Successful implementation of thevalue added tax will provide a prospect for improving resource mobilization.
Nepal needs to safeguard its macroeconomic stability, particularly in the fiscal
and external positions, to protect its foreign exchange commitments and
obligations. More important, urgent efforts are needed to tackle the roots of
investment inefficiency, including (i) separation of politics and bureaucracy;
(ii) performance-based civil service; (iii) privatization of SOEs; (iv) enhancement
of accountability and ownership; and (v) institutional development focusing
on credibility, including the private sector and development administration.
These elements need to be fully in place to ensure effective and efficient
delivery of development and private sector activities.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank approved in 1998 four loans
to Nepal totaling $105 million, including three loans for agriculture and
natural resources ($100 million) and one for the social infrastructure sector
($5 million). Nine technical assistance grants totaling $4.4 million were approved.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Nepal
has received a total of 94 loans, of which 68 had been
closed and 26 were still active at the end of 1998. Contracts worth $75.3 million were awarded during the year,
bringing the cumulative total of contracts to $1.1 billion.
The contract award ratio for 1998 was 29.9 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $120.3 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to $1.1 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 28 percent.

Project implementation continued to encounter delays
because of inadequate institutional capacity. Bank initiatives
in 1998 included the provision of technical assistance and
training programs to improve implementation capacity of
executing agencies. Two workshops, with participants from
the Government and executing agencies, were conducted
under a technical assistance to improve project implementation. The Nepal Resident Mission continued to assist by
holding monthly meetings with project directors/managers. Delays in recruitment of consultants and high turnover of project managers were identified as the main causes
of implementation delays. An action plan agreed between
the Government and the Bank will be undertaken to improve
implementation performance.

Pakistan
Economic performance

Economic growth: Before the nuclear testing in May 1998,
which resulted in international sanctions imposed by major
donors, macroeconomic performance was generally encouraging. Real GDP had grown by 5.3 percent in FY1997/98
(ending 30 June), compared with negative 0.4 percent in the
previous fiscal year, largely because of good crop output and
a significant revival of manufacturing. Economic performance

in FY1997/98 was stronger than in recent years—investment had increased,
gross national savings had picked up, and the trade gap had narrowed
substantially. The agriculture sector—contributing 25 percent of GDP and
47 percent of employment—was estimated to have grown by 5.9 percent,
compared with the growth rate of 0.1 percent in the previous fiscal year. The
situation gradually changed during the first half of the current fiscal year,
with historically low foreign currency reserves, drastically declining remittances from overseas workers, and a significant reduction in foreign debt
service capacity. By mid-December, sovereign debt had been further
downgraded with a negative outlook by rating agencies; and default on
major loans had become a real possibility. To address these difficulties,
IMF approved a financial package for Pakistan in mid-January 1999,
which includes debt rescheduling and new assistance by external donors.
The Paris Club (official debt) met in January 1999 and reached an
agreement to reschedule $3.3 billion in official bilateral debt. The London
Club (commercial debt) is expected to meet soon to similarly consider
rescheduling private sector debt.

Inflation: In FY 1997/98, the increase in CPI was 7.8 percent, compared
with 11.8 percent in FY1996/97. Several factors contributed to this deceleration:
reduction in tariff rates and the decrease in international petroleum prices
and government-administered prices for some essential commodities, together
with tight monetary and fiscal policies. A decline in international prices of
imports and an increased supply of essential items were also contributory
factors, resulting in the first single-digit inflation in the past five years.

External sector: Export earnings for FY1997/98 were $8.4 billion, an
increase of 4 percent over the year before, but well below the annual export
growth target of 15 percent. The slow growth of exports was mainly attributed to a decline in the exports of cotton yarn, affected by recession in major
Asian markets. Imports declined by 8.2 percent, resulting in an improvement
in the current account deficit from 5.8 percent of GDP in FY1996/97 to
3.0 percent of GDP in FY1997/98.

The massive devaluation in exchange rates in the countries affected
by the Asian financial crisis undermined Pakistan’s competitiveness during
FY1997/98. On top of this, the chronic high concentration of exports of
a few items (cotton, leather products, rice, synthetic textiles, and sport
goods), low technology and the resultant low quality of products, shortage
of financial resources, and aging production facilities resulted in a slow
increase in exports during the year. The imposition of restrictions by major
donors aggravated the foreign exchange position by adversely affecting capital
inflows and workers’ remittances. Official foreign exchange reserves fell to
as low as $400 million, equivalent to less than two weeks of imports by
December 1998. However, reserves subsequently recovered to $1.5 billion
as a result of a resumption of assistance by IMF and other donors.

Domestic policies: Pakistan’s economy has deteriorated rapidly since
the nuclear tests and the subsequent worsening of the international
situation, which adversely affected foreign investments in Pakistan.
Although the IMF approved a financial package for Pakistan in January
1999, the underlying socioeconomic difficulties confronting the country
are not likely to be resolved rapidly, considering that the problems are
rooted in structural bottlenecks and restrictions imposed by major donors.Regional Highlights 135

potential of the private sector is being harnessed whenever possible. Resource
mobilization reform, financial market development, governance and public
sector reforms, and an improved policy environment for private sector industry
and export-led growth are also key elements of the strategy.

Policy dialogue: Key policy implications of Bank operations in Pakistan
include resource mobilization and utilization, public sector management and
policy making, governance, devolution, and decentralization. These issues \
are intertwined and cut across all aspects of the Bank’s program in Pakistan, Annual, 1994-1998
involving ongoing dialogue in all sectors of Bank intervention. Extensive
dialogue continued with respect to the 1998 financial crisis and the Bank’s
support for the Government’s macroeconomic and financial reforms program.

Loans and technical assistance: Following the international sanction
after the nuclear tests and Pakistan’s arrears on loan service payments to the
Bank, no loans were approved in 1998. Eight technical assistance grants
amounting to $3.9 million were approved during the year.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Pakistan
has received a total of 179 loans, of which 113 had been closed and 66 were
still active at the end of 1998. Contract awards during the year amounted
to $315.9 million, bringing the cumulative figure to $6.7 billion. The contract
award ratio for 1998 was 20.5 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled
$523 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching $6.9 billion. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 24.7 percent. The Bank undertook a country portfolio
review during the year to assist the Government in identifying and resolving
project implementation constraints. Timely implementation of Bank projects
has been hampered by a number of project management, financial, and
procurement constraints, some related to the effects of the sanctions.

Generic factors that affected project implementation across the portfolio include long delays in the preparation and approval of projects, recruitment of consultants, prequalification of contractors, and award of contracts.
Staff at Bank headquarters and the Pakistan Resident Mission continued to
assist the Government and executing agencies through dialogues and seminars. A project implementation and administration seminar was held to train136 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

executing agency staff. The Country Portfolio Review Mission was conducted to resolve generic issues. Portfolio restructuring was undertaken,
resulting in loan cancellation of surplus loan proceeds of $243.1 million.
Pakistan’s economic difficulties imposed high fiscal constraints, which severely
limited the availability of counterpart funds for timely implementation of
projects. A serious concern for the Bank was delayed or nonsubmission of
audited project accounts. The Bank introduced measures to improve the
level of submission of audited accounts.

Sri Lanka

Economic performance

Economic growth: The Sri Lankan economy has grown at an annual average
of about 5.4 percent during the 1990s, despite the constraints imposed by
periodic drought, the ongoing civil conflict, and an often difficult regional
environment resulting from the international sanctions on India and Pakistan.
In 1998, Sri Lanka achieved a real increase in GDP of 5.3 percent. This is
a creditable outcome, despite being below the 6.4 percent growth achieved
in 1997. So far, the Sri Lankan economy has not felt any major impact from
the Asian crisis, with the exception of net foreign divestment from the stock
market and a slowdown in direct capital inflows from regional countries. The
depreciation of the rupee in 1997 and 1998 was in line with domestic
inflation. Despite a modest increase in private investments in infrastructure
projects and the flow of private capital from continued privatization, private
sector investors’ confidence was adversely affected by the regional instability
following the international sanctions on India and Pakistan for nuclear tests.
This reduced private investors’ confidence is reflected in the drastic changes
in the performance of the Colombo stock exchange. Followed by an 11 percent increase in the first four months of 1998 over the 1997 performance,
the all-share price index started falling in May as the aftershocks of international sanctions on India and Pakistan and the resulting regional instability contributed to driving foreign investors away.

Inflation: In 1998, the inflation rate was about 9.4 percent, which was
slightly lower than the 9.6 percent recorded in 1997. Increased output of the
agriculture sector, the easing of international oil prices, and prudent monetary
control helped contain inflationary pressures.

External sector: In 1998, both exports and imports grew by about
7 percent. Textiles, garments, and leather goods spurred industrial export
growth, while tea contributed to the growth in agricultural exports. The
current account deficit slightly deteriorated to 3 percent of GDP in 1998
because of increased imports associated with development investments in
infrastructure projects. Strong capital inflows, however, reflecting increased
foreign borrowings, led to an overall balance-of-payments surplus of about
$81 million, raising official foreign exchange reserves to almost $2 billion,
equivalent to four months’ import cover. Total outstanding external debt at
the end of 1998 was estimated to be $6.5 billion.

Domestic policies: In 1998, there was further consolidation of the
economic fundamentals of the country. Prudent fiscal management and aRegional Highlights 137

commitment to economic liberalization have established a basis for sustained
economic growth. A goods and services tax was introduced in early 1998 to
broaden the tax base. There was also continued progress in the implementation of the Government's privatization program, including the partial
privatization of Air Lanka and Regional Plantation Companies, and the
award of a build-operate-transfer contract to the private sector for the
development of the Queen Elizabeth Quay in Colombo Port. During the
year, the Government also entered into performance agreements with two
major state banks; over the medium term, this may lead to improvements Sri Lanka:

Policy dialogue: Throughout 1998, the Bank continued to place strong
emphasis on policy dialogue in the sectors where it is an important development partner, including road, energy, tea industry, urban development,
and low-income housing. In the road subsector, agreement was reached on
improved operation and maintenance funding for the primary road network,
and for the promotion of private sector participation in road construction
and maintenance. The Bank approved technical assistance to review the Annual, 1994-1998
capacities and performance of the road sector institutions; the findings will
form the basis for future sector dialogue. In 1998, the Bank completed an
energy sector strategy study. The study concluded that future development
of the sector would be inhibited if substantial restructuring was not undertaken. Following consultation with the sector stakeholders, the Government
sought the Bank’s assistance to plan and implement the proposed sector
reforms. Significant policy and institutional reform measures for the tea
industry were also agreed with the Government in 1998. These reforms
centered on providing the industry participants with a greater voice in
the allocation of funds raised through a levy on the tea industry and the
management of key sector institutions. The adoption of these reforms is
expected to have a positive impact on the future viability of the industry.
The Bank’s dialogue in the urban subsector focused on the need for
enhanced management capacity of local authorities to plan and implement
key urban infrastructure and services. It was agreed that subprojects would
be undertaken only in urban centers where the local authorities demonstrated adequate management capacity and commitment.

Loans and technical assistance: Four loans amounting to $190 million
were approved during the year in the transport ($80 million), social138

and financial ($5 million) sectors. The Bank also approved nine technical
assistance grants amounting to about $7.2 million.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Sri Lanka
has received a total of 88 loans, of which 27 were still active at the end
of 1998. Contract awards during the year amounted to $105.1 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $1.6 billion. The contract award ratio
for 1998 was 14 percent. Disbursements during the year amounted to
$120.1 million, with cumulative disbursements reaching $1.5 billion. The
disbursement ratio for 1998 was 25 percent.

In 1997, the Bank provided technical assistance to identify the key
impediments to the smooth implementation of the Bank’s loan portfolio.
Subsequently, an action plan was agreed with the Government to progressively
remove the identified impediments. In 1998, a review of the action plan was
undertaken, revealing that 37 of the 51 activities included in the action plan
had been addressed and appropriate follow-up was being taken on remaining
matters. A project implementation and administration seminar was also held
in Colombo for staff of executing agencies to enhance their knowledge of
the Bank’s loan administration procedures and requirements. To improve
portfolio performance, the Bank also provided technical assistance to improve
procurement procedures, resulting in the establishment of the Sri Lanka
Procurement Support Bureau. During the year, the Sri Lanka Resident
Mission held quarterly meetings with government authorities to discuss the
status of implementing the Bank’s loan portfolio; and in October, the Mission
conducted a country portfolio review.

The Pacific

The Pacific DMCs of the Bank include Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea (PNG),
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. They are relatively
small and isolated economies, remote from developed country markets, and
environmentally vulnerable, and therefore have limited economic options.

Nineteen ninety-eight was another difficult year for the Pacific DMCs.
Real GDP declined in 9 of the 12 countries, particularly in Solomon Islands,
which was the hardest hit by the Asian financial crisis. For seven of the nine—
Cook Islands, Fiji, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru,
Solomon Islands, and Tonga—it was the second successive year of decline.
For the three countries in which real GDP rose—Kiribati, PNG, and Tuvalu—
the increases ranged from 1.5 to 2.5 percent. In line with the recessionary
conditions, inflation rates were below 4 percent, except in the cases of Fiji,
PNG, Samoa, and Solomon Islands, where substantial currency devaluations
occurred and inflation rose to between 5 and 12 percent. In the three countries
issuing their own currencies, the external situation varied: in Samoa, increased
remittance flows were a major reason for an improved current account balance; in Tonga, a crisis of confidence in the currency was forestalled by
monetary tightening; and in Vanuatu, a balance-of-payments crisis was averted
by monetary tightening and imposition of capital controls. In the six countries
using the Australian, New Zealand, or US dollar—Cook Islands, Kiribati,Regional Highlights 139

Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, and Tuvalu—merchandise trade deficits continued to be covered largely by varied combinations
of official transfers, overseas investment income, and workers’ remittances.

In 1998, Bank-supported reform programs were ongoing in Cook Islands,
Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, and Vanuatu. The focus on policy reform is reflected in the share
of program lending to the Pacific DMCs in 1998. Out of a total of eight loans
to the Pacific DMCs amounting to $82.8 million, four loans totaling $57.5 million were policy-based program loans. As springboards for policy dialogue,
three economic reviews—for Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu—were
prepared. In addition, two special reports on policy reform strategies and
development priorities were completed—A Different Kind of Voyage and
Improving Growth Prospects in the Pacific.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s strategy for the Cook Islands supports
the implementation of the Economic Restructuring Program (ERP). In Annual, 1994-1998
particular, the ERP seeks to (i) achieve and maintain macroeconomic
stability, with focus on fiscal and external sector balance; (ii) ensure
structural reforms, with policies to rationalize and redefine the role of
government and promote private sector-led economic recovery, particularly in the agriculture, tourism, and marine resource sectors; and
(iii) enhance equity and community participation. The Bank will continue to support the ERP through its technical assistance grants.
Policy dialogue: The Cook Islands’ ERP was implemented with Bank
assistance. The Bank’s ongoing policy dialogue has been within the framework of the ERP, focusing in particular on fiscal stabilization, including the
introduction of institutional and legislative measures to ensure greater140 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Loans and technical assistance: No loan was approved in 1998 for the
Cook Islands. One technical assistance grant of $750,000 was approved to
prepare a new project on urban infrastructure improvement.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1976, the
Cook Islands has received a total of 11 loans, of which 4 were still active at
the end of 1998. Contract awards for the year amounted to about $1.8 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $22.6 million. The contract award ratio for
1998 was 21 percent. Disbursements amounted to about $2 million for the year,
with cumulative disbursements standing at $20.9 million. The disbursement ratio
for 1998 was 43.2 percent. Project implementation was affected by a lack of
qualified staff and weaknesses in management and accounting systems. Project
implementation personnel attended the Bank’s regional project implementation and administration seminar held in Fiji in May 1998. The Bank served
as an “honest broker” in a debt-restructuring exercise, which resulted in more
favorable lending arrangements with three official bilateral creditors.

Economic performance

Economic growth: The Fiji economy contracted for the second year in
succession. Real GDP fell by 4 percent, largely because drought-affected sugar
output dropped by half from the 1997 level; and gold production fell 20 percent.

Inflation: The average annual inflation rate increased to 5.7 percent
from 3.4 percent in 1997, reflecting the 20 percent devaluation of the Fiji
dollar in January and the consequent upward pressure on prices and wages.

External sector: The current account moved into a deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP as export revenue from all major sources, except tourism, fell.
However, the overall balance of payments moved into surplus in 1998 because
of a turnaround in the capital account. The external position remained
sound, with foreign reserves covering five months of imports, and external
debt equivalent to 9 percent of GDP. At the end of 1998, the real exchange
rate was 13 percent below its predevaluation level.

Domestic policies: Despite tight monetary policies and an increase in
the underlying fiscal deficit to around 4 percent of GDP, interest rates
remained low and negative in real terms. The low rates had no discernible
effect on private investment, which remained depressed because of uncertainty over the economic policy framework. The renewal of expiring agricultural land leases was the most pressing issue, but there was also a recognized
need for greater transparency and predictability in macroeconomic policy in
general, and for continued efforts for improving the fiscal position.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Fiji focuses on
assisting the Government in its ongoing efforts to stimulate growth throughRegional Highlights 141

encouraging private investment and export-oriented activities. Key policy
issues include the need to (i) expand and diversify the economy to provide
jobs and decrease its vulnerability to volatile export markets; (ii) enhance
the pace of the reforms, particularly in the public sector; (iii) restore confidence
in the long-term commitment of the Government to promote private sectorled growth, especially through corporatization and commercialization, capital market development, and targeted public sector investment; and (iv) address
environmental and natural resource management concerns.

Policy dialogue: Discussions during the year focused on public sector
restructuring, commercialization in agriculture, capital market development, cost recovery in the road subsector, and environmental legislation.
Given Fiji’s difficult economic situation and its uncertain outlook, the
economic and sector work was expanded to include the preparation of
an economic review identifying medium-term prospects and challenges,
and an urban sector strategy study.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were approved in 1998. One
technical assistance grant of $800,000 was approved to prepare a water
supply and sewerage project in the Suva-Nausori area.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1970, Fiji has
received a total of 13 loans, of which 2 were still active at the end of 1998.
Contract awards for the year amounted to about $230,000, bringing the
cumulative total to $109.2 million. The contract award ratio for 1998 was
0.6 percent. Disbursements for the year totaled $994,000, with cumulative disbursements standing at $112.9 million. The disbursement ratio
for 1998 was 2.4 percent. Project implementation progress was slow,
experiencing delays because of staffing and budgetary constraints. Institutions with limited implementation capacity were supported by the
capacity-building process. Under Bank financing and project implementation, personnel of executing agencies attended the Bank’s regional
project implementation and administration seminar, held in Fiji in
May 1998, to familiarize themselves with Bank procedures.

largely reflected activity in the public sector, which accounted for about
three quarters of GDP. The retail price index for urban Tarawa rose by an Novof

Domestic policies: The Medium-Term Strategy, adopted in late 1997,

First is the near-static GDP per capita since independence in 1979. Second
is finding employment as the workforce is expected to increase by 60 percent
in the next 15 years. Third is the Government’s ability to sustain the growth
in public services. Proposed strategies for addressing these issues included
a reduction in the size of core government, public enterprise reform, facilitation
of private sector development, and encouragement of foreign investment.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Kiribati seeks to
promote sustainable growth and improvements in the living standards of the
people of Kiribati. The focus of Bank operations are on three main areas:
(i) strengthening policy and public sector reforms, with emphasis on improving government resource efficiency and on restructuring/reforming public
enterprises; (ii) developing social infrastructure; and (iii) promoting private
sector activities, including outer island development.

Policy dialogue: With Bank assistance, a comprehensive program has
been prepared for infrastructure improvement in water supply, sewerage, and
solid waste management. Institutional reforms, designed to enhance the
effectiveness and efficiency in the operation and maintenance of public
utilities, have also been identified. The Bank’s policy dialogue with the
Government during the year included restructuring of the Public Utilities
Board (PUB); sustainability of operations in the utilities subsector, including
cost recovery, and operation and maintenance; and water and environment
conservation. The Bank convened the first Consultative Group (CG) meeting in Tokyo in January 1998. Kiribati looked to the CG process to help
implement its development strategy more proactively.

Loans and technical assistance: A $10.2 million loan was approved in
1998 for sanitation, public health, and environment improvement. In addition, the Bank approved three advisory technical assistance grants for
$1.9 million for management and financial advisory services for the
restructuring of the PUB and for community development and participation initiatives, and $380,000 supplementary financing for strengthening institutional capacity and economic management.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1974, Kiribati
has received a total of six loans, of which one was not yet effective at
the end of 1998. Cumulative contract awards and cumulative disbursements to Kiribati amounted to $4.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
There were no contracts awarded or disbursements made in 1998. Key
government officials participated in a number of Bank-sponsored programs and workshops designed to improve familiarity with Bank procedures
and policies, as well as project management capacity.

 

Marshall Islands
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

The level of economic activity in the Marshall Islands declined for the third
successive year in 1998, as a result of ongoing public service downsizingRegional Highlights 143

under the Policy Reform Program and poor performances in agriculture and
fisheries. Real GDP dropped by an estimated 5 percent, resulting in a 17 percent drop in real per capita GDP over the three-year period. Inflation
declined to 4 percent from 5 percent in the previous year. Merchandise
imports fell more than exports, thereby improving the current account,
inclusive of declining official transfers. The capital account was in deficit as
the Government repaid loans to bring the external debt to a manageable
level. Government holdings of US dollar reserves were equivalent to just
three weeks of merchandise import cover.

Domestic policies: The key policy issue was still the effective implementation of reforms required to put the economy on the path to fiscal and
external balance. The reforms included further public service downsizing,
introduction of revenue-raising measures, public enterprise reform, and actions
to create an enabling environment for the private sector.

Policy dialogue: The principal areas of the Bank’s policy dialogue
with the Government remained concentrated on issues to enhance economic and financial management of the country. Specifically, it focused
on the elimination of macroeconomic constraints and was in support of
the Government’s private sector development initiatives. In addition, Bank
assistance included further institutional strengthening, establishment of a
private sector unit, fisheries management, and a coconut sector development
study. In January 1998, the Bank convened the Third Consultative Group
meeting of the country’s donors in Tokyo, Japan. The meeting provided the
opportunity to monitor the reform progress and learn about the
Government’s experience in implementing the reforms.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were approved during the
year. The second tranche of the Bank-financed Public Sector Reform
Program loan was released in September 1998. One advisory technical
assistance grant amounting to $130,000 was approved for the Coconut
Sector Development Study.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1990, the Marshall
Islands has received a total of seven loans, of which four were still active
at the end of 1998. Contract awards for the year amounted to $6.4 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $29.3 million. The contract award ratio for
1998 was 45.3 percent. Disbursements totaled $7.9 million for the year, with
cumulative disbursements standing at $26.2 million. The disbursement ratio
for 1998 was 40.9 percent. Several project review missions were carried out
to speed up project implementation.

Overall, implementation progress was generally satisfactory, except for
one project for education development, which was significantly behind schedule
because of frequent staff changes and other implementation difficulties.144 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Federated States of Micronesia
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

The real GDP of the Federated States of Micronesia fell by an estimated
3.1 percent in FY1997/98 (ending 30 September), following a 4 percent fall
in FY1996/97. Public administration contracted, and drought had a negative
effect on agriculture sector output. The inflation rate remained stable at
3 percent. Merchandise exports fell slightly from the 1997 level, but the
current account deficit—exclusive of official transfers—declined to 16.7 percent
of GDP from 17.7 percent in 1997. The Government’s financial holdings
were equivalent to almost six months of import cover.

Domestic policies: Implementation of the Public Sector Reform Program,
adopted in 1997, continued in 1998, with a focus on reducing government
involvement in the economy and promoting private activity in agriculture,
fisheries, and tourism. To ensure a sustainable reduction in government
expenditure, major measures were adopted such as a freeze in public service
hiring and wages, retrenchments, restructuring of ministries and government

Policy dialogue: Policy reform and dialogue continue to be the major
focus of the Bank’s program of assistance to the Federated States of Micronesia.
The core of this dialogue is moving from an emphasis on fiscal and macroeconomic stability and management to the stimulation of private sector
investment, and improved performance and prioritization of the public sector.
The Bank is helping the Federated States of Micronesia examine and discuss
land and capital resource market policies, in addition to sector policies—this
is likely to be an increasingly important component of future overall development policy. The Bank convened the third Consultative Group meeting
of the country’s donors in Tokyo in January 1998 to discuss the progress of
reform implementation and future economic strategy.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were approved during the
year. Two advisory technical assistance grants amounting to $4.9 million
were approved to improve performance-based public resource management,
and to continue economic policy reform and management.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1990, the Federated
States of Micronesia has received three loans, all of which were under
administration during the year. Contract awards for the year amounted to
$6.9 million, bringing the cumulative total to $18.9 million. The contract
award ratio for 1998 was 34.3 percent. Disbursements totaled $6.2 million
for the year, with cumulative disbursements standing at about $18 million.The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 28.6 percent. The Bank has curtailed
the procurement of the remaining fishing vessels under the Fisheries
Development Project in view of unfavorable returns on investment.

Of the three loans under administration, two projects progressed
slowly, while the program loan progressed satisfactorily. Project implementation delays were related to issues concerning internal financing
agreements and staff changes in one project, and delayed start-up requiring extension of the loan closing date in the other.

Nauru
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Phosphate export revenue in 1990-1997 reached only 60 percent of the
1980s average, and fell again in 1998. As a result of the export slump, the
level of economic activity has declined; and there has been a direct and
major impact on government finances. Real GDP is estimated to have fallen
by about 14 percent between FY1991/92 (ending 30 June) and FY1995/96,
and by a further 20 percent in the subsequent two years. In FY1997/98, GDP
per capita in current prices was about Australian dollar (A$)4,600. Moreover, net income receivable from the Nauru Phosphate Royalty Trust has
been declining. The inflation rate was 4 percent. The merchandise trade
deficit declined as the budget deficit fell.

Domestic policies: In 1998, the Government had to develop policies to
address the fiscal and financial crises that had resulted from years of financial
and economic mismanagement. Public sector reforms were contemplated,
including cuts in public expenditure and increased taxes on imports. Plans
were developed to revive the banking subsector. There was also a need to
establish the true value of the assets of the Nauru Phosphate Royalty Trust.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy is for Nauru to achieve
long-term economic and financial sustainability through a reform program
that includes (i) improved fiscal management, (ii) better public debt and
trust fund management, (iii) public sector reforms, and (iv) restructuring of
the economy. The economy needs to reduce its dependence on phosphate
mining and move toward a more balanced real economy. The strategy should
ensure future stability of income and living standards at levels sustainable
by the economy, without distortion through government subsidies.

Policy dialogue: In terms of economic and financial management, the
major effort supported by a program loan will be to achieve all-round economic and fiscal discipline. To avoid economic collapse, a comprehensive
reform program with agreed performance benchmarks was developed in
consultation with the Government.

Loans and technical assistance: The Bank’s first loan to Nauru, amounting
to $5 million, was approved in 1998 for fiscal and financial reform. The Bank
also approved an advisory technical assistance grant of $600,000.

Papua New Guinea
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Following the 1997 recession, the Papua New Guinea economy recovered
in 1998 to record an estimated real GDP growth rate of 2.5 percent. This
reflected a growth in minerals output that outweighed a decline in output
from the nonmineral subsector. The lingering effects of the 1997 drought
were compounded by the impact of the Asian financial crisis on commodity exports, which fell substantially from the 1997 level, placing
considerable pressure on the balance of payments. Central bank intervention, the revival of private flows, and an advance Australian aid
payment permitted the currency to stabilize.
Domestic policies: The fiscal policy stance in 1998 was conservative,
with an overall budget deficit of 1.2 percent of projected GDP. The
No. of actual outcome was a deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP. In November, the

Guinea is to focus on strengthening governance reforms and public sector
management. The Bank supports the Government in reforming public
sector management to focus on outputs and on strengthening financial
management. The generation of long-term, income-earning opportunities is another key concern, to be addressed through private sector
development. The Bank will help by improving sector policy and institutional frameworks, and by selective infrastructure investments, especially in the transport sector. The third broad strategic concern is the
critical need to improve the dismal social indicators; the emphasis is on
rural areas, especially on improving the status of women.

Policy dialogue: The focus of policy dialogue has been on the underlying development management weaknesses that hamper effective planning
and management throughout the economy. The Bank is concentrating on
helping the Government reform the public sector financial management
systems. Improving the efficiency of service delivery, by contracting out
services, has been the core of dialogue in agriculture; institutional strengthening and a focus on sustainability have dominated discussions on commercial fisheries. The need for rational, evidence-based decision making has
underlined dialogue in the transport sector.

 

Annual, 1994-1998Loans and technical assistance: In 1998, the Bank approved two loans
amounting to $14.1 million for fisheries development ($6.5 million) and
smallholder support services pilot ($7.6 million) projects. In addition, seven
technical assistance grants totaling $2.6 million were approved, of which
three were advisory in nature. The remaining four were for project preparation, including one supplementary financing to an earlier project.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1971, Papua
New Guinea has received a total of 47 loans, of which 11 were still active
at the end of 1998. Contract awards for the year amounted to $15.9 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $467.4 million. The contract award ratio
for 1998 was 17.6 percent. Disbursements totaled about $24 million for the
year, with cumulative disbursements standing at $472.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 25.3 percent. Spring-cleaning has been done
by review missions, resulting in a scaling down in project scope to match
budget appropriations, which led to cancellations of surplus loan proceeds of $31.3 million during the year.

Project implementation was hampered by weak institutional capacities
of executing agencies and limited government budgetary appropriations.
Significant delays were experienced, requiring extension of the loan closing
dates to coincide with project completion.

Samoa
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Samoa’s economic growth has slowed in the past two years. Real GDP
increased by 0.8 percent in 1997, and in the first half of 1998 GDP contracted by 0.4 percent. However, nominal gross remittance flows increased
by 19 percent in 1997 to a level equivalent to 20 percent of GDP; and in
the first half of 1998, they were up 20 percent on the comparable period the
year before. These represented substantial real increases, given an inflation
rate of around 6 percent; and they—along with
a fall in imports, increased tourism receipts,
and some commodity export growth—contributed to a reduction in the current account
deficit. The overall balance of payments was
positive as a result of official borrowing on
concessional terms, with foreign reserves covering eight months of merchandise imports.
Domestic policies: The Government's
commitment to economic reform, enunciated
in A New Partnership: A Statement of Economic

addition, tax and tariff reforms have been implemented; and plans are being
developed for further public sector reform, particularly in regard to public
enterprise commercialization, corporatization, and privatization.

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank supports the Government's reform measures,
which are aimed at making the economy more enterprise-based and competitively structured. These measures include (i) public sector reform, (ii) liberalization
of the financial sector, (iii) promotion of private sector-led growth,
(iv) corporatization and privatization of SOEs, (v) improvement of the management of infrastructure, and (vi) improvements in the education system.

Policy dialogue: The Bank encouraged the Government to continue to
implement its strategy of promoting private sector-led growth, as well as its
privatization and corporatization program to reduce the fiscal drag on the
economy. In particular, the Bank encouraged the Government to ensure
greater financial autonomy of SOEs, improve accountability of their management,
and continue its initiatives to rationalize utility pricing to improve cost recovery.

Loans and technical assistance: One financial sector program loan for
$7.5 million was approved during the year. The Bank also approved three
advisory technical assistance grants amounting to about $2 million for strengthening macro policy and planning capacity, evaluation of sewage treatment
options, and institutional strengthening of government financial institutions.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1966, Samoa
has received 26 loans, of which one was still active at the end of 1998.
Contract awards for the year amounted to about $4.3 million, bringing
the cumulative total to $94.4 million. The contract award ratio for 1998
was 52.2 percent. Disbursements for the year amounted to $4.3 million,
with cumulative disbursements standing at $90.7 million. The disbursement ratio for 1998 was 54.8 percent. Executing agency staff attended
a regional project implementation management seminar in Fiji to identify
ways to accelerate project implementation, and were provided training
on Bank procedures related to project matters.

The cyclone damage rehabilitation project loan was closed in April 1998,
leaving only one program loan under implementation. The program implementation progressed smoothly and compliance with all program
conditionalities was generally on track, reflecting the Government’s
commitment to the reform program.

Solomon Islands

Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Real GDP in Solomon Islands declined by 0.5 percent in 1997, and is
estimated to have fallen by 10 percent in 1998. A collapse in Asia’s logRegional Highlights 149

export markets occurred at the same time that the new Government was
cutting spending to restore fiscal balance. Business confidence, and thus
private investment, remained low, but the start of operations of the Gold
Ridge mine was a significant development during the year. Inflation rate
rose to 12.3 percent from 8.1 percent in 1997, largely because of a
20 percent devaluation of the Solomon Islands dollar in December 1997.
The decline in commodity exports substantially weakened the underlying
balance-of-payments position. Even with devaluation, a rise in official
transfers, and an increase in external arrears, external reserves provided
only two months of import cover.

Domestic policies: The Government continued to implement its Policy
and Structural Reform Program in an effort to restore macroeconomic stability, improve the performance of the public sector, and create a policy
environment conducive to private sector development. The settlement of
domestic and external arrears remained a priority, requiring tight control on
government expenditure and revenue enhancement. A public service wage
freeze was imposed, and recruitment stopped. The tariff system was simplified, income taxes were increased, and other revenue-raising measures were Solomon Ielands:

the Government refine its Policy and Structural Reform Program. The program focuses on policy measures in the areas of fiscal stabilization, public
service reform, privatization, and strengthening of governance institutions.

Loans and technical assistance: In 1998, Solomon Islands cleared all
its overdue loan payments to the Bank. Two loans, including one public
sector reform program ($25 million) and one technical assistance loan
for privatization of SOEs ($1 million), were approved in 1998, totaling
$26 million. Technical assistance grants amounting to $900,000 for three
projects were also approved.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1973, Solomon
Islands has received a total of 15 loans, of which two were still active at the
end of 1998. Contract awards for the year amounted to $15.7 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $52.9 million. The contract award ratio for
1998 was 57.7 percent. Disbursements for the year amounted to $15.7 million,

service, and governance reforms. This was the first loan approved for
Solomon Islands since the last loan provided by the Bank in 1993. The
PSRP became effective on 24 November 1998. The first tranche of
$15.7 million, disbursed in November 1998, financed the separation

as a result of extrabudgetary appropriations and an increase in the wage bill.
Greater macroeconomic policy coordination was needed. The Government
expressed interest in developing an economic and public sector reform program.

 

Bank operations

Operational strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy for Tonga continues
Annual, 1994-1998 to focus on (i) strengthening financial and economic management, (ii) creating
an enabling environment for the private sector, and (iii) catalyzing development
in the outer islands. These aims are to be achieved through support for public
sector and public enterprise reform; private sector development, including
basic infrastructure; agricultural diversification; and human development.

Policy dialogue: In terms of economic management, the major effort has
been directed at introducing program budgeting within the Government.
The new budgeting system has been designed and is being installed for
application by all ministries in 1999. In its dialogue with the Government,
the Bank is stressing the need to improve macroeconomic coordination
among central agencies, in particular, as far as monetary and fiscal policies
are concerned. The Bank is also emphasizing the need to rationalize thepublic service to broaden the
country’s tax base and to harmonize the tariff structures.

Loans and technical
assistance: No loans or technical assistance grants were approved in 1998.

Project implementation:
Since becoming a member in
1972, Tonga has received a
total of 14 loans, of which
four were still active at the
end of 1998. Contract awards
for the year amounted to
about $3.3 million, bringing the
cumulative total to $44.9 million. The contract award ratio
for 1998 was 40.9 percent.
Disbursements amounted to
$4.9 million for the year, with
cumulative disbursements
standing at $35.8 million. The
disbursement ratio for 1998 was
46.3 percent. Project implementation suffered from a shortfall of skilled personnel and institutional weaknesses. Executing agency staff attended the
Bank’s regional project implementation seminar, held in Fiji in May 1998.

Implementation progress, except for one transport sector project, was
behind schedule. This was mainly because of initial delays in making the
loans effective and in the procurement process, and weaknesses of the executing
agencies. In the case of the Second Power Project, a long delay in effectiveness has resulted from a lack of coordination among ministries.

Tuvalu
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Real GDP in Tuvalu grew by an estimated 2 percent in 1998. The inflation
rate remained low in line with rates in Australia and Fiji, the major sources
of imports. With merchandise exports financing only 5 percent of imports,
continued reliance was placed on fishing and telecommunications license
fees, remittances from overseas workers, official transfers, and investment
income from overseas assets to cover the trade deficit.

Domestic policies: The Government continued to maintain a conservative fiscal policy stance that involved balancing the recurrent budget, maintaining the real value per capita of the Tuvalu Trust Fund, and
funding development expenditures from foreign aid. Emphasis was again
given to improved governance, and greater and more effective expenditure on health and education. Another focus is greater equality of income

(iv) improvement of the economic conditions of the outer islands. Assisting
the Government in donor coordination is an important task of the Bank.

Policy dialogue: Discussions continued to center on economic management, reform of the public sector, outer islands development, and
donor coordination.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were approved during the
year. One advisory technical assistance grant amounting to $150,000 was
approved for the establishment of a trust fund for island development.

Project implementation: No loans have yet been provided to Tuvalu.

Vanuatu
Economic performance (growth, inflation, and external sector)

Real GDP growth in Vanuatu has slowed from 3.5 percent in 1996 to
1.7 percent in 1997, and to about negative 2 percent in 1998. The slowdown
was the result of declining activity in the manufacturing, electricity, and
construction subsectors, compounded in 1998 by a substantial drop in primary sector production and sluggishness in tourism. The Asian financial
crisis seriously affected traditional exports, both in terms of demand and
commodity prices. On the domestic front, the Vanuatu National Provident
Fund (VNPF) riots in January 1998 and the announcement and subsequent revocation of the devaluation of the vatu (Vt) in March seriously
destabilized the economy. The VNPF issue led to payouts that dramatically increased liquidity in the economy and saw a significant increase
in imports, which resulted in a strain on the country’s foreign reserves.
These developments created instability in the economy that deferred
investment and adversely affected the growth prospects of the country.
Foreign reserves dropped to Vt3 billion in May 1998, its lowest level in
the 1990s, before rising to Vt5 billion in the third quarter of 1998. This
represent five to six months’ import cover. This was only temporary
relief, as it reflected the Government’s receipt of the first drawdown of
the Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) loan which is held in US
dollars with the Reserve Bank. Inflation increased to 3.9 percent in 1998
from 2.8 percent in 1997 because of the impact of a 12.5 percent valueadded tax. Continued multipartisan political support for the CRP is
essential to its successful completion.

Domestic policies: The new administration that took office in late
March 1998 was initially preoccupied with restoring macroeconomic stability
and preparing the delayed 1998 budget in a programming format. A budgetRegional Highlights 153

entirely associated with one-off expenditures arising from VNPF payouts and Vanuatu:

implementation of the CRP adopted in 1997. Under the CRP, a public service Cumulative Bank Lending

restructuring and downsizing program was in progress; the legislative framework (as of 31 December 1998)

for improved governance had been established; budget coverage had been No. of

Operational strategy: Since February 1997, the Bank has (i) actively sup- Multisector 1 3.0 6.1

the need to sustain the momentum of reforms; and (iii) played the lead role
in coordinating donors’ support. The Bank has also been encouraging the
Government to pay greater attention to addressing issues in regard to the
sustainability of the reform process. At a broader level, the Bank and other
funding agencies have been emphasizing that the national-level consultative and participatory approach—which was adopted in the formulation phase of the CRP—should be further strengthened in the
implementation phase. All key stakeholders need to support the reforms
and play an active role in the process of ensuring sustainability. The
Bank and other funding agencies also recognize that in Vanuatu, institutional capacities and technical/professional expertise are limited and
currently constitute a major constraint. Substantial technical assistance
is needed to meet the immediate, short-term, and long-term institutional
strengthening and capacity-building requirements. The latter, in particular, is critical to the success of the whole reform effort. In this context, the
strategic thrust of Bank operations in Vanuatu during 1998, and over the
medium term, is to support actively the implementation of the CRP.

Policy dialogue: The key policy issues to be addressed by the Bank, in
the context of implementing the CRP, cover both economic and public
sector reforms. The emphasis is on supporting the national efforts to strengthen
key institutions to ensure political stability and to improve economic
growth performance through policy and institutional reforms. The overriding objectives are to (i) enhance private sector-led growth by ensuring
policies that are consistent, transparent, and business friendly; (ii) ensure
that output expands at a sustainable rate that is faster than population
growth; (iii) ensure that the costs and benefits of growth are evenly
spread among all sectors of the community and across the country; and
(iv) promote increased participation of the indigenous people of Vanuatu
in economic development. In this connection, one of the key themes of
the Bank’s policy support program would be institutional strengthening and
capacity building in selected agencies.

The Bank’s support will focus on the following five priority areas: (i) address
governance and public sector reform issues, in coordination with other funding
agencies, to help the Government restore stability and confidence, both of
which are fundamental to attaining sustainable, private sector-led growth;
(ii) provide technical assistance for institutional strengthening and capacity154 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

building in critical areas such as financial and economic management, CRP
coordination, and management effectiveness of the public service;
(iii) facilitate national infrastructure and outer islands development to
support economic growth, reduce income disparities, and achieve a more
balanced growth; (iv) promote the further development of Vanuatu’s
financial sector, both through the restructuring and rehabilitation of key
public financial institutions, and the reform of the financial and regulatory
environment; and (v) facilitate donor coordination, through the Consultative
Group process, to consolidate and enhance the complementarity of efforts
of various external funding agencies.

Loans and technical assistance: A program loan amounting to $20 million
to support the Government’s comprehensive reform program was approved
during the year. Two advisory technical assistance grants amounting to
$1.8 million were also approved.

Project implementation: Since becoming a member in 1981, Vanuatu
has received a total of eight loans, of which two were still active at the end
of 1998. Contract awards for the year amounted to about $10.8 million,
bringing the cumulative total to about $28 million. The contract award ratio
for 1998 was 37.6 percent. Disbursements totaled $11.4 million for the year,
with cumulative disbursements standing at $28.7 million. The disbursement
ratio for 1998 was 37.8 percent. Project implementation continued to suffer
from a lack of qualified personnel, institutional weaknesses, and difficulties
in land acquisition. Executing agency staff attended the Bank’s regional
project implementation seminar, held in Fiji in May 1998.Corporate Planning and Support Activities 155

Corporate Planning
and Support Activities

o achieve its strategic and operational objectives, and to
ensure that its projects meet the needs of its developing
member countries (DMCs), the Bank must be both a planning and a learning organization. Both facets of the
organizational structure—corporate planning and the
activities that support that planning—are discussed in this chapter.

Corporate planning

With the extensive and disruptive impact on the region of the Asian financial
crisis, the need for corporate planning and learning—and the ability to readily
translate both vision and lessons learned into operational programs—has been
highlighted. In this light, the Bank’s corporate planning process, which has
proven instrumental in introducing change in the Bank, has become more
flexible and adaptive in the formulation of country assistance plans for the
medium term. The process focuses on crisis alleviation and economic recovery
and on the continuity of long-term development programs.

The corporate planning process begins with the reassertion of the Bank’s
mission as incorporated in its five strategic development objectives: promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, supporting human development,
improving the status of women, and protecting the environment. These
long-term objectives are then carefully considered in the context of each
DMC’s own development priorities and constraints. Country-specific Bank
assistance plans for three-year rolling periods are developed in close consultation with government planning and sectoral ministries, and increasingly
with the participation of beneficiary groups and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) concerned. These country assistance plans (CAPs) establish
how the Bank will support policy reform, capacity building, and regional/
subregional cooperation, and the creation and strengthening of productive capacity, infrastructure, and services in each DMC, in both the public
and private sectors. The CAPs also present the pipeline of loan and technical
assistance projects designed to implement country assistance objectives. Unique
to the Bank’s planning process is a formal project classification system
that links individual projects to the Bank’s strategic development objectives. The individual CAPs are aggregated into an overall medium-term
work plan for the Bank, and the priorities and corporate resource implications of each are discussed informally with the Bank’s Board of Directors.
Finally, each year, the work program and administrative budget for the
coming year are considered formally.156 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Recently, the country focus in the Bank’s work programs has become
greater, taking into account the phase of development of each individual
DMC. The country-focused operational strategies have led to greater selectivity in the sectors, programs, and projects in which the Bank is involved.

The Bank has a deep commitment to the participatory development
process, not only in project and program design, but also in its country
operational strategy and programming work, during which project identification and selection take place. The annual country programming mission
involves extensive consultations with government and NGOs at various
levels in the country and, normally, a project must be included in the CAP
resulting from the mission for it to be considered by the Bank for assistance.
With the objective of mainstreaming stakeholder participation in the Bank’s
business processes, planning began in 1998 for a regional workshop to be held
in early 1999 that will involve participants from DMCs, NGOs, and the
Bank. It is expected that participants will identify systematic participatory
approaches, specifically in the preparation of Bank country operational strategies and programs, and in the design of projects.

Finally, an important planning exercise was initiated in 1998 to prepare a
long-term strategic vision and framework that will set out the development
impact objectives of the Bank through the first decade of the new millennium.

Support activities

While all its departments and offices support the Bank’s priorities and objectives,
some areas of the Bank give particular emphasis to strengthening the Bank’s
capacity to realize its development role.

Economics and Development Resource Center

Guided by the Bank’s underlying strategic objectives, the Economics and
Development Resource Center (EDRC) provides research support to the
Bank’s management and operations, and disseminates knowledge and information on development issues to the Bank’s DMCs and the international
community. Its operational strategy focuses on (i) undertaking research in
development policy issues and disseminating the findings to DMCs;
(ii) extending support to Bank operations by reviewing the quality of project
economic evaluations, country operational strategies, economic reports, and
sector work, and undertaking studies in methodology development for economic analysis of projects and policies; (iii) providing information and advice
to Management and other staff on economic events and development policy
issues; (iv) providing statistical information and assistance to DMCs and
other offices within the Bank; and (v) engaging in institutional strengthening and capacity-building activities for DMCs.

Work relating to the Asian financial crisis featured strongly in EDRC’s
1998 activities. A major in-depth study of financial markets in selected
DMCs was undertaken, which included institutional strengthening and policy
development issues relating to macroeconomic management, and banking
subsector and capital market development. With the objective of discussing
with senior policymakers its key findings and the policy implications forrebuilding the financial sector in the region, EDRC began planning and
preparing for a regional workshop to be held in 1999. Other financial sectorrelated studies undertaken in 1998 included mortgage-backed securities
markets, a review of deposit insurance schemes, social impact of the financial
crisis, and corporate governance and financing.

To discuss emerging issues and exchange views on the financial crisis,
EDRC organized a number of seminars and workshops, including the Asian
Development Forum-East Asia, The Unfinished Agenda; Senior Policy Seminar
on Managing Global Financial Integration in Asia (held in collaboration
with the World Bank); Financial Sector and Liberalization in Asia (jointly
with the International Monetary Fund [IMF], the World Bank, and the
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific); Meetings of
Heads of National Statistics Offices of the Countries in Crisis; and an
inception workshop on the study of the Social Impact of the Financial Crisis.
Also, Bank staff were keynote speakers in many international conferences.

The Bank also undertook regional studies in other areas, including Asian
Exports: Trends and Prospects, and hosted the inception meetings on the study
of Foreign Direct Investment and Technology Transfers in Asian Developing
Countries. The Eleventh Workshop on the Asian Economic Outlook, a preparatory activity for the Bank’s publication Asian Development Outlook 1999, was
held in November 1998. Other conferences held during the year included the
Joint ADB-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
International Forum on Asian Perspectives and the Joint ADB-World Trade
Organization Seminar on Asia and the Challenge of Globalization.

The Bank undertook several measures in the area of improving economic evaluation to ensure project quality prior to loan approval. For example,
guidelines for the economic analysis of water supply projects and a handbook
for economic analysis of subregional projects were completed; and similar
work on build-own-operate-transfer projects was substantively completed.
Further initiatives in 1998 included preparation of a handbook for the
economic analysis of health sector projects, good practice examples in economic analysis, a study on the estimation of economic benefits of program
loans, and a study on severe policy distortions and lack of competitive
markets in the transitional economies of Central Asia.

In the area of its statistical services, the statistical database system and
its Internet linkages were strengthened. The Bank also implemented technical assistance projects for statistical capacity building in its DMCs. Work
on environment statistics neared completion. As part of the Bank’s editing
services, and with a view to achieving consistency in the presentation of
Bank reports, the Handbook of Style and Usage was revised and published.

As part of its development resource center activities, the Bank produced
and distributed numerous publications: Asian Development Outlook 1998, Key
Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries 1998, and ADB Research
Bulletin. The 1998 Monograph Series included, among other titles, “Challenges
for Asia’s Trade and Environment” and “Adjustment and Distribution, The
Indian Experience.” Other notable publications included Social Sector Issues
in Transitional Economies of Asia and The Future of Asia in the World Economy
(Proceedings of the Joint ADB-OECD Conference-Third International Forum
on Asian Perspectives). Work on the manuscript “Fiscal Transition in
Kazakhstan” was substantially completed. In addition, EDRC initiated a new

Corporate Planning and Support Activities 157158 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

serial Briefing Notes on current economic issues; six Briefing Notes covering
the major areas of financial crisis were produced and distributed.

Other development resource center activities included the conduct of
conferences and workshops for government officials and policymakers. EDRC
initiated collaborative activities such as a tax conference and a seminar on
international finance with the ADB Institute, which was established by the
Bank in 1997. As part of its capacity-building activities for DMCs, EDRC
implemented training workshops on economic analysis of projects. A training
course on macroeconomic and structural policies for government officials
from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan was also conducted,
jointly with the IMF Institute.

The Bank also supported the Colombo Plan Secretariat, the East Asian
Economic Association, and the American Committee on Asian Economic
Studies in their research and capacity-building activities for DMCs, and
served as a resource center on Asian economic issues for many external
organizations from the public and private sectors.

Information systems and technology

In 1998, the Bank completed the Information Systems and Technology
Strategy (ISTS), which sets the general directions for its information systems
and technology infrastructure from 1998 to 2002. Following approval of the
strategy and the related capital expenditure in October 1998, steps were
initiated for implementing the strategy.

The Bank also completed the modifications to its computer programs
which were required for year 2000 (Y2K) compliance and successfully carried
out integrated simulation tests (see box). Vendors of software and hardware
were also required to certify Y2K compliance of their goods and services.

Systems affected by the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 were
enhanced to ensure compliance with euro requirements.

The Bank carried out modifications and enhancements on various mainframe and client/server systems during the year, including the loan financial
information system, technical assistance information system, project administration system, and resident/regional missions accounting system. The project
processing information system was redeveloped on a client/server platform
to provide expanded functionality, including the automatic publication
of project profiles and ADB Business Opportunities on the Bank’s web site.
The consultant data systems—data on consulting firms (DACON) and
data on individual consultants (DICON)—were also converted from the
mainframe to a client/server system with an Internet interface. The new
investment portfolio accounting and management system software package
was implemented at the start of 1998.

Various document management systems were enhanced and implemented.
An environment network directory was established and a similar directory
for social development expertise was also developed.

A new enterprise server with a new disk array subsystem and a new Y2K
compliant operating system replaced the old mainframe system and now runs
the Bank’s legacy applications. The network facilities in some resident missions
were upgraded; the other missions’ network infrastructure will be upgraded
in 1999 as part of the ISTS. The Bank’s web site was rehosted in the USto provide faster access to Internet users from Europe and the US. In
addition, the bandwidth capacity for the Bank’s Internet facility was expanded
to 512 kilobits per second to provide faster access and response times.

Year 2000 Compliance Activities

he Bank was dealing with the year
2000 computer problem (also known
as the “millennium bug” or “Y2K”) and the
potential impact in its DMCs and in its
internal information systems well before
1998; but this past year, work was intensified.
The Y2K problem arises because some
computer equipment rely on microprocessors (so-called “embedded chips”) that may

not handle the transition to the year 2000
correctly (i.e., they are not Y2K compliant).
The problem exists in computer hardware,
operating systems, networks, and software.
The risk is significant in that about 70 percent of computer applications make use of
dates and must be assumed likely to fail
unless made Y2K compliant. In addition,
most modern equipment (e.g., medical,
power generation, telecommunications) use
embedded chips, of which a small, but
significant proportion, is likely to fail.
Failure may be dramatic (e.g., complete failure of systems to operate at the
end of 1999) or may be progressive (e.g.,

 

corruption of data over a period of time
until it is detected). Either has the potential
to lead to significant disruption, especially
if a series of such problems occurs in
parallel. The failure of noncompliant systems may result in administrative chaos,
financial losses, danger to public safety,
adverse public reaction, or other as yet
unidentified consequences. At a macroeconomic level, the consequent
oor performance and organizational failure may impact upon the
national financial position.
Resolving Y2K problems is
not difficult technically. The probem is primarily a managerial and
resources issue relating to having to address multiple systems
in parallel. This is compounded
y the very limited time before
year 2000. In addition, the comuter industry has a poor track
record of delivering systems and
upgrades on schedule.

There is a significant risk of
socially dysfunctional behavior
relating to Y2K, e.g., hoarding,
especially of cash. This risk is likely
to be greater in wealthier countries, where there has been more
media exposure, but may still be a significant risk in the Bank’s larger developing
member countries (DMCs). Consideration
needs to be given to printing extra notes
and to developing steps to avoid hoarding.

The estimated costs for rectifying the
Y2K problem globally range anywhere from
$600 billion to $1.5 tillion.' The US
Government's current estimate of its own
requirement is $6.9 billion.

 

The Year 2000 Problem in DMCs

The pervasiveness of computers in DMCs—
even very small countries—is greater than

Corporate Planning and Support Activities

159

generally realized. They are used, for
example, in power generation and telecommunications; often for paying government
salaries, budgeting, and accounting; and
by large businesses such as financial
institutions or extractive industries.
Although the scale of disruption in some
countries may be less than others, those
with a limited resource base are likely to
experience more disruptive failures.
Investing resources in Y2K compliance will
divert DMC resources from other highpriority areas, but failing to address the
problem may have even greater costs.

It is generally expected that the losses
resulting from the Y2K problem may be
about 1-2 percent of GDP. This amounts
to a minimum of $90 billion for the Asian
DMCs altogether. Hence, the Y2K problem must be addressed at a national level.
The Asian financial crisis has, in many
DMCs, diverted attention from addressing
the Y2K problem. In fact, Y2K problems
may delay economic recovery from the crisis.

The Bank has a particular concern
where its funds have been used to acquire
equipment that uses embedded chips.
Although more recently acquired systems
and equipment are likely to be Y2K
compliant, this cannot be safely assumed.
In 1998, for example, computers and
software which were not Y2K compliant
were being sold. The benefits of the Bank’s
lending could potentially be negated by
failures in acquired systems and equipment
that are not Y2K compliant.

With regard to assisting its DMCs, the
Bank first conducted a survey beginning in
March 1998 to assess the level of awareness

(continued on page 160)

1 Report prepared by the Cutter Consortium
for the International Finance Corporation,
May 1998.160

 

(Year 2000 Compliance, continued)

of the governments about Y2K compliance
and the measures already taken to monitor
and coordinate remedial actions in the public
and private sectors. The survey looked for
measures such as the establishment of national coordinating mechanisms, identification of Y2K focal points or institutions,
and conduct of public awareness campaigns.

A Task Force—established to coordinate ADB’s response to the Y2K
problem—determined that priority should
be given first to Bank-financed projects,
particularly to assessing the extent of risk
exposure of each project to Y2K, and the
preparedness of the project authorities to
resolving the problem or minimizing the risk.
In addition, the Bank is assessing and monitoring the readiness of individual DMCs,
and taking steps to raise awareness among
them about Y2K and available solutions.
Because of the short time remaining to
implement solutions, the Bank is also stressing the need to develop contingency plans
in the event that critical systems fail to
work properly in the year 2000.

To date, only a small number of DMCs
have requested a modest level of assistance
to address the Y2K problem, which is being
provided, typically, through reallocation of
resources under existing projects.

ADB is also collaborating closely with
the World Bank’s InfoDev (Information
for Development) program regarding
assistance to DMCs on Y2K. InfoDev has

 

ANNUAL REPORT 1998

launched national and regional Y2K awareness seminars globally, including in several
Asian DMCs. The World Bank is also providing grants and loans to DMCs for Y2K
remedial measures.

Links to a number of web sites providing useful information on the nature of
Y2K and the status of the national action
programs of various DMCs may be found
on ADB’s web site at http://vww.adb.org.

Internal Systems

In early 1996, the Bank inventoried all
systems, programs, databases, and facilities
that would require a Y2K compliance review.
Based on the inventory, it was concluded
that the Y2K resolution activities would be
sufficiently manageable and be completed
by end-1998, provided the activities were
undertaken as a priority task under the
Bank’s annual work program.

In early 1997, the Bank assigned a
team of programmers to apply and test
Y2K program fixes in all its internal application systems. The repaired programs were
tested in the current environment at the
systems level and immediately turned over
to production. A formal monitoring system
was put in place to ascertain that all
programs had been reviewed and that no
slippage would occur. This remediation
effort was completed in July 1998.

During the third quarter of 1998, the
Bank conducted integrated simulation tests
of high-volume, date-sensitive processes of

taken steps to ensure
that its internal
systems are Y2K
compliant and is
helping its DMCs to
do likewise.

critical systems to ascertain that the Y2K
program fixes, tested at the systems level in
1997-1998, would continue to function
properly in 2000 in an integrated application environment. The tests involved
simulations of processes such as account
closing, loan billing, payroll, and the execution of banking transactions for key dates
between November 1999 and March 2000.
Processing as of 29 February 2000 was also
tested to address the issue of a leap year.

A contingency plan will be prepared
in 1999, in coordination with users of the
respective systems, to prepare for any unexpected problems associated with the
Bank’s internal systems that might arise
during the millennium changeover period.

In addition to evaluating its internal
systems, the Bank evaluated the Y2K
compliance of the application software
packages and information and data
services of its vendors. It was confirmed
that all application packages used in the
Bank are Y2K compliant or will be compliant by the first half of 1999. Tests of
the most critical processes supported by
packages were carried out.

In parallel with the remediation effort
for application software, a review of all
equipment and systems software (including operating systems and database
management systems) was conducted in
1997 and 1998, and many pieces of equipment and systems software were replaced
or upgraded. With the exception of some
network components, which will be
replaced in 1999 as part of a planned overall network upgrade, all equipment and
systems software currently in use have been
certified as Y2K compliant by the suppliers.

Bank Management is attentive to
the progress of Y2K problem resolution
activities. In early 1998, the Bank’s internal audit function conducted an audit
of the overall action plan for Y2K problem
resolution, including the procedures and
approaches taken for problem resolution
activities, and reported its findings to
Management. Since then, the internal
audit function has been monitoring Y2K
activities on a continuing basis.Resident and regional missions and representative offices

Through its resident and regional missions and representative offices, the
Bank achieves strengthened representation in its donor and developing member
countries, and broader and more direct access to its constituencies.

Resident missions: The Bank has 10 resident missions, one each in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. The Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan resident
missions began operations in 1998. The Sri Lanka Resident Mission, which
commenced operations in Colombo in October 1997, was opened officially
by the Bank’s President in 1998.

The resident missions were established to (i) improve the Bank’s coordination with the governments and funding agencies; (ii) assist with activities related to country programming and processing of new loan and technical
assistance projects; and (iii) help ensure project quality by directly administering the implementation of select projects. Mission staff initiate and
maintain dialogue with the governments on policy and other issues; and
strengthen the work relationship between the Bank and government authorities
in processing and implementing technical assistance and loan projects and
programs, in coordination with representatives of bilateral and multilateral
funding agencies. Because of their important role in improving implementation performance, the resident missions are being delegated more responsibility and accountability for portfolio management.

The resident missions develop their individual work programs to the
country’s particular needs. For example, in 1998, the Bangladesh Resident
Mission assisted the Bank in its strategic objectives by arranging an incountry poverty consultation workshop, and was extensively involved in the
flood damage assessment in preparation for the Flood Damage Rehabilitation
Project approved by the Board in December 1998. The financial crisis and
related political and social changes in Indonesia led to an increased need
for the Bank to interact and coordinate with stakeholders with respect to
Bank projects; the Indonesia Resident Mission assisted in this process. The
Pakistan Resident Mission took a successful lead role in the spring-cleaning
exercise and the campaign to accelerate disbursements, and interacted with
government agencies and the Bank to ensure that Pakistan’s loan service
payments resumed toward the end of the year.

With regard to their external relations activities, in 1998, the India
Resident Mission published and distributed a quarterly newsletter, and the
Viet Nam Resident Mission launched its web site, which focuses on the Bank’s
program in Viet Nam. Two missions (India and Nepal) updated or developed
new publicity brochures as part of the Bank’s Partners in Development series.

Regional mission: The South Pacific Regional Mission (SPRM) in Port
Vila, Vanuatu is the Bank’s liaison to the eight member nations in the South
Pacific: Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu,
and Vanuatu. SPRM assists in the administration of loan and technical
assistance projects in the South Pacific; provides economic and other inputs for
the Bank’s policy, project, and institutional development work; disseminates
information about ADB activities; and promotes private sector development.

Representative offices: The Bank’s representative offices in Europe
(Frankfurt), Japan (Tokyo), and North America (Washington, DC) strengthen
its representation in donor members and assist in its resource mobilization
efforts by promoting cofinancing with official and commercial sources. Through
the representative offices, the Bank is able to interact regularly with key
decision makers to inform them about the Bank’s activities. The representative offices also help raise the profile of the Bank with key interest groups and
with the public at large. They enable the Bank to communicate better and
in a more timely manner with the development community, businesses, academics, and NGOs. Other important functions are information dissemination
and public relations. In this regard, the Japanese Representative Office assisted
in the translation of a number of Bank publications into the Japanese language.

Archives

The Bank’s Archives was established to preserve and make available records
of permanent value on the history of the Bank. The Archives maintains a
repository that conforms to international standards on archival storage.
A microfilm program is incorporated within the Records Center operations.
The Bank uses off-site storage for vital records.

The Archives currently holds approximately 14,000 textual records;
33,000 photographs, slides, and negatives; and 600 audiovisual items. Holdings include records on the establishment, organization, structure, policies,
programs, and projects of the Bank. The photographs held in the Archives
provide visual documentation of the various projects and activities of the
Bank. The Archives maintains a database of its collection called the Bank
Archives Information System. The Bank’s Archives is listed in the Guide to
the Archives of International Organizations, a publication of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

In 1998, staff carried out an active program to acquire historical Bank
documents to be added to the existing collection.

Library

The Library, with a collection of approximately 200,000 volumes, is the
Bank’s knowledge resource center for information in print and electronic
formats. It provides research assistance in all disciplines related to the Bank’s
strategic objectives, programs, and projects. The collection specializes in
development economics, key economic sectors, and the countries of the Asian
and Pacific region. Sectoral emphasis includes agriculture, energy, finance,
environment, law, transport and communications, and social infrastructure.
A full range of library services supports the Bank’s staff in headquarters and
in the DMCs. In addition, educational institutions and individual researchers
from around the world make regular use of the Library’s collections and services
via Internet, telephone or fax inquiries, or in-person visits. The Library received
close to 3,000 inquiries from more than 2,500 external visitors in 1998. This
number is lower than last year’s high of 2,800 visitors because the Library was
closed to external visitors for several months because of inventory taking.
The Library sponsors an active donation program, extending the shelf
life of materials no longer needed by the Bank. For example, in 1998, nineinstitutions in the Philippines received more than 3,000 titles from the
Library to assist them in building their collections.

The Library continued to broaden its outreach activities with an
exhibit in March 1998 on gender and development to create awareness
and assist in mainstreaming the consideration of gender into Bank operations
and programs. Three other exhibits held in previous years focused on
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation, and environmental issues facing Asia’s megacities. The
Library also updated its bibliography, “Publications On and About the
Asian Development Bank, 1987-1997.”

The Library’s long-term strategy as the Bank’s knowledge resource center
is to increase the amount and the quality of information available at the
desktops of Bank staff. In keeping with this strategy, the Library enhanced
its electronic and Internet-based services to augment the coverage and
sources available, increased and streamlined desktop access for Bank staff,
and developed a home page for the Bank’s internal use.

Public Information Center

One of the Bank’s operational strategies is to increase awareness and
understanding of its activities, strategies, and objectives among the public
and policymakers in its DMCs and donor member countries. In addition, its
Information Policy and Strategy, and Policy on Confidentiality and Disclosure
of Information—both approved by the Board in 1994—provide for the greatest possible degree of transparency and disclosure in all areas of the Bank’s
operations, with few exceptions. To this end, the Bank established the Public
Information Center (PIC) in 1996 to make available to the public—either
free of charge or for purchase, depending on the publication—ADB publications, information brochures, videos, and documents.

In 1998, the PIC catered to about 4,200 visitors who sought its services
either in person or through mail, phone, or electronic requests. This represents
an increase of 20 percent over the 1997 numbers. An estimated 6,700 books,
180 videos, and 40 CD-ROMs (computer disk-read only memory) were sold
in 1998. More than 2,500 documents were dispatched in response to requests
for reports covered by the Bank’s Policy on Confidentiality and Disclosure
of Information; about 1,025 of these documents were distributed free of
charge, the bulk going to NGOs.

The PIC is the dispatch point for the Bank’s Depository Library Program,
a worldwide network of about 130 libraries, offering the public free access
to Bank documents and publications. Each member library received 285 publications and documents in 1998.

In addition, the PIC is the dispatch point for the Bank’s subscription
publications, ADB Business Opportunities and Asian Development Review (ADR).
During the year, nearly 400 companies and individuals maintained subscriptions to ADR and about 2,100 maintained subscriptions to Business
Opportunities. The decrease in Business Opportunities subscriptions from
2,500 in 1997 is attributed to its availability on the Bank’s Internet web site
at http://www.adb.org, a decision that the Bank made in 1995 to ensure
that this publication would reach an even wider audience.

Corporate Planning and Support Activities 163164 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

Asian Development Bank Institute

The ADB Institute was established in December 1997. Nineteen ninetyeight marked the start-up year during which research and capacity-building
activities were initiated. The major activities in 1998 are summarized below.

During its first full year of operation, the Institute’s core program achievement has been the preparation of the initial Strategic Directions paper, which
identified the main areas of the research and capacity-building agenda: (i) Asian
development paradigms, (ii) reform and strengthening of financial systems,
(iii) education and social development, and (iv) strategic perspectives for development management. These directions were discussed by the Bank’s Board of
Directors and at the inaugural meeting of the Institute’s Advisory Council.!

A high-level roundtable series on the Asian financial crisis was held in
Manila, San Francisco, Singapore, and Tokyo. Preliminary results were
published in the Institute’s first book disseminated at a public symposium
held during the Bank’s 31 Annual Meeting in Geneva. An executive summary series was also initiated for these and other conference proceedings in
print and on-line (http://www.adbi.org).

Start-up capacity-building and training activities were conducted mainly
in collaboration with the Bank or OECD. Joint Institute-Bank capacitybuilding and training seminars were held in the fields of municipal management,
taxation policy, and international finance. Together with OECD, the Institute
organized an international symposium on securities market regulatory systems. Seminars on lessons learned and policy responses to the financial crisis
were also held, based on materials developed by the Institute’s research
roundtable workshops. These capacity-building activities reached around
165 participants from 27 countries with about 770 person-days of training.

Planning workshops in the areas of education, social development, public
policy, and institutional reforms were also held throughout the year. An
innovative book entitled The Learning of Nations is now on-line as an experiment in the effective use of media and information technology. The on-line
site features an e-mail feedback mechanism that encourages comments and
documentation of experiences from interested readers and stakeholders.

The seven members of the Advisory Council were selected from leading
scholars and senior policymakers of Bank member countries, and their guidance has been relied upon in refining the work programs. The international
and local staff have now been recruited and have commenced work in Tokyo.

The professional staff (16 established posts, of which 13 have been filled)
have also been augmented by one visiting scholar, seven contractual researchers,
two research associates, and three program consultants. Major research initiatives
were partnered worldwide with leading academic and other institutes, including
the Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, the Institute of South East Asian
Studies, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

In accordance with its statutory oversight responsibilities, the Board of
Directors reviewed and approved the Institute’s 1998 work program and budget.

 

1 The Institute’s Advisory Council consists of seven members: two from the Bank’s DMCs
(the People’s Republic of China and Sri Lanka), two nonregional donor countries (Italy and
the United States), two regional donor countries (Australia and Japan), and a representative
of the Bank (Chief Economist) (see also Appendix 5).Administration 165

Human resource management and development

t the end of 1998, the Bank had a total staff of 1,966 coming

from 44 of its 57 members. The total comprised 673 profes
sional staff! and 1,293 supporting staff, of which 150 staff”

were located in representative offices and resident and regional

missions. During the year, there were 75 appointments and
61 departures of professional staff, while 51 supporting staff joined the Bank,
and 60 left. At the end of 1998, the number of women professional staff was
129, or 19 percent of total professional staff.

In January 1998, the Bank’s Training and Development Division was merged
into the Human Resources Division to enhance coordination of human resource activities. The integration of training and development within an
enlarged Human Resources Division also improved the service quality of training.

Human resource management activities in 1998 concentrated on the
formulation of responsive human resource policies and strategies, including
the nine-point Gender Action Plan to reduce gender disparities at all levels
in the Bank. In support of the Bank’s redefined role as a broad-based
development institution, attention has focused on managing the Bank’s
desired skills mix through deploying administrative positions to operations,
recruiting new skills such as financial economists and capital market specialists, terminating weak performers, reviewing anticipated competencies, and
introducing collaborators from other areas of the Bank in a more rigorous
recruitment exercise. A major focus in 1998 was the initiation of the procurement process for an integrated human resource management information system (HRMIS). Implementation of the new system package—which
is expected to expand the human resource management services available
to Management and staff—will begin in 1999 and be completed in 2001.

A Bankwide training needs assessment was conducted to determine the
training and development priority directions of the Bank. Based on the assessment, several new training activities were conceptualized and implemented in
1998. These activities included technical training (such as macroeconomics,
governance, and capacity building), and managerial and supervisory training.

Emphasis was given to training for senior management staff, managers,
and mission leaders to enhance and upgrade their scenario planning, leadership, and managerial skills. A set of training curricula for executive assistants
was developed and established. These include specific development steps and
training programs. This exercise is also being undertaken for other job streams.

1 Includes the President, Vice-Presidents, and staff on secondment and special leave without
pay, but excludes Directors’ Advisors.

2 Includes 37 professional staff, 47 national officers (locally recruited professional staff), and
66 supporting staff.166 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

   

Staff coming from 44 of ADB's 57 members
work together to improve the welfare of the
people in the region.

In its capacity-building activities, and involving the cooperation of many
departments and offices, the Bank again conducted the Orientation Program
for Developing Member Country Officials to help participants better understand Bank operations. The Bank’s internship program was resumed after a
hiatus of two years. The program, offered to master and doctoral students from
accredited universities, provides interns with an opportunity to learn about
all facets of the Bank’s operations during a two-month internship.

Compensation and benefits

The Bank approved a 4.3 percent salary structure increase for professional
staff effective 1 May 1998, and a 15.9 percent salary structure increase for
supporting staff effective 1 April 1998, in response to changes in market
salaries. In line with the revision of the performance management system, the
system for distributing the pay increase budget was refined. A preliminary
review of staff benefits was undertaken, and rationalization measures were
adopted for some items, which reduced benefit costs. A more extensive review
is planned for 1999. A pilot test commenced in January 1998 to evaluate a
flexible work hours scheme for staff. As a result, flexible work hours have been
adopted by the Bank. Staff now have the option of a number of work periods,
with some staff starting work at 7:00 a.m. and others finishing at 6:00 p.m.

Administrative services

In line with the Bank’s efforts to streamline business processes, simplify work
procedures, and automate enhancements, measures were undertaken to rationalize the Bank’s administrative services and enhance their cost-effectiveness.

In the area of administrative services, such measures included the computerization of various work processes. For example, use of electronic file
exchanges between user-departments and the Printing Unit expanded the
production capability of the Unit. A records management study to develop
guidelines for electronic document management was undertaken; and a
computerized index system, which enhances access to the Bank’s official and
historical records, was developed.

During the year, a redesigned methodology for taking inventory of the
Bank’s equipment was implemented. This resulted in reducing the commitment of staff resources for the physical inventory, strengthening the equipment accounting system, and improving the quality of the equipment inventory
database. Recommendations from a study on the vital records protection
program were implemented to ensure protection of the Bank’s vital records.
In addition, procurement exercises to replace the Bank’s telephone system,
and acquire and install integrated software and related hardware were begun.

Budget

Actual internal administrative expenses (IAE) for 1998 amounted to $193.8 million, a saving of $11 million against the original budget of $204.8 million. Thesaving was mainly due to the impact of the depreciation of the Philippine
currency; additionally, greater emphasis was given to both selectivity and
flexibility in the allocation of internal resources during a year when additional resources were required for new policy initiatives and various efforts
associated with the Asian financial crisis. The Bank will maintain a tight
budgetary approach.

The IAE budget for 1999 of $207 million (summarized in Appendix 8)
has been formulated with continued focus on economy and efficiency, while
enabling the Bank to support the needs of its developing member countries
(DMCs) and provide a broad range of development services. In response to
the broader role of the Bank, the budget for 1999 provides for 15 new
professional staff positions—the first such staff increase since 1994—yet
reflects the lowest nominal budget growth in the Bank’s history. In achieving
this low-growth scenario, the Bank will intensify its focus on business process
reforms and efficiency measures, and will continue its efforts on rationalizing
work activities, redeploying staff positions, and improving the staff skills mix.

Financial and human resource management
information systems

The Bank is introducing changes in its financial, administrative, and operational areas through the use of an information system that will eventually
replace most of the Bank’s existing computer applications systems. The
initiative will take from five to six years to complete. As a preparatory step,
the Bank’s accounting and accounting-related business processes and systems were analyzed, and opportunities for improving, streamlining, simplifying, and automating the current processes were identified. As a result, an
overall business process framework and concept were formulated, including
systems infrastructure, to support a fully integrated system.

In the first phase, it has been proposed that the core financial management (including general ledger, budgeting, and procurement), treasury/banking,
human resources, and project/program management systems be replaced. In
this connection, a procurement process for the acquisition and implementation of the systems, together with the establishment of the necessary
hardware platform, was initiated through international competitive bidding.
Eligible bidders have been shortlisted, and bidders’ proposed solutions are
being evaluated. The new systems are expected to streamline, automate, and
integrate the business processes in these respective areas, making them more
efficient by reducing staff time and expense.

Internal audit

The Office of the General Auditor (OGA) conducts periodic, independent,
and objective appraisals of Bank activities to ascertain the adequacy and
effectiveness of controls, and to identify the means of improving economy
and efficiency in the use of resources in carrying out the Bank’s development
mission. OGA reports directly to the President. Its activities are reviewed
by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Administration 167168 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

In 1998, OGA participated in the Task Force for formulating and implementing the Bank’s Anticorruption Policy. As assigned under the policy,
OGA made preparations and took on the new role of serving as the point
of contact within the Bank for receiving and processing allegations of corruption, fraud, and abuse in headquarters as well as in all Bank-funded
projects. In this regard, OGA initiated steps to collaborate with supreme audit
institutions to achieve the common objectives of promoting good governance
and undertaking anticorruption efforts in the Bank’s member countries.

Also in 1998, OGA assumed responsibility for the Bank’s regional technical assistance to strengthen auditing capabilities in its DMCs. It provided
assistance in audit capacity building to individual DMCs on a selective
basis. It also conducted training on the Bank’s project accounting, reporting,
and auditing requirements at a regional seminar on project implementation
and administration held at headquarters.

To further its interaction with other multilateral development organizations and to comply with the requirements for the professional practice of
internal auditing of the Institute of Internal Auditors, OGA undertook an
exchange of peer reviews with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in 1998 and, as a result, made procedural changes to enhance
the quality of its work.

OGA provided an audit perspective to a number of Bankwide efforts,
including (i) acquisition of the new financial resources management system
and HRMIS; (ii) conversion of all Bank computer hardware and software
to ensure the ability to process correctly dates from 1 January 2000 onward;
and (iii) modification of Bank software, business procedures, and external
depository bank and counterparty arrangements to enable trading in the euro
beginning on the first workday of 1999. Activities in 1998 included design
reviews of new computerized systems to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency, as well as the presence of adequate controls to protect data integrity
and reduce the risk of loss.

Internal audits conducted during 1998 led to recommendations for
(i) enhancing the security of the Bank’s internal network and Internet connection; (ii) reducing the cost of information technology (IT)-related services at headquarters; (iii) reducing the extent to which IT-related problems
might delay the accomplishment of the Bank’s work; and (iv) increasing
efficiency and effectiveness by accelerating the disposal of Bank records,
reducing the Bank’s use of paper-based documents, and expediting decision
making within the Project Administration Units as well as facilitating followups on the submission of progress reports and audited financial statements.

By focusing the approach and streamlining the processes related to audits
of consultants’ contracts conducted in 1998, OGA was able to achieve significant cost saving to the Bank, both in terms of lower audit fees and through
the recovery of overclaims. These audits also resulted in more effective control
procedures for selecting consultants for Bank-financed technical assistance projects.

Expert consultants assisted OGA in conducting in-depth reviews of the
financial instruments in the Bank’s investment portfolio, investment performance, and, as part of the Bankwide Study on Internal Controls, internal
controls over the procurement of goods and services under loan projects.

OGA also provided integrated assistance to its external auditors,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (International Firm).Bank Resources and
Financial Management

he Bank's financial resources consist of its ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and special funds. Both are examined in this
chapter. As the steward of these resources, the Bank is guided
by a number of financial policies, which have been formulated
on the basis of sound and prudent management practices.

Ordinary capital resources

Funding for OCR comes from three distinct sources: (i) private capital
markets in the form of borrowings; (ii) paid-in capital provided by government funds; and (iii) accumulated retained income, i.e., reserves, which
provides the buffer for any operational risk.

Financial policies: The following are the five financial management
and policy concerns that underpin the management of OCR: (i) capital
resource management policies, which aim for the efficient use of capital and
provide an adequate capital base for lending and borrowing; (ii) borrowing
policies and strategies, which aim for efficient mobilization of loanable
resources from capital markets at the lowest possible cost, longest possible
maturity, and most stable cost; (iii) net income management policies, which
ensure that the Bank has the capacity to withstand large event risks from
its loan portfolio and to contain interest rate risks in its operations; (iv) liquidity
policy, which maintains investor confidence by ensuring that the Bank will
have the capacity to meet its cash requirements even in the event of a major
disruption of its expected cash inflows; and (v) loan products and credit risk
policies, which provide borrowers a wider choice of loan products to suit
their exchange rate and interest rate risk management needs.

Capitalization: As of 31 December 1998, the Bank's authorized capital
stock amounted to $49.2 billion (SDR34.9 billion). The subscribed capital
stock stood at $48.5 billion (SDR34.4 billion). During the year, Tajikistan's
membership subscription became effective.

Performance and allocation of net income

At the end of 1998, the Bank’s decisive income indicators, the interest
Coverage ratio (ICR) and the reserve:loan ratio (RLR), stood at 1.39 percent
and 27.7 percent, respectively, The ICR, which measures the Bank’s capacity to meet interest obligations on its debts from income, is the ratio of net170

ees ar severe a

ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

 

 

 

 

 

income to financial expenses plus a factor of one. The RLR is the ratio of
total reserves to the sum of outstanding loans, equity investments, and the
present value of guarantees. The RLR is a capital adequacy ratio that measures
the Bank's capacity to generate net income. Both ratios, however, measure
the Bank's risk-bearing capacity.

The Bank's income and reserves policy, approved by the Board of Directors
in 1997, was reflected in the annual review of the Bank's income outlook
and allocation of 1997 net income. On the basis of the review, the Board
of Directors approved the following:

(i) the Bank undertake conversion of currencies in reserves in 1998 in
the amount of about $300 million as part of its long-term strategy
to align currencies in reserve with those of outstanding loans;

(ii) the lending spread used in determining the Bank's pool-based
variable lending rate be maintained at 40 basis points;

a Board of Directors recommendation to the Board of Governors
that an amount of $367.5 million of 1997 net income, after
appropriation of guarantee fees to the Special Reserve, be allocated to the ordinary reserve, and the balance of net income amounting
to $100 million be retained in the surplus account; and

a Board of Directors recommendation to the Board of Governors
that the amount of $80 million currently held in the Bank's surplus
account be reallocated to the Bank's Technical Assistance Special
Fund (TASF).

The allocation of net income was approved by the Board of Governors
in May 1998 with the adoption of Resolution No. 256.

Income and expenses: Gross income
increased by 26 percent, from $1.4 billion in

($ million) 1997 to $1.8 billion in 1998, because of an
increase in loan, investment, and other income.
Actual Of the total gross income, $1.4 billion was gen1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 erated by the loan portfolio, $382.9 million by

Total operating expenses were $1.4 billion,

up by $383.8 million or 39.1 percent from the

previous year. The rise in expenses was becauseof a $353.3 million increase in financial expenses, a $26 million increase in
administrative expenses, and a $4.5 million increase in the provision for
losses. Total operating expenses accounted for 74.5 percent of gross income,
compared with 67.7 percent in 1997,

Net income for 1998, before appropriation of guarantee fees to the Special
Reserve, amounted to $466.9 million, a 0.2 percent decrease from the previous
year. This compared with an 18.2 percent decrease in net income in 1997,

Lending rates: The Bank has three lending windows: the pool-based
multicurrency lending window, the pool-based single-currency loan window
in United States (US) dollars, and the market-based loan (MBL) window.
These lending windows were established in 1986, 1992, and 1994, respectively. The lending rates for the pool-based multicurrency and pool-based
single-currency loan windows are determined on the basis of the average cost
of borrowings plus a Board-approved loan spread (currently 40 basis points).
The MBL window provides single-currency loans in US dollars, Japanese yen,
or Swiss franes to private sector borrowers and government-guaranteed financial
intermediaries at current terms. The interest rates on loans from the MBL
window are on either fixed-rate or floating-rate terms.

The Bank's pool-based variable lending rates for the first half of 1998 were
6.01 percent for multicurrency loans and 6.93 percent for US dollar loans.
During the second half of 1998, the lending rate on multicurrency loans rose
slightly to 6.02 percent, while that on US dollar loans declined to 6.76 percent.

The lending rates for MBLs are determined on the basis of the sixmonth London interbank offered rate plus a lending spread. A lending
spread of 0.4 percent currently applies for MBLs to financial intermediaries in the public sector; while for private enterprises, the lending spread
is determined on a case-to-case basis to cover the Bank's risk exposure
to the particular borrowers and projects.

Loans

Loan disbursements and repayments: OCR loan disbursements in 1998
totaled $5.6 billion, an increase of 6 percent from 1997. Principal repayments
for the year were $968.5 million, of which $48.5 million represented prepayment on loans. On 31 December 1998, cumulative loans outstanding after
allowance for possible losses amounted to $24.7 billion.

Status of loans: There were 39 OCR loans approved in 1998, of which
77.8 percent was made to three countries; Indonesia, People's Republic of
China, and Philippines.

Two public sector loans to Myanmar and seven private sector loans were
in nonaccrual status at the end of 1998, The total outstanding balances of
these loans amounted to $900,000 and $51.6 million, respectively, comprising about 0.2 percent of the total OCR loans outstanding.

Borrowings

The major objectives of the Bank's borrowing and liability management strategy
are to ensure the availability of long-term funds for lending operations, fund

the liquidity portfolio, and minimize the cost of borrowing for the Bank and
its borrowing members, To achieve these objectives, the Bank seeks to

(i) maintain a borrowing presence in the major capital markets and,
where possible, increase the size of its public bond issues to provide
“benchmark issues” that increase liquidity in the secondary markets,
broaden the distribution of its bonds, and favorably align its funding
and trading spreads with those of other supranational borrowers;

(ii) emphasize borrowings in the longer-maturity range (to the extent
that the related borrowing costs remain attractive) to minimize
fluctuations in its lending rates and to ensure a reasonable maturity relationship between borrowings and loans;

(iii) expand its investor base by borrowing in the private placement
markets of various currencies;

(iv) tap new markets, especially where these will help develop capital
markets in the Asian and Pacific region;

(v) use swap markets where cost-efficient arbitrage can significantly
lower the cost of target currencies and transform structured financing
into conventional fixed-rate liabilities; and

(vi) use short-term bridge financing should temporary deficiencies arise in
currencies required for disbursements or debt service, and if market
conditions are not attractive for bond issues with longer maturities,

In 1998, the Bank raised a record level of funds totaling about $9.6 bil
lion, of which $7.8 billion were liabilities with maturities longer than one year
and the remainder were curo-commercial paper liabilities. The average life
of the 1998 long-term borrowings was about 10.8 years, compared with 12.7 years
in 1997, After swaps, about $4.4 billion of the total long-term funds were in
US dollar fixed-rate liabilities with an average all-in cost of §.29 percent per
annum, compared with 6.58 percent per annum in 1997. The remainder
consisted of US dollar floating-rate liabilities aggregating about $2.7 billion,
and a Japanese yen fixed-rate liability in the principal amount of about
$741 million equivalent. The 1998 borrowings were used as follows: about
$5.7 billion for the US dollar pool-based lending window, $3.2 billion for
disbursements under a $4 billion financial sector program loan to the Republic
of Korea, and $741 million for the multicurrency pool-based lending window.

Despite the difficult market conditions in 1998, the Bank successfully

completed a number of key benchmark transactions during the year: a fiveyear $2 billion global bond issue, an Australian dollar (A$) domestic public
bond issue in the principal amount of A$1 billion with a five-year maturity,
and a Hong Kong dollar (HK$)3 billion multitranche public bond offering
in the domestic bond market of Hong Kong, China. The Australian dollar
offering represents the Bank's first transaction in the domestic bond market
of Australia, while the HK$3 billion transaction was the largest ever fixedrate bond issue in the Hong Kong dollar debt market. The remaining 1998
borrowings were undertaken through targeted opportunistic financing and
private placements in a variety of currency debt markets, including those in
Japanese yen, pounds sterling, Swiss francs, and US dollars.

Liquid asset investments: As of 3] December 1998, the Bank's liquid
assets, consisting of investment holdings (net of Special Reserve investments)
and unrestricted cash, totaled $7.9 billion, or approximately 55.4 percent ofBorrowings, 1998

Financial planning framework; In August 1998, the Bank approved
recommendations concerning the mobilization and allocation of resources
made available as a result of annual loan savings and cancellations in
ADF-financed projects.

Loan terms: In December 1998, the Bank approved amended terms for
new ADF loans. Project loans, i-e., loans other than quick-disbursing program loans, would have a maturity of 32 years including an 8-year grace
period, with an interest charge of | percent per annum during the grace
period and 1.5 percent per annum during the amortization period, and equal
amortization. Quick-disbursing program loans would have a maturity of
24 years including an 8-year grace period, with an interest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum duringthe amortization period, and equal amortization. In addition, the service
charge was redesignated as an interest charge that would include a portion
to cover administrative expenses and a portion that would not. The amended
loan terms and the redesignation of the service charge will take effect from
1 January 1999 and apply only to new loans,

ADF VII: On completion of their negotiations in Tokyo in January
1997, donors recommended $6.3 billion as the level of ADF operations for
the four-year period 1997-2000.

By the end of 1998, ADF VII Instruments of Contribution had been
received from 25 members, including an additional contribution of $10 million from Indonesia, for a total amount of $2.7 billion (at the exchange rates
specified in Resolution No. 247 of the Board of Governors, which sets out
the terms and conditions of the replenishment), This compares with the level
of contributions of $2,609,837,120 (SDR1,781,045,436) pledged by donors at
the conclusion of the ADF VII negotiations in January 1997. Twenty two of
these members, ie., Australia; Austria; Belgium; Denmark; Finland; France;
Germany; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Italy; Japan; Republic of Korea;
Malaysia; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland;
Thailand; Turkey; and United Kingdom, deposited unqualified Instruments
of Contribution. Canada; Taipei,China; and United States deposited Instruments
of Contribution containing a qualification, as permitted by the Resolution,
that all installment payments, except the first, would be subject to budgetary
appropriations. For details of amounts released for operational commitments in
1998, see column labeled “Addition” in Table 42 in the Statistical Annex.

The Resolution envisaged that the contributions would become available to the Bank for operational commitments in four equal tranches over
the four years covered by the replenishment.

ADF VI: The fifth ADF replenishment (ADF VI) was intended to
cover the four years 1992-1995, At the end of the period, a few contribution payments were still outstanding. In addition, as a consequence
of the outstanding payments, some donors had not released the balance
of their contributions to the Bank for operational commitments, as
permitted by Resolution No. 214 authorizing the replenishment. At the
end of 1998, $339 million had not been released for operational commitments ($441 million at the end of 1997).

ADF loan approvals, disbursements, and repayments: In 1998, 27 ADF
loans totaling $987.1 million were approved, compared with 49 ADF loans

Myanmar amounted to $30.6 million and $466.6 million, respectively, representing about 3.5 percent of the total ADF loans outstanding.

Portfolio position: The ADF investment portfolio at end-1998 amounted
to $1.4 billion, compared with nearly $1 billion at end-1997. Of the portfolio,
about 92 percent was invested in deposits and other bank instruments in
member countries. The remaining amount was held in securities issued or
guaranteed by governments of member countries. The return on ADF
investments in 1998 was 4.6 percent, compared with 3.9 percent in 1997.

The portfolio was denominated in 18 currencies. Japanese yen and US
dollars formed 36.4 percent of the portfolio.

ADF revenue and expenses: In 1998, the excess of ADF revenue over
expenses (net income) was $109.7 million, bringing the accumulated surplus
to $1.2 billion at the end of the year.

Gross revenue, consisting mainly of revenue from ADF investments and
service fees on ADF loans, amounted to $182 million. Expenses consisted
mainly of administrative charges allocated from OCR of $71.5 million and

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Review of activities: In May 1998, the Board of Governors approved the
reallocation of $80 million from the Bank’s surplus account to TASF.
During the year, Pakistan made the only direct voluntary contribution
{its twenty-second) to TASF, amounting to $66,000 equivalent. This was
made on a wholly untied basis.

At the end of 1998, rotal TASF resources amounted to $721.7 million. Of the toral TASF resources, $624.5 million had been committed,
leaving an uncommitted balance of $97.2 million. For details, see Table
43 in the Statistical Annex.

Operations and resource position: The TASF contributed 27.1 percent of funding for technical assistance, with 121 technical assistance projects
effective during the year. Revenue from investments increased from $5.8 million
in 1997 to $5.9 million, due mainly to an increase in the size of the investment portfolio resulting from an allocation of $80 million from the Bank's
surplus account, while technical assistance committed decreased from $58.2 million in 1997 to $36 million. During 1998, $15.6 million ($5.5 million in
1997), representing completed and canceled technical assistance projects,
was written back as a reduction in technical assistance for the period and
the corresponding undisbursed commitment was eliminated. As a result, the
uncommitted balances available for future commitments increased from
$54 million in 1997 to $97.2 million in 1998,

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at $183.1 million, up
18.6 percent from 1997, Other assets—comprising dues from banks, advances
to consultants, and others—totaled $15.2 million. Accounts payable to OCR
and others amounted to $82,000,Japan Special Fund

Review of activities: In 1998, the Government of Japan provided a total
amount of yen (¥)7.9 billion for its tenth yearly contribution to the JSF. The
amount included ¥5.9 billion in regular contributions and ¥2 billion in
supplementary contributions. This brought Japan's cumulative contributions
to JSF, since its inception on 10 March 1988, to ¥80.7 billion (equivalent
co about $696.4 million at historical exchange rates). For details, see Table 44
in the Statistical Annex. The cumulative total included regular contributions
of ¥66.5 billion and supplementary contributions of ¥14.2 billion.

Of the total contributions received, $537.7 million had been used as of
31 December 1998, mainly for technical assistance, including organizing
symposia/training, and activities supporting gender and development,
environment, and promoting the private sector. As of 31 December 1998, a
number of technical assistance projects and programs had been approved by
the Bank and the Government of Japan, which had nor yet become effective.

Government of Japan and the Bank, and further technical assistance totaling
$29 million had been approved by the Government of Japan and was being
processed by the Bank. During 1998, $9.2 million ($3.3 million in 1997),
representing completed and canceled technical assistance projects, was written
back asa reduction in technical assistance for the period and the corresponding
undisbursed commitment was eliminated. The uncommitted balances available
for new commitments were $63.4 million at end-1998 ($70.6 million in 1997).

Sectoral activities: In 1998, JSF financed 84 percent of the total project
preparatory technical assistance approved by the Bank. The breakdown of
JSF approvals by sector is shown in the table.

from the ADB Institute Special Fund, which is administered by the Bank
in accordance with the Statute of the ADB Institute. Japan made its
second contribution in the amount of ¥2 billion (equivalent to $16.3 million) in March 1998,

As of 31 December 1998, the cumulative commitments, since receipt
of the first monies on 24 March 1997 from Japan, amounted to
¥3.5 billion (equivalent to about $28.1 million) excluding translation
adjustments. Of the total contributions received, $15.1 million had been
used as of 31 December 1998, mainly for start-up operations, administrative
expenses, and research and capacity-building activities, including organizing
symposia, training, and preparing research reports and publications, Certain
ongoing program activities will be carried over to 1999, with the attainment
of total staff and visiting scholar strength for a full-year work program.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of income and
expenses, of cash flows, and of changes in capital and reserves present fairly, in all material
respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Bank’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, ona test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of loans and of borrowings
as at 31 December 1998 and 1997, and of statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting
power as of 31 December 1998 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not
required parts of the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and in our opinion,
is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole.

RESOURCES

 

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS,
GUARANTEES, AND EQUITY
INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank, a multilateral development
finance institution, was established in 1966 with its headquarters in Manila, Philippines. The Bank and its operations are governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian
Development Bank (the Charter). Its principal objective is
to help accelerate economic and social development of its
developing member countries (DMCs) in the Asian and
Pacific region by providing financial and technical assistance
(TA) for projects and programs which will contribute to
sustainable economic development and social advancement.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is an
integral part of the Bank’s operational activities. In addition, the Bank, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of
donors, including members, their agencies and other development institutions, funds restricted for specific uses which
include technical assistance for borrowers as well as for
regional programs.

The Bank’s ordinary operations comprise loans, equity
investments, and guarantees. It finances its ordinary operations through borrowings, paid-in capital, and retained
earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees, and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the
total amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and
guarantees made by the Bank shall not exceed the total of
the Bank’s unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and
surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At! December

1998 the total of such loans, equity investments, and guarantees aggregated approximately 71.7% (67.9% 997) of.

the total subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired actually paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus,
exclusive of the special reserve. A31 December 1998
such equity investments represented approximately 3.7%
(4.2% —1997) of the paid-in capital, reserves, and surplus,
as defined.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Bank is defined in
Article 4, paragraph | of the Charter “in terms of United
States dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on
31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar) and the value of each
share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital stock
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank’s unit of account) on the basis of its
par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978,
the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966
dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
Bank’s selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes of
these financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing
Right (SDR) at the value in current United States dollars
as computed by the IMF, with each share valued at
SDR10,000.

As of 31 December 1998the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.40803 ($1.34925 —OCR-8

193

Financial Statements

CONTINUED

 

1997) giving a value for each share of the Bank’s capital
equivalent to $14,080.30 ($13,492.501997). However,
the Bank could decide to fix the value of each share at
$12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the
United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments other than those relating to maintenance of SDR capital valueseé Notes I
and J), are charged or credited to “ Accumulated translation
adjustments” and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES”
as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Investments

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by Management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from netincome and reported in “CAPITAL AND

RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value generally represents
market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded
in the market (time deposits, etc.). Realized gains and
losses are included in income from investments and are
measured by the difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

The Bank’s loans are made to or guaranteed by members,
with the exception of loans to the private sector, and have
maturities ranging between 5 and 30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to

fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has
disbursed. It is the policy of the Bank to place in nonaccrual
status loans for which principal, interest, or other charges
are overdue by six months. When loans are in nonaccrual
status, the related unpaid interest and other charges are
reversed and are deducted from loan interest income and
other charges, as appropriate. Interest and other charges on
nonaccruing loans are included in income only to the extent that payments have actually been received by the
Bank. The Bank follows a policy of not taking part in debt
rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans.
In the case of private sector loans, the Bank may agree to
debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action
have been exhausted.

The Bank determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in
arrears for one year for public sector loans made to or
guaranteed by a member (unless there is clear and convineing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of
such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.
If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than the
carrying value of the loan, a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to provision for possible
losses.

The Bank’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowance for possible losses is based on its past loan loss
experience, known and inherent risks in existing loans, and
adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to

repay.
Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are reported at cost less an allowance for
possible losses. Provisions for possible loss of value are
established quarterly based on Management’s evaluation of
potential losses for such investments. Equity securities with
readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income194

and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.” The Bank
applies the equity method of accounting to one investment
where it has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment is stated at cost and,
except for land, is depreciated over estimated useful lives
on a straight-line basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor
betterments are charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Bank
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF
CURRENCIES AND DEMAND
OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i) of the Charter, the use by the Bank or by any recipient from the Bank

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

To reduce credit risk, the Bank is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in (a) securities which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily government or
government-guaranteed obligations, multilateral banks and
selected commercial banks; and (b) exchange-traded derivatives of such securities. Exposure to interest rate risk
may be adjusted within defined bands to reflect changing
market circumstances. These adjustments are made through
the purchase and sale of both securities and exchangetraded financial futures and options. The use of options has
been minimal and there were no outstanding options as of
31 December 199&nil — 1997). To increase returns, the

Bank may invest in securities denominated in currencies
other than the original functional currencies and then
enter into covered forward foreign exchange agreements in

order to maintain its original mix of functional currency
holdings. Accordingly, the financial futures, options, and
covered forwards are held for risk management rather than
trading purposes.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of securities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a
specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirements are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are settled daily. Changes in
the market value of open futures contracts are recognized
as gains or losses in the period of the change and included
in income from investments. A31 December 1998there
were no outstanding purchase contracts ($9,664,00D997)

nor outstanding sales contracts ($9,477,0001997).

Covered forwards: Covered forwards are agreements in
which cash in one currency is converted into a different
currency and simultaneously a forward exchange agreement is executed providing for a future exchange of the two
currencies in order to recover the currency converted. The
Bank records the covered forward as an investment in the
underlying currency. A receivable is created for the forward contract of the originating currency and a payable for
the underlying instrument to be converted into the originating currency at maturity. Premiums or discounts are
deferred and amortized as income from investments over
the life of the underlying instrument. No covered forward
agreements were outstanding atl December 199Q{nil —
1997).

Short sales: Short sales are sales of securities not held in
the Bank’s portfolio at the time of the sale. The Bank must
purchase the security at a later date and bears the risk that
the market value of the security will move adversely between the time of the sale and the time the security must
be delivered. The payable created upon entering into a
short sale is stated at the market value of the security
subject to the short sale and gains and losses resulting from
changes in market value are included in income from investments in the period of the change. Short sales are used196

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was based
on a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which
loans carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986,
the Bank adopted a multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In addition, in July 1992, the Bank introduced a pool-based variable United States dollar lending
system, and in November 1994, a market-based variable
lending system was made available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and to the private sector. For
loans to the private sector, approximately 71% (68% —
1997) of the loans were based on a variable interest rate.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
borrowing member countries as ofl December 1998are
shown in OCR-5.

Public Sector Loans

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members with interest rates which vary based on the pool-based variable lending rate system were fair valued using an entry value method.
Under this method, fair value was determined based on the
terms at which a similar loan would currently be made by
the Bank to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair value
approximated the carrying amount. For undisbursed balances of effective loans and for loans not yet effective, the
contractual amount approximated fair value.

Loans outstanding to or guaranteed by members with fixed
interest rates (principally loans made prior to | July 1986)
were fair valued using a discounted cash flow method. This
method takes into account the scheduled cash flows over
the average life, by currency, of the loans, and current
funding costs for the average life, including a factor for
administrative costs.

The estimated fair value of loans to or guaranteed by members was not affected by credit risks based on the Bank’s
experience with its borrowers.OCR-8

Two public sector loans to Myanmar were in nonaccrual
status but were not impaired as of 31 December 1998 (nil

date was $935,000 (nil — 1997). Overdue interest and
other charges on these loans totalled $70,000 (nil — 1997).
Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in a reduction of $68,000
(nil — 1997) in income from public sector loans for the year
ended 31 December 1998.

Private Sector Loans

Loans outstanding to the private sector were fair valued

Loan Guarantees and Cofinancings

The Bank extends guarantees for the benefit of its members
which are not reflected in the financial statements. Such
guarantees include partial credit guarantees where only
certain principal and/or interest payments are covered.
Such guaranteed payments are generally due 10 or more
years from the loan inception date. The present value of
the contingent future payment obligations of all outstanding guarantees at 31 December 1998 and 1997 is used to
calculate the Bank’s lending limitation. None of these
amounts were subject to call as of that date. The Bank198

The Bank functions as lead lender in cofinancing arrangements with other participating financial institutions who
also provide funds to the Bank’s public and private sector
borrowers. In such capacity, the Bank provides loan administration services, which include loan disbursement and
loan servicing. The participating financial institutions have

($36,277,000 1997) investment in the Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC) which is accounted
for on the equity method. The holding represents 30.3% of
the investee’s issued ordinary share capital and net assets.
The Bank also holds 100% of AFIC issued convertible
noncumulative preference shares in the amount of
$25,000,000 (nil — 1997). In addition, the Bank, together
with other financiers, has agreed to provide AFIC a revolving credit facility up to a maximum aggregate principal
amount outstanding at any time of $105,000,000 (nil —
1997). The Bank’s obligations amount to $40,000,000, of
which, at 31 December 1998, the outstanding loan is
$9,524,000 (nil — 1997). This amount has been included in
“Loans Outstanding” Note E).

Unrealized gains on equity investments reported at market

NOTE G—PROPERTY, FURNITURE,
AND EQUIPMENT

In 1991, under the terms of an agreement with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (Government), the
Bank returned the former headquarters premises which
had been provided by the Government. In accordance with
the agreement as supplemented by a memorandum of understanding, the Bank was compensated $22,657,000 for
the return of these premises. The compensation is in lieu of
being provided premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and amortized over the estimated life of
the new headquarters building as a reduction of occupancy
expense. At31 December 1998 accumulated depreciation
for property, furniture, and equipment was $61,396,000
($53,112,000 1997). The amortization for the years ended
31 December 199&nd 1997 amounted to $566,000 reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building
from $4,700,000 ($4,778,000 +997) to $4,134,000
($4,212,000 -1997). At 31 December 1998 the unamortized deferred compensation balance (included in
“ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES —
Miscellaneous”) was $18,174,000 ($18,740,000 997).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

The Bank uses derivative financial instruments in connection with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding
sources across public and private debt markets, currencies
and instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a
currency borrowed under advantageous terms into one of
the Bank’s major operational currencies, taking advantage
of the opportunities offered in different financial markets.
Such currency swaps enable the Bank to raise operationally
needed currencies in a cost-efficient way and to maintain
its borrowing presence in the major capital markets. Interest rate swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet
interest rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

The Bank issues structured debt which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing. However, the Bank enters into200

simultaneous currency and/or interest rate swaps to fully
hedge against the effects of such embedded derivatives.

The Bank has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligationssge Note O). In order to
reduce such credit risk, the Bank only enters into longterm swap transactions with counterparties eligible under
the Bank’s swap guidelines which includes a requirement
that the counterparties have a credit rating of double A or
higher. The Bank does not anticipate that any of its
counterparties will fail to perform their obligations under
such agreements.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by the Bank, one party agrees to make
periodic payments based on a notional principal amount
and an interest rate that is fixed at the outset of the
agreement. The counterparty agrees to make floating rate
payments based on the same notional principal amount.
Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of the swap
are accrued over the period to which the payment relates
and the related cost or income is included in interest and
other financial expenses. The terms of the Bank’s interest
rate swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments in one
currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic
payments in another currency. The payments may be fixed
at the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest
rates. A receivable is created for periodic payments to be
received, and a payable is created for payments to be made.
Swap premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized
into interest and other financial expenses over the life of
the underlying instruments. The terms of the Bank’s currency swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular borrowings.

The fair value of borrowings outstanding is estimated using
prevailing market prices where available, or estimated replacement values where market prices are not available.

Outstanding currency and interest rate swap agreements
are fair valued at the estimated amount that the Bank
would receive or pay to terminate the agreements based
upon market quotes from dealers.

Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of the Bank as of the end of
1998 and 1997 consists of 3,490,994 shares, of which
3,441,406 shares (3,439,799 — 1997) have been subscribed
by members. Of the subscribed shares, 3,198,931 (3,197,866
— 1997) are “callable” and 242,475 (241,933 — 1997) are
“paid-in.” The “callable” share capital is subject to call by
the Bank only as and when required to meet the Bank’s
obligations incurred on borrowings of funds for inclusion in
its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees chargeable
to such resources. The “paid-in” share capital has been
paid or is payable in installments, partly in convertible
currencies and partly in the currency of the subscribing
member which may be convertible. In accordance with
Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Charter, the Bank accepts
nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing demand obligations in
satisfaction of the portion payable in the currency of the
member, provided such currency is not required by the
Bank for the conduct of its operations. The settlement of
such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to fair value these receivables.

As of 31 December 1998all matured installments amounting to $3,169,579,000 ($2,957,176,0001997) were received except for $5,964,000 from five countries ($4,550,000
— 1997). Installments not due aggregating $244,542,000
($307,105,000 +1997) are receivable as follows:

Payments in respect of capital subscription installments in
advance of due dates are shown in the balance sheet (under
the caption “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER
LIABILITIES”) as “Advance payments on subscriptions”

pending the determination of the full value of such payments based on the rate of exchange to be used by the Bank
as of the date on which such payments are actually due.

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph I(i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of
the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter
as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the Special Funds
of the Bank. The resources so set aside amounting to
$67,036,000 as 081 December 199&$64,237,000 1997)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.40803
($1.34925 —1997) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of
$1.20635 per 1966 dollarsee Note B), were allocated and
transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMF Articles, the Bank implemented
maintenance of value in respect of holdings of member
currencies in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors. The “Amounts required
to maintain value of currency holdings” under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS?” represent the aggregate amounts
receivable resulting from changes in exchange rates of
member currencies from those previously used for the purpose of computing maintenance of value of the Bank’s
holdings of certain member currencies. The settlement of
such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is
not practicable to fair value these receivables.202

Since | April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the Bank’s
capital stock and the basis of determining possible maintenance of value obligations are still under consideration,
notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as
receivable from or payable to members in order to maintain
the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR. The
timing of any establishment and settlement of such amounts
is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not practicable to fair
value such receivables and payables. The notional amounts
as of 31 December 1998consisting of receivables of
$718,693,000 ($627,349,000 +997) and payables of
$247,931,000 ($177,294,000 1997) consist of (a) the
increase of $423,006,000 ($307,089,000997) in amounts
required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the
extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to the
increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the United
States dollar during the period from 1 April 1978 to
31 December 199&nd (b) the net decrease of $47,756,000
($142,966,000 1997) in the value of such currency holdings in relation to the United States dollar during the same
period.

Membership

As of 31 December 1998, the Bank is owned by 57 member
countries, 41 countries from the region and 16 countries
from outside the region see OCR-7). During 1998, the
Board of Governors approved the membership applications
of Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. As atl December 1998
Tajikistan has subscribed to 10,134 shares of the Bank’s
capital stock and remitted the required paid-in portion of
its subscription.

NOTE J—RESERVES
Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the
Board of Governors shall determine annually what part of
the net income shall be allocated, after making provision
for reserves, to surplus and what part, if any, shall be
distributed to the members. Durin99& $367,458,000

($315,000,000 1997) of the net income after appropriation of guarantee fees to Special Reserve for the year ended
31 December 199%was allocated to the Ordinary Reserve,
and $100,000,000 ($256,645,0001997) was allocated to
Surplus.

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar fee Note B) resulted in a net charge of
$23,784,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended
31 December 199&(credit of $29,752,000 1997). That
charge is the increase in the value of the matured and paid
capital subscriptions caused by the change during the year
in the value of the SDR in relation to the United States
dollar not allocated to members as notional maintenance
value adjustments in accordance with resolutions of the
Board of Directors.

°

Special Reserve

 

The Special Reserve represents commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article
17 of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist of term
deposits and government and government-guaranteed obligations and are included under the heading “INVESTMENTS.” For the year endeail December 1998guarantee
fees amounting to $2,639,000 ($416,000 1997) were
appropriated to Special Reserve. The commission charged
on loans was discontinued in 1986.

Surplus

During1998 the Board of Governors allocated $100,000,000
($256,645,000 1997) out of 1997 net income after appropriation of guarantee fees to Special Reserve to Surplus of
which $80,000,000 was subsequently reallocated and transferred to Technical Assistance Special Fund ($230,000,000
to Asian Development Fund 4997). Surplus represents
funds for future use to be determined by the Board of
Governors.OCR-8

Standards Board. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its
components (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) ina full
set of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income has two major components: net income and
other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include such items as unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. The 1997 financial statements have been
reclassified for comparative purposes.

NOTE M—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL
BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Bank has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan). Every employee, as defined under
the Plan, shall, as a condition of service, become a participant from the first day of service, provided that at such a
date, the employee has not reached the normal retirement
age of 60. The Plan applies also to members of the Board of
Directors who elect to join the Plan. Retirement benefits
are based on length of service and highest average remuneration during two years of eligible service. The Plan
assets are segregated and are not included in the accompanying balance sheet. The costs of administering the Plan
are absorbed by the Bank, except for fees paid to the
investment managers and related charges, including custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
remuneration to the Plan and may also make voluntary
contributions. The Bank’s contribution is determined at a
rate sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

In 1993, the Bank adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees
medical insurance premiums. Under the plan, the Bank is
obligated to pay 80% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan
premiums for retirees, including retired members of the
Board of Directors, and their eligible dependents who elected
to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.

Additional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine fair
values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

NOTE O—OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

The Bank is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments. These financial instruments involve elements of
credit risk in excess of amounts reflected on the balance
sheet. Credit risk represents the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors
and counterparties under the terms of the contract.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of revenue and
expenses, of cash flows, and of changes in unexpended balances and capital present fairly, in
all material respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian
Development Bank — Asian Development Fund at 31 December 1998 and 1997, and the
results of its operations, its cash flows and the changes in its unexpended balances and capital
for the years then ended, in conformity, with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank’s management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statement taken as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of loans as at 31 December
1998 and 1997 and of resources as at 31 December 1998 are presented for purposes of
additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial statements. Such information
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial
statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (the Fund) was established
on 28 June 1974 to carry out more effectively the special
operations of the Bank by providing resources on
concessional terms which are made available almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries.

The resources of the Fund have been subsequently augmented by six replenishments, the most recent of which
became effective in September 1997 in a total amount
equivalent to US$2,657,777,000 to cover the operational
requirements for the four-year period from January 1997.
In 1997, unallocated net income in the amount of
$230,000,000 held in the surplus account of the Bank’s
Ordinary Capital Resources was allocated to the Fund to
supplement donors’ contributions.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing member countries are functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United
States dollar, and the financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside resources see Note G) are recorded as

notional amounts receivable from or payable to Ordinary
Capital Resources. Other translation adjustments are charged

CONTINUED

or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and
reported in “UNEXPENDED BALANCES AND CAPITAL” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
among functional currencies are included in revenue.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Bank are considered
by Management to be available for sale and are reported at
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and reported in “UNEXPENDED
BALANCES AND CAPITAL” as part of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used
to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.). Realized gains and losses are included in revenue from
investments and are measured by the difference between
average cost or amortized cost and the net proceeds of
sales.

Loans

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing
member countries, bear only a service charge and require
repayment over periods ranging from 35 to 40 years. The
Fund requires borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. It is the policy of the Fund to place in nonaccrual
status loans made to eligible developing member countries
if the principal or service charges with respect to any such
loans are overdue by six months. When loans are in
nonaccrual status, the related unpaid service charges are
reversed and are deducted from revenue. Service charges
on nonaccruing loans are included in revenue only to the
extent that payments have actually been received by the
Fund. The Bank follows a policy of not taking part in debt
rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans.
In case of private sector loans, the Bank may agree to debt
rescheduling only after alternative courses of action have
been exhausted.ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

The Bank determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or service charges
are in arrears for one year for public sector loans made to
or guaranteed by a member country (unless there is clear
and convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of such provisioning) and six months for private
sector loans. If the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate is less
than the carrying value of the loan, a valuation allowance
is established with a corresponding charge to provision for
possible losses.

The Bank’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for possible losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans and adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay.

Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date
Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Fund

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized
gains and losses, was 4.56% (3.93% — 1997). If unrealized
gains and losses were included, the annualized rate of return would have been 4.67% (3.94% — 1997).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS
PROVISION

Loans

Loans are fair valued using an entry value method. Under
this method, fair value is determined based on the terms at
which a similar loan would currently be made by the Bank
to a similar borrower. Such terms generally include a service charge of 1% and a final maturity of about 40 years.

219

Financial Statements

CONTINUED

For such loans, fair value approximates the carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of loans is not affected by credit
risks because the amount of any such adjustment is not
considered to have a material effect based on the Bank’s
experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans by
countries as of 31 December 1998 are shown in ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans in
nonaccrual status as of 31 December 1998 was $492,379,000
($61,341,000 — 1997) of which $22,253,000 ($8,620,000 —
1997) was overdue. Overdue charges on these loans to
talled $6,960,000 ($2,460,000 — 1997). Loans in nonaccrual
status resulted in a reduction of $5,740,000 ($736,000 —
1997) in revenue from loans for the year ended 31 December
1998. The loans in nonaccrual status as of 31 December

1998 were four loans made to Afghanistan and twenty
seven loans to Myanmar. (Four loans to Afghanistan and

twelve loans to Solomon Islands were in nonaccrual status

as of 31 December 1997).

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 1998
were $13,885,000 ($13,518,000 — 1997), net of accumulated provision for possible loan losses as of 31 December
1998 of $2,324,000 ($1,634,000 — 1997), and there were
no undisbursed loan commitments (nil — 1997).

Loan Loss Provision

The Bank makes provision for possible losses on loans to
the private sector based on an evaluation by the Bank of
the collectibility of loans outstanding.

The Bank makes provision for possible losses on loans made
to the public sector when principal or service charges are in
arrears for a year or more unless there is clear and convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration of
such provisioning. The amount of any loss provision is
determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to
the present value of expected cash inflows discounted at
the loan’s effective interest rate.ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

During the 1998 financial year, no loan loss provisions
($3,943,000 — 1997) were made against public sector loans
while $822,000 (write back of $144,000 — 1997) has been
provided against private sector loans.

Information appertaining to loans which are subject to loan
loss provisions as at 31 December 1998 and 1997 were as

Total $

6,267,000 $ 5,577,000

NOTE E—NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing
and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable
Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by the Bank at
par upon demand.

The Bank currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 1998 will be encashed in varying amounts
over the nine-year period ending 31 December 2007.

Notes of contributors are fair valued using an entry value
method whereby fair value is determined based on the
terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, the fair value of outstanding
notes of contributors approximates their carrying amount.

NOTE F—ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
from Ordinary Capital Resources amounting to $71,475,000
($96,452,000 — 1997). The charge represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses of the Bank (other
than those appertaining directly to ordinary operations and
special operations) based on the number of loans and equity
investments approved during the year.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has
authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paidin” capital paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973,
to be used as a part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The
capital so set aside was allocated and transferred from the
Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside
Resources.ADF-7

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph | of the Charter, “in terms of United States
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January
1966” (the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources
had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank’s unit of account), on the basis of
its par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March
1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per
1966 dollar. Since | April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending the
Bank’s selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the Set-Aside Resources have been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial statements in terms of
the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current
United States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of
31 December 1998, the value of the SDR in terms of the
current United States dollar was $1.40803 ($1.34925 —
1997). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to

221

Financial Statements

components (revenues, expenses, gains, and losses) ina full
set of general-purpose financial statements. Comprehensive income has two major components: net income and
other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include such items as unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments. The 1997 financial statements have been
reclassified for comparative purposes.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

$67,036,000 ($64,237,000 — 1997). If the capital stock of If available, quoted market values are used to determine

the Bank as of 31 December 1998 had been valued in terms
of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources would have
been $57,434,000.

NOTE H—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
AND ACCUMULATED OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

In 1998, the Bank adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 130 — Reporting
Comprehensive Income issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. SFAS No. 130 establishes standards
for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its

fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction, or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund’s balance sheet carrying amounts are considered
to approximate fair values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E for discussions with
respect to investments, loans, and notes of contributors,
respectively.222 ANNUAL REPORT 1998

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of financial position and the related statements
of activities and changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank —
Technical Assistance Special Fund at 31 December 1998 and 1997, and the results of its
activities and changes in net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Bank’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit

to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts

and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall

financial statements presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the

opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The accompanying statement of resources as at 31 December
1998 and summary statement of technical assistance approved and effective for the year ended
31 December 1998 are presented as additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied
in the audits of the basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material
respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK — TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

 

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to the
Bank’s developing member countries and for regional technical assistance. TASF resources consist of direct voluntary
contributions by members, allocations from the net income
of Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) and Asian
Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from
investments and other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted net assets.

TASF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial
statements from the date contribution agreements become

effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted
by them to technical assistance (TA) projects/programs
with specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those without any stipulations as to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted
contributions.

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes
effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in TA for the
period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is
eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars. As a matter of
convenience, the United States dollar is the functional and
reporting currency and is used to measure exchange gains
and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the year are recognized at applicable exchange rates as of
the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense
amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semimonthly period generally at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average
rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments
are accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are charged
or credited to operations.TASF-6

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as

of 31 December 1998 and 1997 expressed in United States
dollars were as follows:

Currency 1998 1997
Australian dollar $ 5,299,000 $ 5,231,000
Canadian dollar 85,137,000 89,047,000
Deutsche mark 6,103,000 5,821,000
Italian lira 5,032,000 4,490,000
Netherlands guilder 2,542,000 2,286,000
Swiss franc 72,884,000 40,040,000
Others 6,080,000 7,506,000

Total $183,077,000 $154,421,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held
during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month was 4.10% (3.18% — 1997).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.

Financial Statements

 

CONTINUED

Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—FUNDING

Since 1967, contributions have been made by 31 member
countries. In February 1992, the Board of Governors, in
authorizing a $4,200,000,000 replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $140,000,000 to be used for technical assistance to poorer developing members and for regional technical assistance. This replenishment became
effective in August 1992.

An aggregate amount equivalent to $161,000,000 has been
allocated to TASF ($81,000,000 and $80,000,000 from the
1994 and 1997 net income of the OCR, respectively, in
1995 and 1998).

Some of the contributions received were restricted to use
upon procurement sources, while some were given on
condition that the TA be made on reimbursable basis.

The total contributions received for the years ended
31 December 1998 and 1997 were as follows:

1998 1997
Unrestricted contributions — $80,066,000 $1,126,000
Temporarily restricted
contributions = 192,000
Total

$80,066,000 $1,318,000

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA
projects/programs which are not yet disbursed as of the end
of the year. During 1998, an amount of $15,557,000
($5,481,000 — 1997) representing completed and cancelled

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK — TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

 

TA projects has been written back as a reduction in TA of
the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value of undisbursed
commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed because the Bank expects that grants will be made for all
projects/programs covered by the commitments. When TA
provided as a project preparatory grant leads to a Bank
loan, the amount of the grant exceeding $250,000 will be
refinanced under the terms of that Bank loan. Refinanced
amounts of $714,000 ($656,000 — 1997) were charged to
such loans and credited to revenue from other sources of
the TASF during the year ended 31 December 1998.

NOTE F—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund’s statement of financial position carrying amounts
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B and E for discussions
with respect to investments and undisbursed commitments,
respectively.Financial Statements 231

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of financial position and the related statements
of activities and changes in net assets, and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank —
Japan Special Fund at 31 December 1998 and 1997, and the results of its activities and changes
in net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and the
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statements
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March
1988 when Japan and the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an initial contribution and the Bank became the administrator. The
purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries
(DMCs) of the Bank restructure their economies and
broaden the scope of opportunities for new investments,
thereby assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs of the
Bank. While the JSF resources are used mainly to finance
technical assistance (TA) operations, these resources may
also be used for equity investment operations in the Bank’s
DMCs. Under the agreement between the Bank and the
Government of Japan, the Bank may invest the proceeds of
JSF pending disbursement. The revenue from such investments, if retained by the Bank, may only be used to pay for
direct and identifiable costs incurred in the administration
of JSF.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the JSF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When the
donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or
purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted
net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net
Assets as net assets released from restrictions.

Investments
All investment securities held by JSF are reported at esti
mated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally

CONTINUED

represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used to
approximate fair value for certain short-term investments
not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements from the date indicated by the government of Japan
that funds are expected to be made available. Contributions which are restricted by the donor for specific TA
projects/programs are classified as temporarily restricted
contributions. Those without any stipulation as to specific
use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions and
reported as such.

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes
effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in TA for the
period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is
eliminated accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen, while
the reporting currency is the United States dollar. The
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the year are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue
and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated for
each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates236

ANNUAL REPORT 1998

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on
translation differences between the date a project/program
is committed and the timing of disbursements. Exchange
gains or losses are charged or credited to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values
are reported at fair value. The Bank makes provisions for
possible loss of value quarterly based on Management’s
evaluation of potential losses on investments without readily
determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year
and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the
year. The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as

of 31 December 1998 and 1997 expressed in United States
dollars were as follows:

 

Currency 1998 1997
Japanese yen $ ce $152,367,000
United States dollar

309,782,000 117,085,000

Total $309,782,000 $269,452,000

Starting November 1997, liquid funds denominated in yen
were converted into United States dollar denominated investments. This has resulted in an increase in the return on
investments noted below.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 5.08% (0.68% —
1997).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

The Bank used JSF resources to make an equity investment
in India in 1990 totalling $216,000 at 31 December 1998
($373,000 — 1997). The investment is reported at its estimated fair value and the unrealized loss of $152,000
($259,000 — 1997) is included in income for the year.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective TA for projects/programs
which have not been disbursed. During 1998, an amount of
$9,169,000 ($3,266,000 — 1997) representing completed
and cancelled TA projects has been written back as a
reduction in TA of the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value
of undisbursed commitments approximates the amounts
outstanding because JSF expects that disbursements will
substantially be made for all the projects/programs covered
by the commitments.JSF-4

NOTE F—UNCOMMITTED BALANCES

Uncommitted balances are composed of amounts which
have not been committed by the Bank as at 31 December
1998. These balances include TA projects/programs that
had been approved but which had not yet become effective.

As of 31 December 1998 and 1997 these balances were as
follows:

1998 1997
Uncommitted balances $127,535,000 $164, 105,000
TA projects/programs
approved by the

Government of Japan
and the Bank but
not yet effective (35,108,000) (49,243,000)
TA projects/programs

approved by the

Government of Japan

and not yet effective (29,050,000) (44,236,000)
Uncommitted balances

available for new

commitments

$ 63,377,000 $ 70,626,000

NOTE G—CONTRIBUTIONS AND
TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED
NET ASSETS

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 1998
and 1997 were received during the respective years. Some
of the contributions received were with the restriction that
they were to be utilized for specific TA projects/programs.
Such contributions were classified as temporarily restricted
support.

Financial Statements

CONTINUED

Temporarily restricted uncommitted balances are available
for the following purposes as of 31 December 1998 and
1997:

1998 1997
Environment-Related Activities $13,917,000 $20,113,000
Private Sector Promotion 5,458,000 8,760,000
Gender and Development 4,809,000 5,586,000
Training/Symposium 280,000 183,000
Total

$24,464,000 $34,642,000

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated
administrative expenses has been categorized as temporarily restricted net assets because, under the terms of the
agreement between the Bank and the donor, it may only be
used for the defrayment of the Fund’s administrative
expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments
for TA satisfying the conditions specified by the donor and,
in the case of accumulated investment income, to defray
the administrative expenses of the Fund.

NOTE H—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The Fund’s statement of financial position carrying amounts
are considered to approximate fair values for all significant
financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E for discussions with respect to investments, equity investments, and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.Financial Statements 239

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CONTINUED

 

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Bank approved the establishment of the Asian
Development Bank Institute (the Institute) in Tokyo, Japan
as a subsidiary body of the Bank. The Institute’s operations
commenced upon the receipt of the first fund from the
Government of Japan on 24 March 1997, and it was inaugurated on 10 December 1997. The Institute maintains its
own financial accounts and is financed by a Special Fund.
The Institute’s funds consist of voluntary contributions,
donations, and grants from members, nongovernment
organizations, and foundations. The objectives of the
Institute, as defined under its Statute, are the identification of effective development strategies and the improvement of capacity for sound development management in
developing member countries.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented on
the basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports the contributions of cash and other
assets as unrestricted support as these are contributed by
donors without conditions other than for the purposes of
pursuing the objectives of the Institute.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Institute are reported
at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains
and losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Cost or amortized cost is used
to approximate fair value for certain short-term investments not traded in the market (time deposits, etc.).

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment is stated at cost and is
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial
statements from the date indicated by the donors that
funds are expected to be made available.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar and the financial statements are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the period are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue
and expense amounts in currency other than the United
States dollar are translated for each semimonthly period at
the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each
period; such practice approximates the application of average
rates in effect during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year
(24 March — 31 December 1997) and the reported amounts of
income and expenses during the year (24 March — 31 December
1997). The actual results could differ from those estimates.244

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1998 and 1997

 

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Institute
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of investments denominated in Japanese yen. As of 31 December
1998 and 1997, the estimated fair value of the investments
approximates the amortized cost. All such investments are
due in one year or less.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 0.48% (0.53% —
annualized rate of return for the period ended 31 December
1997).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors. The main investment
management objective is to maintain security and liquidity.
Subject to these parameters, the Bank seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

The Institute’s statement of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments.

NOTE E—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL
BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Institute participates in the contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of the Bank. Every
member of the professional staff, as defined under the Plan,
shall, as a condition of service, become a participant from
the first day of service, provided that at such a date, the
staff has not reached the normal retirement age of 60.
Retirement benefits are based on length of service and
highest average remuneration during two years of eligible
service. The Plan assets are segregated and are not included in the statement of financial position. The costs of
administering the Plan are absorbed by the Bank, except
for fees paid to the investment managers and related charges,
including custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
remuneration to the Plan and may also make voluntary
contributions. The Institute’s contribution is determined
at a rate sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan
not covered by the participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

The Institute participates in the cost-sharing plan of the
Bank for retirees medical insurance premiums of ADB.
Under the plan, the Institute is obligated to pay 80% of the
Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums for retirees and
their eligible dependents who elected to participate. The
cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.ADBISF-4

Financial Statements

 

The following table sets forth the pension and postretirement
benefits at 31 December 1998:

For measurement purposes, an 11.5% annual rate of increase
in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was
assumed for the valuation as at 31 December 1998. The
rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 3.5% for 2009
and remain at that level thereafter.

eg., Afghanistan; and

for countries with active loans, the contract amount inputted is basically the percentage of Bank-financed portion and each contract amount was adjusted upon completion.

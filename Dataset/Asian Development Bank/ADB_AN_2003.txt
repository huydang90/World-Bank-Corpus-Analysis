or Asia and the Pacific, 2003 was a year of many

challenges and uncertainties marked by

geopolitical concerns, threats of terrorism, global

economic and financial instability, and outbreaks

of epidemic diseases such as the severe acute

respiratory syndrome followed by the avian flu in
early 2004. In our ongoing efforts to be an effective and
dynamic development partner for our devdoping
member countries (DMCs), we at ADB have initiated
many changes and reformsin our organization and in
our operations to address these challenges and to better
position ourselves to respond to future challenges. All of
these initiatives enphasize greater development
effectiveness by focusing operations on the achievement
of impacts and outcomes.

The extensive reorganization and the introduction
of new business processes in January 2002 marked the
beginning of a series of organizational changes and
reforms. In 2003, we conducted a review of the reorganization and business processes, and initial findings and
recommendations of the review have already been
implemented. In 2004, an independent assessment of the
reorganization will be conducted by a panei of external
experts and will also include consultations with key
stakeholders in our DMCs. Other steps ADB took in
2003 toward greater organizational effectiveness include
the appointment of a fourth Vice-President to oversee
knowledge management and sustainable development,
and the creation of anew Managing Director General
position to facilitate the coordination of the work of
senior management.

To reinforce accountability, particularly to address
in afair and proper manner the concerns of persons
affected by ADB-assisted projects, a new accountability
mechanism was established in May 2003. The new
mechanism consists of a consultation phase and a
compliance review phase, and the offices for the Special
Project Facilitator and the Compliance Review Pane are
now operational. A comprehensive review and revision of
all sections of the Operations Manual were completed in
October, and copies have been disseminated to ADB
Management and staff as well as to the public on ADB's
web site to promote greater and clearer accountability.
ADB is now preparing a unified public communications
policy that will help increase transparency in all aspects
of its activities and will hence improve outreach to all
stakeholders and development partners. In addition,
ADB has initiated a review of theimplenentation of our
governance and anticorruption policies. In 2003, ADB
also adopted the policy, “Enhancing ADB's Rolein
Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of
Terrorism.”

In December 2003, the Board of Directors approved
a set of recommendations to enhance the independence
and effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). Effective January 2004, OED reports
directly to the Board of Directors. This important

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 _ iiiADB's evaluation procedures and results.

To address the human resource dimension of
devedopment effectiveness, ADB is preparing a new
Human Resource Strategy with three strategic objectives:
to enhance organizational capacity, to establish an
effective performance management system, and to
strengthen leadership and accountability for performance. One of the priorities is to implement the Gender
Action Plan II as part of our diversity framework and to
mainstream gender issues in ADB's internal initiatives as
well asin the regional development agenda. The Board
of Directors on the recommendation of the President has
recently appointed ADB's first female Vice-President.

All of these initiatives have hdped ADB maximize
its institutional effectiveness. As a result, ADB isnow a
more accountable, more efficient, and more transparent
institution that is better positioned than ever to respond
to the needs of its DMCs.

For ADB to provide the necessary assistance to its
DMCs, it must optimize the management of its financial
resources. This requires making the most efficient use of
existing resources as well as securing adequate levels of
additional funds, particularly in the Asian Devdopment
Fund (ADF) which offers concessional loan terms to
poorer DMCs. To strengthen ADB's strategic planning
and efficient allocation of existing resources, the
performance-based allocation system of the ADF was
reviewed. Discussions with donors also started in 2003
concerning the replenishment of the ADF. Significant
milestones have been achieved including ADF IX donors’
meetings in Copenhagen and Tokyo in the last quarter
of the year and in Lisbon in early 2004. Additionally, the
review of the management and effectiveness of technical
assistance operations resulted in important improvements in the management of those limited resources.

The most important initiative of 2003 was a
comprehensive review of ADB's Poverty Reduction
Strategy, the outcome of which is so crucial to refining
our operations to achieve our overarching goal of poverty
reduction. Based on empirical evidence across countries
which demonstrates that robust and sustained pro-poor
economic growth is the single most important factor in
attaining rapid poverty reduction, initial findings of the
review emphasized the importance of infrastructure
development and private sector participation. The review
also reinforced the importance of the nonincome
dimensions of poverty, especially the need to focus on
thematic and crosscutting issues like environment and
gender, many of which are included in the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). We have sharpened our
focus on the attainment of the MDGs by aligning ADB's
country strategies and programs with them; in fact,
achieving the MDGs has become a framework for
measuring development progress in the region.

development effectiveness. We created in 2004 a Results
Management Unit that will lead the implementation of
the action plan at the country, institutional, and
partnership levels. Furthermore, ADB is currently
piloting results-based country strategies and programs in
selected DMCs.

Recognizing that knowledge is of critical importance
in development and that ADB's enhanced rolein
knowledge generation and sharing is a prerequisite for
achieving our overarching goal of poverty reduction,
ADB is committed to becoming a primary source of
development knowledge in Asia and the Pacific. To guide
ADB's transition to a knowledge-based organization, the
preparation of the Knowledge Management Framework
started in 2003.

We all know that peace is a prerequisite for
development, but we also know that poverty reduction
and development are essential for attaining peace. As a
regional development bank, we at ADB are aware of the
role we should and can play in promoting development
and reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific. ADB will
continue to work hard in cooperation with our member
countries as well as with our devdopment partners and
stakeholders to realize an Asia and Pacific region free of
poverty where all people can enjoy economic prosperity
and lasting peace.

viii ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKith the strong
support of the Asian
Devedopment Bank
(ADB), the Asia and
Pacific region has
continued its
progress toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) by 2015 (see page 36).
Overall poverty rates in the region
have fallen, and growth has
continued. Many of ADB’s members
have made investments in health
and nutrition that have reduced
maternal and child mortality rates
and lowered the incidence of
communicable diseases.

Yet challenges remain, and
enormous efforts are still required.
Women and girls do not always
benefit equally with males from
social services. Cross-border public
health problems continue to takea
toll on families and nations.
Diseases such as HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis, and malaria are major
causes and effects of poverty in the
region asis thelack of access to safe
water and to sanitation. Although
employment is a principal means to
escape from poverty, many of the
poorest and most vulnerable people,
including the dderly, female heads of
households, and people with special
challenges, are unable to work.

In 2003, global and regional
uncertainties directly and indirectly
influenced ADB's daily activities.
The reconstruction of Afghanistan
continued, the war in Iraq created
uncertainty around the region, and
the outbreak of the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) had a
heavy impact on the economies of
many ADB members. Furthermore,
growth prospects for industrial
economies during the first half of
the year were subdued.

While the goal of reducing
poverty continued to guideits
operations, ADB also responded
quickly to the urgent needs of its
developing member countries!

included loans to Afghanistan,

The Asian Development Bank was
established in 1966 through a
multilateral agreement ratified by
31 members. Luxembourg and the
Republic of Palau joined in 2003
bringing the total membership to 63,
of which 45 are in Asia and the
Pacific. ADB has its headquarters in

providing technical assistance to the
People’s Republic of China (PRC).

ADB also faced internal
challenges and opportunities. ADB
personne continued to adapt to the
new organizational structure and to
new business processes; extensive
reviews of both were completed with
recommendations to further
improve the efficiency of operations.
A staff engagement survey pointed
out specific issues and concerns that
ADB began addressing in 2003 with
the preparation of the new human
resource strategy.

Recognizing these complex
issues, the Board of Directors
supported ADB Management and
staff in their efforts to improve
institutional effectiveness and
internal governance and to
demonstrate devedopment impact.

Funding

The main instruments for providing
help to ADB’s DMCs are policy
dialogue, loans, technical assistance,

in Frankfurt, Germany; for Japan in
Tokyo; and for North America in
Washington, DC, United States. It
recently approved resident missions
for Azerbaijan and Thailand; a
subregional office for the Pacific in
Suva, Fiji Islands; and a liaison and
coordination office for the Pacific in
Sydney, Australia.

ADBs vision is an Asia and Pacific
region free of poverty with better
living conditions and quality of life for
all its inhabitants. The strategic
agenda focuses on pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; inclusive social
development; and governance for
effective policies and institutions with
crosscutting themes of environmental
sustainability, gender and development, private sector development,
and regional cooperation and

grants, guarantees, and equity
investments (see page 7). ADB offers
arange of modalities and terms
for loans aimed at improving
performance.

About 70% of cumulative
lending comes from ordinary
capital resources (OCR) from three
distinct sources: private placements and capital markets in the
form of borrowing, paid-in capital
provided by shareholders, and
accumulated retained income
(reserves) that provides a buffer
for risks.

Loans are also provided from
Special Funds. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) offers loans on
concessional terms to members
with low per capita gross national
products and weak debt-repayment
capacities. The ADF is financed by
periodic, voluntary contributions
from donors. A major constraint in
2003 was the level of available
resources for concessional lending
and technical assistance, a
situation that might potentially
jeopardize the institution’s ability
to deliver its program. Discussions
were held with donors concerning

the replenishment of ADF
resources. Significant milestones
included the ADF VIII Midterm
Review followed by the ADF IX
donors’ meetings in Copenhagen
and Tokyo. As part of these
meetings, ADB has agreed with
donors to undertake a wide range
of initiatives and reforms aimed at
improving its efficiency and
effectiveness in providing
development assistance to DMCs.
Other Special Funds are the
Technical Assistance Special Fund,
the Japan Special Fund, and the
ADB Institute Special Fund.

ADB also manages and
administers additional funds: the
apan Scholarship Program, the
.apan Fund for Poverty Reduction,
and the Japan Fund for Information
and Communication Technology. It
also channels grants provided by
bilateral donors to support technical
assistance and soft components of
loans. In recent years, thematic trust
funds focusing on gender and
development, governance, poverty
reduction, water, energy, and the
environment were established to
support technical assistance
operations and selected components
of loan projects.

Technical assistance funded
through grants or loans helps
maximize ADB’s devdopment
impact. Most technical assistance
grants are used for preparing
projects and supporting advisory
activities in areas such as law and
policy reform, strengthening fiscal
policies and procedures, good
governance, capacity building, and
natural resource management.

ADB has atriple-A credit rating?
and actively mobilizes financial
resources through its cofinancing
operations tapping official,
commercial, and export credit
sources. Assistance to its DMCs
creates an enabling environment for
private sector development. ADB
also directly finances private sector
projects to assist commercial
investors and lenders. (For moreon
ADB finandal management, see http://

The Board of Directors approved
several policy, financial, and
administrative papers in 2003. One
was “Enhancing ADB’s Role in
Combating Money Laundering and
the Financing of Terrorism.”
Another was the review of the
inspection function that resulted in
the establishment of anew
accountability mechanism that is
now in place. It consists of two
complementary functions: the
consultation phase and the
compliance review phase. For
consultation, a special project
facilitator was appointed. For
compliance, the Board of Directors
appointed a full-time chair and parttime members of a review pand and
the Board Compliance Review
Committee to replace the Board
Inspection Committee. The new
mechanism provides important
structural and procedural means to
address the concerns of projectaffected people, to improve project
quality, and to enhance development
effectiveness. (For moreon ADB

Review of Existing Policies

A review of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy was initiated in 2003 to
refine ADB's institutional response
to its overriding goal of poverty
reduction. Reviews of policies on
financial managenent included the
“Review of ADB's Lending and
Borrowing Limitations,” the “Review
of the Resource Position of ADB,”
and the “Review of ADB’s Income
and Policy Framework” (ongoing).
The “Review of the Managenent
and Effectiveness of Technical
Assistance Operations’ resulted in
important improvements in the
management of ADB’s limited
resources. “The Pilot Study for
Delegation of Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under
Technical Assistance to Executing
Agencies’ and reviews of the 1994
“Policy on Confidentiality and

Disclosure of Information” and the
“Information Policy and Strategy”
were initiated.

MQnanging Focus

Many of ADB's internal initiatives
explicitly and implicitly focused on
results with a greater enphasis on
impact and outcome. Changes in
senior management in 2003
reflected this change in focus. An
additional Vice-President was
appointed to oversee knowledge
management and sustainable
development activities, bringing the
total number of vice-presidents to
four. In addition to that, anew
position of Managing Director
General was created to coordinate
the work of the vice-presidents.

A change in the reporting
structure for the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED)
likewise reflected the shift. Noting
that the credibility of evaluation
depends on the quality and integrity
of analysis, the degree of transparency, and the independence of the
evaluation unit, ADB examined the
reporting structure and accountability of its evaluation work. In 2004,
OED will report directly to the Board
of Directors through the Development Effectiveness Committee
(seehttp:// www.adb.org’ OED/ ).

Also reflecting the emphasis on
results, the functions and responsibilities for representative offices were
transferred from the Strategy and
Policy Department to the Office of
the President. The change in
reporting will allow representative
offices to better operate under the
general direction of the President for
matters such as high-level, broadrange dialogues with external
counterparts.

Broadening Development
Partnerships

ADB continued to provide support
for partnerships throughout the
region. Indicative of its active
engagement in regional and
international issues was its support

for and participation in the
following:

(i) the High-Level Forum on
Harmonization,

(ii) the Third World Water
Forum,

(iii) the Brunei DarussalamIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East
Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) Growth Area
Leaders’ Meeting,

(iv) Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation,

(v) Asia-Europe Finance
Ministers’ Meeting,

(vi) the Twelfth Ministerial
Conference on Subregional
Cooperation in the Greater Mekong
Subregion, and

(vii) the Second Ministerial
Conference on Central Asian
Economic Cooperation.

In addition, ADB signed
cooperation agreements with the
following institutions:

(i) Southeast Asian Ministers of
Education Organization to
complement their knowledge base
and to expand the network of
institutions active in educational
devdopment;

(ii) World Health Organization
to fight SARS and other energing
diseases;

(iii) United Nations Human
Settlement Programme to build the
capacity of Asian cities to secure and
manage pro-poor investments and
to hap the region meet the MDG of
“halving, by 2015, the proportion of
people without safe drinking water
and basic sanitation”; and

(iv) Gender and Water Alliance
to promote gender mainstreaming
into DMC water sector activities.

ADB's resident missions played
an essential rolein enhancing the
institution’s country focus enabling
staff to work more closely with all
stakeholders to achieve results. ADB
and its resident missions worked
with nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) and civil society to strengthen
partnerships and interaction in all
areas and to build capacity. In May
2003, ADB approved the ADBGovernment-NGO Cooperation:

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 3A Framework for Action, 2003-2005.
The Framework put in an operational context the directives contained in
ADB's Long-Term Strategic
Framework 2001-2015 and
Medium-Term Strategy 2001-2005,
particularly promoting improved
conditions for wider and more
effective participation in decision
making by civil society.

Governing Structure

The highest policy-making body is
the Board of Governors which
comprises one representative from
each ADB member. The Governors
meet annually and elect the
12 members of the Board of
Directors who serve 2-year terms.
Each Director appoints an Alternate.
The President is elected by the
Board of Governors for a 5-year
term and serves as Chairperson of
the Board. The President manages
ADB assisted by four Vice-Presidents
and a Managing Director General.
(For a current lis of Governors and
Directors, sse appendixes 2 and 3.)

The Board of Directors met
formally on 48 occasions and hdd
24 informal meetings in 2003
including briefings, discussion
seminars, and presentations. In their
informal meetings, the Directors
examined a range of issues, including
the Poverty Reduction Strategy,
disaster and emergency assistance,
Afghanistan’s development,
cooperation with governments and
NGOs, and human resource activities.

Board Committees

The Board of Directors had four
standing committees and one
working committee. (For membership,
see Appendix 4.)

Audit Committee

In accordance with its mandate, the
Committee reviewed the adequacy of
ADB's internal controls, particularly
for financial reporting, and of
internal and external audits.
Monitoring continued of ADB’s
decision to provide parallel
reporting for derivative instruments
before and after the introduction of
Financial Accounting Standards
(FAS 133) and rdated amendments
in 2001. ADB's financial statements
refer both to preFAS 133 reporting
practice and to the new, currentvalue reporting practice. Parallel
reporting and the need for close
monitoring of accounting and
reporting practices were Committee
priorities. In this context, the
importance of cooperation among
the multilateral development banks
(MDBs) and of the professional
partnership of the outside auditors
who provided experience and advice
were emphasized.

The Committee also monitored
the devdopment of ADB's institutional risk management capability,
again in close consultation with
other MDBs. Using the Audit
Recommendations Implenentation
Report and the report of the
auditors, monitoring of the

Board and Management Retreat

The Board and Management met in
October for a 2-day retreat on the
theme “Development Effectiveness:
Managing for Results.” Discussions
focused on ways of strengthening
results-based management in ADB
including how to measure, monitor, and manage for development
results; how to handle accountability and human resource management aspects; and lessons to be
learned from other development

institutions and partners. The
retreat followed an earlier Management Committee meeting on the
same topic at which the President
called for a positive reorientation in
ADB's management processes.
Retreat inputs were used in finalizing a paper for the ADF IX donors

effectiveness and efficiency of control
systems, including access control
procedures, continued. The
Committee also reviewed and
endorsed the following: (i) the 2003
work program of the Office of the
Auditor General (OAG); (ii) the
Audit Recommendations Implenentation Report with a focus on highly
critical items associated with risk
management in both operations and
financial management; and (iii) the
annual report of the Anticorruption
Unit of OAG with close attention to
ADB's handling of debarment of
firms and individuals to ensure
sanctions against them were
effective.

Budget Review Committee

The Committee recommended
approval of ADB’s proposed 2004
budgets for internal administrative
expenses and annual capital
expenditures. The proposed internal
administrative budget is higher than
in past years though without the
additional initiatives it included,
growth could have been kept bdow
past averages. The increase in the
provision for the Board of Directors
was mainly due to the inclusion of
the costs associated with the new
accountability mechanism. The
Board’s budget may increase
significantly in future years should
it include the cost of the independent OED. (For a summary of the
budget for 2004, see Appendix 8.)

The Committee supported
continued delegation to resident
missions and stressed the need for
cost-effectiveness in their establishment and in managing their
operating costs. The Committee also
emphasized the importance of
resident missionsin portfolio
management and the need to ensure
that adequate resources are allocated
to project administration both in
resident missions and at headquarters.

The Committee raised several
questions regarding the adequacy of
staff resource allocations and was
informed that staff and budget
resources were extremely tight in
part because work has becomeincreasingly complex in recent years
as a result of multiple policy
mandates and compliance requirements. It recommended developing
in-house capability and institutional
memory and that consultants be
used prudently and judiciously. The
Committee also queried the regional
directors on how they proposed to
motivate staff in a resourceconstrained environment; they said
that changes arising from anew
human resource strategy and
implementation of managing-forresults would improve staff morale.

A series of meetings was held in
November to discuss the work
programs of departments and
offices of the ADB Institute (ADBI)
and to review the budgets of ADB
and ADBI. As part of the ddiberations, the Committee met with the
Dean of the Institute and the heads
of departments and offices and their
staff, resulting in better understanding and appreciation of the activities
of ADB and ADBI. The Committee
also reviewed the progress on
implementing the recommendations
it made during the 2003 budget
deliberations.

The Committee recommended
approval of the proposed ADBI 2004
budget. It noted the contributions
and achievements of ADBI and
welcomed the increase in resources
allocated to capacity building and
training and the enhanced internal
coordination among ADBI, the
Economics and Research Department, and the Regional Economic
Monitoring Unit. The need for
further institutionalized coordination among the three research
bodies to avoid duplication was
stressed.

The Committee noted the
progress made to date on the
reorganization of ADB but expressed
concern on the operational support,
quality assurance, and compliance
roles of the Regional and Sustainable Devdopment Department and
suggested that necessary changes be
implemented as early as possible.

To make its work more
meaningful and effective, the

Committee proposed periodic
meetings and also requested that the
Budget, Personnel and Management
Systems Department and the Office
of the Secretary schedule the
Committee's annual budget meeting
before the budget document is
circulated. Several changes to
improve the format and presentation of the budget were suggested,
and the need for more communication with the Board on budget
matters was stressed.

The Committee also met to
discuss the Information Systems and
Technology Strategy Il paper and
raised numerous issues and
concerns. These included assessment
and incorporation of lessons learned
from INTEGRA (an integrated webenabled information system); more
rigorous benefit analysis; improved
accounting for project components;
more detailed definition of project
components; and inclusion of
systems audits. These issues are
being studied in detail by staff for
incorporation in a revised paper.

Development Effectiveness
Committee

The Committee reviewed a balanced
selection of OED evaluation studies
(see box) and presented its assessment to the Board of Directors in
the annual report. The report also

Reports Reviewed in 2003

presented overall conclusions and
recommendations from discussions
on (i) the status of actions taken by
ADB on key committee recommendations made in 2002; (ii) the
Annual Report on Loan and Technical
Assistance Portfolio Performance for the
Period Ending 31 Decamber 2002 (see
http:// www.adb.org/ Documents! Reports!
Portfolio_Performance! 2002/
2002_12.pdf); and (iii) the Annual
(se http:// www.adb.org Documents!
PERs RPE_OTH_2003_12.pdf). The
Committee expressed its satistaction
that evaluation activities had
generally been adequate and
efficient but at the same time noted
areas for improvement.

Loan portfolio performance
indicators in 2002 had improved
since 2001 for all but 5 of the 18
DMCs with at least 5 active loans
and a portfolio of more than
$100 million. Areas that required
further attention included the time
taken for effectiveness of loans after
approval, the need for extensions to
loan closing dates, and the
increasing proportion of loan
cancellations. In its assessment of
technical assistance portfolio
performance, the Committee
intended to closely monitor actions
taken by ADB to improve management and effectiveness.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 5The Committee noted that the
total number of evaluation reports
in 2002 increased by almost 50%
over the previous year, and that the
scope of the program had also
increased substantially. In addition
to 31 individual project/program
and 6 technical assistance performance audit reports, 9 thematic
evaluation studies were carried out.
In particular, three country program
evaluations and a special evaluation
study of ADF VI-VII operations were
completed. The Committee also
commended the first-time inclusion
in OED’s annual report of a chapter
on long-term trends in evaluation
results. This new analysis showed
that the downward trend in the
proportion of projects and programs
rated successful was halted and
reversed in 1989, and that subsequently a slow improvement in the
social and agriculture sectors had
been reinforced by higher success
rates in economic infrastructure
projects and with new borrowers.

The Committee recommended that
future reports go beyond statistical
reporting to identify lessons for
development effectiveness.

Inspection Committee

In 2003, the Inspection Committee
held six formal meetings, several
informal meetings, and considered
one request for inspection. In
January, the Committee created a
matrix for requests for inspection
which provides a tracking system for
monitoring the progress of ongoing
requests and a depository of publicly
available documents related to
specific requests.

At the beginning of 2003, the
Committee considered the request
for inspection of the Chashma
Right Bank Irrigation Project
(Stage II) in Pakistan and
forwarded it to Management for a
response. As permitted by the
Inspection Policy, the Committee
decided to consult a member of
the roster of experts in deciding

whether to recommend that an
inspection be authorized.

In March, the Committee
submitted its report to the Board; it
recommended that the Board
authorize an inspection of the
Project with a deferred start to allow
the process for grievance redress put
in place by the Government in
consultation with ADB to take
place. However, the Committee
reserved the right to bring forward
the proposed timetable for
commencement of the inspection
should it become evident to the
Committee that the grievance
redress process was unlikely to be
successful. As a basis for making
such a determination, the Committee requested Management to
prepare two reports on grievance
redress activities—onein July 2003
and onein January 2004.

The Board approved the
Committee's recommendation. The
Committee received the midterm
report on the grievance redress
process from ADB Management in
July. Comments and additional
information were sought from the
requesters. The Committee
considered the material provided at
its meeting in Seotenber and
published it on the ADB web sitein
October (seehttp:// www.adb/ org!

The inspection commenced in
December 2003 with the selection of

Working Group on the
Annual Report for 2003

The Board Working Group set the
general direction for 2003 working
closely with Management and staff
and taking into account the
responses from the Annual Report
Readers’ Survey. This year’s report
clearly demonstrates how ADB is
optimizing its institutional
effectiveness and resources, how it is
progressing toward achieving the
MDGs, and how it is moving the
poverty reduction agenda forward.Financing
Operations

Financial Resources

Authorized capital stock amounted
to $52 billion, and subscribed
capital stood at $52 billion. ADB
raised long-term funds totaling
about $4.1 billion, of which

$1 billion was raised through a
global public offering. Gross income
amounted to $1.7 billion,

$1.4 billion of which was generated
from theloan portfolio,

$308.7 million from the investment
portfolio, and $48.5 million from
other sources of which $41 million
came from equity investment
operations ($15 million from
dividends, $25 million from gains
realized on the sale of equity
investments, and $600,000
representing the share in net
income of the Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd).
ADB's Special Funds consisted of
the Asian Development Fund with
committed resources amounting to
$511.1 million, the Technical
Assistance Special Fund of

$85.9 million, the Japan Special
Fund totaling $19.9 million, and
the ADB Institute Special Fund of
$11.8 million.

Loans

Lending for both public and private
sector operations in 2003 amounted
to $6.1 billion for 85 loans to

66 projects. This was ADB's highest
lending since 1997. The average loan
size in 2003 was $72 million,
compared with $64 million in 2002.
Twenty-three DMCs and one regional
project received loans. A total of
$3.8 billion was disbursed. Of this,
$2.1 billion (55%) were for project
loans. The rest was for program,
sector, and private sector loans.

Of the total lending, loans with
government guarantees were over
$5.9 billion for 62 projects
comprising $4.5 billion for 33 loans
from ordinary capital resources
(OCR) and $1.4 billion for 47 loans
from the concessional ADF.
Thirteen were policy-based programs
amounting to $1.1 billion reoresenting 19%of total public sector
lending. Of program lending,
$912 million or 80%of the total
came from OCR and $228 million or
20%from the ADF. Policy-based
programs support DMC efforts to
improve policy, institutional, and
investment environments and to
help meet short-term adjustment
costs. Lending to the private sector
without government guarantees, using
OCR, amounted to $187 million.

Oofinancing and
Guarantee Operations

To maximize devdopment impact,
ADB closely coordinated with other
devdopment partners on its
assistance programs to all DMCs to
incorporate cofinancing and
coordination opportunities. ADB
systematically intensified coordination with official loan and grant
cofinanciers to identify opportunities that directly complemented
ADB projects or produced other
benefits. In commercial cofinancing,
ADB actively supported
commercially attractive private
sector projects and programs by
using appropriate credit enhancement products such as guarantees.
ADB continued the dialogue with its
DMCs to identify the best financing
solutions for public and private
sector projects and programs,

specifically the use of its credit
enhancement products (ssehttp://
www.adb.org/ cofinandng ).

ADB intensified efforts to
promote commercial cofinancing
and guarantee operations by
developing initiatives such as trade
finance and private sector investment funds like the ASEAN China
Investment Fund and the Asia Clean
Energy Fund. ADB also organized
cofinancing seminars and training
for its staff, DMC officials, and
cofinancing partners; adopted an
active rolein structuring and
mobilizing financial resources for
public-private partnership initiatives,
and strengthened partnerships with
its cofinanciers and risk-sharing
partners.

In total, cofinancing and
guarantee operations mobilized
about $2.4 billion, which represented about 40% of ADB's total lending
of $6.1 billion. Twenty-eight projects
in 14 DMCs including two regional
projects involved cofinancing in
2003. The PRC received the largest
amount ($1,241 million), primarily
from its domestic financial
institutions, followed by Bangladesh
with $598 million and Thailand
with $170 million (see Table6 in the
Statisical Annex).

Since 1970, cofinancing and
guarantee operations have mobilized

Resource Transfers

The net transfer of resources to
ADB from its DMCs increased to
$5.3 billion in 2003, compared with
$1.4 billion in 2002. During the
year, there was a net inflow of

$6.0 billion ($2.1 billion in 2002) to
ADB from OCR borrowers/ investees,
mainly from prepayments of

$5.9 billion ($2.0 billion in 2002) of
OCR pool-based loans. However, net
transfers from ADB to ADF
borrowers decreased from

$717.8 million in 2002 to

$640.8 million in 2003. (For details
se tables 26 and 27 in the Statigical
Annex.)

Loan disbursements in 2003
totaled $3.8 billion comprising
95.8% of the target for the year. Of
the total, OCR disbursements were
$2.7 billion or 70% and ADF
disbursements were $1.1 billion or
30% (For details see tables 7, 8, and 14
in the Statistical Annex.)

Loan service payments reached
$9.1 billion in 2003, compared with
$5.6 billion in 2002. The increase
was mainly because of higher
prepayments ($5.9 billion in 2003,
$2.0 billion in 2002).

In 2003, the four largest net
resource transfers from ADB were to
Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and
Bangladesh (see tables 26 and 27 in the

Catalysts for Inclusive Development
in the Asia and Pacific Region

ith over 3 billion

people, Asia is home to

a majority of the

world’s population. It

includes the two most

populous nations, the
People’s Republic of China (PRC)
and India, as well as several small
island states with populations of
only tens of thousands.

The past several decades have
ushered in major economic and
social transformations. The Green
Revolution has largely banished the
specter of recurring famine, and
immunization programs have
reduced infant and child mortality.
The phenomenal economic growth
in some East Asian countries has
been billed as the “East Asian
Miracle.” For the first timein the
history of Asia in the span of one
generation, entire countries have
been lifted out of poverty and now
rank among the prosperous societies
of the world. The rapid economic
growth in the PRC since 1980 has
significantly reduced the number of
poor people in the world. As the
growth of the Indian economy
accelerates, and as the prospect for
peace and stability in South Asia
brightens, the potential for further
economic and social progress in the
region is indeed impressive.

Despite these successes, Asia
confronts a sobering array of
challenges. The region is still home
to more than half of the world’s
poor. Malnutrition, disease, violence,
lack of education, and premature
death haunt the lives of too many of
those most likely to have been
excluded from the surging economic
boom. They may be women;
uneducated; landless or unskilled;
members of ethnic, religious, or
cultural minorities; or simply people
living in remote regions who are
unable to migrate to settings with
better economic opportunities. Such
exclusion reinforces, often from one
generation to the next, their
disadvantages in society.Deprivation is often an outcome
of past policies and practices. To
remedy this, the rules of the game
must be re-examined and modified.
At the beginning of the 21° century,
theinternational community took a
determined step in this direction in
the Millennium Declaration.' The
pursuit of the Millennium Deveopment Goals outlined therein calls for
a comprehensive re-examination of
both the strategies for economic
growth and the function and
organization of institutions critical
in meeting them. Consistent with
this, ADB has defined poverty in a
comprehensive manner.

“Poverty is a deprivation of
essential assets and opportunities to
which every human is entitled.
Everyone should have access to basic
education and primary health
services. Poor households have the
right to sustain themselves by their
labor and be reasonably rewarded, as
well as having some protection from
external shocks. Beyond income and
basic services, individuals and
societies are also poor—and tend to

remain so—if they are not enpowered to participate in making the
decisions that shape their lives.”
For wider economic participation, people must be able to control
their lives and to reshape the
opportunities that are open to then.
As long as the poor have low
productivity jobs and the exchange
of labor continues at near subsistence levels, they will renain
extrenely vulnerable. Widening
employment opportunities in higher
productivity jobs will, therefore,
continue to be of paramount
importance in economic development. At the same time, efforts
must be made to ensure that jobs
offer fair wages and provide some
measure of security against the
uncertainties of the marketplace.
Devedopment efforts that bypass
vulnerable people can hardly
succeed. The challenge is to pursue
economic growth through inclusive
development that combines
initiatives to expand and equalize
opportunities, to combat discrimination, to enable and foster participa
 

In addition to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy, ADB's broader development
agenda is served by many other
associated policies. Some of these are
briefly listed here. Under the Gender

mainstreaming was adopted as the
key strategy with ADB undertaking to

also supports inclusive development
and emphasizes intervening both
directly by reducing poverty and

indirectly by promoting sustainable

 

 

tion, and to provide all with a stake
in managing common resources.
Inclusive development uses political,
economic, and social policies to
reduce vulnerability in a framework
of pro-poor, sustainable economic
growth. By its nature, it haps build
consensus on the vital issues facing
anation. ADB's Poverty Reduction
Strategy and supporting policy
documents’ articulate precisely this
challenge (sxe box).

The Poverty Reduction Strategy
of 1999 was the culmination of a
long learning process in which ADB
transformed itself from a project
lender in the 1970s to the institution it is today: a supporter of
development in its totality. It
provides a comprehensive framework
for ADB's approach to inclusive
development and explicitly states
that poverty reduction is ADB's
primary goal. This goal is pursued
through country poverty reduction
strategies.

The Strategy rests on three main
pillars: (i) pro-poor, sustainable
economic growth, (ii) inclusive social
development, and (iii) governance for
effective policies and institutions. It
also recognizes the importance of
strengthening the private sector, of
regional cooperation, of gender, and
of promoting environmental
sustainability. The Strategy
recommends that ADB increase
partnerships with civil society, local
governments, and other stakeholders

Legal Empowerment

An ADB-commissioned study
examined how legal empowerment
contributes to good governance,
poverty reduction, and other
development goals. Using seven
country reports, the study
identified the constraints faced by
the poor in accessing the legal
system and in participating in
local or national governance.
These included (i) lack of economic
independence; (ii) minimal
understanding of law and the
rights it confers; (iii) limited access
to affordable legal services; (iv) lack
of knowledge, incentives, and
resources among government
Officials; (v) limitations in the
outreach and capacity of civil
society organizations to provide
legal services to the disadvantaged;
(vi) inconsistency between formal
law and traditional values;

(vii) poorly drafted or contradictory
laws and regulations; (viii) failure
to implement sound laws;

(ix) traditional use of law as an
instrument of control; and

(x) corruption.

Legal empowerment can be
undertaken through a variety of
activities and strategies. The first
step is awareness of the law and the
rights it confers. The second is
assistance to poor communities to
assert their rights or to enforce
judgments through formal or
informal decision-making bodies. A
third and potent area of activity is
participation in local governance by
the poor or by nongovernment
organizations representing their
interests.

greatly aid in the fulfillment of
human aspirations just as malfunctioning institutions can impede
progress. Certain traits have come to
be identified with effective
performance: (i) mandates for
participation and transparency of
transactions, (ii) provisions for
public and professional scrutiny and
accountability, (iii) public voice in
determining outcomes, and

(iv) taking local circumstances into
account in institutional design.
Recognizing the close nexus between
poverty reduction and institutional
and legal regimes, ADB supports
legal and institutional reform (se
boxes).

The formal laws, policies, and
rules that determine the efficient
functioning of the state and the
market are crucial for inclusive
development in Asia. Most people
recognize that the state has
responsibilities to provide affordable, effective, and equitable public
goods and services, including those
targeted under the Millennium
Devdopment Goals. Understanding
thereationship among governance,

poverty, and vulnerability from the
viewpoint of the poor is vital to
institutional reform that promotes
inclusive devdopment. Equally
important are reforms that protect
the poor against the misuse of
power. ADB has started identifying
approaches that can enable the poor
to exercise their rights to public
entitlements and to seek protection
from such misuse.

Policymakers must resist the
temptation to replicate institutional
arrangements simply because they
have been successful elsewhere or
because theoretically they seen
optimal; instead, institutional makeup must be anchored in local
knowledge of practices. The
prospects for experimentation are
vast, and the intersection of theory
and practice promises to be
incredibly dynamic. Regional and
country analyses and interventions
will yidd the greatest insights going
far beyond the few international
best practices. Much remains to be
done to learn from and support the
positive lessons that are energing
from the region.

Evolution in ADB of the Concept of
Legal Systems and Access to Justice

In the past, definitions of legal
systems have been narrow and too
limited to address poverty reduction and development objectives
as they are now understood.
Because of this, a definition that is
much more robust and emancipating has been adopted by ADB:

“A legal system encompasses the
tights and obligations of any
individual or private or public
institution that is supported by
formal or informal enforcement
mechanisms.” Among other
things, this functional definition
eschews the traditional and often
artificial line that is drawn between
bureaucracies and judiciaries.

Just as the scope of a legal
system has expanded, so too has
ADB's definition of what constitutes
access to justice. Earlier definitions
included a narrow and mostly formal
set of institutions and activities.
Research on legal empowerment
supported by ADB demonstrated the
need to expand the boundaries of
what is meant by access to justice
and the institutions involved in
enhancing it. In this context, legal
empowerment is defined as, “The
use of law to increase the control
that disadvantaged populations
exercise over their lives.” Thus, the
law becomes a key instrument in the
empowerment of people.

the Rule of Law. Stanford University Press. Erik G. Jensen, “The Rule of Law and Judicial Reform: The
Political Economy of Diverse Institutional Patterns and Reformers’ Responses.”To promote pro-poor, sustainable growth, developing member
country (DMC) governments are
reconfiguring existing institutions to
improve access by the poor to credit
and technology. Supporting small
and medium enterprises (SMEs) is a
major policy thrust as is widening
the reach of markets by building
transport networks.

In social development,
investments and capacity building
are essential for any meaningful
improvement. However, without
institutional and policy reform,
many of these interventions will
not bear fruit or be sustained.
Areas of reform where ADB has
been particularly active include
(i) adequate budgetary allocations
for human capital, (ii) basic social
services for the poor, (iii) removal
of gender discrimination,

(iv) formulating effective population policies, and (v) designing
social protection.

Better macroeconomic
management and improved
governance call for major
institutional changes. ADB
support, particularly in recent
years, has been significant in this
area. Legal and institutional
changes have focused on improving bureaucratic responsiveness,
supporting devolution and
decentralization, strengthening the
enforcement of justice, and
providing greater information and
transparency about performance
and spending. Finally, ADB has
worked closely with DMCs to
overcome barriers to effective
participation in globalization* by
initiating national and regional
institutional reforms.

Insolvency and Secured Transactions

The recommendations of an ADB
study in 11 Asian countries provided
the basis for determining good
practice standards essential to
debtor-creditor relations. Recognizing the pioneering nature of this
work, the United Nations Committee
on Trade Law adopted these
standards and incorporated them
into its draft Legislative Guide on
Insolvency Law.

Good insolvency laws should
provide for continued functioning
of debtors, if possible, with
effective rescue processes in which
creditors and shareholders have
confidence so that businesses can
be rehabilitated and employees
can retain their livelihoods. The laws
can provide an awareness of what
practices lead to insolvency, and in
cases where there appear to have
been infringements by corporate
managers or directors, prosecution
could be launched thus building
awareness of what constitutes illegal
corporate conduct. Sound insolvency laws also permit all economic
players to understand in advance

how their interests will be protected.

The Asian financial crisis highlighted the importance of developing a framework for regional
cooperation to address the growing
problem of cross-border corporate
insolvency. ADB's discussions with
key stakeholders on strengthening
national frameworks led several
countries to consider ways of
cooperating in this area.

When the insolvency risk for a
country is predictable and financial
institutions can ascertain and price
this risk, the cost of credit stabilizes
and eventually falls. Evidence from
the Asian financial crisis highlighted
the potentially destabilizing impact
of systems that were overly dependent on the banking sector for
credit and on real estate as collateral
for credit. Secured transaction
regimes allow small and medium
enterprises and farmers to use
moveable property such as equipment and raw materials as collateral
when these groups cannot provide
real estate or land as collateral, thus
reducing risks.

ADB's Experience and
Lessons Learned

Improved Market Functioning
and Access to Resources for
Pro-Poor Economic Growth

Central to the efficient operation of
markets is improving the security of
private property, the sanctity of
contracts, and the predictable and
consistent application of rational
laws ensuring access to economic
resources by all, particularly the
poor and the vulnerable. ADB has
been assisting institutional reform
in these areas. In addition, support
has been provided for promoting
competition, reducing market
distortions, and introducing fair
terms for labor.

Improving the Security of
Property and Exchange

The need for a legal framework for a
market economy is particularly
salient in transition economies, i.e,
the Central Asian republics,
Cambodia, PRC, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR ),
Mongolia, and Viet Nam. The
demand for law and legal institutions has also accelerated in the
wake of economic growth; for
example, ADB has actively collaborated with the PRC in the development of bankruptcy laws,
regulations on antidumping, and
subsidy and countervailing duties
and safeguards.

The Asian financial crisis
highlighted the importance of
strong insolvency and debtorcreditor regimes for crisis
prevention, mitigation, and
resolution (seebox). The crisis
exposed weaknesses in the proper
functioning of financial and
corporate institutions.° The rules
under which the markets functioned were also scrutinized.
Postcrisis assistance often included
a cluster of loans supporting
reforms in the financial and
corporate sectors and in the
policies governing competitive
market functioning.

Specific attention has also been
paid to improving therules
governing the functioning of
corporations and stock markets so
that they are more open and
accountable. The Indonesia program
loans in the financial governance
sector are examples. In Thailand,
operations focused on improving
institutions to strengthen market
regulation and supervision;
restructuring the Securities and
Exchange Commission into an
autonomous agency was a key
edement. Philippine operations
focused on reforms in the capital
market and nonbank financial
sectors.

The 1997 crisis raised awareness
of the need for reforms even in
countries that were not directly
affected. That led to ADB assistance
to several DMCs on institutional
reforms in the financial and
corporate sectors including projects
in Cambodia, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao
PDR, Marshall Islands, and
Pakistan.

Improving Access to Resources
and Opportunities

domestic institutions to enable the
poor to better access productive
resources such as land, technology,
and credit. Impediments to access

ndonesia: Legal Empowerment

of Water Users’ Associations

An ADB-assisted Asia Foundation
study has helped to develop a legal
empowerment component of the
Participatory Irrigation Sector
Project. As a result, water users’
associations will become better
positioned to negotiate agreements,
and farmers can better negotiate
irrigation transfer, management, and
service agreements with the
Government. Government officials
are better informed and become
more responsive to farmers’ needs.
Women play greater roles in
irrigation management and in other
community affairs. Farmers and their

communities are better able to
respond to outside encroachment
on their water rights. Legal empowerment is enabling farmers and
communities to address issues
outside of irrigation, e.g., gender,
local governance, and natural
resource management. Through
paralegal development and other
mechanisms, farmers can assert their
interests beyond the term of the
Project. A network of nongovernment organizations, lawyers, law
schools, and farmers’ associations is
further contributing to irrigation
reforms.can be as basic as the denial of a
person’s legal identity; other
exclusions follow as a matter of
course. At the very minimum, a
person must be recognized by the
state as legally existing, yet it is
estimated that 63%of births in
South Asia annually go unregistered,
and 22% are not registered in East
Asia and the Pacific. Registration of
births is lower in rural areas than in
urban areas, for girls than for boys,
and for some minority groups.
Registration at birth and the
resulting legal identity may be
prerequisites for social participation
and inclusion. They could also
potentially be useful in efforts to
combat child labor and marriages
and trafficking of women and
children. ADB has initiated a study
to more clearly understand the
connection between proof of legal
identity and access to resources,
services, and opportunities, as well as
thelinks among economic development, inequality before the law, and
empowerment.

The most important resource for
the poor island. Cultivating land
remains the primary means of
sustenance for Asia’s rural poor,®
yet their access is often barred
physically or legally. This also
prevents them from accessing credit.
Several projects have addressed these
problems. In Cambodia where the
great majority of land is unregistered, ADB collaborated with the
Government in developing a land
law and a system for registration of
ownership. In Indonesia, legal
empowerment support in an
irrigation project is helping farmers
get better access to water (see bax on
page 16).

ADB is supporting several
microfinance and SME projects
throughout the region to improve
access to credit and to promote
entrepreneurship. For microfinance
services, this requires social
intermediation covering
(i) awareness building; (ii) disseminating information on service
providers; (iii) training in basic
literacy, numeracy, and skills; and

(iv) forming community-based
organizations and solidarity groups
to actively participate in markets.
Enhancing the capacity of the poor
to effectively manage microenterprises’ and service debts is critical
for sustainability. Several governments have sought ADB support in
the microfinance sector. A typical
example is the Microfinance Sector
Development Program in Pakistan
(seehttp:// www.adb/ org’ Documents!
profiley LOAN/ 29229013.agp).
improved functioning of the
labor market is crucial to efficient
market performance and growth.
The benefits of economic growth
cannot be maximized if enployees
do not have proper working
conditions and the right to fair
termination. ADB has provided
support to many DMCs in improving labor skills and training.® The
2001 Basic Skills Development
Project in Bhutan is one such project
(sehttp:// www.adb.org’ Documents!
Profiles LOAN/31317013.agp).

ADB's Social Protection Strategy
aims to hdp DMCs create supportive labor conditions. In Indonesia,
labor legislation provides help for
workers facing retrenchment asa
result of privatization. In Bhutan
and the Maldives, support for
employment legislation has been
provided. In Bhutan, Maldives, and
Pakistan, ADB also assisted in the
development and operation of a
labor administration systen. ADB
has promoted innovative approaches
to labor protection such as labor law
compliance strategies that include
self-reporting and self-inspection.

Rectifying Geographical Exclusions
and Imbalances

Left entirely to markets, growth and
development tend to agglomerate
resulting in spatial imbalance. In
several countries, ADB has focused
on the poorest, most isolated areas
through targeted interventions. In
the Philippines, Mindanao’s conflict
areas and poor ethnic minorities
have been the targets of the country
strategy and program. Other

disparities such as the PRC and
India are also considering areaspecific interventions.

In many cases, the absence of
effective transport links with the
economic mainstream has been the
primary constraint to balanced
development. ADB has supported
several transport strategy studies
and projects that helped to link lessdeveloped areas and hinterlands
with growth centers. An exampleis
the PRC Western Yunnan Roads
Development Project that supports
devedopment in poor western and
central regions of the country
(seehttp:// www.adb.org’ Documents!
ADBBO/ LOAN/ 32336013.agp).

In addition to infrastructure
investments, ADB also provides
macroeconomic policy support for
addressing regional disparities. An
example is recent technical
assistance to the Indonesian central
planning and devdopment agency
for decentralized management of
regional disparities. Often, lessdeveloped regions comprise renote
areas in different countries where
international boundaries have posed
significant constraints to trade and
infrastructure devdopment. DMCs
are addressing this with ADB
support through regional
cooperation.

Institutional Reforms for
Social Development

Lack of access to basic social services
has immense economic consequences,
and social stratification prevents
mobility of labor and skills, placing
constraints on production. It is
generally believed that the success of
the East Asian economies in the late
20'" century compared to other
areas in Asia rested significantly on
their ability to focus on widespread
social development °

Access to Basic Social Services
and Empowerment

ADB encourages a shift in domestic
policy and legislation to ensure
better access and enpowerment for
disadvantaged groups. A recent
project to improve decentralized

health services in Indonesia, for
example, focuses on strengthening
delivery of services used mainly by
the poor, by vulnerable groups, and
by women. The 1997 health sector
development program for Papua
New Guinea and the 2002 health
project for Cambodia are other
examples. The importance of
education, particularly basic
education, has been one of ADB’s
primary areas of support to its
DMCs. The possibility of changing
social mores through education
makes it an even more compelling
intervention.

Legal reforms including
constitutional provisions can also be
significant. India, for example, has a
policy of reservations for poor castes
and tribes in public sector enployment. India, Pakistan, and recently
Afghanistan have reserved seats for
women in local or national
parliaments. These are big steps
toward gender enpowerment.
Experience, however, shows that
mere legislation is not enough to
eiminate discrimination and that
the process of changing social mores
is long and slow.

Addressing Gender Exclusion

ADB has mainstreamed gender in its
operations since the 1980s to
improve the formal legal status of
women and to encourage their active
and equal participation in society."
Legal enpowerment has been a
major focus through training
judges, lawmakers, lawyers, court
officers, and law enforcement
personnel in gender awareness and
gender sensitization and through
support for legal aid offices and
women’s organizations that promote
women’s legal awareness and protect
their interests. The Governance
Reform Program for Nepal, for
example, recommended several
amendments to the civil service act
to increase the proportion of women
and to address the sociocultural
impediments to women’s career
advancement.

Supportive research and analysis
are critical to policy advocacy forgender mainstreaming. In Indonesia,
studies identified maternal mortality
and disadvantages in the labor
market as critical barriers to
women’s empowerment; the country
strategy incorporates a detailed
gender strategy and action plan to
address these problems. An ADB
loan to support capacity building of
regional governments following
decentralization requires the
devdopment of gender action plans
as an integral component. ADB is
monitoring these action plans to see
if significant improvements in
women’s participation result from
these efforts.

Another example of gender
mainstreaming is a health care
project in Bhutan where a number
of gender-sensitive policy reforms
were suggested. Similarly, Pakistan's
Access to Justice Project removes
barriers and encourages women to
enter the legal and judicial
professions. It also provides gender
sensitivity training for the judiciary
and the police and a legal empowerment fund to advocate the rights of
poor people and disadvantaged
groups, particularly women (see box

on page 21).

Support for Indigenous Peoples,
Bhnic Minorities, Bonded Laborers

ADB approved a strategy that
addresses both adoption of their
legal safeguards and rights as well as
measures to bring about lasting
changes in social values and
institutions (ge box). Concerns of
indigenous peoples are mainstreamed into projects implemented
in areas that have significant ethnic
minorities. For example, in the
Greater Mekong Subregion
Northern Economic Corridor
project, special efforts are under way
to ensure that the benefits reach
ethnic groups living there. Bonded
laborers are the focus of the Sindh
Rural Devdopment Project in
Pakistan. Reforms promoted by the
Project include greater transparency
for accounting of debts and
payments as well as civic education
on the rights of tenants.

Institutional Reforms for
Good Governance

Governance reforms are crucial for
inclusive devedopment. While ADB
provides a wide array of support for
introducing good governance
measures, important initiatives have
involved institutional changes that
improve bureaucratic responsiveness
and access to justice."

Improving Bureaucratic
Responsiveness

This requires a combination of
approaches. Internal activities focus
on performance standards and
incentives, rules of business, and the
framework for civil administration
including decentralization.
Administrative grievance mechanisms are also an essential dimension. Programs in Nepal and
Mongolia are examples. In Nepal,
the program helps the Government

develop its own internal capacity to
lead and undertake governance
reform. ADB has supported reform
in Mongolia since 1995 and has
helped with the adoption of the
Governance Reform Program with a
10-year roadmap (see box on page 20).
Likewise, the governments of the Fiji
Islands and Samoa have been
assisted to strengthen public
financial management and their
treasury and finance ministries.

Decentralization and devolution
can be important. Given its scale
and nature, Indonesia's program is
considered as one of the most
comprehensive attempts at
decentralization in the region. ADB
has supported it at all levels. ADB
was also extensively involved in all
aspects of the legal framework of
Pakistan’s devolution program and
worked particularly closdy on the
access to justice dimensions of the
program.

Proposed Nepal Gender Equality and
Empowerment of Women Project

ADB is currently working with the
Government of Nepal to formulate
the first loan focusing exclusively
on gender. The project envisages
improving the socioeconomic
conditions of poor rural women,
including ethnic and low-caste
women, through empowerment by
(i) strengthening their capabilities

to improve their access to and
control over assets; (ii) building
group support and solidarity to
undertake collective action to
engage, influence, and hold
institutions accountable; and
(iii) reforming government
institutions to include women in
development opportunities.

Indigenous Peoples and Ethnic Minorities

Indigenous peoples are regarded as
those with a social or cultural
identity distinct from that of the
mainstream society that makes them
vulnerable. Indigenous peoples
include cultural minorities, ethnic
minorities, indigenous cultural
communities, tribals, scheduled
tribes, natives, and aboriginals.
Under its 1998 Policy on Indigenous
Peoples, ADB pledged to work with
borrowing member countries to
support their capacity building and

institutional development to address
matters pertaining to indigenous
peoples.

The First Indigenous Peoples
Forum conducted in Thailand in 2001
endorsed ADB's policy and institutional guidelines. Providing basic
services addresses problems of
physical delivery in remote regions,
of adapting services to indigenous
needs, and of providing credit and
financial services in the context of
communal tenure.

QMongolia: Public Sector Financial Management Law

Mongolia is divided into a large
number of administrative jurisdictions
that are managed by over 6,000
budgetary bodies. The government
sector is larger than that in other
comparable transition economies
with current expenditures at over
70% of total expenditures. Until the
end of 2002, provincial governors
negotiated their budgets directly
with the Ministry of Finance and
Economy, and district governors
negotiated with provincial governors. This system led to significant
expenditure over-runs and overall
fiscal deficits in the mid-1990s. In
addition, there were concerns about
accountability at local levels all of
which generated a sense of urgency
to institute reforms to achieve fiscal
responsibility, transparency, and
accountability.

20 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

The enactment of the Law in
June 2002 was a milestone in
macroeconomic reforms. It aims to
integrate strategic planning at all
levels with budget formulation
and execution while infusing
budgetary discipline through
enhanced accountability and
transparency in the determination
and the utilization of funds. The
law defines fiscal and operational
relations within the different
executive branches of the government at various levels and between the executive and the
elected representatives of the
public. Further, it requires the
Supreme Audit Agency to undertake certification audits of the
financial statement audits of all
budgetary bodies and state-owned
enterprises.

Strengthening Enforcement
Capacity for Justice and Access
to Information

Considerable work has been
undertaken to improve access to
justice. The strongest argument in
support of formal legal systems is
that courts are the ultimate
enforcers, and implementation of
judgments spawns all sorts of less
formal and informal bargaining and
agreements. Alternative institutions
to resolve disputes have their place
but operate with weak enforcement
capacities."* Such institutions, in
fact, can only be effective in the
shadow of a well-functioning formal
legal order as is evident, for
example, from the fact that arbitral
awards ultimately rely on the
enforcement power of the state
through courts.

Preference and value given to
formal legal systems have been
confirmed by public opinion surveys
like the ADB-Asia Foundation study
in Pakistan. Thus, fixing the formal
system is likely to bea strategic,
popular intervention. ADB also
funded surveys to ascertain the
perspectives of litigants and wouldbe litigants and carried out case-file
analyses. Of various access to justice
projects, the onein Pakistan was the
earliest and provided valuable insights
for later interventions (seebox).

Regional interventions includea
study on judicial independence and
assistance to the Philippine judiciary
to strengthen its independence and
enhance its accountability. Other
studies include strengthening the
commercial division of thejudiciary
in the Lao PDR and widespread
regional interventions to combat
corruption and to enhance international security through anti-money
laundering legislation and training.

Credibleinformation and easy
access to it are most important for
creating an environment in which
citizens may act and public
institutions may become more
responsive to citizens’ needs. Since
1997, ADB has assisted policymakers
and others engaged in legal reformin its DMCs through the Devedopment of the Internet for Asian Law
project. This Project assisted the
creation and development of the
World Legal Information Institute’?
and is the largest collection of freely
accessible legal databases on the
Internet. ADB supports the
publication of annual reports, court
decisions, budgetary information
about the courts, and legal literacy/
citizen information kiosks in
Pakistan. Draft legislation for
freedom of information has also
been prepared. In Nepal, ADB is
assisting the Government to develop
alegal information center to provide
access to supreme court cases and to
laws, amendments, and consolidations through a publicly accessible,
easy-to-navigate web site. The result

will be a one-stop legal information
center. Empirical data on case
management and disposition times
will also be available. In Tajikistan, a
database of over 5,000 legal acts has
been created and is expected to be
on the Internet in the near future.

Promoting Inclusion at
the Global Level

Inclusive development also requires
that countries do not face exclusion
at the global level. People everywhere
must be able to participate in the
general prosperity associated with
globalization though there must
also be protection from its external
shocks and other drawbacks.
Globalization opens up
opportunities for developing
countries for optimal use of

Pakistan Access to Justice Project

The Project pursues five inter-related
governance objectives: (i) providing
a legal basis for judicial, policy, and
administrative reforms, (ii) increasing
the efficiency, timeliness, and
effectiveness of judicial and police
services; (iii) supporting greater
equity and accessibility in justice
services for the poor and the
vulnerable; (iv) improving predictability and consistency between
fiscal and human resource allocation
and the mandates of reformed
judicial and police institutions in
federal, provincial, and local governments; and (v) ensuring greater
transparency and accountability in
the performance of the judiciary, the
police, and justice institutions.

The system aims to create
opportunities for a large body of
stakeholders (including authorities,
citizens, and civil society) to monitor
and evaluate activities. Early results
from the Project include a reduction
in delays in courts, improvement in
judicial performance monitoring and
merit rewards, and a judicial
grievance procedure.

Reduction in Delays. In the
North West Frontier Province (NWFP)

there have been striking reductions
in the number of court cases
pending. In the High Court based in
Peshawar, the number of cases
disposed of in 2002 increased by
222% over those in 2001. Across all
three benches of the High Court,
there was an overall reduction in
total cases pending by the end of
2002 of 35% over 2001. In the highvolume district courts, the improvements were even more striking; they
disposed of 77% more cases in 2002
than 2001.

Performance Monitoring and
Rewarding Merit. Inspection teams in
the district judiciary monitor performance and investigate complaints.
For the first time, the teams inspected
all courts in NWFP and assessed the
performance of justices. A policy was
established that provided a monetary
reward to judges on the basis of their
performance.

Grievance Procedures. The
procedures for citizens to lodge
complaints against a member of the
judiciary were advertised in the
newspapers. The teams received 864
complaints during July-December
2002.

resources and economies of scale.
Countries that facilitate the
functioning of global firms and
participate in a high value-added
link of the global supply chain can
reap its benefits (eg., Indian and
Philippine software firms which
provide services for multinational
software companies).

Another aspect of globalization
is movement of labor. The movement of workers from job-scarce
settings to those with more
employment opportunities can also
make significant contributions to
private and national prosperity.
Remittances from workers abroad
constitute an important share of
foreign exchange earnings for many
countries; in fact, in terms of
financial flows to devdoping
countries, remittances are now more
than two and a half times as much
as annual official development
assistance.

ADB pursues inclusive globalization. Considerable assistance has
been provided to DMCs to
modernize domestic institutions to
participate more effectively in the
global marketplace while also
safeguarding and promoting the
interests of smaller economies and
the weaker sections of society to
avoid exacerbating inequality.
ADB's Social Protection Strategy
specifically addresses this problem
(see http:// www.adb.org/ Sodal Proteotion/ drat.ago). ADB has also
attempted to influence international
institutions to strengthen the
region’s capacity in handling
globalization and to address
geographical exclusions through
regional cooperation. One of ADB’s
major efforts to promote global
inclusiveness is its special attention
to hdping the Pacific nations to
increase their links to the global
economy (sse box on page 22).

ADB has supported inclusive
globalization by promoting stable
macroeconomic and prudent
financial policies and by supporting
foreign direct investment. In this
context, labor issues have been
important. The proper functioning

Remoteness and dispersion, small
populations, and limited resource
bases combine to limit the ability of
the Pacific developing member
countries (DMCs) to compete in
world markets. They are also
vulnerable to global shocks due to
their narrow production and export
bases, high import dependence, and
susceptibility to natural disasters.
Difficulties in developing and
implementing market-friendly
policies and institutions have led to
high transaction costs, low efficiency
of public investment, and weak
private sector development. Weak
governance institutions and poor
social development outcomes add to
their problems.

ADB support includes
microcredit, legal and institutional
reform, diversification in production,
and macroeconomic management.
Since the mid-1990s ADB has

supported public sector, governance, and economic reforms in

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

most of the Pacific DMCs. Support for
economic diversification has gone to
agro-industrial and small and
medium enterprise development
including identification of alternative
livelihoods. ADB has also commenced
work to increase the participation of
the poor in policy and program
formulation and to strengthen
accountability of governments. A
new study is strengthening understanding of appropriate social
protection policies and programs to
address the needs of the poor.

In 2003, ADB took a major step by
preparing its first Regional Cooperation
Strategy and Program for the Pacific.
Interventions have included support for
the establishment of a Pacific aviation
safety office and technical advice on
joint negotiating arrangements to
maximize returns from deepwater fish
harvesting. ADB is also exploring a
regional approach to providing costeffective information and communication technology.

of labor markets depends on labor
laws that allow entrepreneurs
flexibility in increasing or reducing
the labor force and in setting wages,
and policies that improve labor
productivity and devdopment of
skills. Many DMCs need assistance
in modernizing labor legislation as
well asin improving skills and
safeguards. ADB supports these
measures in collaboration with other
devdopment partners.

The Pakistan Trade, Export
Promotion, and Industry Program is
a comprehensive attempt to improve
institutions. Another example is the
Indonesia Industrial Competitiveness and SME Devdopment
Program loan that has striven to
promote foreign investments. A
follow-up loan (the SME Export
Development Project) has specifically
attempted to bring the SME sector
into the global mainstream by
providing assistance for modernization and export facilitation.

ADB has also played an
important role in helping governments cope with the rigors and
downturns of globalization,
particularly in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis. The best examples
are the programs in Indonesia and
Thailand—two of the worst affected
countries.Regional Institutional Arrangements
and Regional Cooperation

Calls for ADB to play amore
proactive rolein this effort have
become more emphatic since the
Asian financial crisis. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) Free Trade Area was
implemented in 2002 much ahead
of the original target of 2008. The
ASEAN summit in Bali in October
2003 agreed to eventual extension of
the free trade area to include PRC,
India, Japan, and Republic of Korea.
A consensus among the Asia and
Pacific countries has emerged to
establish a broader institutional
arrangement for cooperation,
extending beyond trade to financial
and monetary areas. Better
utilization of the vast savings of the
region as a cheaper and more stable
alternative to international financial
markets is one area of focus.
Another is the need to strengthen
monitoring systems to provide early
warning of financial volatility and
threats to DMCs.

ADB established a regional
monitoring unit in 1999 and set up
an Asia Recovery Information Center
and web site (http:// www.adb.org!
REMU/aric.agp) soon after that has
been providing useful information
on high-frequency economic,
financial, and social indicators. To
preempt future financial crises,
technical assistance has been
provided for the establishment of
national surveillance units in
countries and for strengthening
their capacity for detecting energing
macroeconomic, financial, and
corporate vulnerabilities. A study
outlined modalities of monetary and
financial cooperation including
multilateral ASEAN swap agreements and transitional arrangements toward a single currency in
thelong term. An important new
step is the Asian Bond Market
Initiative. ADB has helped this
initiative by strengthening networking among Asian domestic credit
rating agencies. The Asian Bonds

Online web site is expected soon (see
http:// www.adb.org’ Documents! Profiles!
GRNT/38080012.agp).

Regional cooperation addresses
the needs of countries that could
gain substantially by facilitating
movement across international
boundaries."* These initiatives
include the Greater Mekong
Subregion Economic Cooperation
Program as well as the Central Asia
Regional Economic Cooperation, the
Brune Darussalam-IndonesiaMalaysia-Philippines East ASEAN
Growth Area, the South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation,
the Central and South Asia
Transport and Trade Forum, and
the Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia.

  

Concl

 

Ui je r tne ruture
The Asia and Pacific region has
developed a large skill base and the
capacity to harness new technology,
adapt it, and generate more. It has a
growing potential to reach new
markets inside and outside its
boundaries. An unprecedented
nearly $2 trillion in foreign exchange
reserves provide new vigor to pursue
development goals. Such a
confluence of development factors is
aunique historical opportunity.
DMCs must ensure that the benefits
of prosperity help improve the lives
of all. Inclusive devedopment must
be pursued vigorously; legal reforms
and institutions have a critical role
in this pursuit.

What is clear is that there is no
one path to inclusive development;
each DMC needs to devise its own
course and fully tailor and own its
institutional reform agenda.
Nevertheless, there are some general
principles that experience and
analysis suggest transcend the
particular.

Accelerating Economic Growth
in an Inclusive Environment

As the experience of the East Asian
economies and the PRC demon
strates, rapid economic growth
provides the essential wherewithal
for reducing poverty. At the same
time, the sudden escalation of
poverty levels in the wake of the
Asian financial crisis demonstrated
that unless broad-based, the benefits
of growth can be fleeting, especially
for vulnerable groups. To make
economic growth the most effective
and enduring engine for inclusive
development, excluded groups must
fully participate in and meaningfully
benefit from it. Legal and institutional reforms must provide new
channels through which those who
have been historically left behind
can overcome their individual and
common predicament.

In aglobal economy where
education, particularly higher
education, is increasingly becoming
the arbiter of competitive success,
educational opportunities must be
expanded at levels not tried before.
Barriers to labor mobility must be
addressed to ensure best returns.
Social protection such as minimum
wage, old age pensions, disability
insurance, and adequate health
services will help make graduation
from poverty a sustained
achievement.

Calibrating Laws and
Building Institutions

As the speed of change accelerates,
the role and nature of institutions
and laws must also adapt to take
advantage of newly available
opportunities, to withstand new
threats, and to overcome persistent
problens. Country after country in
the region has adapted institutional
and legal frameworks in the face of
crises, but the cost of crisis-led
reform is often high. The region’s
prospects will be improved if reforms
anticipate demands and pave the way
for changes. With greater movement
of people, goods, capital, and even
communicable diseases across
boundaries, thereis an urgent need
to realign frameworks to maximize
the benefits and minimize the
consequences of new opportunities.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 23

WUOJaY JEUO!INY!ISU| PUe METStrengthening Governance

The challenge of creating economic
prosperity in a hugely competitive
and increasingly more open global
system imbues governance
institutions and markets with new,
complex responsibilities. Their
capacity and effectiveness have a
direct impact on the prospects for
prosperity. The failure of the state
to create and sustain robust public
institutions will deter economic
growth and will disable attempts to
achieve inclusive development.
Investments in good governance
need to bean integral part of
poverty reduction strategies.

Regional Cooperation

and Convergence

While Asia's great diversity does not
easily lend itself to wholesale
application of best practices,

experiences in the region do suggest
some common principles. Countries
must learn from each other and
must recognize how common
principles are at work in each
context. More efforts will have to go
to reducing barriers to learning and
sharing of experiences for ultimately,
regional convergence in policies,
practices, and institutional norms
will sour greater economic
cooperation, peace, and stability.

Pursuing Inclusive Globalization

While the merits of economic
globalization continue to be debated,
thereisno denying the greater
integration of the global economy.
Asia as a whole has greatly benefited
from its early engagement. As the
structure of global trade changes
because of technological innovation
and other factors, globalization will
present new challenges. Working

together with devdopment partners,
the region must be prepared to seek
and to realize every opportunity, to
anticipate changes and to adjust
national economic directions to meet
them. To the extent economic
globalization creates new vulnerabilities, both the countries and the
region as a whole must be prepared
to detect them early on and to take
protective measures. The state, civil
society, and markets will play a
central role in these efforts.

The region faces the twin
challenges of (i) strengthening state
capacity for development effectiveness, and (ii) enhancing the legal
and institutional framework
through which state action is
bounded by legitimacy, commitment
to inclusive devedopment, and
fairness. Reforming laws and
institutions can be a catalyst for
meeting these challenges.

24 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKDB took several steps
toward greater organizational effectiveness in 2003.
A Board and Management
retreat on the topic led
ADB closer to adopting a
results-based management system
that will allow it to better gauge its
development effectiveness.

There was a clearer focus on
objectives and monitoring and on
moving toward the targets of the
Millennium Development Goals.

Further delegation of responsibilities to resident missions under
the Resident Mission Policy and the
reorganization and changes in
business processes improved ADB's
country focus and led to clearer
lines of accountability. Progress was
made on integrating performance
considerations in operations and in
updating country strategies and
programs, including a stronger
emphasis on benchmarking,
measuring, monitoring, and
reporting.

A new Vice-President was
appointed to oversee knowledge
management and sustainable
development, bringing the total to
four. In addition, a new position was
created for a Managing Director
General to coordinate the work of
senior management. At the staff
level, there was increased emphasis
on merit, results, and productivity.
Work began on anew human
resource strategy to reflect these
changes.

ADB also continued its
partnerships for development by
coordinating priorities with other
multilateral devdopment banks
(MDBs) and by working more
closely with civil society. The HighLevel Forum on Harmonization had
in Romein 2003 set out principles
to harmonize procedures and
processes in environmental impact
assessments, safeguards, procurement, financial and portfolio
management, and public expenditure reviews. Finally, key milestones
for enhancing organizational and
business processes were identified:
complete the independent

 

Institutional
Effectivenessassessment of the reorganization;
finalize the agenda for organizational
improvement and stability; and
continue to refine, consolidate, and
stabilize the processes throughout
ADB.

Streamlining
Organizational
and Business
Processes

Within the context of the first
Medium-Term Strategy 2001-2005
of the Long-Term Strategic
Framework 2001-2015, ADB
implemented major structural and
systemic changes aimed at maximizing its effectiveness as a development partner. ADB’s inherent
advantage—that it is physically close
to its devedoping member countries
(DMCs)—has been enhanced
through an expanded regional and
resident mission network and the
country-focused structure of the
organization. New business
processes support this structure
with greater enphasis on delegating
responsibilities and on strengthening team-based approaches. To
maximize effectiveness, ADB aims to
ensure that (i) programs and
projects are of high quality from
their inception, (ii) people and the
environment are safe from adverse
impacts of proposed operations,
(iii) standards for portfolio
performance are high, and
(iv) results and impacts are
objectively measured and lessons
learned are properly gauged and fed
back into the development process.
Quality assurance mechanisms
must meet the highest standards.
ADB continued to streamline quality
review to enhance the value added
by sector and thematic committee
contributions to important
crosscutting areas such as gender,
governance, and social development.
These efforts aim to improve the
quality of analytical and diagnostic
work, policy dialogue, and project

26 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

and program design. In addition,
ADB continued to emphasize and to
improve economic analysisin policy
formulation and in program and
project design.

All programs and projects
complied with the institution’s
rigorous environmental and social
safeguards. Legal services reinforced
the quality of ADB operations by
focusing on due diligence, structuring, documentation, and negotiation
of ADB's public and private sector
lending, guarantee, and equity
operations. Policy compliance
requirements were scrutinized
during project preparation and
administration and were reflected in
the transaction documents.

While DMCs are primarily
responsible for implementing
interventions, ADB was actively
engaged as a supportive partner.
During implementation, monitoring
compliance with safeguards
continued particularly at critical
junctures. Portfolio management
was increasingly shared between
headquarters and the regional
offices and resident missions,
allowing for intensified in-country
cooperation with stakeholders and
improved monitoring of operations,
both key dements for successful
implementation.

ADB enhanced its monitoring
systems to track and analyze the
performance of individual loan and
grant-financed projects, increasing
emphasis on monitoring and
measuring results and impacts. The
project performance reporting
system for loan-financed projects
was expanded to (i) cover records of
major issues, problems, actions
taken, design changes, and ratings;
and (ii) extend DMC access to the
information in the project performance report. A technical assistance
performance reporting system was
pilot tested in 2003 and will be
operational in early 2004.

A review in the first half of 2003
of ADB's 2002 reorganization
concluded that disruption to ADB's
operations and deliverables was
minimal and that DMCs benefited

from the single operational focal
point provided by theintegration of
programs and projects at the
department level. The review noted
that while ADB's capacity to ddiver
its strategic agenda had improved,
this could be strengthened further. It
also noted that changed management initiatives may not have been
as effective as expected and that
institutional work arrangements and
environment and incentive structures
need to be resolved.

The review identified several
areas that required attention—the
span of control of directors in some
of the larger sector divisions, the
distribution of assignments among
sector divisions and regional
departments, and quality assurance
mechanisms in the Regional and
Sustainable Development Department. The issue of control in large
sector divisions in the South Asia
and the East and Central Asia
departments was resolved. Some
regional departments and the
Regional and Sustainable Development Department addressed the
necessary distribution and balance
of work through a change in mix of
skills and redeployment, and options
to enhance quality assurance
mechanisms were considered. An
independent assessment of the
effectiveness of the reorganization
will be undertaken in 2004.

Mobilizing Human
Resources and
Budget

Human resource programs and
activities continued to focus on
attracting, retaining, and motivating
highly qualified staff. In addition to
offering competitive salaries on
appointment, ADB formalized the
outsourcing of background checks
for senior and other sensitive
positions. Vacancies were posted on
web sites targeting international
devedopment specialists specifically
those with skillsin social protection,
social devdopment, private sectordevelopment, derivatives, transport,
renewable energy, and project/
operationsadministration.

Based on theinterventions
identified by a study of human
resource challenges,’ ADB completed
its self-review and identified 10
priorities (see box). Of these, the
Gender Action Program II, staff
participation in selection and
promotion panels (6-month trial
basis), and the revision of the Staff
Service and Exemplary Performance
Recognition Program were approved
and implemented. A review of the
current performance management
system was conducted. Behavioral,
cultural, and structural changes in
managing and conducting the
present system were recommended
to senior management and to ADB's
Staff Council and were the basis for
workshops with staff.

Training and development
activities focused on providing
opportunities for staff to align their
skills with the desired mix under the
new organizational structure and
business processes. Alternative
dedivery methods were used to
expand audience numbers and
access to training programs by a
wider range of staff especially in the
resident missions. An operations

tool kit was launched, providing a
one-stop source on policies,
strategies, procedures, and business
processes.

ADB continued to subsidize
postgraduate studies, membership in
professional associations, and the
ADB-Ateneo* Masters in Business
Administration Program and also
provided capacity-building initiatives
such as the Orientation Program for
Developing Member Country
Officials, the Secondment Program,
and the Internship Program.

At the end of the year, ADB had
a staff of 2,311 representing 51 of
its 63 members. The total comprised
836 professional staff? 356 national
officers, and 1,119 administrative
staff,4 of which 362° or about 15.7%
were located in the fidd offices.
There were 89 appointments and
47° departures of professional staff
members, while 110 national officers
and administrative staff joined ADB
and 59” left. The number of women
professional staff increased from
217 (27.3%o0f the total professional
staff) at the end of 2002, to 241
(28.8%) at the end of 2003.

ADB provided regular services to
staff members to ensure optimum
staff welfare, fundamental to
developing, updating, and retaining

Human Resource Management Priority Interventions

* Establish a competency system
to support personnel decisions
including selection, performance
management, and career
development.

+ Implement a job rotation system
for national officers and administrative staff to enrich their work
experiences.

+ Enhance the performance
management system to ensure
adequate feedback and to make
meaningful distinctions among
individual staff performances.

+ Implement the Gender Action
Program as part of ADB's diversity
framework.

+ Implement leadership development and talent management

programs to strengthen capabilities
of senior staff.

+ Revise the staff recognition
program to promote meritocracy
and to reward performance.

+ Implement a one-Bank policy for
resident/regional missions and
representative offices to ensure
consistent application of human
resource management.

* Establish accountability and
transparency in the recruitment and
selection system.

+ Initiate a balanced work-life
program for an improved work
environment.

+ Review personnel guidelines to
improve clarity and ease of access
by staff.

the core competencies that are
needed to deliver ADB's increasingly
complex work program.

An ADB-wide survey to ascertain
and better gauge staff perception of
the overall working environment, as
well as a review of professional staff
job offer rejections® was completed.
The survey noted that staff morale
was an issue that ADB needed to
address. Work on a human resource
strategy was begun.

Security was a primary consideration as was the health of staff. ADB
provided regular advisories on severe
acute respiratory syndrome, took
appropriate measures for staff
members health, and maintained
close coordination with medical
representatives from the World
Health Organization and various
embassies in Manila.

Consistent with ADB's marketdriven compensation system, a 4.2%
weighted average increase in
professional staff salaries was
approved in 2003 (effective
1 January 2004). For local staff at
headquarters, the salary survey for
2003 resulted in a 10.1%weighted
average salary increase effective
1 January 2003. An overall weighted
average salary increase of 9.3%for
local staff in 19 fidld offices was also
implemented.

The existing compensation and
benefits package for professional
staff in the fidd offices was
monitored and revised as necessary.
The mandatory and optional life
and disability insurance plans were
rebid and renewed.

Significantly, ADB was the first
MDB to get ISO 14001 and OHSAS
18001 certification.°

Internal Administrative
Budget

Actual internal administrative
expenses for 2003 amounted to
$252.6 million, a utilization rate of
98%for a savings of $6.1 million
against the original budget of
$258.7 million. The budget for 2004
amounts to $279.5 million,
including a general contingency of

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 27 |1% (summarized in Appendix 8). The
increase over the 2003 revised
estimate is 8.3% largely due to
further increases in ADB's
contribution to the Staff Retirement
Plan, implementation of the
accountability mechanism and antimoney laundering policies, the cost
of new resident missions, increased
depreciation charges, and securityrelated costs. The overall price increase
is estimated at 5.1% while the net
volume increase is about 3.2%

Priorities to be funded by the 2004
budget include implementing new
Board-approved policies and
mandates, expanded work programs
and portfolios of regional departments, increased activity in private
sector operations, compliance-rdated
legal services, the managing-for-results
initiative, and an action plan for the
knowledge management framework.

In addition to internal administrative expenses, the 2004 budget
also includes an annual capital
budget of $4.85 million covering,
among others, security-related
capital expenditures at the resident
missions and technology-redated
infrastructure/ systems consolidation
and updates.

Assuring
Development
Impact

ADB has made significant progress
in integrating performance
considerations into its operations.
Improved use of project evaluation
results and project performance
management systems is hdlping to
create better designed and better
targeted interventions.

Reorganization of OED

The Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) assesses projects,
policies, and procedures to account
for the use of resources, to provide
lessons for future operations, and to
sustain activities already completed.

28 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Evaluation criteria are relevance,
efficacy, efficiency, sustainability,
and impact. Evidence presented in
2003 showed that since 1989 the
success rate of individual operations
and of most sectors and countries
has been increasing (see the Annual
Review of Evaluation Adivitiesin 2002
at http:// www.adb.org Documents
PERs RPE_OTH_2003_12.pdf).
During 2003, OED completed

38 reports including 22 project and
program performance audits,

6 technical assistance reports,

2 country assistance program
evaluations, 6 special and impact
evaluations, and 2 annual reports.

In December 2003, the Board
approved a set of recommendations
to further enhance the independence
and effectiveness of OED. The
following changes that came into
effect on 1 January 2004 brought
OED to acomparable position with
evaluation unitsin other multilateral
development finance institutions.

(i) OED will report directly to
the Board through the Devdopment
Effectiveness Committee (Committee).

(ii) The Director General of OED
(Director) will be appointed by the
Board upon the joint recommendation via the Committee of the Board
and the President.

(iii) OED will have fuller
autonomy in selecting its staff; the
final selection of OED personna
will be made by the Director in
consultation with the Budget,
Personnd and Management Systems
Department in accordance with
ADB human resource policies and
procedures.

(iv) The annual work program of
OED prepared in consultation with
the Committee and the President
will be approved by the Board.

(v) Within the overall ADB-wide
budgetary framework, the Director in
consultation with the Committee and
the Budge, Personnd and Management Systems Department will
prepare an annual budget proposal for
OED which will be presented by the
President for consideration and
approval of the Board in a separate
resource envelope.

(vi) Completed evaluation
reports will be circulated by the
Director simultaneously to
Management and to the Board for
their response. Disclosure of reports,
which will be authorized by the
Director, may include as attachments Management’s response,
OED’s comments on it, and a
summary of discussions by the
Committee.

Corresponding changes in
practices rating to work program
and budget and to circulation and
disclosure of reports will be
instituted during 2004 based on
continued engagement with
operations and other departments.
OED’s role will be guided by the
principles of usefulness and
timeiiness and of disengagement.
The first principle requires OED to
use lessons identified in evaluations in
reviewing the design of future projects
and to provide timdy and useful
inputs to current operations. The
second principle requires that OED
maintain an arm’slength rdationship
from day-to-day operational decisions.
OED will continue to have unfettered
access to all rdevant ADB records and
information.

Project and Program
Performance
Audit Reports

Most public sector projects and
programs evaluated in 2003 were
completed in 1999. Of the 22,

16 were rated successful or higher.
None was rated unsuccessful.
Seventeen confirmed the ratings
given in completion reports, and five
were reclassified. The economic
infrastructure sectors continued to
record the highest success rates. Five
(62%) of eight programs were
successful compared with an average
of 30% over the last 5 years.Twenty-four technical assistance
projects for capacity building and
advisory studies attached to these
projects’ programs were also
evaluated. Of the 21 that were rated,
11 were successful or better, 8 were
partly successful, and 2 were
unsuccessful.

Five programs involved financial
sector reform. Three were successful,
including in particular a strong
commitment by the Government of
Viet Nam to sustain positive impacts
of financial sector reform. The
Agriculture Sector Program in
Cambodia, the first for the country,
removed some key constraints
including the passage of a land law.
The Public Sector Reform Program
in the Federated States of
Micronesia was successful and
helped restore fiscal balance to the
country.

Of the 14 projects evaluated,

2 (14%) were rated highly successful,
9 (64%) successful, and 3 (22%)
partly successful. The highly
successful Dalian Water Supply
Project in the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) confirmed that
commitment at the local government level is an essential factor for
SUCCESS.

Special and Impact
Evaluation Studies

A special study was undertaken on
financial cost recovery in the power
sector in 14 DMCs during the
1990s. ADB's contribution was
assessed in part through the record
of compliance with financial
covenants by 42 power utilities that
received 69 loans totaling $9.2 billion during 1990-2001.

The principle of financial cost
recovery in the power sector is that
revenues from electricity sales
should fully recover operational
expenses and depreciation and
should generate a reasonable return
on the capital invested. The three
key criteria for evaluating cost
recovery were (i) cost minimization,
(ii) tariff setting, and (iii) revenue
collection efficiency. Performancein
three countries was satisfactory; in
five countries was unsatisfactory;
and in six countries was tolerable.
The review of compliance with
covenants showed an overall average
compliance rate of 61% ADB is
(i) moving away from further
lending to utilities that arein
chronic default of covenants;

(ii) assisting DMCs to create new

Project Performance Management in ADB

and in Projects in DMCs

The purpose of the study was to
identify what if any changes should
be made in the short to medium
term to enhance the efficiency,
quality, and use of ADB's project
performance management system.
The system comprises five elements:
(i) the framework, which specifies
performance targets and indicators;
(ii) the performance report; (iii) the
completion report; (iv) audit reports;
and (v) executing agency monitoring
and evaluation.

The study concluded that ADB
had made substantial progress in
developing and adopting specific
processes for project performance
management; however, several
challenges were identified,

particularly on the specification and
measurement of the achievement
of development objectives. The
quality of project frameworks, the
basis for the whole system, was
identified as a key area for improvement. The quality of monitoring
data in the project performance
report also needed significant
improvement. Standardization of
terminology, updating of guidelines,
mandatory preparation of a
preliminary project framework early
on, and strengthening of borrower
monitoring and evaluation were
proposed. The Working Group on
Project Performance Management
was recalled and a detailed action
plan was devised.

institutions with a more businesslike approach to utility management; and (iii) shifting away from
project lending to utilities to
program lending to governments for
improving the sector policy
environment.

Many countries are moving in
the direction of sector reforms
involving independent regulatory
bodies, unbundling the sector by
function, and establishing a
competitive wholesale market for
electricity. ADB should assist
integrated utilities to unbundle their
utility tariffs and to organize their
business units by function.
Commercialization should ensure
that unbundled tariffs are at full
cost-recovery levels.

Two studies in particular yielded
valuable lessons for future ADB
assistance in the power sector.
Assistance to Bangladesh over the
last 30 years comprised 16 public
sector loans and 1 private sector
investment for a total of $1.1 billion
as well as 19 technical assistance
grants totaling $8.8 million. Lessons
learned include the need to
(i) minimize extensive delays in
implementation; (ii) improve local
capacities in project preparation,
implementation, and operation and
selection of appropriate technology;
(iii) improve ownership of technical
assistance; (iv) improve financial
management capacities; and

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 29 |(v) avoid use of project phasing to
finance a change such as improving
financial systems. At the strategic
leva, akey lesson was that ADB's
approach to sector reform, which is
based on piloting change and
learning by doing, facilitated change
whereit took place through the
success of individual projects and
newly created entities.

A study of the impact of power
assistance in Indonesia since 1980
provided further guidance for future
operations. The conclusion was that
conventional lending operations had
significant, positive impacts on the
development of power systems and
on socioeconomic and institutional
development but that sector reform
assistance had not been as
successful.

Evaluations in the water and
forestry sectors proved equally
valuable for guiding future
operations. A special evaluation
analyzed participatory processes in
six projects in three DMCs. The
conclusion was that participatory
approaches had added value to
natural resource management
project design, implementation, and
operation and if applied effectively
could increase ownership and
sustainability. Environmental
outcomes were almost universally
positive. Comanagement was optimal
for forests to ensure benefits to local
communities. Participation offered
major benefitsin rural income and
poverty reduction through improved
resource planning and management
and through promoting interaction
of the poor with the community,
enhancing their sense of worth and
self-esteem.

ADB provided $73 million of
assistance in loans and grants to
build capacity in several water
utilities in Pacific DMCs. The
projects provided valuable lessons.

(i) Setting up boards of directors
with the right composition was a
good first step but needed to be
complemented with training.

(ii) Introducing performancebased principles did not ensure that
the data were actually used in

30 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

decision making and that actions
were taken when performance fell
short of targets.

(iii) Efforts to change operational
procedures were effective only if the
utility, its management, and its staff
took full ownership of necessary
changes.

(iv) All stakeholders had to
support plans to incorporate to
build politically acceptable
solutions, to increase transparency,
and to ensure sustained implenentation of institutional changes.

In general the conclusion was
that ADB's capacity-building
approach needed to change.
Systematic institutional diagnostics
should be undertaken jointly before
a decision is made on the areas and
direction of change. A medium-term
strategy for capacity building should
be developed, providing a framework
for continuous assistance with
interim milestones. Terms of
reference of consultants need to be
changed to give greater enphasis to
capacity-building roles.

Country Assistance
Program Evaluations

Papua New Guinea

The evaluation focused on three
central issues: reforming the
machinery of government, managing
the dual economy, and delivering
public services. Projects, the main
assistance tool, were generally
successful in producing outputs but
did not generate significant or
sustained impacts. Sector performance did not improve and
contributions to promoting
economic growth, particularly in
rural areas, were overshadowed by
declining international commodity
prices, the Asian financial crisis,
economic downturns, deteriorating
law and order, and periodic
droughts. Improvements to service
delivery were lacking largely due to
weaknesses in resource transfers and
the absence of qualified staff.
Projects tended to work in isolation
rather than form an integrated

country program with a clear
strategic devdopment goal.

There is a need to focus on a
development agenda that creates
jobs and addresses law and order, on
managing debt and changing public
resource management to avoid
perpetual financial crises, and on
building capacity in public
administration.

Cambodia

ADB resumed operations in
Cambodia in 1992 and has played a
leading rolein its recent devdopment. Assistance was guided by
three country strategy documents
that emphasized poverty reduction;
however, Cambodia renains poor
with only limited economic
opportunities in tourism and
garment exports.

The strategies were generally
responsive to the needs of the
country but could have placed
greater emphasis on improved
governance and on more diverse
private sector devdopment. The
program has adapted over time to
incorporate operations with a
greater impact on the poor.

Portfolio performance was good
(above the ADB average) though
overall there were some weaknesses.
The substantial resources contributed
for capacity building were focused
on training specific individuals
rather than on the effective
functioning of institutions asa
whole. Coordination of external
assistance proved difficult in light of
the complex government structure
and inadequate harmonization of
programs across agencies.

Implications for the future are
(i) ways need to be found to induce
investment and to generate financial
resources for the Government;

(ii) some reduction in sector coverage
would be beneficial with continued
focus on governance issues;

(iii) coordination of Government and
external resources needs to be
improved; and (iv) a broader
approach to capacity building that
will reduce dependence on external
assistance should be adopted.Technical Assistance
Performance Audit
Reports

In the 6 audit reports, 30 technical
assistance activities were evaluated:
2 were rated highly successful ,

17 successful, 7 partly successful,
and 1 unsuccessful. Three were
ongoing and therefore not rated.

Environmental Issues in the PRC

Seven technical assistance projects,
both completed and ongoing,
addressed needs in all key areas of
environmental management and
capacity building at the central,
provincial, and municipal levels.
Technical assistance to establish the
Center for the Transfer of Environmentally Sound Technology, to
improve environmental management
in Shaanxi Province, to formulate
provincial legislation on environmental protection and natural
resources conservation, and to
provide leadership training on urban
environmental management in key
cities achieved their objectives.

The evaluation identified some
important lessons for each stage of a
technical assistance cycle. Their
essence is how best to meet the
needs of the Government rather
than perceived needs or the needs of
ADB. Several projects were more
supply driven than client oriented.
One technical assistance project was
rated highly successful, two
successful, and one partly successful.

Pension Reform

Five technical assistance projects
totaling $4.4 million were approved
between November 1997 and
December 1999 to promote pension
reform in Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia, Thailand, and Uzbekistan. Two—those in Bangladesh and
Thailand—were attached to capital
market development programs. A
common feature was that pension
reform was seen primarily through
development of domestic capital
markets rather than as a means of
providing income for the vulnerable.

The assumption that pension
reform will promote long-term
domestic capital formation
sufficient for good social policies,
particularly for the most vulnerable
groups, should be revisited. The
skills and knowledge of pension
staff and coordination between
finance and human development
staff during pension reform should
be improved. Distribution issues,
particularly those involving women
and disadvantaged groups, must
be explicitly addressed in the
design of any future pension
reform.

Development Planning and
Statistics in Cambodia

Technical assistance started in 1992
with the approval of a large grant to
strengthen capacity in macroeconomic management. From 1992 to
1997, three other projects focusing
on development planning and
national statistics totaling $6.8 million were approved. The capacity
built up in national statistics was
impressive; from virtually zero, the
National Institute of Statistics is
now producing alarge amount of
widely used data and has sufficient
staff to continue to do so. In
development planning, the
outcomes were somewhat less
convincing owing mainly to the
changed institutional role of the
ministry concerned.

The main lessons learned
included the following: (i) it may be
appropriate to have smaller projects
with fewer components; (ii) in
transition economies where local
capacity is limited, it may be useful
to separate funds to substitute local
capacity with external capacity from
those for training to produce local
capacity; (iii) if a ministry undergoes
major organizational change, it may
be useful to support a thorough
institutional assessment to review the
need for ongoing or new support.

Funding salaries and operational
expenses through technical
assistance should be replaced by
regular financial support to priority
mission groups. Institutional

assessment of the ministry should
be conducted and its role expanded
through village, commune, district,
and provincial databases. The public
investment program should become
an integral part of macrobudget
planning rather than a means of
mobilizing aid. Three projects were
assessed successful and one partly
successful .

Gender and Development
in Cambodia

Three projects provided assistance
over 8 years. Two emphasized data
collection and policy formulation
while the third was for project
preparation and also provided
assistance for capacity building and
promoting women’s employment.
The main lessons learned were

(i) without mainstreaming, gender
issues integral to poverty reduction
will continue to be marginalized;
(ii) revising technical assistance
design could be successful if there
were early identification of key
constraints, early objective analysis
of achievable goals, and efficient,
participatory management; and
(iii) achieving objectives must be
sensitive to the political and
institutional environment if failure
is to be averted.

The ministry should be
reorganized to reinforce consideration of gender concerns. The policy
on women should be reviewed,
updated, and published, and there
should be greater focus on gender
training and mainstreaming. All
technical assistance projects
achieved planned output in terms of
reports and had considerable success
in achieving gender outcomes. One
project was partly successful because
it failed to take account of the
capacity of the executing agency,
and two were successful.

Institutional Strengthening and
Policy Support to the Power
Sector in Bhutan

The three projects had two design
weaknesses: the time given for
consulting input was inadequate
and sequencing of activities was not

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 31 |taken into account. Lessons from
the evaluation included (i) before
developing complex new accounting
software, the Government should
agree to replace the existing system;
(ii) more attention needs to be paid
to domestic characteristics and
conditions when technical assistance
is formulated; and (iii) the time
allowed for counterpart feedback
must be adequate.

should agree to an acceptable level
of increase in domestic prices for
electricity, and indicators other than
the standard financial covenants
should be developed to gauge the
effectiveness of sector reforms. One
project was rated successful and two
partly successful.

Water Supply and Sanitation

Eight projects for improvements in
water supply and sanitation
included three advisory technical
assistance projects in the Lao
People's Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR) and fivein Viet Nam. Lessons
learned included the following:

(i) effects could be cumulative and
positive in institutions that receive
continued advice over time even if
individual projects were unsuccessful; (ii) health and hygiene programs
associated with water supply and
sanitation are more effective when
implemented by an experienced
professional organization; (iii) where
an advisory technical assistance
project has several interrelated
components, consultants’ inputs
should be organized so that outputs
can be properly coordinated; and

(iv) coordination and timing
between associated projects and
advisory technical assistance is
important. One project was assessed
highly successful, six successful, and
one partly successful.

Annual Report on Loan
and Technical Assistance
The report assesses performance in
the previous year. In 2002, the
public sector portfolio improved
markedly over 2001. The proportion

32 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

of projects at risk of performing
below expectations dropped from
26%in 2001 to 16%in 2002. Success
in moving projects out of the “at
risk” group is measured by a
proactivity index; this improved
from 39%in 2000, to 59%in 2001
and 67%in 2002. Though overall
performance improved, problems
were identified such as the time
taken for loans to become effective,
the high proportion of loans
requiring extensions, and the
proportion of loan cancellations in
some DMCs. The proportion of
technical assistance and project
completion reports actually carried
out remained disappointing. The
performance of the private sector
portfolio was little changed in 2002.
Delegating project administration to
resident missions and doing so
earlier in implementation will
improve performance.

Strengthening
Accountability

In 2003, ADB continued to review
the new business processes as a way
of improving accountability and
internal governance. Reviews of the
1994 Policy on Confidentiality and
Disclosure of Information and the
1994 Information Policy and
Strategy were also begun. In May,
ADB appointed a senior-level
steering committee to oversee the
reviews. The committee set up a
working group to study ADB's
experience with the policies; to
examine international trendsin
transparency and communications;
to analyze the practices of comparable institutions; and to confer with
the Board of Directors, Management, and staff.

In mid-August, ADB actively
solicited public comment on the
policies and asked for suggestions
on how to improve them. About
70 individuals and organizations in
more than 20 countries contributed
feedback which was posted on
ADB's web site (http:// www.adb.org)

to encourage informed public
debate. The working group then
began formulating an entirdy new,
unified Public Communications
Policy that enphasizes proactive
sharing of operational information,
seeking feedback, and demonstrating results. All departments and
offices were involved in the process
to ensure that the new policy would
take into account business processes
and the project cycle, would protect
confidential information and the
deliberative process, would broaden
public understanding of ADB's role,
and would support effective
consultation, promote public
participation, and ultimatey
contribute to poverty reduction.

As 2003 drew to aclose, ADB
continued work on the Policy with
the aim of circulating a public draft
and holding face-to-face consultations with stakeholders in
12 countries.

At the project level, ADB
approved a new accountability
mechanism and appointed a Special
Project Facilitator to address
concerns of persons affected by ADB
projects. The new mechanism
consists of two complementary
functions, a consultation phase and
a compliance review phase. The
Facilitator will be responsible for the
consultation phase. The accountability mechanism will replace the
inspection function approved in
December 1995 (seepage 3 and http://
www.adb.org/ Documents! Polides!
ADB_Accountability_Mechanisv ).

Audit and Anticorruption

The Office of the Auditor General
(OAG) conducts periodic, independent, and objective appraisals of
ADB activities to ensure adequate
and effective internal controls and
to improve economy and efficiency
in the use of resources. OAG is also
the focal point in the drive against
corruption, addressing alleged
incidents of corruption or fraud in
ADB projects or by its staff. OAG
reports directly to the President.
The Audit Committee of the Boardof Directors reviews OAG’s
activities.

OAG completed 28 audits in
2003 that resulted in, among others,
the following recommendations:

(i) enhance the monitoring of
compliance with loan covenants;

(ii) establish criteria and
methodology for prioritizing and
allocating funds for interregional
technical assistance projects;

(iii) strengthen internal controls
in financial, administrative, and
operational areas at the resident
missions;

(iv) strengthen internal controls
relating to treasury services by
monitoring applicable diversification
limits for corporate investments,
executing proper deal tickets for
interest rate and currency swaps,
monitoring counterpart risk
exposure for foreign exchange
transactions, and maintaining
segregation of duties in all treasury
functions; and

(v) enhance the process of
monitoring the performance of
maintenance contractors and ensure
the accuracy of their invoices.

Information technology audits
recommended (i) improving
response time to ensure prompt
action in case of critical system
events and (ii) taking appropriate
virus control measures. Recommendations also included enhancing
procedures to monitor the use of
software and to ensure compliance
with licensing agreements. OAG also
participated in local and offshore
fallback tests of the mainframe
computer to ensure continuity of
operations in case of a disaster and
in monitoring the implementation
of the Treasury Risk Managenent
System, including reviewing the
results of user acceptance tests.

The audit of six consultants
contracts by OAG resulted in the
recovery of overpayments and in the
sanction of one consulting firm.
OAG initiated the analysis of new
legislation and guidelines related to
auditing and oversight to consider
best practices to strengthen internal
procedures.

OAG also participated in the
review of several audit firmsin Viet
Nam along with the World Bank and
the Japan Bank for International
Cooperation, which resulted in
shortlisting firms considered
acceptable to audit externally
funded projects. OAG also
maintained close liaison with its
counterparts working in various
MDBs and United Nations agencies.
OAG provided integrated assistance
to ADB's external auditors in their
audit of ADB's annual financial
statements and their review of
interim financial statements for
ADB's bond offerings.

ADB's Anticorruption Unit is the
contact point for reporting
allegations of fraud and corruption
in ADB projects or among its staff
members. In 2003, the Unit opened
88 investigations for a total of
360 investigations since ADB
adopted the Anticorruption Policy
in 1998. ADB reprimanded 2 firms
and 1 individual and declared
21 firms and 10 individuals
indigible to participate in ADBfinanced activities. A cumulative
total of 49 firms and 50 individuals
had been declared ineligible by the
end of 2003. With 8 firms and
11 individuals having regained
eAigibility, 41 firms and 39 individuals remained ineligible at the end
of the year.

In 2003, the Anticorruption Unit
performed procurenent-rdated
audit of aroad devdopment project
in South Asia. It assessed the
control risks of the executing agency
and its compliance with ADB's
procurement guideines, its
opportunities for operational
improvements, and other concerns
that required further investigation
under ADB's Anticorruption Policy.
The Unit increased awareness of the
Policy and of itself through
presentations, workshops, and
publications. (Seehttp:// www.adb.org/
anticorruption for information on ADB's
anticorruption eforts induding how to
report fraud and corruption, procedures
for dealing with allegations and the
sanction and appeal processes )

OAG further contributed to
upgrading the audit capability of
supreme audit institutions in DMCs.
In 2003, OAG was involved in
training programs for the Asian
Organization of Supreme Audit
Institutions and the South Pacific 4
Association of Supreme Audit
Institutions. OAG also continued to
exchange information on anticorruption issues, capacity building,
and auditing with supreme audit
institutions and MDBs through
meetings, awareness seminars,
international conferences, and
meetings of the heads of audit of
MDBs.

Managing
Knowledge

The capacity to acquire, share, and
apply knowledge is crucial for
institutional effectiveness, and for
allowing clients to benefit more
readily from the experience of others.
To this end, ADB began work on the
Knowledge Management Framework
in 2003 and appointed a VicePresident for Knowledge Management
and Sustainable Devdopment.
ADB's sector and thematic
committees are potential conduits
for knowledge sharing. The
committees and networks are
expected to discuss emerging issues
in the region; to recommend
regional technical assistance; to
disseminate information on
publications, conferences, and
training opportunities; to suggest
prominent individuals within and
outside the region for informal
seminars; to provide professional
peer support to ADB staff; and to
facilitate partnerships with relevant
in-country and regional networks,
resource organizations, and key
development stakeholders.
Observations on their effectiveness
were mixed. Their mandates,
resources, and incentives were
addressed in 2003 and in the review
of new business processes to make
them more functional in 2004.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 33 |ADB continued to support
information and communication
technology (ICT) by participating in
the United Nations World Summit
on the Information Society (WSIS).
President Chino delivered the
keynote address at the Asia-Pacific
Regional WSIS where the Tokyo
Declaration was prepared for
submission at the WSIS in Geneva,
Switzerland, in December 2003. In
response to the WSIS Declaration of
Principles and Plan of Action, ADB
is reviewing its ICT policies.

Asian Development
Bank Institute

Considerable effort was made in
2003 to respond positively to
requests for assistance and
cooperation. The relevance of new
activities for stakeholders helped set
ADB Institute (ADBI) priorities. To

improve focus and impact, work was
integrated into the four strategic
themes chosen for the coming 3-year
rolling workplan i.e. poverty
reduction, regional cooperation,
private sector development, and
governance. Considerable emphasis
was given to strengthening ICT links
in line with the Knowledge
Management Committee and to
align ADBI’s work with ADB’s
overall priorities.

Steps were taken to extend
activities to a wider cross section of
countries. New activities included
the following: the preparation and
publication of a country economic
report on Afghanistan (launched at
the Bonn Donors Meeting); the
“Making Markets Work for the
Poor” project in Cambodia and the
Lao PDR in collaboration with the
Department for International
Deveopment, United Kingdom; a

comprised regional teams.

Capacity building and training
were expanded. Learning activities
were supported in Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan and more are being
developed for the five ADB regions:
East and Central Asia, Mekong, the
Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast
Asia. ADBI is also developing new
activities using ICT to provide
services across the entire Asia and
Pacific region. Two new products
were successfully launched in 2003:
a daily dectronic news and analysis
service (enewsline, latest edition at
http:// www.adbi.org’/ enewsine’
index.html) and a CD-ROM review
program accessible on ADBI’s web
site. In addition, work has started
on a redesign of the web site to be
launched in mid-2004.

In addition to its own projects,
ADBI supports visiting researchers
(principally from the region) whose
work is generally on one of the four
themes. This new program
commenced in the fourth quarter of
2003. Five visiting researchers are
expected in 2003-2004.

ADBI is also the implementing
agency for the ADB and InterAmerican Devdopment Bank
agreement on the Latin America/
Caribbean and Asia/Pacific
Economics and Business Association. As part of this work, in 2003
ADBI organized and hosted
conferences on comparative
development in Asia and Latin
America and supported networking
for researchers.

Fostering
Partnerships

The diversity and scale of the
development potential and
challenges in the region require
collaboration among all stakeholders
committed to reducing poverty.ADB's partners include national and
local governments, civil society,
nongovernment organizations
(NGOs), and bilateral and multilateral development agencies.

To enhance partnerships, ADB
focused on (i) harmonizing policies
and procedures to minimize
transaction costs, (ii) strategic
coordination to better align country
strategies and programs with the
development planning cycles of
individual DMCs and with those of
other key devdopment partners,

(iii) working with NGOs and civil
society, and (iv) enhancing
communications and outreach to
attain a higher public profile for and
understanding of ADB. This
includes a combined review of the
Information Policy and Strategy of
ADB and the Policy on Confidentiality and Disclosure of Information. Representative offices and
regional and resident missions play
a growing rolein this regard. The
network will be augmented by the
Pacific coordination and imple
mentation office in Sydney,
approved in 2003 which will
expand outreach in Australia and
New Zealand.

Two factors that have catalyzed
stronger partnerships are
(i) expansion and devolution of
responsibilities to resident missions;

and (ii) establishment of grant funds
from several bilateral donors,
including Canada, Denmark, Japan,
the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
and United Kingdom.

Experience gained in Bangladesh
and Cambodia as well as lessons
learned from other institutions led
ADB to view sector-wide approach
programs (SWAPs) as a way to
enhance project effectiveness.
SWAPs presume strong local
capacities and require that stringent
policy and fiduciary conditions be
met up front, but with attention to
the best blend of instruments,
SWAPs can serve the needs of poorly
performing countries.

In May 2003, a participatory
process involving more than 500
representatives of the public, private,
and nonprofit sectors culminated in
the adoption of ADB-GovernmentNGO Cooperation: A Framework for
Action, 2003-2005. This document
provides a medium-term roadmap
for increasing tripartite collaboration in poverty reduction efforts and
recommends specific actions to
increase NGO participation in ADB
activities, to enhance transparency
and interaction, to devedop ADB
capacity for NGO cooperation, to
build NGO capacity, and to
strengthen government-NGO
cooperation.

One immediate step of the
Framework’s implementation was
the creation of apilot NGO small
grants window, NGO Partnerships
for Poverty Reduction, made
possible by a $500,000 regional
technical assistance fund financed
by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Technical assistance will
hep NGOs design and implement
innovative projects in several DMCs.
Projects will emphasize poverty
reduction and enhanced cooperation
among ADB, governments, and
NGOs.

This landmark development in
ADB rdations with civil society gives
ADB greater flexibility and
additional resources to support
innovative NGO activities that
complement poverty reduction
efforts at the country levd. NGOs
may submit proposals for up to
$50,000 per country or up to
$20,000 per project.

Coordination with other
development partners was given
increased importance in 2003. Active
participation in events organized by
the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Devdopment, the United Nations,
and the World Trade Organization
provided ADB with an effective
platform to present regional
perspectives to a global audience.

to their achievement. The goals are
Clearly reflected in ADB’s Long-Term
Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2001—

continued to be a framework for
measuring development progress
in 2003.

Rapid economic growth in many
developing member countries
(DMCs) has been an important
contributor to the large reduction in
overall poverty rates in the Asia and
Pacific region. Primary drivers of
growth were strong domestic
demand, sustained export performance, and a supportive policy
environment especially for fiscal and
monetary policies.

Prospects for further economic
growth are, however, increasingly
affected by global economic and
geopolitical factors including the
pace of economic recovery in
industrialized countries, trends in
long-term interest rates, and
progress toward multilateral trade
liberalization under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Doha

.While economic growth is
essential for reducing poverty, much
remains to be done to achieve the
MDGs. In South Asia, sustained
economic growth rates of 5-6%per
year will be required to meet
poverty reduction targets with
particular attention to issues of
malnutrition and access to
sanitation. In East Asia and the
Pacific, child mortality rates are
falling too slowly, and the lack of
infrastructure is contributing to
poverty. Only 75% of the population receive water from an improved
source, and only 47% have access to
improved sanitation facilities. In
Central Asia, poverty levels have
risen markedly since 1990. The
region is faced with a rapid increase
in HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases, with rising infant
mortality, and with deteriorating
access to education.

Strategic Priorities

ADB's strategic priorities are defined
in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
and the LTSF which sets out the
agenda and the broad implenentation strategy to realize its vision of
an Asia and Pacific region free of
poverty.’ The key strategic priorities
are (i) sustained, pro-poor economic
growth; (ii) inclusive social
development; and (iii) good
governance. The LTSF also ensures
country ownership, partnerships
with key stakeholders, and use of
new assistance modalities. The
Framework is being implemented
through three sets of 5-year
medium-term strategies (see http://
www.adb.org/ Documents Polides MTS
2001/). The current medium-term
strategy stresses the importance of
attaining the MDGs, of enhancing
development effectiveness, and of
ensuring that ADB’s interventions
are focused at the country level.
ADB is committed to working in
close partnership with other key
development agencies, including the
United Nations Devedopment
Programme (UNDP), United

Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the
Pacific, and the World Bank, to
support DMCs to achieve the
MDGs. ADB's work is guided by the
provision of the Millennium
Development Compact that
identifies a core role for the regional
development banks in financing
regional public goods and in
encouraging regional integration
and cooperation. In addition to
these areas, ADB is also a major
contributor to key investment areas
identified by UNDP as vital for
achieving the MDGs, including
(i) human development,
(ii) increased productivity on small
farms, (iii) investment in basic
infrastructure, (iv) promotion of
small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) and entrepreneurship,
(v) good governance, and
(vi) promotion of environmental
sustainability and urban management.
In addition, ADB continues to place
high priority on capacity building in
DMCs to allow for improved data
collection and implementation of
activities and provision of services
for achieving the MDGs.
Recognizing the diversity of
impediments to poverty reduction in
individual countries, ADB ensures
its support is fully compatible with
national policies and strategies.
Where such policies are inadequate,
ADB supports their improvement.
This includes formulating national
poverty reduction strategies in close
partnership with other devdopment
agencies. To date, ADB has
supported poverty reduction
strategies in over 20 DMCs and has

Poverty Reduction in 2003

identified several areas for improved
impact, including (i) greater focus
on the nonincome dimensions of
poverty; (ii) further stress on
participatory approaches;

(iii) capacity building for poverty
monitoring, strategy development,
and implementation; and

(iv) development of a comprehensive
poverty monitoring framework to
measure achievements in poverty
reduction.

Critical links exist among economic
growth, employment, and poverty
reduction. ADB supports sustainable, inclusive, pro-poor economic
growth that fully integrates the
environmental and social considerations of each country. Strategic
areas of focus are the following.

Creating the Conditions
for Growth

In coordination with the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank, and other devdopment
partners, ADB emphasizes achieving
and maintaining macroeconomic
stability, improving fiscal management, and aiding financial sector
restructuring. ADB is also working
with its DMCs to develop institutional and regulatory frameworks
conducive to private sector
devdopment.

Investing for Economic Growth
ADB places high priority on

investing in physical and technological infrastructure, especially to boost

* Of the 62 public sector loans, 10 were for core poverty intervention
projects and 29 were for poverty intervention projects. These 39 projects
amounted to about $3 billion or 51% of total public sector lending.

* Grants from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction totaling $35.3 million
were approved for nine projects. (For details, see Table 32 in the Statistical

Annex.)

the effective functioning of product
and labor markets essential for propoor economic growth. Developing
human capital is also a key area of

operations.

Holistic Approach to
Promoting Employment

This is based on (i) macroeconomic
stability and faster economic
growth; (ii) assistance to employers,
including SMEs; (iii) support for
effective functioning of labor and
other markets; and (iv) labor force
deveopment through education and
training. ADB promotes the use of
core labor standards, especially those
that ensure the protection of poor
and vulnerable groups.

Poverty Funds

In response to the Poverty Reduction
Strategy of 1999, two trust funds
were established. The Cooperation
Fund in Support of the Formulation

_ and Implementation of National _

' Poverty Reduction Strategies (see |

: http://www.adb.org/Documents/ |

: Policies/NPRS) was established in :

“November 2001 by the Government

_of the Netherlands, and the Poverty

: Reduction Cooperation Fund (see:

{ http://www.adb.org/PRF) was |

“launched in July 2002 by the ~~
Government of the United Kingdom.
In 2003, these Funds supported the
implementation of 40 projects and
the preparation of 35 technical
assistance projects, some of which
provided assistance in formulating,
implementing, monitoring, and
disseminating national poverty
reduction strategies.

In the People’s Republic of China
(PRC), a technical assistance project
was designed in a fully participatory
manner and will develop plans for
22 minorities. In Uzbekistan,
assistance was provided to build
capacity in collecting data on living
standards and in formulating propoor growth strategies and social
policies.

Inclusive Social
Development

ADB isamain proponent of equitable
social devdopment and a major
source of support for such critical
areas as education and training,
health, water and sanitation,
housing, and—more recent! y—social
protection. Inclusive devdopment
means that no one is excluded, that
no group is left behind.

A core feature of ADB's social
development activities is mainstreaming gender initiatives both through
stand-aloneinterventions and
through integration into lending and
technical assistance operations.
Emerging gender problems such as

operations. For example, in the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, a
project is in progress to provide
technical training on quality standards for silk products so producers
can participate in regional economic
cooperation programs. Building on
its initial success, a follow-on phase
is being prepared to expand training
to agricultural, handicraft, and
other production lines. In Yunnan
Province of the PRC, a pilot road
project will raise awareness of the
increased risks of HIV/AIDS and will
develop a service delivery system.
In Si Lanka, the Funds are being
used to ensure that the poor have
access to computers, radios, and
other communication facilities and
media provided by an ADBfinanced education loan.

The Funds were also used in
2003 to analyze the potential for
negative impacts of globalization on
the poor. In Cambodia, a detailed
analysis is under way to assess the
impact of lifting the trade quota
allocation in the garment industry by
the end of 2004. The industry is seen
as a means for poor young women
to become economically empowered.
If foreign investment were to
withdraw as a result of lifting the
quota, there would be significant
socioeconomic consequences.

the trafficking of women and girls
are especially emphasized. Where
ADB lacks the experience to tackle
such issues, it partners with
specialized agencies. ADB is also
working to eliminate barriers that
women facein finding enployment,
including access to credit, availability
of day-care services, and adherence to
labor standards.

ADB supports formulating social
policies that focus on pro-poor
approaches, that involve the private
sector and civil society, and that are
fiscally viable.

With an appropriate policy
environment in place, ADB focuses
on developing sustainable social
services for the poor by investing in
physical infrastructure and
equipment, institution and capacity
building, and optimizing the design
of social service programs.

Social Protection

ADB's Social Protection Strategy (see
http:// www.adb.org/ SodalProtection/
drat.agp) addresses labor markets,
social insurance, social assistance
schemes to protect communities,
and child protection. The Social
Protection Network has taken the
lead in recruiting and deploying
specialists, issuing guidelines, and
engaging in dialogues with partners
such as nongovernment organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and the
International Labour Organization.

Since the approval of the Strategy
in 2001, both awareness and practical application of labor standards
have gradually increased among ADB
staff. ADB's core labor standards
initiatives are implemented within
the context of the Strategy. Main
areas of work include devdopment of
ahandbook on corelabor standards,
guiddines for the design of risk and
vulnerability profiles, and tools for
integrating core labor standards into
procurement.

Street children fall under core
labor standards as child labor. In
2003, an important study on street
children was finalized” as was a
practical guide for ADB staff and
others. Two roundtable discussionswith NGOs working with street
children were hdd. The Street
Children’s Art Competition
produced the publication If | Had the
Chance... 4

Regional technical assistance on
disability issues was completed in
2003. Two publications—The
Disability Handbook and The Disability
Manual—are in process.

Indigenous Peoples

ADB continued to strengthen the
implementation of its 1998 Policy
on Indigenous Peoples (ssehttp://
www.adb.org/ Documents! Polides!
Indigenous Peoples ). Twenty-one
(30%) of the 68 public and private
sector projects reviewed triggered
policy safeguards; five public sector
projects were found to have
significant impact and required the
preparation of an Indigenous
Peoples Deveopment Framework.
In addition, 15 public sector and

1 private sector project were found
to have limited impact requiring
specific actions or provisionsin the
loan agreement.

A review mission of one project
found that identifying the affected
indigenous peoples and applying
ADB's definition in the context of
acountry’s indigenous peoples
policy is a problem. This can be
addressed if the project can

local context and address their
specific concerns.

In 2003, ADB participated in
regional and global discussions on
safeguarding the interests of
indigenous peoples and disseminated
the results of the capacity building
project (ssehttp:// www.adb.org/
Documents Reports Indigenous Peoples ).
ADB conducted an NGO roundtable
discussion on indigenous issues;
took part in the UNDP's Regional
Initiative to Strengthen Policy
Dialogue on Indigenous, Highland,
and Tribal Peoples’ Rights and
Devedopment; and participated in
the Conference on Human Rights,
Ethnic Minorities, and Religions.
Progress was made in harmonizing
ADB's indigenous peoples policy
with that of the World Bank. ADB's
indigenous peoples web page was
launched in November 2003
(see http:// www.adb.org/ IndigenousPeoples). ADB also provided
orientation on the indigenous
peoples policy to headquarters and
resident mission staff and to
government officials.

Involuntary Resettlement

Many countries in the region

had completed their first strategies
and had achieved important gains in
making policies more pro-poor and
processes more participatory.

The themes were governance and
promoting participation, transparency,
and accountability; pro-poor growth;
widening markets and trade and
pursuing regional integration; and the
challenges in meeting the Millennium
Development Goals and their linkages
to poverty reduction strategies. Since
the majority of poor people live in rural
areas, delegates stressed that investing
in rural development and agricultural
productivity—roads to markets,
schools, health facilities, telecommunications, improved access to
technology, and training—is a priority.

early screening of projects to assess
and manage risks and to set
standards for resettlement planning
and implementation. Thirty-seven
(54%) of the 68 projects and equity
investments approved had involuntary resettlement impacts and
required resettlement plans and/or
resettlement frameworks. Of those,
18 had significant impacts, and

10 had less significant impacts.
Nine projects required resettlement
frameworks. Revised guidelines on
involuntary resettlement were
included in the Operations Manual.
Briefing sessions for ADB staff were
initiated to familiarize then with
involuntary resettlement safeguards
(se http:// www.adb.org/ Documents!

ADB assisted DMCs in
developing and implenenting
national resettlenent policies and
helped build the capacity of
executing agencies in implementing
social safeguards and resettlement
management. ADB held training
workshops for its staff and
representatives of executing agencies
in Bhutan, Cambodia, People's
Republic of China (PRC), and Viet
Nam. ADB also implemented
country-specific technical assistance
to enhance national resettlement
policy standards in the Lao People's
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Sri
Lanka, and Viet Nam (seehttp://

Good Governance

ADB recognizes that good governance is an essential condition for
poverty reduction. Without effective
governance institutions, structures,
and services, a country cannot
progress and equitable devd opment
for its people cannot be achieved.
The Governance Agenda and Action
Plan for 2000-2004 committed ADB
to the following: (i) taking a lead
rolein promoting good governance
in the region; (ii) devating
governance issues to the top of the
development agenda; (iii) building
consensus on regional benchmarks,
codes of conduct, and indicators of
good governance; and (iv) enhancing
the quality of governance in DMCs.
These objectives are monitored and
reported on at regular intervals.
Advocacy also includes policies and
strategies on procurement,
participation of civil society,
anticorruption, anti-money
laundering, and counterterrorism.
Furthermore, ADB sponsored
regional seminars and training
workshops to highlight governance
and continued to work with the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Devdopment on
developing an anticorruption action
plan for Asia and the Pacific.
ADB's strength in promoting
good governance stems from its
status as a trusted partner of its
DMCs and its enphasis on extensive
analysis, consultation, and policy
dialogue. Since the adoption of the
governance policy in 1995 (seehttp://
www.adb.org/ Documents Polides!
Governanad ), the principal focus has
been on policy and institutional
reform and devdopment. ADB's
support is grounded on the needs
assessments conducted under
country governance assessments and
on other such studies. Special
attention is given to incorporating
governance in regional and country

strategies and programs and their
updates.

ADB continued to support DMC
efforts to develop public services
that impact positively on economic
growth and social development. Key
issues addressed included law and
policy reform, public sector
management and accountability,
private sector deveopment, legal
and judicial systems, civil society
participation, and corruption.
Innovations in governance activities
were emphasized including pilot
testing new approaches under
facilities such as the Governance
Cooperation Fund established in
2002 with Canada and Norway
providing initial contributions. As
part of ADB's greater focus on
measuring results, it explored the
potential for results-based management in DMCs.

Public Sector Governance,
Transparency, and Investment

In recent years, particularly since the
Asian financial crisisin 1997, ADB
has focused increasingly on the
importance of good public sector
governance for creating a sound
investment environment to
accelerate country development and
to ensure good governance practices
within enterprises. In the Governance Agenda and Action Plan, one
of the main themes is supporting
developing country governments to
strengthen the enabling environment for investment.

To attract investments, ADB has
helped countries improve the quality
of legislation and economic
regulation. The formulation of legal
and regulatory frameworks
encourages investor confidence
through improved standards of
treatment of both domestic and
foreign investment interests. Judicial
reform projects in the PRC and
Pakistan are making these countries’
judicial systems more predictable
and reiable.

ADB has helped DMCs improve
regulatory frameworks, particularly
in energy, banking, capital markets,

bankruptcy, and liquidation. For
example, ADB-financed capital
market program loans to
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and
Philippines resulted in legal reforms
to strengthen the oversight and
enforcement capabilities of securities
and stock exchange regulators. In
Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, ADB
provided assistance by developing
an effective framework for
promoting and strengthening
agencies that regulate competition.
ADB helped the Sri Lankan power
sector to establish independent
regulation and a tariff-setting
mechanism, to introduce competition and commercialization by
changing management practices,
and to encourage private sector
participation in the sector by
developing a transparent business
environment.

In some cases, ADB has offered
limited financial and fiscal
incentives to help countries induce
investment in less desirable
locations and to overcome transaction costs. ADB helped promote
investments through fiscal incentive
reforms such as the duty suspension
schemes in the Fiji Islands and
Samoa. In the Maldives, ADB
assistance contributed to establishing a Pacific investment capital fund
in collaboration with the World
Bank.

The quality of customs
administration is an important
consideration for potential investors;
poor administration is a deterrent
since uncertainty and unpredictability make investment decisions
difficult and increase the cost of
transactions. To secure transparent,
stable, simple, and predictable
conditions for domestic and longterm, cross-border investment,
particularly foreign direct investment, comprehensive reforms are
often needed, including training,
legislation, and computerization for
customs administration. ADB hdd
workshops in Central Asia to hdp
the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan
attract foreign investment, improveinstitutional capability, and
strengthen the legal and regulatory
framework in line with international
standards and conventions. This
region is keen on fostering economic
alliances in infrastructure, trade, and
investment.

In Bangladesh and the Federated
States of Micronesia, ADB support
helped formulate privatization
strategies and initiate effective,
smooth, and transparent stateowned enterpriseredated reforms. In
Indonesia, Pakistan, and Samoa,
ADB he)ped facilitate corporate
restructuring and privatization of
state-owned enterprises. Privatization of teecommunication services
was supported in Thailand.

Promoting Good Corporate
Governance

ADB actively pursues and encourages
good corporate governance in all
aspects of its business endeavors
within DMCs. ADB worksin
countries like Mongoliain public
sector reform to upgrade the
capacity of shareholders, boards of
directors, and boards of supervisors
in state enterprises to be privatized.
At thelevel of creditor and investor,
ADB works closdy with regulators,
state-owned enterprises and private
businesses to emphasize and heap
implement good governance
practices.

Assistance was provided to
Mongolia in legal and procedural
aspects related to restructuring and
recapitalization of insolvent banks.
ADB also provided technical
assistance in promoting efficient
insolvency regimes, particularly with
respect to cross-border insolvency.
Technical assistance to Indonesia,
Philippines, and Thailand aimed
specifically to facilitate the exchange
of ideas between courts in handling
cross-border insolvency cases. ADB
was active in developing insolvency
procedures to deal with state-owned
enterprise reorganization and
liquidation in the PRC, establishing
anew regulatory framework for
secured transactions in Indonesia,
and introducing a collateral security
registration system in Viet Nam.
ADB was also active in improving
the regulatory systems affecting the
environment. (For moreon ingitutional
rdorms ssethe theme chapter that tarts

Governance Policy on Money
Laundering and Antiterrorism
Financing

A policy was approved in April 2003
enabling ADB to increase its
assistance to DMCs to fight the
financing of terrorism and to
encourage anti-money laundering
initiatives (see http:// www.adb.org
Documents Polides ADB_Money_

Formulating and Promoting Economic Laws

ADB has helped improve the quality
of legislation directly related to
investment. In the People’s Republic
of China, ADB has provided assistance to amend its company law and
to develop various economic laws
on bankruptcy, trust, social security
registration of commercial and
industrial organizations, and
administrative licensing. These laws
aim to enable a market environment
and growth for investments. ADB
has also supported the development
in English of an information system
on laws and regulations on foreigners, of an electronic database for the

translated legal materials, and of
an English translation of laws and
regulations. This has helped
increase the transparency of the
legal and regulatory system and
has enabled the Government to
meet the legal information transparency requirements of the World
Trade Organization.

In Vanuatu, technical assistance
has strengthened the state law
office improving laws on copyright,
trademarks, e-commerce, and
financial institutions to ensure that
anti-money laundering conditions
are met.

Laundering _Terrorism/ money100.agp).

It further provided the umbrdla
framework for improving ADB's
cooperation and coordination with
other organizations engaged in these
areas. The policy has also enabled
ADB to strengthen its internal
system to protect its own funds
from misuse.

Crosscutting
Strategic Themes

The crosscutting strategic themes of
the LTSF and the Poverty Reduction
Strategy are (i) environmental
sustainability, (ii) gender and
development, (iii) private sector
development, and (iv) regional
cooperation and integration.

Addressing Environmental
Sustainability

Assistance focused on providing the
poor access to basic water and
sanitation services, on managing the
natural resources on which the poor
depend, and on improving the
quality of the environment. Loans
totaling $305 million were approved
to finance clean energy development
and wastewater management
projects in the PRC, water supply
and sanitation projects in Fiji
Islands, Pakistan, Samoa, and Sri
Lanka, and a project to manage
floods in Azerbaijan (see box on page
44). ADB also approved grants to
establish the feasibility of renewable
energy projects for off-grid, rural,
poor communities in the PRC,
Philippines, and Uzbekistan.
Indonesia received assistance to
develop certified emission reduction
ratings for greenhouse gases to
promote reforestation and afforestation. In the PRC, forestry conservation programs were studied to
alleviate the plight of poor
communities.

To enhance environmental
sustainability, ADB approved
nearly $6 million in grants to
strengthen institutional capacity for

Benvironmental management in
Bhutan and Cook Islands, to
improve land use management in
Kiribati, to promote industrial
environmental management in
Pakistan and strategic planning and
policy formulation in Tajikistan, to
design pollution taxation and
mobilize resources in Thailand, and
to promote waste management and
recycling in Samoa and Tuvalu. A
study will also address arsenic and
other groundwater problems in
Bangladesh. Two regional grants will

assist the Central Asian republics to
integrate environmental considerations into devdopment policies,
plans, programs, and capacity
building in information management systems.

Regional and subregional
initiatives will boost poverty
reduction and address cross-border
environmental issues. Better Air
Quality Management in Asia will
help to ensure that air pollution is
considered in making and implementing environmental policies and

in planning and implementing
sustainable development policies. In
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and
Nepal, an air quality management
program addresses the goals in the
Malé Declaration. It sets standards,
pilots clean technology programs,
and monitors and evaluates air
quality. The program will also
examine how air pollution affects
health. Two programs in the Central
Asian republics will assess water
management and improve the
management of shared resources

Sector Activities

Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development.
Twelve loans totaling $391.9 million were approved for
projects covering policy and institutional reforms, natural
resource management, infrastructure development
particularly for irrigation, and productivity enhancement.
They included a flood mitigation loan for Azerbaijan; an
agriculture sector program loan for Cambodia to promote
diversification and commercialization; two livestock
development loans for Bangladesh and Nepal; a community development loan for Si Lanka; the Phuoc Hoa Water
Resources Project in Viet Nam; three irrigation loans for
Cambodia, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan; and a grain productivity improvement loan for Uzbekistan. In addition,
21 technical assistance projects totaling $15.8 million were
approved during the year, including four for regional
technical assistance. The eighth umbrella regional technical assistance project for $3 million was approved for
supporting agriculture and natural resource research in
soil and water management for Central Asia and in
productivity enhancement of rice and fish for the poorer
regions and farmers of South and Southeast Asia. To
promote regional cooperation in agriculture development
and poverty alleviation, an agriculture working group was
established for the Greater Mekong Subregion countries,
and its first meeting was organized at ADB headquarters.
Education. Sx loans totaling $269 million were
approved. More than $215 million were spent on education for all (EFA) to benefit approximately 25 million
primary school children over the next 4 years. In
Bangladesh, the $100 million Second Primary Education
Development Program is expected to help Bangladesh
reach near-universal primary education as early as 2010.
Attendance of girls and disadvantaged children is emphasized. The project is funded by 12 donors led by ADB, a
system that allows for expanding external financing. A
program loan for $220 million (half for schools) to Sndh,
Pakistan, supported education, health, water and sanitation. In Tajikistan, a $7.5 million loan will improve capacity
building at central and local education offices to improve
access by girls and vulnerable groups. Two loans

42 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

supported distance education (Si Lanka) and skill development (Maldives). These projects will improve skill acquisition
for secondary school graduates to reduce youth unemployment. Project beneficiaries include rural poor and females.
Technical assistance was provided to Papua New Guinea to
promote literacy for all.

Energy. Ten loans provided $756.7 million for electrical
power in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, People’s Republic
of China (PRC), India, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR), and Thailand. Cambodia will have access to affordable
and reliable electricity with the installation of a power
transmission line from Chau Doc in southwest Viet Nam to
Phnom Penh, the first component of a master plan to
interconnect the power sectors of the Greater Mekong
Subregion member countries. Poor rural areas in the Lao
PDRwill get electricity, and a power development plan
supports a comprehensive program of reform in the state of
Assam, India. The Rural Hectrification and Network Expansion Project will deliver electricity from existing national
hydropower stations to 8,000 new consumers in mostly
poor, rural areas of Bhutan. Cleaner, more reliable energy
for poor communities in Gansu Province, PRC, will be
provided through a $35 million loan, while a private
sector loan financed the Tala-Delhi Transmission Project
in India.

Finance, Industry, and Trade. The Trade Finance
Facilitation Program enables local banks in a number of
developing member countries (DMCs) to offer importers and
exporters better access to reliable and reasonable terms and
conditions for trade finance, boosting liquidity and stability
in the system. About 30 banks in 10 DMCs are expected to
participate by the end of 2004. ADB also approved a
$15 million equity participation in the ASEAN China Investment Fund LP, a new private equity fund that provides
capital for small and medium enterprises (SMES) located in
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members
and the PRC. Loans for $170 million will boost the competitiveness and profitability of Pakistan’s SMEs and promote
economic growth. The Second Nonbank Financial Governance Program for the Philippines financial sector willespecially in the Aral Sea Basin. In
Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam,
aprogram will assess poverty
reduction and the potential for
community and industrial forestry
to reduce the vulnerability of forestdependent communities particularly
poor ethnic minorities and women.
In the South Pacific, the Renewable
Energy and Energy Efficiency
Program will develop a market-based
rural energy sector and will mobilize
external financing for funding or
cofinancing.

ADB strengthened partnerships
and fostered regional cooperation to
mobilize resources. A $3.6 million
Poverty and Environment Fund was
established with the governments of
Norway and Sweden to accelerate
learning on how to mainstream the
environment in ADB operations.
The Fund will also finance the
recently launched Poverty and
Environment Program that will pilot
environmental activities, finance
research, disseminate lessons
learned, and compile good practices

(se http:// www.adb.org Documents!
News 2003/ nr2003099.agp). The Clean
Devdopment Mechanism Facility
provides DMCs access to additional
financial resources by bridging the
gap between buyers and sellers of
emission reductions ensuring a fair
return to DMCs on their greenhouse
gas reduction initiatives and
assisting developed countries to
meet their commitments under the
Kyoto Protocol. To facilitate direct
access to Global Environment
Facility resources, ADB negotiated

address graft and corruption in financial markets, improve
transparency, strengthen investor protection, and mobilize
domestic savings.

Health, Nutrition, Population, and Early Childhood
Development. Five new loans totaling $172 million were
approved. Loans for Indonesia, Mongolia, and Tajikistan
focused on improving the health of the poor, particularly
women and children, by improving services and access to
basic health care. The multisector loan for Pakistan (Sindh
Devolved Social Services Program) incorporated assistance
for improving health services. A loan to the Kyrgyz Republic
established a national early childhood development program
to improve the health, nutrition, education, and psychosocial development of preschool children. In addition to
these loans, technical assistance funds supported 21 new
projects ranging from the establishment of HIV/AIDS care
centers in Papua New Guinea to regional support to fight
severe acute respiratory syndrome and other newly
emerging diseases.

Rural and Microfinance. A loan package totaling
$70 million was approved to establish a more sustainable
rural finance system in Sri Lanka. The Rural Finance Sector
Development Program aims to revive the rural economy
and promote private sector economic growth. It comprises a program loan of $50 million to support policy
and institutional reforms in rural finance, and two project
loans of $10 million each to promote rural enterprise
development and institutional strengthening. A loan and
technical assistance project totaling $8.6 million were also
provided to Tajikistan to regulate and expand the
microfinance market.

Transport. Heven loans totaling $2.6 billion were
approved. Loans for Bangladesh, PRC, India, Pakistan, and
Tajikistan focused on promoting economic growth and
reducing poverty by enhancing the access of the poor to
economic opportunities and social services. The $400 million
loan for the Rural Roads Sector | Project in India funded the
construction of all-weather roads for unserved rural populations in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In addition to
loans for investment, technical assistance for 27 projects was

provided for project preparation as well as to support
capacity and institution building. Grant funding for the
Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Construction
Project for Afghanistan will help to restore key infrastructure including the repair and rehabilitation of the primary
national road network.

Urban Development, Municipal Services, and Housing. More than $280 million in assistance was provided. A
$16 million loan reduces poverty and boosts incomes in 10
small towns in the Lao PDR In Viet Nam, urban environmental improvement in six towns and their surrounding
areas in the poor central region was financed through a
$44 million loan. The Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter
Sector Project in Indonesia addressed the lack of serviced,
tenured plots; appropriate shelter finance; and the need to
strengthen institutions. A $90 million loan package was
signed to improve living and health conditions for more
than 3.6 million poor urban and slum dwellers in southern
Punjab, Pakistan. Affordable housing for some 20,000 poor
urban families outside the Philippines’ national capital
region will be provided through a $30 million loan and a
$1.5 million technical assistance grant.

Water. Several initiatives launched during the Third
World Water Forum are in place. Water for the Poor—
Partnerships for Action improves water security for the
rural poor; Water for Asian Cities addresses the need for
pro-poor investments in water and sanitation; and Gender
in Water Partnership promotes gender mainstreaming in
water management. Loans for more than $581 million
were approved for nine DMCs. The Urban Water Supply
and Environmental Improvement Project in Madhya
Pradesh, India, received $200 million in funding, and
Nepal received a total of $39 million for water and
sanitation services and a water service development
program in the Kathmandu Valley. Loans for two
projects in the PRC, Harbin Water Supply and Wuhan
Wastewater Management, totaled $183 million. A
program in Sri Lanka to supply water and sanitation to
secondary towns and rural communities received
$60 million.

3an agreement and Menorandum of
Understanding for the direct
transfer of resources from the
Facility. ADB also hosted a meeting
of the Multilateral Financial
Institutions Working Group on
Environment in which a common
environmental assessment framework was developed.

All ADB projects were designed
to comply with environmental
safeguards and included measures to
address potential environmental
problems during implementation.

Projects that Protect
the Environment and
Reduce Poverty

In the People’s Republic of China
(PRC), Zhangye City will have clean,
efficient energy and strengthened
social service delivery with the
construction of a 98 megawatt
run-of-river hydropower plant on
the Xiaogushan River. A project in
Azerbaijan (i) provides structural
measures to protect the villages
and agricultural land on the Araz,
Ganikh, and Mazim rivers from
floods; (ii) promotes pilot,
community-based afforestation;
and (iii) implements flood forecasting, warning, zoning, and disaster
preparedness training. Improving
water supply and sanitation is the
goal of projects in the Fiji Islands in
the Suva and Nausori urban areas,
in Pakistan in low-income urban
communities in southern Punjab
Province, and in Si Lanka in the
tural districts of Polonnaruwa and
Anuradhapura. In Apia, Samoa, a
project will rehabilitate existing
drains; provide a wastewater
collection and treatment system;
upgrade individual sanitation
facilities; and strengthen institutions and legislative frameworks for
wastewater management, drainage,
urban management, and environmental monitoring. A project in
Wuhan, PRC will increase the
capacity to treat wastewater from
the current 6% to about 45% by
constructing three treatment plants
and associated collection systems.

44 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Out of 68 projects, a rigorous review
was done on 52 (76%) that had
potential risks, and the environmental implications of the remaining
projects were also studied. Compliance review missions were undertaken for selected high-risk projects
under implementation. The Forest
Policy Working Paper that assessed
the 1995 Policy and outlined
investment priorities for the coming
decade was reviewed, and environmental analyses were prepared for
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and
Tajikistan to facilitate the integration of environmental considerations into country strategies and
programs.

The use of cumulative impact
and environmentally responsible
procurement in environmental
assessments was addressed.
Orientation courses were held for
project teams and resident mission
staff on the principles and
procedures needed to ensure
compliance with environmental
assessment requirements. A CDROM and brochure were prepared to
improve ADB staff and stakeholders
awareness of the safeguards.

In recognition of its outstanding
contributions to the promotion and
advancement of environmental
assessment in its recipient countries,
ADB was given a Corporate
Environment Award by the
International Association for Impact
Assessment. It also became the first
multilateral development bank to
qualify for the joint ISO 14001 and
OHSAS 18001 certification which
indicates its commitment to sound
environmental practices at
headquarters.

Gender and Development

Lending activity in 2003 confirmed
that gender has broad relevance to
all ADB operations. A multidonor
Gender and Devdopment Cooperation Fund was launched in 2003 to
further expand ADB initiatives (sse
box on page 45 and http:// www.adb.org’
Documents Others’ GDCF/ GDCF pdf).

The Fund’s primary objective is to
promote gender equality and
women’s empowerment in the
region. The Fund will assist DMCs
to close gender gaps and to progress
toward achieving the MDGs and will
help ADB accelerate implementation
of the Policy and Action Plan on
Gender and Devdopment. Initial
contributors to the Fund were the
governments of Canada, Denmark,
and Norway.

ADB developed a rating scheme
to assess gender mainstreaming in
loan projects which has enabled the
systematic monitoring of loans for
their gender content. In 2003, the
number of loans with gender equity
objectives increased from 12 (14%)
in 2002 to 15 (22%). An additional
14 (21% loans were designed with
significant gender mainstreaming. In
total, nearly 43%of loans in 2003
mainstreamed gender issues,
compared with 31%in 2002. Loans
with gender mainstreaming were
represented in all three core strategic
areas of ADB operations—economic
growth, inclusive social development, and governance—and in
virtually all sectors that ADB
supports, including agriculture,
natural resource management,
microfinance, rural and urban
infrastructure, governance, health,
and education. Examples of
successful mainstreaming were
noted in sector and program loans
and in more conventional project
loans. Almost all loans classified
with a gender and devdopment
theme or with gender mainstreaming features were also classified as
poverty rdated, demonstrating that
addressing gender issues promotes
ADB's overall goal of poverty
reduction.

ADB recognized gender impact
in infrastructure and other sectors
such as energy and transport. While
those sectors present challenges in
gender mainstreaming, increasing
efforts were made. For example,
three road projects addressed HIV/
AlDS and trafficking of women and
children. In two of these projects
(Bangladesh and India), loan fundswere allocated to finance information campaigns targeting road
construction workers, transport
operators, sex workers, and decision
makers. Recent transport loans have
also required civil works contractors
to use local labor for road construction and to adhere to core labor
standards, including equal pay for
work of equal value and a prohibition on child labor. These examples
will be replicated in more physical
infrastructure and road projects in
future loans.

Aside from loan projects, ADB
implemented advisory and regional
technical assistance projects to
support policy reform and capacity

building to improve women’s
economic and social status and to
pursue regional cooperation in
promoting gender equality. In 2003,
two new regional technical
assistance projects were approved.
Phase 2 of the project Enhancing
Gender and Development Capacity
was approved following the success
of the first phase under which
locally recruited gender specialists
were placed in six ADB resident
missions to assist with gender
capacity building. Under the second
phase, three additional missions—
Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Sri
Lanka—were allocated gender
specialists. The second project,

Multidonor Gender and Development Cooperation Fund

ADB launched its multidonor Gender
and Development Cooperation Fund
in 2003. The Fund will accelerate
implementation of ADB's Gender and
Development Policy and Action Plan
by providing grants to development
projects to address gender equality,
social mobilization and training of
women’s groups, leadership training
for women, and gender capacity
building of executing agencies and
national women’s ministries to more
effectively mainstream gender issues
and concerns. Other potential areas
of financing under the Fund may

include the prevention of trafficking
of women and children and of
violence against women, the impact
of economic restructuring on female
workers, gender and trade, and
gender in postconflict reconstruction. Grants designed in association
with loan projects will also complement and strengthen gender
benefits and will contribute to
overall development effectiveness.
Collaboration and partnerships with
other stakeholders will constitute an
important element of the operation
of the Fund.

Promoting Gender Equality and the
Empowerment of Women, will
develop projects to address gender
equity, social mobilization, training
of women’s groups, and gender
capacity building of executing
agencies and national women’s
ministries to complement and
strengthen gender benefits of ADBsupported projects and to contribute
to overall devdopment effectiveness.
Collaboration and cooperation
with other development agencies
was further strengthened in 2003. A
joint country gender assessment was
undertaken with the World Bank in
Cambodia and was initiated in
Mongolia. The regional Gender and
Poverty Reduction Strategy
Workshop and the Gender and
Millennium Deveopment Goals
Workshop were cosponsored with
the World Bank and other agencies.

Promoting the Role
of the Private Sector in
Development

To achieve sustainable economic
growth, ADB operations promote a
conducive environment for private
sector development, including
supporting small and medium
enterprises and microfinance.
Increasingly, DMCs are using private
resources to meet the considerable

Bangladesh Road Network Improvement and Maintenance II Project (RNIMP)

National highways can inadvertently
contribute to the spread of HIV/AIDS
and the trafficking of women and
children; the RNIMP was designed to
address these issues. The objectives
are to combat trafficking, to reduce
the spread of HIWAIDS, and to pilot
and identify effective and viable
models of antitrafficking and
awareness programs on HIV/AIDS
that can be integrated into transport
sector operations.

The scope of the component
includes (i) strengthening the
capacity of governments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and

media to address issues of trafficking
and HIV/AIDS, (ii) public awareness
campaigns on HIV/AIDS and trafficking
in the cross-border areas of
Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar; and
(iii) capital investment of $40,000 for
physically upgrading each of three

literacy/awareness on HIV/AIDS and
trafficking. The scope will complement
ongoing and planned activities of
other key stakeholders. The main

Training will also be organized for
grassroots partners such as law

enforcement agencies, border
security personnel, communitybased organizations, local government staff, judicial officers, ward
commissioners, and informal local
leaders in three districts of the
project area. This training will build
on lessons learned from existing
initiatives within the country. The
Project will also include public
awareness campaigns through radio,
print, town hall meetings, and public
consultations. Workshops will be
held for groups such as truck and
bus drivers, construction workers,
and sex workers.

demand for social, financial, and
physical infrastructure that cannot
be met by the public sector alone.
Central to DMC good governance
and responsible fiscal management
are measures to shift risk away from
public to private parties better able
to manage and deliver services

(see box).

The public sector plays a major
rolein setting and enforcing rulesin
an unbiased manne. Private sector
development is most effective in
reducing poverty when it promotes
efficient and equitable growth
through competitive market activity
that is unimpeded by special
interests, either public or private.

In collaboration with other donors,
ADB promotes an enabling
environment that provides for
private property rights and sound

rules adhered to by market
participants and by the state. ADB
also assists DMCs in establishing
standards for the environment,
corporate governance, and labor. In
general, ADB helps DMCs design
policies and reforms that support
socially responsible private sector
development and activities consistent
with pro-poor devdopment.

Partnerships for Development

ADB makes direct investments in
private projects or intermediaries
without government guarantee. (For
more on private sector operations sse
tables 9-12 in the Statistical Annex.)
These investments bring
knowledge and solutions to the local
market. In addition to their direct
and multiplier effects, they
demonstrate to a global audience

Innovations in Private Sector Operations

In response to changing market
conditions and to the needs of its
developing member countries
(DMCs), ADB introduced innovative
solutions and risk-mitigating
measures to promote private sector
development and sustainable
growth. The key initiatives introduced included trade financing,
local currency financing, and use of
partial credit guarantees for small
and medium enterprise (SME)
development.

Trade Finance Facilitation
Program. A lack of trade lines with
international confirming banks has
restricted the ability of local banks
in developing countries to provide
trade finance to their clients, thus
inhibiting trade and economic
expansion.

ADBss Trade Finance Facilitation
Program (TFFP) is designed to
support intraregional and international trade by enhancing the
capacity of local banks to provide
trade finance services to private
sector enterprises. In addition, local
banks can establish strong working
relationships with regional and
international banks.

46 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

The TFFP also includes a component under which ADB will enter into a
risk-sharing arrangement with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development for guaranteeing letters
of credit issued by participating local
banks in the Central Asian republics.

Local Currency Financing. ADB
can play a vital role in DMCs to ensure
the sustainability of companies and/or
projects by extending long-term local
currency loans particularly to those
that generate revenues only in local
currency.

The Tala-Delhi Transmission Project
in India is financed under ADB's local
currency lending initiative to avoid
currency mismatch between the
currency of borrowing and the
currency of revenue, to supplement
the debt requirements of the Project,
and to provide additional risk-taking
capacity that commercial lenders were
unable to provide.

The Project will build the first
private sector power line in India from
Siliguri in West Bengal to Mandaula in
Uttar Pradesh near Delhi. The line will
form a part of India’s national transmission grid, and will transmit power
from the Tala Hydro Hectric Power

the potential for prudent investment
within the DMC. Direct investments
further complement the public
sector reform agenda of ADB’s
regional departments by working
within DMC rules and regulations
and by identifying practical changes
that would improve the business
climate.

ADB promotes good corporate
governance with competent due
diligence prior to investment and
continued commitment to corporate
responsibility within financial
intermediaries and companies
receiving investments. Private sector
enterprises are discovering that
traditional financial performance
will be insufficient to attract
investors.

ADB's major private sector
investment areas are infrastructure,

Project in Bhutan as well as transfer
surplus power from India’s eastern
region to the power-deficient
northern region.

The Project promotes subregional cooperation through energy
trades between Bhutan and India
and also promotes public-private
partnership efforts in India and
with ADB.

Small and Medium Enterprise
Development. The SME Sector
Development Program in Pakistan
supports the implementation of
policy reforms and the building of
market-based infrastructure for
business development and financial
services to SMEs. The Program also
includes a partial credit guarantee
facility to mobilize financing for
SMEs from private sector banks. This
is the first time that ADB anchored a
partial credit guarantee for the
private sector to a public sector
program loan. As a result of this
partnership, up to $65 million in
additional credit will be provided by
private sector banks to SMEs. The
Program is a model for publicprivate partnership that can be
replicated across the region.housing, security, resolution of
nonperforming loans, local currency
financing, trade finance, privatization, and restructuring. The
modalities used are long-term loans,
guarantees, equity investment, and
hybrid investment instruments such
as convertible bonds. An important
initiative in 2003 was the introduction of long-term domestic currency
finance to local enterprises. This
approach efficiently transfers risk to
those who are better able to manage
it. This value-added tool demonstrates ADB’s commitment to
improving design and implenentation based on lessons of the past
and on awareness of global market
dynamics.

ADB's regional departments
implement the private sector
development strategy in DMCsin
various ways including policy
dialogue, interregional initiatives,
technical assistance, loans, credit
enhancement, complementary
financing schemes, and equity.
ADB's public sector focus in terms
of private sector development is on
policies, legal and regulatory
frameworks, and public-private
partnerships.

Implementing the Private Sector
Development Strategy

In 2003, ADB mainstreamed private
sector deveopment into operations
by producing the Private Sector
Assessment Reference Guide
(Guide). The Guide focuses on
practical areas that use ADB's
strengths in public sector programs
to promote an enabling environment while identifying devdopmental investments that are best
implemented by the Private Sector
Operations Department. The key
added value of private sector
assessment is the close consultation between primary stakeholders
in the design of strategic and
operational priorities that use
DMC and ADB comparative
strengths; that incorporate global
lessons learned; that build on
complementary work of other
development institutions; and that

are sensitive to cultural, social, and
political realities.

In 2003, assessments were
completed or under preparation in
15 DMCs including Cambodia, PRC,
India, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR,
Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Nepal,
Papua New Guinea, Pakistan,
Philippines, Samoa, Sri Lanka,
Tajikistan, and Vanuatu; one
regional assessment was completed
for the Pacific. Assessments are
meant to provide the basis for a
country-specific, private sector
development strategy for each DMC.
The strategy is tailored to the
particular needs of each DMC; the
strategic focus and detailed plans of
the assessment inform the private
sector development component of
the country strategy and program.
In line with multilateral development bank cooperative efforts, ADB
is carrying out investment climate
studies with the World Bank in
three pilot countries: Indonesia,
Philippines, and Sri Lanka.

Supporting Regional
Cooperation and Integration for Development

Regional cooperation promotes
increased economic activity by
creating new opportunities,
generating more jobs, lowering
transaction and transportation costs,
improving access to existing and new
markets and resources by diminating
impediments to trade and investment, accelerating joint infrastructuredevdopment, diversifying
exports, and boosting trade and
investment. Increased economic
activity will in turn promote

economic growth and reduce poverty.

Regional projects can (i) bring
economic and social benefits to
countries working together that
otherwise may not occur through
individual efforts alone; (ii) build on
existing regional cooperation efforts
and work within the framework of
existing intergovernmental
arrangements; (iii) manage and
mitigate negative effects that spill

over from one country to neighboring countries; and (iv) strengthen
national development through
complementary, regional initiatives
that are beneficial, financially and
administratively feasible, and
sustainable. From 1997 to 2003,
roughly 7%of investments either
financed or planned to be financed
under the Asian Devdopment Fund
have supported regional cooperation. Cross-border investments by
private businesses are also increasingly important.

Four aspects of cooperation are
most important to the Asia and
Pacific region: addressing crossborder development challenges,
enhancing regional public goods,
promoting regional economic
integration, and exploiting
economies of scale.

Addressing Cross-Border
Challenges

Infectious diseases, maritime safety,
terrorism, money laundering,
trafficking of women and girls and
other crimes, air pollution, and
financial contagion are some of the
major cross-border challenges. In
early 2003, for example, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) spread
around the world, particularly in
many East Asian countries; however,
the collective efforts of countries
supported by regional and international organizations such as the
World Health Organization and the
Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) controlled the
spread by June. ADB estimated an
overall loss of demand and business
revenue of $60 billion, but the
outcome could have been much
worse. ADB quickly assessed country
readiness to effectively deal with the
crisis and to mobilize financial
support. Countries are currently using
those funds, expert assistance, and
training to strengthen their
surveillance and control systens. This
will not only hdp prevent a recurrence
of SARS, but will also help contain
the spread of new diseases.

To improve resilience to external
shocks and to prevent financial

members of ADB are enhancing
regional monetary and financial
cooperation. The ASEAN Surveillance Process and the ASEAN +3
Finance Ministers Process are
important initiatives. ADB's
Regional Economic Monitoring Unit
provides technical support to these
regional mechanisms. The ASEAN +3
Policy Dialogue focuses on
information exchange and peer
review of economic policies. The
Chiang Mai Initiative, launched by
ASEAN +3 countries, has resulted in
16 bilateral currency swaps totaling
about $36 billion. More agreements
are under negotiation. In addition,
efforts are under way to provide
regional support to the devdopment
of Asian bond markets under the
ASEAN +3 Bond Market Initiative.
To support the ASEAN +3 Initiative,
ADB approved and/or processed
regional technical assistance for
supporting guarantee operations,
improving settlement and clearing
systems, supporting regional credit
rating agencies, and developing the
Asian Bonds On-line web site.

Enhancing Regional
Public Goods

Addressing cross-border challenges
helps protect regional public goods,
including shared air space,

watersheds, fisheries, financial
standards, and security. For
example, ADB is hdlping Cambodia
improve the management of the
Tonle Sap—an important, vulnerable
wetland area in Southeast Asia, a
seasonal breeding and nursery
ground for migratory fish, and one
of the most productive freshwater
fisheries in the world. Sound
management of Tonle Sap is vital to
the health of the river system of six
Mekong countries. Partners are
working together with ADB support
to improve planning and coordination, to enhance the communities
roles, and to conserve biodiversity.
Although the costs of this project
are largely borne by Cambodia, other
countries in the Greater Mekong
Subregion are contributing to
complementary efforts by the
Mekong River Commission and
other bodies in managing the overall
river system to maximize benefits
for all.

Regional bodies are moving to
agree on international standards
for financial transactions and to
make suggestions for improving
regulatory environments to prevent
money laundering and related
crimes. ADB has supported this
work in many ways including
publishing a detailed manual of
conventions, principles,

Initiatives to Boost Regional Cooperation

Despite difficulties, the Central Asian
republics have made some headway
with cooperative investments in
transport, energy, and trade facilitation; and improved conditions in
Afghanistan are opening up the
possibility for transport and energy
links between Central and South
Asia. To support such initiatives, ADB
organized a ministerial conference in
2003 for Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The
ministers agreed to work toward a
trade agreement that would bring
the five countries into conformity
with international transport and

48 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

trade conventions, which would
modernize border crossings, and
which would establish a transport
and trade forum where issues can be
discussed and resolved. In a separate
initiative earlier in the year, heads of
state of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and
Turkmenistan met to discuss a major
cross-border gas pipeline. If studies
presently under way are favorable
and financing and implementation
are successful, the pipeline will
transport up to 30 billion cubic
meters of gas per year from
Turkmenistan to consumers in South
Asian economies.

recommendations, guiddines, modd
laws, and other reference materials.

In another example, nearly all
Pacific members of ADB have signed
aconvention ensuring the conservation of straddling and highly
migratory fish stocks including the
introduction of total allowable
catches for various species.

Promoting Economic Integration

Regional economic integration
promotes economic growth and
strengthens competitiveness. The
Greater Mekong Subregion program
has improved transport connectivity
through strategic economic
corridors and has promoted and
coordinated investments in
telecommunications and power.
These investments are supported by
negotiated agreements and by
institutional mechanisms that will
facilitate cross-border transport,
power interconnection, and trade.

Economic cooperation is largely
driven by private businesses that
have linked up across borders to
integrate production networks that
supply raw materials, manufacture
components, assemble finished
goods, and move them through
regional and global distribution
chains to consumers. Assisted by
ADB, many DMCs are supporting
this process by improving their
regulatory environments and by
freeing up trade.

Most DMCs are already
participating in various trade and
integration schemes such as the
ASEAN Free Trade Area and the
ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement. These devdopments
increasingly point to an outwardlooking region, an essential building
block to closer integration with the
global economy. ADB promotes
accession to the WTO and
compliance with the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
the numerous multilateral
agreements that facilitate DMC
growth through exports. Technical
assistance was provided to strengthen the capacity of DMCs to more
effectively integrate into the WTOmultilateral trading system, which
included increased awareness

of issues that will be covered by
the new WTO round (Doha
Deveopment Agenda) for policy
formulation.

The Central Asian republics are
landlocked and remote from major
world markets, so ADB supported
capacity building for trade
facilitation to improve economic
integration. A combined regional
seminar and training session
attended by the Customs Coordination Committee, a group of heads of
customs administrations of the East
and Central Asian countries, was
organized to strengthen capacities
for facilitating intraregional trade
through joint-border processing,
transit, and information and
communication technology for
information sharing and customs
modernization.

In South Asia, technical
assistance supported the integration
of national economies of the South
Asia Subregional Economic
Cooperation group for efficient use
of manpower, infrastructure, trade
opportunities, and economic
resources. A comprehensive study
explored the role of private sectors
and governments and further
assistance and investment projects
at country and interregional levds
by ADB and other development
partners to promote private sector
cooperation. In addition, increased
trade was promoted through an
investment project in Bangladesh
which includes improving the border
access road in PanchagahrBanglabandh to facilitate crossborder traffic from Nepal.

In the Brune DarussalamIndonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East
ASEAN Growth Area, business
cooperation and networking among
SMEs included more private sector
support. Under this initiative,
national and subregional competitiveness is enhanced through the

(i) renoval of barriers to the
efficient flow of goods and
investments; (ii) creation of interregional industry and SME
associations as mechanisms for
promoting cooperation among the
private sectors; and (iii) dissemination of information on trade and
investment opportunities.

Exploiting Economies of Scale

The final aspect of regional
cooperation takes advantage of
economies of scalein providing
specialized and/or high-cost public
goods and services. For example,
ADB and its partners supported a
regional center in the Fiji Islands,
which provides specialized training
in public financial management and
in economic and monetary statistics
so small island countries have access
to world-class expertise. In another
example, ADB’s partnership with the
Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research helped ensure
that research activities of its
members link complex projects to
advance regional knowledge on the
genetic resources of the coconut
palm and on sustainable rice-based
cropping systems in rainfed
lowlands among other topics.

Lessons from ADB Experience

Opportunities for regional
cooperation are wide-ranging, and
several broad principles apply. First,
preliminary findings suggest that
one can measure the value regional
cooperation adds to economic
growth, one of the three pillars of
ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy.
Although the incomes of the poor
and vulnerable may not rise initially,
they will improve over time.
Second, successful regional
cooperation includes participation
of central and local governments,
the private sector, and civil society.
ADB's role as an “honest broker”
can facilitate trust, provide
knowledge, support capacity
building needs to manage regional
cooperation, or help mobilize public
and private financing. ADB has
found that the most successful
projects use appropriate institutional
mechanisms and have sufficient
flexibility built into then to handle
problems arising from the diverse
interests of cooperating partners. An
appropriate mechanism needs to be
judged based on its context. In the
Greater Mekong Subregion, for
example, operational review and
coordination are carried out by
regular meetings of senior officials
and ministers supported by a small
secretariat at ADB. In the Pacific,
cooperation tends to be anchored in
established regional institutions
such as the Pacific Forum.

Finally, successful cooperation
takes time, patience, political
commitment, and willingness to
compromise. One mechanism found
useful in Asia and the Pacific and
other regions is to ensure that
countries are engaged in many
different types of cooperation,
thereby ensuring that a broad range
of stakeholders in each country is
benefiting. In such situations, the
particular stakeholders involved
have the incentive to cooperate as
lack of cooperation might threaten
progress on other efforts. Different
stakeholders in the full range of
cooperative efforts hdlp ensure that
their counterparts will all live up to
their respective agreements.

ADB's regional cooperation
strategies and programs improve
cooperation. Based on an analysis of
contextual issues and the impact of
past assistance, focal areas for
assistance are set out for the next
3 years. They include an investment
program, monitorable performance
benchmarks, collaborative
approaches, risk-minimizing
mechanisms, and arrangements for
performance monitoring and
evaluation. The first one approved
in 2003 was for the Pacific in July.

ASIA

The region extends from the
Republic of Korea’ in the east to
Azerbaijan in the Southern Caucasus
in the west and is comprised of the
People’s Republic of China (PRC),
Mongolia, and the six Central Asian
republics (CARs). It covers a vast
land mass and a wide range of
economic, political, social, and
natural conditions. The population
is nearly 1.4 billion and combined
gross domestic product (GDP) is
$1.8 trillion. The CARs, Azerbaijan,
and Mongolia are still largely
dependent on the production and
export of natural resources, so their
performance is heavily dependent on

international commodity prices.
Because of the strong growth of the
PRC economy and the continued
upswing in commodity prices, the
region again performed well
economically in 2003 and also
enjoyed both social and political
stability, including Azerbaijan’s
successful political transition.

ADB's regional efforts were
implemented under its Central Asia
Regional Economic Cooperation
program. Almost all DMCsin the
region are members though
Turkmenistan has not yet joined.
Since March 2002, activities have
been guided and supervised by an
official institutional mechanism
headed by a ministerial committee.
At its second meeting in Tashkent
in November 2003, the committee
reiterated its commitment to
promote regional cooperation and
urged promotion of investment
projects in the transport, trade, and
energy sectors. The committee
endorsed the agreement the
development partners reached
during the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Devdopment’s
2003 annual meeting for ADB to be
the secretariat for the mechanism.
ADB is currently preparing a
regional cooperation strategy to
ensure effective cooperation.

Some regional initiatives taken
up outside the Central Asia Regional
Economic Cooperation framework
saw further progress during the year.

ADB strengthened its presence in
the region with the opening of a
resident mission in Dushanbe,
Tajikistan, and the appointment of
acountry director for Azerbaijan to
head the resident mission in Baku.
Coordination of ADB’s activities and
operations with other devdopment
partners was strengthened through
active collaboration in the Commonwealth of Independent States-7
initiative; a visit to European Union
headquarters for program coordination; senior, official consultations
with the World Bank; participation
in International Monetary Fund and

Facility missions; and formal
consultations with the European

framework for banks under
technical assistance on PRC banking
laws and regulations. Advice was
provided on anti-money laundering,
including comments on the three
rules for banking-type financial
institutions adopted by the People's
Bank of China.

Technical assistance further
supported work that culminated in
the amendment of the Central
Banking and Commercial Banking
laws, and the formulation of the
Bank Supervision Law, all of which
were adopted in December. These
laws addressed issues raised by
technical assistance. Recommendations were also made for laws and
regulations regarding credit
information bureaus, financial
conglomerates, and bank insolvency.

Other milestones in ADB's
support for strengthening the rule
of law in 2003 included the
passage of the Administrative
Licensing Law and making
effective the ADB-supported
Regulations on the Legal Aid
System, the Law on Promoting
Small and Medium Enterprises,
the Government Procurement Law,
and the Clean Production Law.

At the sector level, the study
completed in 2003 on Project Cost
Estimates and Loan Savings provided
recommendations to improve
estimates and monitoring of costs
during project implenentation.

MEKONG

The countries in the Mekong region
generally have made steady progress
in poverty reduction and hunger
alleviation over the past decade.
Sound macroeconomic policies and
growth have reduced poverty,
especially in Viet Nam where the
poverty rate decreased to 28.9% in
2002. Poverty, however, is still
prevalent with the poorest segment
representing only 6.9%of regional
wealth.

The percentage below the
minimum level of dietary energy
consumption declined overall in the
past decade, but performance varied
across the region and averaged 19%
in 1998-2000.

Primary school enrollment
reached 89% in 1999-2000, though
more efforts must be made to ensure
that students complete the full
course. The gainsin enrollment are
reflected in increased literacy rates.

The under-five and infant
mortality rates declined to 56 and
43 per 1,000 live births, respectively,
in 2001, compared with 67 and 50
in 1990, but greater gains must be
made if the region is to achieve the
MDGs. Maternal mortality rates
have improved, especially in
Cambodia where the rate dropped
from 900 per 100,000 live births in
1990 to 437 in 2000. In the same
period, Viet Nam's maternal
mortality rate dropped from 160 to
100. The fight against HIV/AIDS
and other diseases is important in
maximizing human resources and in
containing escalating costs of health

women ranged from virtually nil
to 3%

The region has a rich and diverse
natural resource base which has
historically supported economic
development and has sustained rural
livelihoods. In recent years, these
resources have come under
increasing stress due to rapid
demographic changes and unsustainable exploitation among other
reasons. Forests accounted for about
41%of the land area in 2000. In
2002, 69% of the rural population
and 91%of the urban population
enjoyed clean water, and 82% of
urban residents had access to
improved sanitation.

In September 2003, Cambodia
acceded to the World Trade
Organization (WTO). Upon
ratification, Cambodia will become
one of the first least-devel oped
countries to join the WTO through
the full working party negotiation
process. Accession is also envisaged
for Viet Nam in the near future.
Regionally, substantial progress has
been made in improving the debt
situation. Debt service as a
percentage of exports was roughly
halved (from 10.2%to 5.5%) from
1990 to 2001.

ADB assisted with water resource
management while supporting
decentralization, rural development,
natural resource management, and
agriculture reforms. Second, to assist
human and social development,
ADB facilitated sector-wide
approaches in education and health
and provided support to improve
water supply. Third, to promote
private sector development, ADB
contributed to the development of
the nation’s road network while
taking a key role in governance and
financial reforms and a supportive
rolein energy. In addition, ADB
provided strategic support to
governance in economic planning,
public finance, and legal reform
while ensuring that an appropriate
gender focus existed in all
interventions.

Work was completed on the
Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and
Public Expenditure Review that was
implemented with the World Bank
and DFID. The Review involved
intensive discussions with the
Government on streamlining

eTHE PACIFIC

The aggregate GDP of the Pacific
DMCs—Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,
Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated
States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua
New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon
Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu,
and Vanuatu—increased by 2.7% as
all economies except Nauru and
Timor-Leste expanded. Global
economic growth accelerated and
underpinned generally higher
international prices for Pacific DMC
primary exports. Higher oil, gold,
and copper pricesin particular
benefited the largest economy—
Papua New Guinea. Solomon
Islands emerged from 3 years of
recession as primary production
grew rapidly and law and order were
restored under a multicountry
rehabilitation assistance mission.
Tourism rebounded despite the
conflict in Iraq and the outbreak of
SARS, stimulating service sector
activity and encouraging investment
in infrastructure, especially in the
Fiji Islands.

Weak international financial
markets kept returns on trust funds
held by Kiribati and Tuvalu low, but
these markets strengthened toward
the end of the year. Timor-Leste’s
contraction mainly resulted from
drought and from the scaling down
of United Nations activities, while

Nauru remained afflicted by economic
and financial mismanagement.

Political uncertainty and poor
governance continued to be
concerns in several Pacific DMCs.
Renewed attention was given to
pooling resources in governance, air
transport, security, and international
crime. The Pacific Is'and Countries
Trade Agreement, which provides
for a move toward free trade among
14 Pacific countries over a 10-year
period, came into force in April, and
at the subsequent forum for
economic ministers, delegates agreed
that acore of economic policies
should address poverty. ADB's effort
to assess the extent of poverty in the
Pacific and to contribute to its
reduction continued in 2003 through
aregional technical assistance project
that included interviews of the
poorest segments of the population
in several Pacific countries. Provision
of basic social services, job creation,
and access to markets were identified
as the highest priorities of the poor
in the region.

At the national leva, the main
policy focus in the majority of
Pacific DMCs was on maintaining
macroeconomic stability through
sound fiscal management as a key
condition for encouraging private
investment and economic growth.

sector reform programs varied. The
governments of the Marshall Islands
and the Federated States of
Micronesia finalized negotiations for
anew 20-year phase of the economic
and financial conditions under the
Compact of Free Association with
the United States (US). The donor
community continued providing
significant assistance to TimorLeste, the newest country in the
region, which is making slow but
steady progress in building new
institutions and capacity and in
establishing a national legal and
regulatory framework.

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The
strategy focused on building
sustainable capacity for sound
economic and public sector
management and improving public
infrastructure to support private
sector growth. The program
emphasized building public sector
management capacity by improving
planning capability and cost control.
Tourism has underpinned the
country’s economic growth in recent
years. The Government encouraged
diversification into fisheries in 2003
while also helping local black pearl
production to be more competitive.

standards of governance, particularly
by strengthening the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services and
public enterprises; and (iii) enhance
the scope and opportunities for
private sector development. A more
efficient use of resources is expected
to improve competitiveness and to
attract private investment. The
strategy also (i) ensured access to
safe water and proper sanitation in
South Tarawa; (ii) improved living
conditions and access to basic social
services on the outer islands;

(iii) promoted greater domestic use

strengthening central governance to
improve social services, create an
environment conducive for private
sector development, and strengthen
central economic policy formulation
and planning.

ADB's assistance was designed
to complement and augment all
other external assistance. Traditional social order and dependence
on relatively large levels of US
funding may have deterred
improvement in public and private
sector productivity, including
reforming traditional land tenure,
private competition, and public
sector management. This was
addressed by fully incorporating
participation at all levels of decision
making for ADB activities.

national and state governments
particularly in economic policy
formulation and implementation
and in public financial management.

frameworks (agriculture and
fisheries), to enhance productivity
(skills deveopment and microfinance services), and to improve
market access by investing in
transport infrastructure particularly
in rural areas. In the social sectors,
ADB continued to assist in health
policy devdopment and to support
service delivery. It agreed to help
establish HIV/AIDS outpatient
support centers and to prepare a
literacy project.

Solomon Islands

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The
Regional Assistance Mission to
Solomon Islands in the fidd since
July 2003 helped restore law and
order and fiscal discipline. The key
challenge facing the Government and
its devdopment partners is how best
to use this opportunity to tackle the
underlying causes of conflict; to
address fundamental structural
constraints in the economy; and to
build credible, capable national and
provincial publicinstitutions. Major
challenges included shifting the
overall focus from short-term
stabilization toward a medium- and
long-term roadmap; building
capacity; strengthening donor
coordination between the Government and donors and among donors;
and ensuring pro-poor, private
sector-led economic growth.

development programs. ADB's
strategy continued to support the
improvement of public infrastructure, largely through investment
projects funded by the multidonor
Trust Fund for East Timor. ADB
technical assistance in 2003
supported these projects with
capacity building. It also focused on
strengthening the microfinance
institution—enhancing its sustainability and enabling it to expand to
rural areas and improve the microcredit access of the rural poor,
particularly women. The Government’s public financial management
capacity was strengthened by
continuing advisory support on the
issue of Timor Sea oil and gas and
by assisting in the development of
trade statistics.

Several technical assistance grants
helped the Government develop a
policy framework for poverty analysis
including the establishment of
baseline data on its extent, nature,
and dimensions. They also hdped
the Government to decide on its
poverty reduction strategy. Assistance
was provided to develop infrastructure expenditure programs to
enhance the Government's ability to
develop a financially viable and
fiscally responsible budget. This work
enhanced the linkages between the
national deveopment plan and the
combined budget sources and
supported government decision
making and priority setting within
and across sectors.

Vanuatu

Strategy and Policy Dialogue.
Although Vanuatu has good growth
prospects due to abundant natural
resources and increased tourism
potential, its growth was hampered
by frequent shifts in policies, the
high cost of doing business, and
difficulties in enforcing contractual
agreements. The country suffers
from low adult literacy and primary
and secondary school enrollment
rates and from poor access to health
and social services. ADB's strategy
was three-pronged: improving
economic management and
governance; reducing poverty; and
creating an enabling environment
for private sector development. In
September, ADB assisted the
Government in conducting a donor

SOUTH ASIA

Economic growth in South Asian
DMCs—Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—rebounded
to 6.9% in 2003. Inflation remained
at 5% and the current account
balance showed a surplus of 0.6%of
GDP. Increased remittances from
abroad and strong export growth
allowed the rapid buildup of foreign
exchange reserves; India’s alone
reached $106 billion. This led to
monetary expansion in some
countries and its attendant pressure
to appreciate exchange rates,
especially against the US dollar.

A key factor in the improved
economic performance was aboveaverage agriculture sector production
due to exceptionally good rainfall.

( ) Negative.

This led to arecovery in agriculture
incomes that in turn boosted
consumption and investment.
Another factor was improvements in
the global economy that increased
exports. This, added to remittances
and expansion in the service sector,
especially in information technology,
boosted domestic demand.

Fiscal consolidation frees up
resources and encourages private
investment. Several countriesin the
region made progress in this area by
collecting more revenue and
controlling expenditures. More needs
to be done, however, particularly in
India where the fiscal situation could
deteriorate because of upcoming
elections. Structural constraints will
also inhibit sustainable growth.
These include weak institutions and
regulatory and legal frameworks and
inadequate competition in the
manufacturing sector due to policy
restrictions, labor market inflexibility,
corruption, and poor governance. In
the medium term, the South Asian
countries must address their fiscal
problems or rising imbalances could
hamper future growth.

Most loan projects in the region
are designed to contribute to the
MDG of eradicating extreme poverty
and hunger.

tarian assistance to reconstruction
and development assistance. The
accent is on broad-based, pro-poor
growth which is also key to securing
peace and stability. In the transport
and energy sectors, ADB supported
the rehabilitation of national roads,
power transmission facilities, and
the gas subsector to help revive the
national economy. ADB operations
in the agriculture and natural
resource sector rehabilitated
production and irrigation systems
and worked toward eliminating
poppy cultivation. ADB also
provided technical assistance for
public administration reform,
budgetary management, poverty
assessment, and statistical capacity
building.

Since September 2001, ADB has
assumed a key rolein theinternational community's efforts to plan
for and assist in Afghanistan’s
reconstruction, drawing on its
experience in providing postconflict
assistance in Cambodia, Sri Lanka,
Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste. At the
Tokyo Conference, ADB pledged
$500 million in concessional loans
and grants by June 2004. ADB
assigned this assistance the highest
priority. By December 2003, ADB
had approved the delivery of
$325 million in Asian Development
Fund loans and technical assistance,
thus fulfilling two thirds of its
pledge. In addition, ADB administered $65.6 million in cofinanced
grant projects.

important for delivery of services. In
the power sector, ADB aimed to assist
the Government's reform program
especially in focal states. Energy
projects concentrated on environmentally friendly sources of power such as
renewable energy and hydropower and
promoted the use of cleaner fuds to

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. Sri
Lanka's CSP 2004-2008 was

strategy proposes a higher level of
lending than in the past to support
peace and rehabilitation, economic
growth, and the economic reform
agenda of the Government. In May
2003, the donors’ meeting in Tokyo
pledged $4.5 billion in support of
the country’s economic recovery and
the ongoing peace process. The
strategy, in line with the PPA
signed by the Government and
ADB in March 2002, aimed to
reduce the wide income disparity
within the region due to civil
conflict and also to improve
governance and support for private
sector growth.

A broad range of economic,
thematic, and sector work began,
specifically assessments on the
country’s borrowing capacity and
ability to absorb ordinary capital
resources, and also on gender,
governance, and the private sector.
These will strengthen the formulation of new projects, improve sector
strategies, and promote informed
policy debate. Ongoing technical
assistance supported streamlining
budgeting, setting up a multisector
utility, and restructuring public
enterprises.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Eight loans totaling
$275.3 million were approved. These
included support for distance
education, water supply and
sanitation, conflict area rehabilitation, and rural finance. Eleven
technical assistance projects
amounting to $5.4 million were also

called for reducing poverty and
regional inequality by improving
governance, meeting local needs
through decentralization, promoting
human devedopment, mainstreaming

Cumulative ADB Lending

Loans and technical assistance.
No loans or technical assistance
projects were approved in 2003. One
loan was closed.

 

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. ADB's
operational strategy supported the
Government's devdopment priorities
in the Medium-Term Philippine
Devdopment Plan and aimed to
reduce poverty, promote market
devdopment, improve social service
deivery, protect the environment, and
promote good governance. ADB
assistance included activities for
improving financial markets especially
in support of SME and rural
microcredit services, urban development, power and health sector
reforms, rural roads, protecting the
environment, and strengthening the
judiciary system.

Policy dialogue focused on
supporting ongoing program loans
(including strengthening financial
markets, improving Metro Manila
air quality, and rehabilitating the
Pasig River), judiciary reform, antimoney laundering, water source
development, and health sector
reforms. ADB continued dialogue
with the Government on reformsin

 

the power sector, including the
privatization of the National Power
Corporation. Significant efforts were
made to resolve governance issues
related to land acquisition and
resettlement under ongoing projects.
Important nonlending activities
included (i) improving the quality of
the active loan portfolio; (ii) joint
publication with the Government
and the World Bank of the Public
Expenditure, Procurement and
Financial Management Review; and
(iii) preparation of the Decentralization and Service Delivery Study
Phase. In addition, ADB joined
other development partners in the
Devedopment Innovative Market
Place program which supports pilot
poverty reduction projects prepared
by civil society groups. To support
preparation of the CSP in 2004,
assessments were undertaken on
governance, gender, environment,
private sector, and poverty.

Loans and Technical Assistance.
ADB approved three loans totaling
$183.8 million for anonbank
financial governance program, new
water source development, and
development of poor urban
communities. Seven technical
assistance grants totaling
$4.4 million were approved.

74 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKManagement's
Discussion and
Analysis

DB isan international

development finance

institution whose vision is

to make the Asia and

Pacific region free of

poverty. ADB was
established in 1966 through the
“Agreement Establishing the Asian
Devedopment Bank” (the Charter),
ratified by 31 members to promote
the social and economic deveopment
of the region and to reduce poverty.
ADB currently has 63 members, of
which 45 arein the region.

ADB provides various forms of
financial assistance to its developing
member countries (DMCs). The
main instruments are loans,
technical assistance, grants,
guarantees, and equity investments.
These instruments are financed
through ordinary capital resources
(OCR), Special Funds, and various
trust funds. OCR and Special Funds
are used to finance operations that
are solely under ADB administration. Trust funds are externally
funded and are administered by
ADB on behalf of donors. The
Charter requires that funds from
each resource be kept separate from

the others.
ADB also provides policy
dialogues and advisory services, and

enhancement products such as :
guarantees, (For moreddalls =e ¢ Financial Statements

http:// www.adb.org/ .)Ordinary Capital Resources

Funding for OCR comes from three
distinct sources: funds borrowed
from private placements and capital
markets, paid-in capital provided by
shareholders, and accumulated
retained income (reserves). The
financial strength of OCR is largely
based on the support of shareholders and on financial policies and
practices. Shareholder support is
reflected in the form of capital
backing from members and in the
record of borrowing members in
meeting their debt-service
obligations.

Borrowed funds, together with
equity, are used to fund OCR
lending and investment activities as
well as general operations. Loans are
generally made to private borrowers
and to DMCs that have attained a
higher level of economic development. Public sector loans are priced
on acost pass-through basis in
which the cost of funding the loans
plus a lending spread is passed
through to the borrowers. Private
sector loans are priced based on
market practice.

With the introduction of London
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)based loans (LBL) and the retire.
ment of other loan products, ADB
has evolved into a full-fledged
LIBOR-based lender. In view of the
more stable nature of the pool-based
loan compared with that of the
LIBOR-based loan and the general
trend in theinterest rate environment, loan prepayments of
$5.9 billion by some member
country borrowers were made.

In addition to direct lending,
ADB also provides guarantees to
assist DMC governments and private
borrowers in securing commercial
funds for ADB-assisted projects.
ADB has experienced strong and
growing demand for guarantees as
credit enhancement products.

Financial Policies

ADB adheres to prudent financial
policies and practices that have
allowed it to build reserves, to

76 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

diversify its funding resources, and
to manage a portfolio of liquid
investments and a variety of risks.
ADB also requires thorough
technical, financial, and economic
justifications for all loans.

A review of ADB’s income and
reserves policy in 1997 indicated
that the earning base, i.e, useable
paid-in capital, reserves, and surplus,
ultimately determined ADB's riskbearing capacity. The review
concluded that its risk-bearing
capacity should therefore focus on
the adequacy of reserves and
surplus. Thus, ADB continued to
use the reserve-to-loan ratio (RLR)
and interest coverage ratio (ICR) as
decisive financial indicators. As the
ratio of equity to loans is also part
of the earning base, it was used in
conjunction with the RLR and the
ICR.

The ICR is the ratio of net
income to financial expenses plus a
factor of one. It indicates the extent
to which net income can fall
without jeopardizing ADB's ability
to service expenses from current
income. The RLR, on the other
hand, is the ratio of total reserves to
the sum of outstanding loans
including the present value of
guarantees and equity investments
less the cumulative provision against
possible losses. The RLR measures
the adequacy of ADB's earning base
relative to its loan assets. The
minimum levels for these financial
indicators are 1.31 for the |CR and
25%for the RLR. At the end of
2003, ADB’s ICR was 1.62 and the
RLR was 36.72%

To ensure it has adequate riskbearing capacity, ADB reviews its
income outlook annually. Based on
that review, the Board of Directors
allocates a portion of the previous
year’s actual net income to reserves
to ensure that the level is commensurate with the level set in the 1997
Review. In addition, to the extent
feasible, it allocates part of the net
income to support devdopment
activities in its DMCs. In May 2003,
the Board of Governors approved
allocations of 2002 net income of

$473 million to ordinary reserves,
$224.8 million to the cumulative
revaluation adjustments account,
$200 million to the Asian Development Fund (ADF), and $80 million
to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund (TASF). For 2003, the Board
of Directors approved a waiver of
50%of the front-end fee for loans
approved in 2003 to benefit public
sector borrowers.

In February 2003, the Board of
Directors reviewed ADB’s lending
and borrowing limitations and
approved the following policies to
take effect immediately: (i) gross
outstanding borrowing is limited to
no more than the sum of callable
capital from nonborrowing
members, paid-in capital, and
reserves (including surplus), subject
to the Charter limit of 100% of
callable capital; and (ii) outstanding
loan commitments, i.e, the sum of
outstanding disbursed and
undisbursed loans, equity investments, and guarantees, is limited to
no more than the sum of the total
callable paid-in capital and reserves
(including surplus but excluding
special reserves).

In March 2003, the Board of
Directors reviewed the position of
OCR. The review followed a
medium-term capital management
approach within the approved
financial framework for assessing
the adequacy of current and
prospective lending and borrowing
headroom. The review concluded
that ADB's capital position is
comfortable enough to support the
projected lending operations
through 2005 and to maintain a
prudent buffer against exchange rate
fluctuations and a margin for
unutilized lending capacity. As of
31 December 2003, headroom for
lending and borrowing was
$19.9 billion and $16.4 billion,
respectively (compared with
$12.2 billion and $14.5 billion,
respectively in 2002).

2003. ADB prepares its financial
statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (US).
Effective 1 January 2001, ADB
adopted Financial Accounting
Standards (FAS) 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” and its rdated
amendments (collectively referred to
as FAS 133). FAS 133 allows hedge
accounting only if qualifying criteria
are met. An assessment of those
criteria indicated that most of
ADB's derivative transactions are

highly effective in hedging the
underlying transactions and are
appropriate for reducing funding
costs. However, applying FAS 133
hedge criteria does not entirdy
reflect ADB's risk management and
hedging strategies. Compliance with
hedge accounting would impose
undue constraints on future
borrowing, loan, and hedge
programs and would likely detract
from minimizing the cost of
borrowing, which ADB believes is
moreimportant. Accordingly, ADB
elected to adopt non-hedge

Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 133 was implemented in 2001. Accordingly, statutory reported basis is the same as pre-FAS 133 basis prior to 2001.
Net of administration charge allocated to the Asian Development Fund and 2003 loan origination costs that are deferred.

Discussion and Analysis of
Current Value

The table on page 78 presents
estimates of the economic value of
ADB's financial assets and liabilities
taking into consideration changes in
interest rates, exchange rates, and
credit risks. Current value reflects

the exit price for financial instruments with liquid markets and is
the estimated fair value. For
financial instruments with no
market quotations, current valueis
estimated using the expected cash
flow streams discounted with the
appropriate interest and exchange
rates. The reversal of FAS 133
effects removes their impact as these
effects are a part of the current
value adjustment. (For details, see
tables above.)

Current Value Balance Sheets

Loan Portfolio. Most loans are made
to or guaranteed by ADB members.
ADB does not sail its loans believing
that there is no comparable market
for them. The current value of loans
incorporates Management's best
estimate of expected cash flows,
including interest. Estimated cash
flows from principal repayments,
interest, and other loan charges are
discounted by the applicable market

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 79yield curves for ADB’s funding cost
plus ADB's lending spread.

The current value also includes
an appropriate credit risk assessment. To recognize the risk inherent
in these and other potential overdue
payments, the value of the loans for
private sector operations is adjusted
through loan loss provisioning. ADB
has never suffered a loss on public
sector loans except opportunity
losses resulting from the difference
between the present value of
payments for interest and charges,
according to the loan’s contractual
terms, and the actual timing of cash
flow. In 2003, ADB recognized loan
loss provisions against one public
sector loan totaling $240,000. The
positive adjustment of $1.9 billion
(7.5% of loan balance)—from the
FAS 133 basis of $25.8 billion to the
current value basis of $27.7 billion—
indicates that the loans in the
portfolio, on average, carry a higher
interest rate than ADB would
currently originate.

Investments. Under both the
reported and current value basis,
investment securities and related
derivatives are carried and reported
at fair values based on market
quotations. In the case of instruments
for which market quotations are not
readily available, the current value is
calculated using market-based
valuation modds incorporating
observable market data. The net
positive adjustment of $55 million
resulted from unrealized gains on
asset swaps due to increasing
interest rates.

Equity Investments. Equity
investments with readily determinable fair values are reported at fair
value. Equity investments without
market value are reported at cost
less allowance for losses, which
represents a fair approximation of
the current value.

Receivables from Members.
These consist of unrestricted and
maybe restricted promissory notes.
The current value is based on the cash
flow of the projected encashment of
the promissory notes discounted
using appropriate interest rates.

80 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Borrowings after Swaps. The
current value of these liabilities
includes the fair value of the
amounts borrowed and the
associated financial derivative
instruments. The current value of
these liabilities is calculated using
market-based valuation modes
incorporating observable market data.

The $1.2 billion increase in the
valuation of these liabilities—
equivalent to 4.8%of the value of
the borrowing portfolio after swaps,
from the FAS 133 reported basis of
$25.8 billion to the current value
basis of $27.0 billions due to the
fact that the average cost of the
portfolio is higher than the market
rate at which ADB can currently
obtain new funding.

Current Value Income
Statements

The total current value adjustment
of $746.7 million ($429 million in
2002) in the table on the preceding
page represents the change in the
current value of all of ADB's
financial instruments during the
year. The adjustment reflects
changes in both interest rates and in
currency exchange rates in 2003.

Current Value Adjustments. All
unrealized gains and losses are
presented as current value adjustments. Thus, the change in mark-tomarket unrealized losses on
investments of $137.5 million as
well as the $18 million provision for
loan losses are presented as part of
the adjustment.

For 2003, current value net
income was $1.4 billion compared
with preFAS 133 net income of
$616.6 million and statutory
reported net income of $438.2 million (setable on page 79). The
$746.7 million increase from the
pre-FAS 133 basis to current value
basis (i.e, current value adjustment)
comprises a net effect of $588.9 million from the valuation of all
outstanding financial instruments
and $304.6 million of favorable
translation adjustments net of
$137.5 million of unrealized
investment losses and minimum

pension liability adjustments of
$9.3 million (ssetable on page 79).

Impact of Changes in Interest
Rates. The net increase in the
current value adjustments on the
balance sheet during 2003 was
$588.9 million. It was a result of a
$972.3 million decrease in unrealized losses in the borrowing
portfolio, a $64.3 million increase in
unrealized gains in the net
investment swap portfolio, and a
$53.9 million decrease in unrealized
losses in other assets offset by a
decrease in unrealized gains in the
loan portfolio of $501.6 million. The
current value changes reflect several
increases in interest rates for the
year, which translated to a decrease
in the current value adjustments for
some of the portfolios (loans and
financial derivative instruments
associated with the borrowing
portfolio).

Impact of Changes in
Exchange Rates. The increase in the
current value adjustment from 2002
to 2003 was partly attributed to
changes in exchange rates. Translation adjustments, reflected as part of
“Accumulated Other Comprehensive
Income” under the reported basis,
are presented as current value
adjustments (sse table on page 78). A
significant portion of ADB's loans,
investments, and borrowings was
denominated in non-US dollar
currencies. The general weakening of
the US dollar against other major
currencies in 2003 resulted in a
significant positive translation
adjustment of $304.6 million.

Operating Activities

In pursuing its objectives, ADB
provides financial assistance
through loans, technical assistance,
guarantees, and equity investments
to its DMCs to hap then meet their
development needs.

Loans. Until 30 June 2001,
ADB's three windows for loans from
OCR were the pool-based multicurrency loan (PMCL), the pool-based
single-currency loan (PSCL) in US
dollars, and the market-based loan
(MBL). With the introduction ofLBL products on 1 July 2001,
PMCLs and MBLs were no longer
offered and on 1 July 2002, the
PSCL in US dollars was retired. The
LBL is a timely response to borrower
demand for loan products that suit
project needs and external debt riskmanagement strategies. LBL
products give borrowers a high
degree of flexibility in managing
interest rate and exchange rate risks
and at the same time provide low
intermediation risk to ADB.

OCR Loan Approvals,
Disbursements, Repayments, and
Prepayments. In 2003, 38 OCR
loans totaling $4.7 billion were
approved compared with 36 OCR
public and private sector loans
totaling $4 billion in 2002.
Disbursements in 2003 totaled
$2.7 billion which represented a
decrease of 12.3%from the
$3.1 billion disbursed in 2002.
Principal repayments for the year
were $7.1 billion, $5.9 billion of
which were prepayments on loans.
In 2003, 45 loans were fully prepaid
and 5 loans were partially prepaid.
On 31 December, cumulative loans
outstanding after allowance for
losses and unamortized front-end
fees amounted to $25.4 billion.

Status of Loans. One public
sector OCR loan to Nauru and
12 private sector loans were in nonaccrual status at the end of 2003;
the total outstanding balance was

$2.3 million ($3.2 million in 2002)
and $77.1 million ($83.9 million in
2002), respectively. The two public
sector loans to Myanmar came out
of nonaccrual status after the
settlement of all overdue accounts in
December 2003. The decrease in
private sector loans in nonaccrual
status was due to loan restructuring.
Three loans came out of nonaccrual
status during 2003. The total of
$79.4 million represented 0.3% of
the total of outstanding OCR loans.

Lending Rates. The lending
rates for PMCLs and PSCLs are
based on the previous semester’s
average cost of borrowings. Interest
rates for MBLs are either fixed or
floating. The lending rates for MBLs
are determined on the basis of
6-month LIBOR with reset dates of
either 15 March and 15 Septenber
or 15 Juneand 15 December. ADB's
pool-based variable lending rates for
multicurrency loans and for US
dollar loans are shown below. For
the second half of 2003, the lending
rate for multicurrency loans
decreased to 246%per annum, and
the rate for US dollar loans
remained at 6.31%per annum.

In addition to lending rates,
lending spread is charged to all
borrowers. Starting from 1 January
2000, this has been between 40 and
60 basis points. For private
enterprises, the lending spread is
determined on a case-by-case basis
to cover ADB's risk exposure to
particular borrowers and projects.

Rebates and surcharges are
standard features of public sector
LBLs. They can have two components: adjustment of the basic
lending spread and adjustment of
the cost base. To maintain the
principle of cost pass-through
pricing, ADB returns the actual subLIBOR funding cost margin to its
LBL public sector borrowers through
rebates. A surcharge could arise if
ADB's funding cost exceeds the
6-month LIBOR, but that is arenote
possibility unless ADB experiences
serious credit deterioration. Rebate!
surcharge rates are set on 1 January
and 1 July every year and are based

on the actual average funding cost
margin for the preceding 6-month
period. Based on rebate rates, ADB
returned an actual sub-LIBOR
funding cost margin of $5.6 million
to its LBL public sector borrowers.
Technical Assistance. From
1967 to 1991, technical assistance
expenses were charged to OCR and
to other technical assistance funding
resources—the TASF, the Japan
Special Fund (JSF), and trust/grant
funds. From 1992 to 2000, no
technical assistance expenses were
charged to OCR. In 2001, the Board
of Directors approved the financing
of high-priority technical assistance
programs out of OCR current
income within a rolling
4-year financing framework. The
amount of financing required varies
between years and is subject to the
approval of the Board. In 2003, the
Board reverted to the practice of
allocating OCR net income to the
TASF and of financing technical
assistance activities through it and
various other funding resources.
Guarantees. ADB provides
guarantees as credit enhancements
for digible projects to cover risks
that the private sector cannot easily
absorb or manage on its own.
Reducing these risks can make a
significant difference in mobilizing
debt funding for projects. ADB has
used its guarantee instruments
successfully for infrastructure
projects, financial institutions,
capital markets, and trade finance.
The instruments are recognized as
off-balance-sheet in the financial
statements. For guarantees issued
and modified after 31 December
2002 in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board
Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness to Others,” ADB
recognized at the inception of a
guarantee the noncontingent aspect
of its obligations. ADB's total
exposure on signed and effective
loan guarantees is disclosed in Note E
of the OCR Financial Statements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 81ADB offers two guarantee
products—political risk and partial
credit—designed to mitigate risk
exposure of commercial lenders and
capital market investors. These
guarantees are not issued on a
stand-alone basis but are provided
for projects in which ADB has direct
participation. ADB can cooperate
with other multilateral, official, and
private sector lenders and insurers
to provide guarantee products.

Political Risk Guarantees. A
PRG is designed to facilitate
cofinancing by providing lenders/
capital market investors of ADBassisted projects with cover against
specifically defined political risks.
Coverage is available against any
combination of the risks of
expropriation, currency inconvertibility or nontransferability, political
violence, and breach of contract and
is available for loans and other
forms of debt instruments. Equity
instruments are ineligible for PRG
coverage. Tenors are based on the
merits of the underlying project. All
or part of outstanding debt service
obligations to a lender may be
covered. The cover may be for
principal and/or interest payment
obligations. For private sector
projects, ADB can issue a PRG
without a counterguarantee from
the host government; however, PRG
exposure to such a project is subject
to amaximum of $150 million or
50% of the project cost, whichever is
lower. Fees are market-based and
comprise guarantee fees, front-end
fees, and standby fees. A PRG is
callable when a guaranteed event
has occurred and such an event has
resulted in debt service default to
the lender. In 2003, ADB approved a
$70 million PRG supporting
commercial lending for a private
sector power project in Thailand. As
of 31 December 2003, the project
was not yet effective.

Partial Credit Guarantees. A
PCG provides comprehensive cover
(of commercial and political risks)
for a specific portion of the debt
service provided by cofinanciers.
PCG cover is particularly useful for

82 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

projectsin DMCs with restricted
access to financial markets but
which ADB considers creditworthy
and financially sound. Since the
1997 Asian financial crisis,
borrowers, project sponsors,
cofinanciers, and host governments
have increasingly sought to hedge
currency mismatch risks by
borrowing in the same currency as
the revenues generated by the
project. A PCG can cover local
currency debt including domestic
bond issues or long-term loans from
local financial institutions. For
private sector transactions not
supported by a counterguarantee
from the host government, the
exposure limit stands at $75 million
or 25%of the project cost, whichever
is less. Guarantee fees for private
sector transactions are market-based.
Fees for transactions backed by the
host government guarantee
comprise a standard guarantee fee
of 40 basis points (0.4%) per annum
on the present value of the
outstanding guarantee obligation
plus a front-end fee to cover
processing costs. Fees can be
charged to the borrower or to the
lender. In 2003, ADB approved a
private sector PCG for $65 million
to support small and medium
enterprise (SME) development in
Pakistan, and a regional trade
finance facilitation program to
provide up to $105 million of
guarantee cover. Neither project was
effective as of 31 December 2003.
Cofinancing. To optimize the
development impact of its assistance
programs to all DMCs, ADB has
maintained close coordination with
other development partners,
incorporating cofinancing and
coordination opportunities with
them. ADB has increasingly and
systematically intensified coordination with official loan and grant
cofinanciers to identify cofinancing
opportunities that directly
complement ADB projects and to
mobilize grants for addressing the
important thematic priorities for all
DMCs. Official cofinancing
arrangements with bilateral partners

and multilateral financial institutions totaled $775.3 million for

18 projects comprising $433.2 million in grant funds and $342.1 million in loans, compared with
$738.4 million for 29 projects in
2002. Commercial cofinancing
totaled $1.6 billion for 12 projects
of which guarantee operations
amounted to $240 million.

Private Sector Equity Investments and Loans. The Charter
allows the use of OCR for equity
investments in private enterprises of
up to 10%of its unimpaired paid-in
capital together with reserves and
surplus, exclusive of special reserves.
As of 31 December 2003, there were
50 companies in which ADB held
equity only, 26 to which it had loans
only, and 12 in which it had both
equity and loans. The total equity
portfolio for the OCR for both
outstanding and undisbursed
approved facilities net of allowance
for probable losses amounted to
$413.9 million at year’s end. This
represented about 32%of the ceiling
defined by the Charter.

As of 31 December 2003, the
overall private sector portfolio
(equity investments, loans, and
guarantees) was about $1.4 billion.
Asan interim arrangement, pending
theimplenentation of amore
objective capital allocation
methodology, approvals of private
sector operations in excess of the
operational limit of $1.5 billion
established by the Board have been
allowed since September 2001.

Equity and Capital

Total shareholders equity on a
reported basis grew from $12.4 billion as of 31 December 2002 to
$12.9 billion as of 31 December
2003. This was primarily due to

(i) net income of $435.9 million;
(ii) favorable translation adjustments
of $339.2 million; (iii) the net effect
of changein special drawing rights
value on capital and reserves of
$262.8 million; (iv) capital subscriptions of $10.3 million net of
transfers to the ADF and the TASF
of $200 million and $80 million,respectively; (v) unrealized investment losses of $137.5 million; and
(vi) increase in maintenance of value
receivable of $132.3 million.

On 31 December 2003,
authorized and subscribed capital
was $51,997 million. ADB’s
authorized capital was increased by
8,177 shares to 3,499,171 shares to
accommodate Luxembourg and
Palau becoming members. Of the
subscribed capital, $3,657 million
was paid-in and $48,340 million was
callable. Capital backing in the form
of callable capital can be called only
if required to meet ADB's obligations incurred on borrowings or
guarantees under OCR.

Borrowings

Asin previous years, the 2003
borrowing program focused on
ensuring the availability of long-term
funds at the lowest cost possible for
lending operations. To achieve that
objective, ADB pursued a strategy of
(i) issuing liquid benchmark bonds
to maintain ADB's strong presence
in key currency bond markets,
(ii) raising funds through costefficient opportunistic and private
placement transactions to minimize
borrowing costs, and (iii) enphasizing borrowings in the longer
maturity range to smooth ADB's
debt redemption profile. In 2003,
ADB also pursued its objective of
contributing to the devdopment of
regional bond markets and providing
local currency financing for ADB's
private sector operations by
undertaking preparations for
possible local currency bond
issuance.

In 2003, ADB raised about
$4.1 billion in long-term funds
through one benchmark bond issue
and 63 opportunistic transactions in
US dollars, Japanese yen, Canadian
dollars, Australian dollars, and New
Taiwan dollars. After swaps,
$3.9 billion or 95%of 2003
borrowings were in US dollars and
the remaining 5%was in Japanese
yen. The average maturity was
7.6 years compared with 7.2 years in
2002. With favorable market

conditionsin January
2003, ADB launched a
3-year $1 billion
benchmark global bond
issue. This was in line
with the strategy of
maintaining a strong
presence in the US dollar
bond market and further
smoothing the debt
redemption profile. As
the first top-quality
benchmark issue of 2003,
the transaction achieved
broad market distribution and became a liquid benchmark
in the US global bond market.

In keeping with the overriding
objective of minimizing costs, ADB
further enhanced its private
placement strategy in 2003 raising
around $3 billion, or more than 70%
of the year’s total borrowings. Of
that total, $1.9 billion were raised
through eight bond issues targeted
to retail investors ranging from
$130 million to $520 million. Their
longer maturities smoothed ADB's
redemption profile. In addition to
retail bonds, ADB also raised
$700 million through 49 callable
structured notes. These notes
typically carry principal and a
coupon in .apanese yen that will vary
with changes in foreign exchange
rates between the two currencies. The

remaining $400 million was raised
through two US dollar callable zero

with established policy, all transactions were swapped on a fully hedged
basis into floating rate US dollar
liabilities.

Liquidity Portfolio Management

Theliquidity portfolio helps ensure
the uninterrupted availability of
funds to meet loan disbursements,
debt servicing, and other cash
requirements. It also contributes to
ADB's earning base.

The Investment Authority, which
is approved by the Board of
Directors, governs liquid asset
investments. Its primary objective is
to maintain security and liquidity of

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 83funds invested. Subject to these two
parameters, ADB seeks to maximize
the total return on itsinvestments
in this portfolio. In compliance with
its Charter, ADB does not convert
currencies for investment; investments are made in the same
currencies in which they are received.
At present, liquid investments are
held in 18 currencies.

Liquid assets are held in
government and government-related
debt instruments, time deposits and
other unconditional obligations of
banks and financial institutions,
and, to alimited extent, in corporate
bonds, mortgage-backed securities,
and asset-backed securities of high
credit quality. They are had in four
subportfolios—core, operational
cash, cash cushion, and discretionary liquidity—all of which have
different risk profiles and performance benchmarks. The year-end
balance of the portfolios in 2003
and 2002, excluding securities
transferred under the securities
lending arrangement and pending
sales and purchases, is presented in
the table below.

The core portfolio is invested to
ensure that the primary objective of
aliquidity buffer is met. Cash inflow
and outflow are minimized to
maximize the total return relative to
a defined level of risk. The portfolio
is funded largely by equity, and
performance is measured against
external benchmarks with an average
duration of about 2 years. The
renaining part of the core portfolio
is funded by debt and is invested in
high-quality instruments to maximize
the spread earned between borrowing
cost and investment income.

The operational cash portfolio is
designed to meet net cash requirements over a 1-month horizon. It is
funded by equity and invested in
short-term, highly liquid money
market instruments. The portfolio
performance is measured against
short-term external benchmarks.

The cash cushion portfolio holds
the proceeds of ADB’s borrowing
transactions pending disbursement.
It is invested in short-term
instruments, and the performance is
measured against short-term
external benchmarks.

The discretionary liquidity
portfolio is funded by issuing
floating rate debt and is invested in
high-quality instruments to
maximize the spread earned between
borrowing cost and investment
income. For 2003, the size of the
discretionary liquidity portfolio was
set at $1.75 billion.

Risk Management

In undertaking its devdopment
banking operations, ADB assumes a
variety of financial risks: credit,
market (interest rate and foreign
exchange), and operational. ADB has
established a risk managenent
infrastructure designed to ensure
that the risks associated with its
activities are fully identified,
measured, monitored, and managed.
In 2003, ADB further enhanced
risk management functions by
enhancing the risk metrics and
assumptions used in valuation and
risk analysis of the treasury activities
and the performance measurement
and attribution methodologies used
for its investment portfolio. Stress
testing and scenario analysis were

developed as supplementary risk
management tools while the
architecture for valuing highly
structured borrowings and related
swap transactions was improved.
ADB prepared for establishing the
Derivatives Collateral Management
Program for 2004 as an important
part of credit risk management.
Credit Risks. Credit risk can be
defined as potential loss arising
from default of a borrower
(country), counterparty, and issuer.
ADB's credit risk management for
lending operations involves
continuous monitoring of the
creditworthiness of borrowing
members and managing risks
through a rigorous capital adequacy
framework. In country credit risk
management, ADB uses an internal
quantitative risk-based capital modd
as the basis to monitor estimates of
expected and unexpected loss linked
to the equity capital adequacy, loan
loss allowance, minimum net
income requirement, and pricing of
OCR loans. The methodology
involves examining ADB's lending
portfolio, incorporating default
probability, exposure, and loan loss
severity of the borrowers and is used
as the foundation for managing
lending risk within ADB.
Commercial credit risk is the risk
of loss due to a counterparty not
honoring its contractual obligations.
Commercial credit risks involve
issuer risk and counterparty risk.
Issuer risk arises from ADB's
investment transactions. It is
concentrated in investments in debt
instruments issued by sovereign
governments, agencies, banks, and
corporate entities. ADB restricts

To assist in ensuring investment
and funding activities are undertaken in an effective and costefficient manner, ADB uses various
cash and derivative instruments in
its financial operations where these
transactions involve counterparty
credit risks. To manage and mitigate
these risks, ADB restricts these
activities to authorized dealers and
counterparties meeting conservative
credit risk guidelines. ADB monitors
and controls counterparty credit
risks arising from derivative
transactions through credit
approval, collateral agreements, and
risk limits. ADB requires all swap
counterparties to be rated AA-/Aa3
or higher. Credit limits are
calculated and monitored on the
basis of current and potential
exposure which incorporates risks
involved with counterparty default.

Market Risks. Market risks can
result from unfavorable market
movements, primarily in interest rate
and foreign exchanger rates. The
market risks associated with the loan
portfolio are managed by passing all
associated costs to borrowers and
employing derivatives to manage and
align characteristics of loans and
borrowings. ADB assumes no
significant market risks rdating to
its loan portfolio, except for minor
cost of carry associated with
borrowed funds held temporarily in
liquid assets pending disbursement.

Market risk exposure is generally
restricted to ADB's liquid asset
investments. The principal source of
interest risk arises from the income
volatility associated with investments due to interest rate movements. ADB monitors and manages
interest rate risks by enploying
various quantitative methods. All
positions are mark-to-market, and
risk-sensitive measures are calculated
and compared to internally
established risk limits daily. In
addition, potential exposures are
calculated and monitored against
aggregate risk limits established
under the new investment strategy.

ADB has a policy to match loans
and investments in the same
currencies in which the funds are
received. However, the borrowed
funds or funds to be invested may
be converted into other currencies
provided that forward exchange
agreements are entered into
simultaneously to ensure recovery of
currencies converted. ADB does not
otherwise convert one currency into
another, except for limited amounts
required to meet certain obligations
in the ordinary course of business or
as specifically authorized by the
Board of Directors.

Operational Risks. Operational
risk represents the potential for loss
resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes or systems,
human factors, or external events
including business disruptions and
system failure, transaction processing failures, and failure in execution
of legal, fiduciary, and agency
responsibilities. ADB is exposed to
many types of operational risks and
attempts to mitigate them by
maintaining a system of internal
control procedures and processes
that are designed to maintain risks
at appropriate levels.

Risk Management in Private
Sector Operations. The risk
management unit of private sector
operations has two main functions:
special asset management to give
attention to the more vulnerable
private sector projects which pursues
recovery, restructuring, rescheduling,
and litigation in managing nonperforming projects; and credit
review to evaluate and give an
independent credit assessment,
separate from the operating
division’s judgment on each project.

Summary of Financial
Performance

Operating Income. Operating
income for 2003 before FAS 133
adjustment was $616.6 million,
$137.3 million (18% less than the
$753.9 million in 2002. The decrease
was predominantly due to the
following: (i) a decrease in net loan
income after interest and financial

expenses of $159.3 million
attributed to the combined effect of
decreases in average outstanding
loans and borrowings—decreases
attributed to significant loan
prepayments ($5.9 billion) and to
unfavorable fair value changes for
swaps ($0.2 billion); (ii) a decrease in
investment income of $21.8 million
primarily due to changes in interest
rate environment; and (iii) increases C
of $27.9 million and $13.5 million
in administrative expenses and
provision for losses, respectively. The
increase in administrative expenses
was principally due to retirement
benefits and office occupancyrdated expenses while provision for
private and public sector loans and
equity investments accounted for
theincrease in loss provision.

The $222.5 million decrease in
net income resulting from these
three factors was offset by gains on
equity investment disposals of
$25.4 million and other income of
$3.3 million and by a decrease in
technical assistance of $56.5 million.

FAS 133 Adjustments. The
$178.4 million FAS 133 adjustment
for the year represented a net
decline in the values of derivatives of
$176.1 million (unfavorable fair
value changes of $386.3 million for
borrowing swaps and favorable fair
value changes of $60.8 million for
investment swaps and embedded
derivatives of $149.4 million) and
amortization of FAS 133 transition
adjustments of $2.3 million during
the year. The $176.1 million loss in
the derivatives portfolio is primarily
attributed to increased interest rate
environment during 2003 and
general weakening of the US dollar.

Staff Retirement Plan and
Postretirement Medical Benefits.
Retirement benefits are provided by
the Pension Plan to which staff are
expected to contribute 9 1/3%of
their salaries and to which they may
make additional, voluntary
contributions. The Pension Plan is
administered by ADB as a separate
fund and is required to be kept
separate from ADB resources. In
addition, postretirenent medical

ANNUAL REPORT 2003 85 3benefits are provided to retirees who
elect to enroll in the Postretirenent
Plan. ADB covers 75%of the medical
insurance premium.

Recognition of ADB's obligations
for the two plans is based on benefit
projections under certain actuarial
assumptions net of the fair value of
the projected plan assets under
certain actuarial assumptions. As of
31 December, the Pension Plan and
the Postretirement Plan showed an
unfunded status of $116.9 million
and $149.1 million, respectively. To
the extent allowed, certain costs,
gains/losses, and obligations are
deferred and recognized in relevant
accounting periods as permitted by
accounting standards. Consequently,
the unfunded amounts are not
recognized as liabilities, but periodic
costs based on actuarial valuation
are recognized in the OCR accounts.
Recognition of future costs will
depend on future events. In that
respect, the fund’s status and the
periodic costs are reviewed annually
with the assistance of actuaries.
These reviews may lead to a revision
in the funding rate to the Pension
Plan. In 2003, ADB’s contribution
rate increased from 11%to 13%
commencing January 2004 the rate
will be 15%

Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates

The significant accounting policies
are contained in the Note B of
OCR's financial statements. In
presenting the financial statenents,
Managenent estimates the fair value
of financial instruments. Estimates
by their nature are based on
judgment and available information.
Therefore, actual results could differ
from those estimates and could have
a material impact on the financial
statements.

Fair Valuation of Financial
Instruments. Under statutory
reporting, ADB carries its investments and derivatives, as defined by
FAS 133, on a fair value basis. These
derivatives include certain enbedded
derivatives in borrowings; for

86 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

accounting purposes they are
separately valued and accounted for
in the balance sheet. Fair values for
exchange traded securities and
derivatives are based on quoted
market prices. Fair valuations where
market prices are not readily
available are determined using
market-based pricing modes
incorporating readily available
market data and require use of
Management judgment and
estimates.

All pricing models used for fair
valuing ADB’s derivatives are based
on discounting the expected cash
flows using observable market
data. ADB reviews the pricing
models to assess the appropriateness of the assumptions to
reasonably reflect the valuation of
transactions. In addition,
valuations derived from the
models are subject to ongoing
internal and external verification
and review. The models use
market-sourced inputs, such as
interest rate yield curves, exchange
rates, and option volatilities.
Selection of these inputs may
involve some judgment and may
impact net income. Nevertheless,
ADB believes that the estimates of
the fair value are reasonable given
existing controls and processes.

Special Funds

ADB is authorized by its Charter to
establish and administer Special
Funds. These are the Asian
Deveopment Fund; the Technical
Assistance Special Fund; the Japan
Special Fund, including the Asian
Currency Crisis Support Facility;
and the ADB Institute Special Fund.
Financial statements for each fund
are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting
principles except for the ADF which
are special purpose financial
statements prepared in accordance
with ADF regulations.

Asian Development Fund

The ADF is ADB's concessional
lending window for DMCs with low

per capita gross national products
and limited debt repayment
capacities. It is the only multilateral
source of concessional assistance
dedicated exclusively to reducing
poverty and to improving the
quality of life in Asia and the
Pacific. Twenty-nine donor members
(regional and nonregional) have
contributed to the Fund (seehttp://
www.adb.org’ ADF ).

ADF VIII. The current
replenishment of the Fund,
authorized in December 2000 by
Resolution No. 276 of the Board of
Governors, is intended to finance
concessional lending operations for
2001-2004. Donors agreed on a
total replenishment from their
contributions of $2.79 billion based
on the exchange rates specified in
the Resolution. By the end of 2003,
ADB had received Instruments of
Contribution from 24 donors for a
total of $2.40 billion (including a
contribution from Luxembourg,
which became a member of ADB in
September 2003 and an additional
contribution from Spain). Twentytwo donors deposited unqualified
Instruments of Contribution.
Canada and Taipei ,China deposited
Instruments containing a qualification as permitted by the Resolution
that all installments except the first
were subject to budgetary appropriations. By the end of 2003, all donors
that had submitted their Instruments had paid their first three
installments, except Austria. Two
donors, namely Italy and the United
States, had not submitted their
Instruments. (For détails of amounts
rdeased for operational commitment in
2003, see the cdlumn labded “Addition”
in Table 28 in the Statistical Annex.)

To augment ADF VIII commitment authority, in April 2003 the
Board of Governors approved the
transfer of $200 million of 2002
OCR net income to the ADF. In
addition, Management assessed the
opportunities for freeing committed
resources by canceling loans that
were not moving or by identifying
savings. In October 2003, the Board
approved the use of loan savingsAsian Development Fund Commitment Authority

for new loan commitments.

ADB donor members, Management, and senior staff met in
Washington, DC on 14-15 April
2003 to undertake a midterm review
of ADF VIII. The objective of the
meeting was to take stock of
progress in implementing the
recommendations set out by donors
in the ADF VIII Donors Report.

ADF |X. Negotiations with a
commitment to broad consultation
on afurther ADF replenishment are
now under way. The first meeting
was hdd in Copenhagen on 9-10
October 2003. The discussions
revolved around development
effectiveness in the context of the
Global Devdopment Agenda. A
second meeting was held in Tokyo
on 9-11 December 2003. In the
Tokyo meeting, donors reaffirmed
the central importance of the
country strategies and programs
linked to the Millennium Deveopment Goals and national poverty
reduction strategies.

ADF Loan Approvals,
Disbursements, and Repayments.
In 2003, 47 ADF loans totaling
$1.4 billion were approved compared
with 53 loans totaling $1.7 billion in
2002. Disbursements during 2003
totaled $1,128.1 million, a decrease
of 0.7%from $1,135.5 million in
2002. At the end of the year,
cumulative disbursements from ADF
resources were $19.8 billion. Loan
repayments during the year
amounted to $312.3 million, and
cumulative repayments were
$2.3 billion. At year's end, ADF
loans outstanding amounted to
$20 billion (see rdated discussion on
Finandng Operations on page 7 and
rdated tablesin the Statistical Annex).

Status of Loans. At the end of
the year, 28 public sector loans to
Myanmar were in nonaccrual status.
The total of outstanding ADF loans
to Myanmar amounted to $496 million comprising about 2.5% of total
ADF loans outstanding.

Investment Portfolio
Position. The ADF investment
portfolio amounted to $4.3 billion
on 31 December 2003, compared
with $3.2 billion in 2002. About

35% of the portfolio was invested
in bank deposits and 65% was in
floating and fixed income
securities. The financial rate of
return on ADF investments in
2003 was 3.5% compared with 4.6%
in 2002. The portfolio was
denominated in 10 currencies.
Euros, pounds sterling, Australian
dollars, and Canadian dollars
accounted for 86%

Technical Assistance
Special Fund

Review of Activities. In 2003, the
Board of Governors approved an
allocation of $80 million from 2002
OCR net income to the TASF. In
addition, Pakistan made a wholly
untied, direct, voluntary contribution (its 26") amounting to $70,000.
At the end of 2003, total TASF
resources amounted to $1,005.5 million. Of this, $901.4 million were
committed leaving an uncommitted
balance of $104.1million. (For details,
se Table 29 in the Statistical Annex.)

Operations and Resource
Position. Technical assistance
commitments (approved and
effective) increased from $27.9 million in 2002 to $80.1 million in
2003 with 186 technical assistance
projects effective during the year. In
2003, $10.1 million ($3.9 million in
2002) representing completed and
canceled technical assistance
projects were written back asa
reduction in technical assistance,
and the corresponding undisbursed
commitment was diminated.
Revenue from investments rose from
$4.8 million in 2002 to $5.3 million
in 2003 because of an increase in the
size of the investment portfolio. As a
result, the uncommitted balance
available for future commitments
increased from $68.3 million in
2002 to $104.1 million in 2003. The
TASF contributed 49% of funding
for all technical assistance approved
in 2003.

At the end of the year, TASF
investments stood at $228.5 million,
up 47.4%from 2002. Other assets—
due from banks, advances to
consultants, and others—totaled

Japan Special Fund

Review of Activities. Technical
assistance funded by the JSF
continued to support ADB
operations aimed at reducing
poverty. In March 2003, Japan
contributed 2 billion yen ($16.7 million equivalent) as a regular
contribution. As of 31 December
2003, Japan’s cumulative contribution to the JSF since its inception in
1988 amounted to 99.2 billion yen
(about $852.7 million equivalent)
comprising regular contributions of
81.1 billion yen and supplenentary
contributions of 18.1 billion yen. In
2003, ADB approved 66 technical
assistance projects for the JSF
totaling $36.9 million inclusive of
those that were approved but not
yet effective (seetable bdow). The
uncommitted balance after taking
into account approved technical
assistance not yet effective as of

31 December 2003 was $125.1 million. (For details, see http:// www.adb.
org JSF/ and tables 30 and 31 in the
Statistical Annex.)

Sector Activities. In 2003, the
JSF financed 21%of the total
amount of technical assistance
approved by ADB including 35%of
the total amount of project
preparatory technical assistance
during the year. The breakdown of

ADB Institute Special Fund

The costs for operating the ADB
Institute are met from this Fund
which is administered by ADB in
accordance with the Statute of the
ADB Institute. Japan made its
dghth contribution in the amount
of 1.4 billion yen ($11.8 million
equivalent) in June 2003.

As of 31 December 2003,
cumulative commitments amounted
to 10.1 billion yen (about $83.1 million equivalent) excluding transiation adjustments. Of the total
contributions received, $69.8 million
had been used by the end of the year
mainly for research and capacitybuilding activities, including
organizing symposia, forums, and
training; preparing research reports,
publications, and web sites; and
associated administrative expenses.
The balance of net current assets
available for future projects and
programs was about $13.3 million.

Japan Special Fund

Trust Funds Managed
by ADB

In addition to the OCR and the
Special Funds, ADB also manages
and administers the Japan Scholarship Program (JSP), the Japan Fund
for Poverty Reduction, the Japan
Fund for Information and Communication Technology, and channd
financing of grants provided by
bilateral donors to support technical
assistance and soft components of
loans. These funds do not form part
of ADB’s own resources.

Japan Scholarship Program

The Program was established in
1988 to provide an opportunity for
well-qualified citizens of DMCs to
undertake postgraduate studies in
economics, management, science
and technology, and other
development-related fidds at
selected educational institutions in
Asia and the Pacific. The Program is
funded by Japan and administered
by ADB. Currently, 18 institutions
in 10 countries participate.

Between 1988 and 2003, Japan
contributed about $61 million. A total
of 1,621 scholarships has been
awarded to recipients from 34 menbers. Of the total, 1,298 have already
completed their courses. Women have
received 487 scholarships. The
number of new scholarships awarded
annually grew from 49 in 1988 to 145
in 2003 (seehttp:// www.adb.org JEP ).

a_ Includes regional technical assistance.Channel Financing
Arrangements

Official grant cofinancing plays a
vital rolein ADB operations,
particularly in view of the continuing constraints on TASF and ADF
resources. These grant funds
support technical assistance and
finance mostly soft components of
loan projects. Most grants are
provided by bilateral donors under
channd financing arrangenents
(CFAs). ADB acts as administrator
of the funds and applies its own
guidelines and procedures in
recruiting consultants, making
disbursements, and supervising
projects.

Under a CFA, the donor enters
into a comprehensive agreement
with ADB whereby the donor
provides an untied grant fund to
be administered by ADB, but the
fund does not become part of
ADB's own resources. The donor
indicates its preferred sectors and
recipient countries. ADB regularly
provides alist and description of
proposed technical assistance
projects that satisfy the donor’s
preferences, and they agree on the
specific activities to be financed.
Funds provided under a CFA are
transferred to an interest-bearing
account and may also be invested
by ADB pending disbursement.
Donors are provided with regular
financial statements and progress

reports on the use of the funds.
ADB is responsible for project
preparation, processing, and
administration. CFAs may be
replenished with additional funds
at the donor’s discretion.

The primary advantage of CFAs
is that funding for several individual
technical assistance projects may be
provided under a single agreement.
Accordingly, they minimize the need
for detailed negotiations on a caseby-case basis and foster administrative efficiency. The first CFA was
negotiated in 1980. Since then, ADB
has entered into CFAs with the
following bilateral deveopment
partners: Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
and United Kingdom.

In addition to the traditional
type of CFA that may be used for
several sectors, the processing of
thematic CFAs with bilateral
agencies has risen sharply in the
last couple of years in such areas
as renewable energy, climate
change, poverty reduction,
governance, water, gender and
development, and poverty and
environment. Several thematic
CFAs have been packaged as
umbrella facilities to allow more
than one donor to contribute.

In 2003, ADB and its partners
established two new cooperative
funds: the Gender and Devdopment

Cooperation Fund with initial
contributions from Canada,
Denmark, and Norway; and the
Poverty and Environment Fund
with initial contributions from
Norway and Sweden. A CFA was
entered into with each donor. In
addition, Norway also contributed
to the existing Cooperation Fund
for the Water Sector while
Denmark also contributed to the C
existing Governance Cooperation
Fund. (See Table 33 in the Statistical
Annex.)

Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction

The Fund was established in May
2000 as a trust fund to support
poverty reduction and social
devdopment activities that can add
substantial value to ADB projects.
Since 2000, Japan has contributed
$302.4 million in total; 38 projects
totaling $116 million were approved
for implementation (seehttp://
www.adb.org/ FPR’ and Table 32 in the
Statisical Annex).

Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology

The Fund was established in July
2001 to assist DMCsin bridging the
digital divide to hdlp reduce poverty.
It had an initial contribution of

1.3 billion yen (approximately

$10.7 million) for a 3-year period;
$680,000 were approved for two
projects.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2003 and 2002

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONSAND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS, GUARANTEES,
AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Natureof Operations

TheAsian Development Bank (ADB), amultilateral development finance institution, was established in 1966 with
its headquartersin Manila, Philippines. ADB and its operationsaregoverned by theAgreement Establishing theAsian
Devdopment Bank (the Charter). Its purpose is to foster
economic devedopment and co-operation in the Asian and
Pacific region and to contribute to the acceleration of the
process of economic development of the developing menber countries (DMCs) in the region, collectively and individually. With theadoption of itspoverty reduction strategy
at theend of 1999, ADB madereducing povertyin theregion
its main goal. ADB provides financial and technical assistance (TA) for projects and programs which will contribute to achieving this purpose.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is an integral part of ADB's operational activities. In
addition, ADB, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of
donors, including members, their agencies and other development institutions, funds restricted for specific uses
which include TA grants as well as regional programs.

ADB's ordinary operations comprise loans, equity
investments, and guarantees. During the years 2001 and
2002, limited technical assistance to member countries to
support high priority TA programs was included. ADB
financesits ordinary operationsthrough borrowings, paidin capital, and retained earnings.

Limitationson Loans Guarantees and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the
total amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and
guarantees madeby ADB shall not exceed thetotal of ADB's
unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus, exclusiveof thespecial reserve. At 31 December 2003, thetotal
of such loans, equity investments, and guarantees aggregated approximately 67.7% (78.4% - 2002) of the total
subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus as defined.
Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that
equity investments shall not exceed 10%of the unimpaired
paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusiveof thespecial reserve. At 31 December 2003, such equity
investments represented approximately 3.2%(3.3%- 2002)
of the paid-in capital, reserves, and surplus, as defined.

NOTE B—SUM MARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Fundional Currendesand Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
Thereporting currency isthe United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB is defined in Artide 4,
paragraph 1 of theCharter “in termsof United States dollars
of theweight and finenessin effect on 31 January 1966” (the
1966 dollar) and the value of each shareis defined as 10,000
1966 dollars. Thecapital stock had historically been translated into the current United States dollar (ADB's unit of account) on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
timethe Second Amendment to theArticlesof Agreement of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect,
currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB's sdection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, thecapital stock hasbeen valued for purposesof these
financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right
(SDR) at the valuein current United States dollars as computed by theI MF, with each share valued at SDR10,000.
Asof 31 December 2003, thevalueof the SDRin tamsof
thecurrent United Statesdollar was $1.48597 ($1.35458 - 2002)
giving a value for each share of ADB's capital equivalent to
$14,859.70 ($13,545.80 - 2002). However, ADB could decideto
fix the valueof each shareat $12,063.50 based on the31 March
1978 par value of the United States dollar in terms of gold.

Trandation of Currendes

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currenciesto thereporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Incomeand expenseamountsaretranslated for each semimonthly period generally at theapplicablerates of exchange
at thebeginning of each period; such practice approximates
theapplication of averageratesin effect during theperiod.
Translation adjustments other than thoserdating to maintenance of SDR capital values (sseNotes! and J), arecharged
or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments’ and
reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES’ as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

 

104 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKDerivativeFinandal Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities’, along with itsamendments, collectively referred
as FAS 133, became effective for ADB on 1 January 2001.
FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards
requiring that every derivativeinstrument berecorded in the
Balance Sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. Changesin thefair valueof derivativesarerecorded
in net income or other comprehensive income, depending
on whether aderivativeisdesignated aspart of ahedgetransaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction.

ADB uses derivative instruments for asset/liability
management of individual positionsand portfolios, aswell as
for the reduction of transaction costs. In applying FAS 133
for purposes of financial statement reporting, ADB has dected not to define any qualifying hedging relationships.
Rather, all derivative instruments, as defined by FAS 133,
havebeen marked to fair valueincorporating observablemarket data, and all changes in the fair value have been recognized in net income. ADB has elected not to define any
qualifying hedging relationships, not because economic
hedgesdo not exist, but rather becausetheapplication of FAS
133 hedging criteriadoesnot makeevident theimpact of economicrisksinherent in ADB'sfinancial assets and liabilities.

Thecumulativeeffect of achangein accounting principleincludesthedifference between thecarrying valueand
the fair value of the derivative instruments in the borrowings portfolio on 31 December 2000 as well as loans that
met hedge criteria, offset by any gains or losses on these
borrowings and loans for which a fair value exposure was
being hedged. The net effect gave rise to a transition loss
of $81,657,000 in comprehensive income and a gain of
$34,656,000 was reported in net income. The allocation
between net income and other comprehensiveincome was
based upon the hedging relationships that existed before
the initial application of this statement.

Since ADB has not defined any qualifying hedging
relationships under this standard, theamount recorded in
other comprehensiveincomeas part of thetransition isbeing reclassified into earningsin the same period or periods
in which thehedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Investments

Allinvestment securitiesand negotiable certificateof deposits

losses excluded from net income and reported in
“CAPITAL AND RESERVES’ as part of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value represents market value. Time deposts are classified as “Hdd-toMaturity’ and arereported at cost. Realized gains and losses
are induded in income from investments and are measured
by the difference between amortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales. With respect to futures, realized gain or loss
isreported based on daily settlement of thenet cash margin.

Scuurities Trangerred Under SeauritiesLendingArrangement

ADBaccountsfor transfersof financial assetsin accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a
replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfersareaccounted
for as sales under FAS 140 when ADB has relinquished
control over the transferred assets. Transfers that are not
accounted for as sales areaccounted for as repurchase agreements and collateralized financing arrangements.

Loans

ADB's loans are made to or guaranteed by members, with
the exception of loans to the private sector, and have
maturities ranging between 3 and 30 years. ADB requires
its borrowers to absorb exchangerisks attributableto fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has disbursed. Loan interest income and loan commitment fees
are recognized on accrual basis. With the introduction of
LIBOR-based loans in 2001, in line with ADB's principle
of cost pass through pricing, any variation in the actual
cost of borrowings is passed to LIBOR-based borrowers as
surcharge or rebate.

It is the policy of ADB to place loans in nonaccrual
status for which principal, interest, or other charges are
overdue by six months. Interest and other charges on nonaccruing loans are included in income only to the extent
that payments have been received by ADB. ADB follows a
policy of not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements
with respect to public sector loans. In the case of private
sector loans, ADB may agreeto debt rescheduling only after
alternative courses of action have been exhausted.

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and therefore subject to provisioning when principal or interest is
in arrears for one year for public sector loans (unless there
is clear and convincing evidence warranting the deferment
or acceleration of such provisioning) and six months for
private sector loans. If the present value of expected future
cash flows discounted at theloan’s effectiveinterest rateis

less than the carrying value of theloan, a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.

ADB's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the
allowancefor loan lossesis based on its past loan loss experience, known and inherent risksin existing loans, and adversesituationsthat may affect aborrower’sability to repay.

ADBleviesfront-end feeson all newloans. Thesefees
are deferred and amortized over the life of the loans after
offsetting deferred direct loan origination costs.

In addition, ADB leviesacommitment chargeon the
undisbursed balance of effective loans. Unless otherwise
provided by theloan agreement, thechargestakeeffect commencing on the 60!" day after the loan signing date and
are credited to loan income.

Guarantees

ADB extends guarantees to public sector and private sector
borrowers. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the
underlying financial obligation of the borrower is incurred.
ADB would berequired to perform under itsguaranteesif the
payments guaranteed were not made by the debtor, and the
guaranteed party called theguaranteeby demanding payments
from ADB in accordance with the term of the guarantee.

Prior to 1 January 2003, guaranteesin the absence of
any call, were not reflected in the financial statements but
disclosed as anoteto thefinancial statements (see Note E)
in accordancewith theprovisions of FASB No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN
45), “Guarantor’sAccounting and DisclosureRequirenents
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtednessto Others’, which cameinto effect in 2003, requires
the recognition of two types of liabilities that are associated with guarantees: (a) the stand-by ready obligation to
perform, and (b) the contingent liability. ADB recognizes
at theinception of a guarantee, aliability for the stand-by
ready obligation to perform on guarantees issued and
modified after 31 December 2002. Theliability isincluded
in “Miscellaneous liabilities.”

Front-end fee income on guarantees received is deferred and amortized over the period of the guarantee contract and the unamortized balance of deferred front-end
fee of guarantee is included in “Miscellaneous liabilities.”

Equity Investments
Investments in equity securities without readily determin
able fair values are reported at cost less probable losses inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable.

The reserve against losses for equity investments
is established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of potential losses for such investments. Equity
investments with readily determinable fair values are
reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL
AND RESERVES’ as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” ADB applies the equity method of
accounting to oneinvestment whereit has the ability to
exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and,
except for land, depreciated over estimated useful lives on
astraight-line basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor betterments are charged to expense.

AccountingEsimates

The preparation of thefinancial statementsin conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to makeestimatesand assumptionsthat affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of the year and the
reported amountsof revenues and expenses during theyear.
The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accountingand Reporting Devdopments

In November 2002, FASB issued FASB interpretation (FIN)
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others’ - an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This interpretation requires a guarantor to
recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
the fair value of all of the obligations it has undertaken in
issuing a guarantee, including its ongoing obligation to
stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in
theevent that the specified triggering events or conditions
occur. This provision appliesto guaranteesissued or modified after 31 December 2002. FIN No. 45 also clarifies
requirements about disclosures on guarantees. Full disclosures on all outstanding financial guarantees have been
made in Notes E and N to the financial statements.

In January and December 2003, FASB issued FIN
No.46, “Consolidation of VariableInterest Entities—an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements’ and FAS No. 132 (revised

 

106 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK2003), “Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirenent Benefitsan amendment of FASB Statenents
No. 87, 88 and 106, and arevision of FASB Statement
No. 132", respectively.

FIN No. 46 requiresan entity to consolidateand provide disclosures for any variable interest entity (VIE) for
which it is the primary beneficiary. For public enterprise,
the effectivity of FIN No. 46 has been deferred for application to theentity sreporting period ending 15 March 2004.
An evaluation of its applicability to ADB will be considered in 2004. FAS 132 (revised 2003) provided for additional disclosures effective for 2003 year-end financial
statements for public companies with domestic plans and
with a delayed effective date for certain disclosures for
foreign plans of non-public entities.

Further developments were issued by the Emerging
Issues Task Force(EITF) in November 2003. EITF IssueNo.
03-1 requires additional disclosures for FAS 114 and FAS
124 securities, among which are disclosures of the aggregate amount of unrealized losses and the aggregatereat ed
fair value of investments with unrealized losses.

In April and May 2003, FASB issued FAS No. 149 and
150, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities’ and “Accounting for Certain Financial instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilitiesand Equity’, respectively. Thesestandardsdo not
have a significant impact on ADB's financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, ADB considersthat itscash and cash equivalentsarelimited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”

Redassfication

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have
been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Asset/Mortgage-backed Securities: Asset/Mortgage-backed securities are instruments whose cash flow is
based on the cash flows of a pool of underlying assets or
mortgage loans managed by a trust.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery
of securities or money market instruments in which the
seller agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of
a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial
margin requirements are met with cash or securities, and
changes in the market prices are generally settled daily in
cash. ADB generally closes out open positions prior to
maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or payments are limited
to thechangein market valueof thefutures. At 31 December 2003, the nominal amount of outstanding purchase

Prior to 1 ly 1986, thelending rateof ADB was based
on amulticurrency fixed lending rate systen under which
loans carried interest rates fixed at thetimeof loan approval for theentirelife of theloans. Effective 1 July 1986, ADB
adopted a multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate
system. In addition, in July 1992, ADB introduced a United
States dollar pool-based variable lending rate systen, and
in November 1994, amarket-based variablelending ratesystem was made available to financial intermediaries in the
public sector and to the private sector borrowers. For loans
to the private sector borrowers, approximately 78% (72%2002) of the loans were based on variable lending rates.

Since 1988, ADB has charged front-end fees for privatesector loans. Effective 1 January 2000, ADB leviesfrontend fee of 1%for public sector loans for which the loan
negotiations are completed after that date. In 2003, ADB
waived 50%of the front-end fee charged on all OCR public
sector loans approved during the year. The effect of this
waiver was to reducenet incomeby $3,008,000 (2002 -nil).
Effective 1 January 2000, the lending spread applied to all
outstanding pool-based OCR public sector loans and new
public sector market-based loans was increased from 0.4%
to 0.6% Also effective the same date, a flat commitment
fee of 0.75% is charged for new program loans, while the
progressive commitment fee of 0.75% is maintained for
project loans.

Thefront-end fees received for the year ended 31 December 2003 was $24,342,000 for loans ($37,057,000 and
$6,092,000 for loans and guarantees, respectively - 2002).
Administrative expenses dating to direct loan origination

of $13,678,000 for the year ended 31 December 2003
($19,440,000 -—2002) weredeferred and offset against frontend fees earned. The excess, if any, is amortized over the
life of each loan.

Commencing 1 July 2001, ADB offered LIBOR-based
loans (LBLs) in the following currencies — Euro, Japanese
yen, and United States dollar. The new LBL lending facility offers borrowers the flexibility of (i) choice of currency
and interest rate basis; (ii) optionsto link repayment schedules to actual disbursements for financial intermediary
borrowers; (iii) changetheoriginal loan terms (currency and
interest rate basis) at any time during the life of the loan;
and (iv) options to cap or collar the floating lending rate at
any timeduring thelifeof theloan. LBL terms are available
for all newloansfor which theinvitation to negotiateisissued
on or after 1 uly 2001. With theintroduction of LBLs, all
other loan windows are no longer offered to borrowers.

In November 2003, ADB offered borrowers to transform their outstanding pool-based multicurrency loans of
$6.5 billion to pool-based single currency loansin Japanese
yen. The transformation will facilitate borrower's administration for loan service payments and loan accounting. The
transformation will be made effective on 1 January 2004.

In 2003, ADB received full and partial prepayments
for 50 loansamounting to $5,883,772,000 ($1,977,139,000
- 2002) and collected prepayment premiums of
$107,404 ,000 ($62,521 ,000 - 2002) which havebeen included in “Other income from loans.” Sixty five percent of the
prepaid amountswerepool-based multi-currency and poolbased single currency (US$) loans.

the event that a guaranteeis called, ADB has the contractual right to require payment from the government, on
demand, or as ADB may otherwise direct.

Guaranteed payments under partial credit guarantees are generally due 10 or more years from the loan inception date. ADB’spolitical risk guaranteeiscallablewhen
a guaranteed event has occurred and such an event has

($13,620,000 - 2002) investment in the Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd.(AFIC) which isaccounted for
on the equity method. AFIC, domiciled and incorporated
in Singapore, was established in 1989 with 26 shareholderscomprising ADB and agroup of international commercial banks. AFIC is principally engaged in the business of
merchant banking including theoperation of an Asian Currency Unit under theterms and condition specified by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore. ADB's participation in
AFIC’s equity was to provide financing for private sector
enterprises to strengthen and diversify the institutional
structure in DMCs. At the end of 2003, AFIC had
$46,891,000 in net assets ($43,710,000 - 2002) and
$3,270,000 in net profit ($1,602,000 - 2002).

ADB's holding represents 30.5%o0f AFIC’s issued ordinary share capital and net assets. ADB also holds 100%
of AFICissued convertiblenoncumulativepreferenceshares
in the amount of $25,000,000 ($25,000,000 - 2002). In October 2002, ADB, together with other financiers, renewed
the revolving credit facility up to a maximum aggregate
principal amount outstanding at any time of $36,000,000.
The facility expired in November 2003, and as at 31 De
cember 2003, the outstanding loan was nil ($4,444,000 —
2002). As of 31 December 2003, ADB's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its investment in AFIC was
$39,284,000 ($38,620,000 - 2002). ADB is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 with respect to AFIC on the
OCR statements.

NOTE G—PROPERTY, FURNITURE, AND
EQUIPMENT

In 1991, under the terms of an agreement with the
Philippines (Government), ADB returned theformer head
quarters premises, which had been provided by the Government. In accordancewith theagreement as supplenented by a memorandum of understanding, ADB was
compensated $22,657,000 for thereturn of these premises.
The compensation is in lieu of being provided premises
under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and
amortized over the estimated life of the new headquarters
building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The amortization for the year ended 31 December 2003 amounted
to $337,000 ($511,000 — 2002) reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building from $4,471,000
($4,492,000 - 2002) to $4,134,000 ($3,981,000 - 2002). At
31 December 2003, the unamortized deferred compensation balance (included in “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND
OTHER LIABILITIES - Miscellaneous”) was $9,039,000
($9,653,000 - 2002). At 31 December 2003, accumulated
depreciation for property, furniture, and equipment was
$101,766,000 ($91,195,000 - 2002).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

ADB uses derivative financial instruments in connection
with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding sources across public and private debt markets, currencies and
instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a currency borrowed under advantageous termsinto oneof ADB's
major operational currencies, taking advantage of the opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such currency swaps enable ADB to raise operationally needed
currenciesin a cost-efficient way and to maintain its borrowing presencein the major capital markets. Interest rate
swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet interest
rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

ADB issues structured debt which includes enbedded derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing.
However, ADB simultaneously enters into currency and/
or interest rate swaps to fully hedge the effects of such embedded derivatives. Borrowingsarereported on thebalance
sheet at their carrying book value adjusted for any unamortized premium or discounts, and include the fair value
of enbedded derivatives of $149,474,000 as of 31 December 2003 that are required to be separated by FAS 133.

ADB has a potential risk of lossif the swap counterparty fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce
such credit risk, ADB only entersinto long-term swap transactions with counterparties eligible under ADB’s swap
guidelines which include a requirement that the counterparties have a credit rating of AA-/Aa3 or higher and requires certain counterparties to provide collateral.

 

112 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKThe fair value of outstanding currency swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements is determined at
the estimated amount that ADB would receive or pay to
terminate the agreements using a market-based valuation
model. The basis of valuation is the present value of expected cash flows based on observable market data.

Interest rateswaps: Under atypical interest rateswap
agreement used by ADB, one party agrees to makeperiodic
payments based on a notional principal amount and an
interest rate that is fixed at the outset of the agreement.
The counterparty agrees to make floating rate payments
based on the same notional principal amount. The terms
of ADB'sinterest rate swap agreements specifically match
the terms of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap
agreement, one party agrees to make periodic paymentsin
one currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic payments in another currency. The payments may be
fixed at the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest rates. A receivable is created for the currency swapped
out, and a payable is created for the currency swapped in.
Theterms of ADB's currency swap agreements specifically
match the terms of particular borrowings.

Capital Tranderred to Adan Devdopment Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of
the Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid
by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the
Charter as of 28 April 1973 to beused asapart of the Special
Funds of ADB. The resources so set aside amounting to
$70,746,000 as of 31 December 2003 ($64,491,000 - 2002)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.48597
($1.35458 - 2002) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar—see Note B), were allocated and
transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Valueof Currency Hddings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMF Articles, ADB implemented maintenance of value (MOV) in respect of holdings of member
currenciesin termsof 1966 dollars, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors. Since then, settlement of
MOV has been put in abeyance.

Inasmuch asthevaluation of ADB’scapital stock and
thebasis of determining possible M OV obligationsarestill
under consideration, notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as receivable from or payable to membersin order to maintain thevalue of currency holdingsin

terms of the SDR. In view thereof, the notional MOV
amounts of receivables and payables are offset against one
another and shown as net notional amounts to maintain
value of currency holdings in the “CAPITAL AND RESERVES’ portion of the Balance Sheet. The timing of the
establishment and settlement of such amounts is uncertain and, accordingly, it isnot practicable to determinea
fair value for such receivables and payables.

Onecountry madean arrangement with ADB that has
theeffect of continuing thesettlenent of thar MOV obligation. The “Amounts required to maintain value of currency
holdings’ under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS’ of
$316,000 represents the amount receivablefrom changesin
exchange rates of the member’s currency in rdation to the
United States dollar. In 2003, the arrangement was cancdled. Accordingly, this will no longer apply.

The net notional amounts as of 31 December 2003
consisted of (a) theincrease of $606,902,000 ($334,457,000
- 2002) in amounts required to maintain the value of currency holdings to the extent of matured and paid capital
subscriptions due to the increase in the value of the SDR
in relation to the United States dollar during the period
from 1 April 1978 to 31 December 2003 and (b) the net
decrease of $13,903,000 ($153,999,000- 2002) in the value
of such currency holdingsin relation to the United States
dollar during the same period. In terms of receivable from
and payable to members, they are as follows:

2003 2002
Notional MOV Receivables — $879,531,000 $718,212,000
Notional MOV Payables 258,726,000 229,756,000

Membership

As of 31 December 2003, ADB is owned by 63 member
countries, 45 countries from the region and 18 countries
from outsidetheregion (sseOCR-7). During 2003, Luxembourg and Palau have subscribed 12,040 and 114 shares of
ADB'scapital stock respectively, and remitted therequired
paid-in portion of their subscriptions.

NOTE J-RESERVES
Ordinary Reserveand Net Income

Under theprovisionsof Article40 of theCharter, theBoard
of Governors shall determine annually what part of thenet

income shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves, to surplus and what part, if any, shall be distributed to themembers. During 2003, of thenet incomefor the
year ended 31 December 2002, theamount of $473,059,000
wasallocated to the Ordinary Reserve ($7 14,464,000 - 2002)
and the amounts of $200,000,000 and $80,000,000 were
allocated to ADF and TASF, respectively (nil - 2002).

Therestatement of the capital stock for purposes of
these financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead
of the 1966 dollar (see NoteB) resulted in a net charge of
$50,567,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended 31 December 2003 ($56,808,000 - 2002). That chargeis
the increase in the value of the matured and paid capital
subscriptions caused by the change during the year in the
valueof theSDRin relation to the United States dollar not
allocated to membersasnotional maintenanceof valueadjustments in accordance with resolutions of the Board of
Directors.

Cumulative Revaluation AdjustmentsAcoount

In May 2002, the Board of Governors approved the allocation of net income representing the cumulative FAS 133
adjustment to a separate category of Reserves - “Cumulative Revaluation Adjustments Account.” During the year
theamount allocated of the31 December 2002 net income
was $224,756,000 ($147,601 ,000 - 2002). The amount in
the cumulative revaluation adjustments account as of
31 December 2003 was $372,257 ,000 ($147,601 000-2002).

Spedal Reserve

The Special Reserve includes commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article
17 of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist of term
deposits and government and government-guaranteed
obligations and areincluded under the heading “I NVESTMENTS.” For the year ended 31 December 2003, guarantee fees amounting to $2,302,000 ($861,000 — 2002) were
appropriated to Special Reserve.

Surplus

Surplus represents funds for future use to be determined
by the Board of Governors. No amounts were allocated by
the Board of Governors out of Surplus during 2003 and
2002.

Income

Comprehensive income has two major components: net
incomeand other comprehensiveincomecomprising gains
and losses affecting equity that, under generally accepted
accounting principles, areexcluded from net income. Other
comprehensive income includes such items as the effects
of the implementation of FAS 133, unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities and listed equity investments, currency translation adjustmentsand minimum
pension liability adjustment.

for the year ended 31 December 2003 were apportioned
between ordinary capital resources and the Asian Development Fund according to the number of loans and equity
investments approved during the year. Of thetotal administrative expenses of $285,136,000 ($254,372,000 - 2002),
$153,018,000 ($144,379,000 - 2002) was accordingly
charged to the Asian Devdopment Fund. The balance of

deferral of direct loan origination costs of $13,678,000
($19,440,000 -—2002) related to new loans for the year ended
31 December 2003 (see Notes B and E).

Following the approval by the Board of Directorsin
dune 2003 of the resumption of direct net income allocation to TASF to finance technical assistance (TA) operations, no TA commitments during the year were charged
to OCR current incomeas“ TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO
MEMBERCOUNTRIES.’ Accordingly thewrite-back in the
amount of $358,000 for the year represented cancellations
of the undisbursed amounts of completed TA projects
committed in prior periods (charges of $55,998,000 - 2002).

Asof 31 December 2003, thenet cumulativeamount
of TA commitments that had been charged to OCR current income in the prior years amounted to $75,601,000

Staff Reirenent Plan

ADB has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement
Plan (the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan,
shall, asa condition of service, become a participant from
the first day of service, provided that at such a date, the
employeehas not reached thenormal retirement ageof 60.
The Plan applies also to members of the Board of Directorswho dect tojoin thePlan. Retirement benefitsarebased
on length of service and highest average remuneration
during two years of eligible service. The Plan assets are
segregated and are not included in the accompanying
Balance Sheet. The costs of administering the Plan are
absorbed by ADB, except for fees paid to the investment

managers and related charges, including custodian fees,
which are borne by the Plan.

Participants arerequired to contribute9 1/3%of their
salary to the Plan and may also make additional voluntary
contributions. ADB's contribution is determined at arate
sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants’ contributions.

The expected amount of contributions to the Plan
for 2004, based on ADB's budgeted contribution rate of
15% and the participants mandatory contributions are
$17,431,000 and $10,846,000 respectively. In addition, at
year-end, ADB provided an additional contribution of
$2,000,000 to the Plan that will be transferred in 2004.

Contributionsin excess of current benefitspayments
areinvested in international financial markets and in avariety of investment vehicles. Investments areunde themanagement of sixinvestment agents and oneglobal custodian
who function within theguidelines established by thePlan’s
Investment Committee. Theinvestment of theseassets, over
thelong term, is expected to produce higher returns than
short-term investments. Theinvestment policy incorporates
the Plan’s package of desired investment returns, and tolerance for risk, taking into account the nature and duration of thePlan’sliabilities. ThePlan’s assets are diversified
among different markets and different asset classes. The
use of derivatives for speculation, leverage or taking risks
is prohibited. Selected derivatives are used for hedging and
transactional efficiency purposes.

The Plan’s investment policy is periodically reviewed and revised to reflect thebest interest of the Plan’s
participants and beneficiaries. Thecurrent policy, adopted in January 2003, specifies an asset-mix structure of
70% of assets in equities and 30%in fixed income securities. At present, investments of the Plan’s assets are
divided into three categories: US equity, Non-US equity, and US fixed income.

As of 31 December 2003 and 2002, the breakdown
of the fair value of plan assets held is as follows:

Podreirenent Medical BenefitsPlan

In 1993, ADB adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees’ medical insurance premiums. Under the plan, ADB is obligated
to pay 75%of the Group Medical Insurance Pian preniums
for retirees, including retired members of the Board of Directors, and their eligible dependents who dected to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of

related special purpose statements of revenues and expenses, cash flows and changes in fund balances
for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the
Asian Devdopment Bank. Our responsibility isto express an opinion on thesefinancial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our auditsin accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on atest basis, evidence supporting the amountsand disclosurein thefinancial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note B, the Board of Directors approved in May 2001 the adoption of special purpose
financial statements for the Asian Development Bank—Asian Deveopment Fund. With the adoption of
the special purpose financial statements, loan loss provisioning has been diminated. The accompanying

2003 and 2002, and of resources as at 31 December 2003 are presented for purposes of additional
analyses and are not required parts of the special purpose financial statements. Such information has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the special purpose financial statements and in our opinion is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the special purpose
financial statenents taken as a whole.

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2003 and 2002
NOTE A-NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established on
28 June 1974 to more effectively carry out the special operations of the Asian Devdopment Bank (ADB) by providing resources on concessional terms which are made
available almost exclusively to theleast developed borrowing countries.

The resources of ADF have been subsequently augmented by seven replenishments, themost recent of which
became effectivein June 2001 in atotal amount equivalent
to $2,791,483,000 to cover the operational requirements
for thefour-year period from January 2001. During theyear,
an allocation in the amount of $200,000,000 was made to
ADF from the 2002 net income of ADB's ordinary capital
resources (OCR).

NOTE B—SUM MARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the special purpose financial statements for ADF.
Due to the nature and organization of ADF, these financial statements havebeen prepared for thespecific purpose
of reflecting the sources and applications of member subscriptions. With theadoption of thespecial purposefinancial statements, loan loss provisioning hasbeen eliminated.
With the exception of the aforenentioned, the ADF financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Fundional Currendesand Reporting Currency

Thecurrenciesof contributing member countriesarefunctional currencies. The reporting currency is the United
States dollar, and the special purposefinancial statements
are expressed in thousands of current United States
dollars.

Trandation of Currendes

Assets, liabilities, anountsavailablefor loan commitments
and advancepaymentson contributionsaretransiated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency, generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. Revenue and expense amounts aretranslated for each semimonthly period, generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximatestheapplication of averagerates

in effect during the period. Other translation adjustments
are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments’ and reported in “FUND BALANCES’ as part
of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” Translation adjustments relating to set-aside resources (see Note
G) are recorded as notional amounts receivable from or
payable to ordinary capital resources. Exchange gains or
losses on currency transactions among functional currencies are included in revenue.

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of deposits held by ADF are considered by Management to be
“Available for Sale’ and are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and reported in “FUND BALANCES’ as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensiveincome.” Estimated fair
value represents market value. Time deposits are classified
as “Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost. Realized
gains and losses are included in revenue from investments
and aremeasured by thedifference between amortized cost
and the net proceeds of sales.

Scuurities Tranderred Under SeauritiesLendingArrangement

ADBaccountsfor transfers of financial assetsin accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a
replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfersareaccounted
for as sales under FAS 140 when ADB has relinquished
control over the transferred assets. Transfers that are not
accounted for assalesareaccounted for asrepurchaseagreements and collateralized financing arrangements.

Loans

It isthe policy of ADF to placein nonaccrual status loans
made to digible borrowing member countries if the principal or interest with respect to any such loans is overdue
by six months. Interest on nonaccruing loans is included
in revenue only to the extent that payments have actually
been received by ADF. ADB follows a policy of not taking
part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB
may agreeto debt rescheduling only after alternativecourses
of action have been exhausted. When ADB decides that a
particular loan is no longer collectible, the entire amount
will be expensed during the period.

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS PROVISION
Loans

Prior to 1 January 1999, loans of ADF were extended to
eligible borrowing member countries, which borea service
charge of 1%and required repayment over periods ranging
from 35 to 40 years. On 14 December 1998, the Board of
Directors approved an amendment to ADF loan terms, as
follows: (i) for loans to finance specific projects, the maturity was shortened to 32 years including an 8-year grace
period; (ii) for program loans to support sector development, the maturity was shortened to 24 yearsincluding an
8-year grace period; and (iii) all new loans bear a 1%interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5% during the
amortization period, with equal amortization. Thenew ADF
lending termstook effect on 1 January 1999 and apply only
to newloansfor which formal loan negotiationswere completed on or after 1 January 1999. ADF requires borrowers
to absorb exchangerisksattributableto fluctuationsin the
value of the currencies disbursed.

ADB bdieves that thereisno comparable market, nor
ADBintendsto sd itsloans. Theuseof market datato arrive
at theloan at fair valuewill givemeaninglessresults. Assuch,
the fair value of loans is determined using an entry value
method. Under this method, fair value is determined based
on thetermsat which asimilar loan would currently bemade
by ADB to asimilar borrower. For such loans, fair value approximates thecarrying amount. Theestimated fair value of
loans is not affected by credit risks because the amount of

any such adjustment is not considered to have a material
effect based on ADB's experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of
loans by country as of 31 December 2003 are shown in
ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector
loans in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 2003 was
$495,974,000 ($498, 137,000 -—2002) of which $106,895,000
($80,420,000 -2002) was overdue. Loansin nonaccrual status resulted in $4,620,000 ($5,009,000 - 2002) not being
recognized as income from loans for the year ended
31 December 2003. Theaccumulated interest on theseloans
that was not recognized asincomeas of 31 December 2003
would have totaled $28,281,000 ($24,361,000 — 2002). The
loans in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 2003 were
28 loans made to Myanmar (28 loans to Myanmar and 14
loans to Solomon Islands — 2002).

No private sector loan wasin nonaccrual status as of
31 December 2003 (nil — 2002).

Private sector loan outstanding as of 31 December
2003 was $5,962,000 ($5,502,000 — 2002), and there was
no undisbursed loan commitment (nil — 2002).

NOTE E—-DUE FROM CONTRIBUTORS

Included in “Duefrom contributors’ are notes of contributors and contributions receivable. Notes of contributors
arenonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing and, subject to certain restrictionsimposed by applicableBoard of Governors’
resolutions, encashable by ADB at par upon demand.

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2003 and 2002

ADB currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 2003 will be encashed in varying amounts
over an eight-year period ending 31 December 2011.

Thefair value of notes of contributorsis determined
using an entry value method, whereby fair value is determined based on thetermsat which notesarecurrently being
accepted from contributors. On this basis, the fair value of
outstanding notes of contributors approximates their carrying amount.

NOTE F—ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses for 2003 included a directly identifiable expense of $3,000 (nil - 2002) and administration
charge from ordinary capital resources amounting to
$153,018,000 ($144,379,000 - 2002). Thechargerepresents
an apportionment of all administrative expenses of ADB
(other than thosepertaining directly to ordinary operations
and special operations), based on thenumber of loans and
equity investments approved during the year.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
theArticles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired
“paid-in” capital paid by member countries pursuant to
Article6, paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of theconvertible currency portion paid by member countries pursuant
to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April
1973, to beused asa part of the Special Fundsof ADB. The
capital so set aside was allocated and transferred from the
ordinary capital resources to ADF as Set-Aside Resources.

Thecapital stock of ADBisdefined in Article4, paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States dollars
of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966”
(the 1966 dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been translated into the current United States
dollar (ADB's unit of account), on the basis of its par value
in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, therate
arrived at on this basiswas $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since
1 April 1978, at which timethe Second Amendment to the
Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) cameinto effect, currenciesno longer had par values

in terms of gold. Pending ADB's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources
have been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial statementsin termsof the Special Drawing Right (SDR),
at the valuein current United States dollars as computed
by the IMF. As of 31 December 2003, the valueof the SDR
in terms of the current United States dollar was $1.48597
($1.35458 - 2002). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources
amounted to $70,746,000 ($64,491,000 - 2002). If the capital stock of ADB as of 31 December 2003 had been valued
in termsof $12,063.50 per share, Set-AsideResourceswould
have been $57,435,000.

NOTE H—COM PREHENSIVE INCOME AND
ACCUMULATED OTHER
COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income has two major components: net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities and currency translation
adjustments.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair valueof afinancial instrument isdefined astheamount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair value.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine fair values. Financial instruments for which market
quotations arenot readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the
use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value
at which such financial instruments could be exchanged
in acurrent transaction, or whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

Thecarrying amountsof ADF’sassets, liabilities, and
fund balances are considered to approximate fair values
for all significant financial instruments. See NotesB, C, D,
and E for discussions relating to investments, loans, and
notes of contributors.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2003 and 2002

NOTE A-NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to
devdoping member countries of the Asian Devdopment
Bank (ADB) and for regional technical assistance. TASF
resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by
members, allocations from the net income of ordinary
capital resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund
(ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and
other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presmtation of theFinandal Satenents

Thefinancial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.
TASF reports contributed cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulationsthat limit theuseof thedonated assets. When adonor
restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purposerestriction isaccomplished, temporarily restricted net
assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets as net assets released from restrictions. There were no
restricted net assets at 31 December 2003 and 2002.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gainsand
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value represents
market value. Time deposits are classified as “Held-toMaturity” and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions from members areincluded in thefinancial
statementsfrom thedatecontribution agreements become
effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted
bythem to technical assistance (TA) projects’ programswith
specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Thosewithout any stipulations
as to specific use are accounted for as unrestricted
contributions.

Technical Asistanceto Menber Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes
effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in technical
assistance for the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars. Asa matter of convenience, the United States dollar is the functional and
reporting currency and is used to measure exchange gains
and losses.

Trandation of Currendes

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of areporting period.
Contributionsincluded in thefinancial statenents during
the year are recognized at applicable exchange rates as of
the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense
amountsin currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semimonthly period generally at theapplicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practiceapproximatestheapplication of averagerates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are
accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are charged
or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

Thepreparation of financial statementsin conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expensesduring theyear. Theactual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2003 and 2002

Redasification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have
been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

NOTE CHNVESTMENTS

Themain investment management objectiveisto maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeksthehighest possiblereturn on itsinvestments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directorsin 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in government and government-rdated debt instrumentsand in timedeposits. In the
US dollar portfolio only and up to limited amounts, investmentsmay bemadein corporatebondsrated A or better,
AAA-rated asset-backed securities, and AAA rated mortgagebacked securities. In addition, ADB may purchaseand sell
financial futures and option contract, and enter into interest exchangeagreements, currency exchangeagreements
and forward rate agreements. Securities may be lent, borrowed, and sold short.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as of 31 December 2003 and 2002 expressed in United States dollars are as follows:

Currency 2003 2002
Australian dollar $ 8,359,000 $ 6,027,000
Canadian dollar 131,321,000 124,352,000
Euro 15,315,000 12,354,000
United States dollar 68,789,000 8,239,000
Others 4,709,000 3,993,000

Total $228,493,000 $154,965,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held at
the beginning and end of each month was 2.78% (2.86%2002).

NOTE D-FUNDING

Since inception in 1967, direct contributions have been
madeby 29 menber countries. In 1986 and 1992, theBoard
of Governors, in authorizing areplenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $72,000,000 and $140,000,000, respectively, to be used for technical assistance to ADF borrowing developing member countries and for regional
technical assistance.

In 2003, $80,000,000 was allocated out of OCR net
income to TASF bringing the accumulated allocation out
of OCR net income to $581,000,000.

Some of the direct contributions received were subject to restricted procurement sources, while some were
given on condition that the technical assistance be made
on ardmbursable basis. The total contributions received
for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2002 werewithout restrictions.

NOTE E-UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United
States dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA projects/ programs which are not yet disbursed
as of the end of the year. During 2003, an amount of
$10,136,000 ($3,870,000 - 2002) representing completed
and canceled TA projects has been written back as areduction in technical assistance of the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated.
Thefair value of undisbursed commitments approximates
theamountsundisbursed becauseADB expects that grants
will be made for all projects’ programs covered by the commitments. Prior to 1 January 2002, when technical assistance provided as a project preparatory grant leads to an
ADBloan, theamount of thegrant exceeding $250,000 will
be refunded by the borrower through the loan proceeds
under the terms of that ADB loan. Refinanced amount of
$458,000 ($2,625,000 - 2002) was charged to such loans
and credited to revenue from other sources of the TASF
during the year ended 31 December 2003. All project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) funded from TASF
and OCR current income approved on or after 1 January
2002 are no longer subject to cost recovery.

NOTE F—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS

Fair valueof afinancial instrument isdefined astheamount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair valueand thus unrealized loss was not
incurred as of 31 December 2003.

Thecarrying amountsof TASF’sassets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes
B and E for discussions with respect to investments and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2003 and 2002

NOTE A-NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The.apan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when Japan and the Asian Devedopment Bank (ADB) entered into a financial arrangement whereby Japan agreed
to make an initial contribution and ADB became the administrator. The purpose of JSF is to help developing
member countries (DMCs) of ADB restructure their economies and broaden the scope of opportunities for new
investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to
DMCs of ADB. While JSF resources are used mainly to
financetechnical assistance(TA) operations, theseresources
may also beused for equityinvestment operationsin ADB's
DMCs. Under theagreement between ADB and Japan, ADB
may invest the proceeds of JSF pending disbursement.

In March 1999, the Board approved the acceptance
and administration by ADB of a new facility, the Asian
Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF) to assist Asian
currency crisis-affected member countries (CAMCs). Funded by Japan, ACCSF was established within JSF to assist in
theeconomicrecovery of CAMCsthrough interest payment
assistance (IPA) grants, TA grants, and guarantees. With
the general fulfillment of the purpose of the facility, Japan
and ADB agreed to terminatetheACCSF on 22 March 2002.
An amount of $90 million in the ACCSF account, upon
request of Japan, was transferred to the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction (JFPR). JFPR, established by Japan in
May 2000 supporting innovative poverty reduction and
related social development activities, is one of the trust
funds managed by ADB. The ACCSF account is to be kept
open until thecompletion of all TAand IPA disbursements
and the settlement of all administrative expenses.

NOTE B—SUM MARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presmtation of the Finandal Statenents

The financial statements of JSF are presented on the basis
of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. ACCSF
funds are separately reported in the financial statements.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as restricted support if they are received with donor
stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When
thedonor restriction expires, that is, when astipulated time
or purposerestriction isaccomplished, tenporarily restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and
reported in the Statement of Activities and Changesin Net
Assets as “NET ASSETS RELEASED FROM
RESTRICTIONS.”

Investments

All investment securities held by JSF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value represents
market value. Time deposits are classified as “Held-toMaturity’ and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statementsfrom thedateindicated by Japan that fundsareexpected to bemadeavailable. Contributionswhich arerestricted by
thedonor for specific TA projects’ programsor for IPA grants
are Classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those
without any stipulation asto specific useareaccounted for as
unrestricted contributions and reported as such.

Technical Asistanceand Interest Payment Asistance

Technical assistance and interest payment assistance are
recognized in the financial statements when the related
project or assistance is approved and becomes effective.
Upon completion of the TA project or cancellation of a
grant, any undisbursed amount is written back as areduction in TA or IPA for the year and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is diminated, accordingly.

Fundional Currency and Reporting Currency

The United States dollar is considered the functional currency asit hasbecomethecurrency of theprimary economic
operating environment of the Fund. Thereporting currencyisthe United States dollar. Thefinancial statements are
expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Trandation of Currendes

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
to thereporting currency at theapplicablerates of exchange
at the end of areporting period. Contributions included in
the financial statements during the year are translated at
the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of
commitment. Revenue and expense amounts are translated
for each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on exchange differences between the date a
project/program is committed and the timing of disburse

ments. Exchange gains or losses are charged or credited to
operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values
are reported at fair value. The reserve against losses is established quarterly based on Management’s evaluation of
potential losses on investments without readily determinable fair values.

AccountingEsimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the
year and thereported amounts of incomeand expenses during
theyear. Theactual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

Redassfication

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have
been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

NOTE CHNVESTMENTS

Themain investment management objectiveisto maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB

seeksthehighest possiblereturn on itsinvestments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directorsin 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in government and government-rdated debt instrumentsand in timedeposits. In the
US dollar portfolio only and up to limited amounts, investments may bemadein corporatebondsrated A or better,
AAA-rated asset-backed securities, and AAA rated mortgagebacked securities. In addition, ADB may purchase and sell
financial futures and option contract, and enter into interest exchangeagreements, currency exchangeagreements
and forward rate agreements. Securities may be lent, borrowed, and sold short.

The investment portfolios of both JSF and ACCSF
as of 31 December 2003 and 2002 are comprised of United
States dollars holdings.

Theannualized rates of return on theaverageinvestments held under ACCSF and JSF funds during the year,
based on the portfolio held at the beginning and end of
each month were 1.45%and 1.30% respectively (1.54%and
2.15% respectively — 2002).

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB used JSF resources to make an equity investment in
Indiain 1990. Commencing May 2001, dueto theunavailability of areliablemarket for theinvestment, ADB reported the investment at its written down value of $111,000
($106,000 - 2002).

NOTE H—CONTRIBUTIONS AND TEMPORARILY
RESTRICTED NET ASSETS

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 2003 and
2002 were received during the respective years. Some of the
contributions received were with restriction that were to be
utilized for specific TA projects/ programs. Such contributions
were Classified as temporarily restricted support.

Effective 31 December 2002, all remaining tenporarily restricted net assets under JSF were transferred and
integrated into the regular net assets, as concurred by Japan, in order to optimize the use of JSF. Similarly, Japan
lifted the restriction over the use of net accumulated investment income, which under the original terms of agreement between ADB and Japan, may only be used for
defraying JSF’s administrative expenses. Japan agreed to
use the net accumulated investment income as additional
resources for funding future ADB's TA operations.

Thetemporarily restricted uncommitted balance remaining available as of 31 December 2003 corresponds to
funds under ACCSF of $25,067,000 ($26,211,000 - 2002)
to cover completion of TA disbursements and the amount
of net accumulated investment income of $2,402,000
($1,818,000 - 2002) for settlement of all administrative
expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions rdate to commitments for technical assistancesatisfying theconditions
specified by the donor and, in the case of accumulated investment income, to defray the administrative expenses of
the Fund.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable estimate of fair valueand thus unrealized loss was not
incurred as of 31 December 2003.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine fair values. Financial instruments for which market
quotations arenot readily available are valued using methodologies and assumptions which necessarily require the

use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value
at which such financial instruments could be exchanged
in a current transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The carrying amounts of JSF’s assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes

NOTE E—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Reirenent Plan

TheInstituteparticipatesin the contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of ADB. Every member of theprofessional staff, as defined under thePlan, shall,
as a condition of service, become a participant from the
first day of service, provided that at such a date, the staff
has not reached the normal retirement age of 60. Retirement benefits are based on length of service and highest
average remuneration during two years of eligible service.
The Plan assets are segregated and are not included in the
statement of financial position. The costs of administering the Plan are absorbed by ADB, except for fees paid to
the investment managers and related charges, including
custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

Participants arerequired to contribute9 1/3%of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions. The Institute's contribution is determined at arate
sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants contributions.

The expected amount of contributions to the Plan
for 2004, based on the Institute's contribution ratefor the
coming year of 15% and the participants’ mandatory contribution are $138,000 and $86,000 respectively.

Contributionsin excess of current benefits payments
are invested in international financial markets and in a
variety of investment vehicles. Investments are under the
management of six investment agents and one global custodian who function within the guidedines established by
thePlan’sInvestment Committee. Theinvestment of these
assets, over the long term, is expected to produce higher
returnsthan short-term investments. Theinvestment policy
incorporates the Plan’s package of desired investment returns, and tolerance for risk, taking into account the natureand duration of thePlan’sliabilities. The Plan's assets
are diversified among different markets and different asset classes. The use of derivatives for speculation, leverage
or taking risksis prohibited. Selected derivatives are used
for hedging and transactional efficiency purposes.

ThePlan’sinvestment policy is periodically reviewed
and revised to reflect the best interest of the Plan’s participants and beneficiaries. The current policy, adopted in
January 2003, specifies an asset-mix structure of 70% of
assets in equities and 30% in fixed income securities. At
present, investments of the Plan’s assets are divided into
three categories: US equity, Non-US equity, and US fixed
income.

As of 31 December 2003 and 2002, the breakdown
of the fair value of plan assets held is as follows:

a Includes special assistance loans and private sector loans but excludes loans terminated. The USdollar equivalent isin accordance with the exchange rate prevailing
in ADB at the time of loan approval.
b Net refers to effective loan amounts less cancellations.
c TheUSdollar equivalent isin accordance with the exchange rate prevailing in ADBon 31 December 2003. The cumulative contracts awarded exceed the net effective
loan amounts due to the following reasons:
(i) for countries without active loans, the base contract amount of loans that were closed prior to computerization does not reflect the adjustment with regard
to procurement data, e.g., Afghanistan; and
(ii) for countries with active loans, the contract amount entered is basically the percentage of the ADB-financed portion, and each contract amount was adjusted
upon completion of disbursement.
d Excludes private sector loans without government guarantee.

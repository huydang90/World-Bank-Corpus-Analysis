125INTERNATIONAL BACKGROUND

1971 was generally a difficult year for the developing member countries of. the Asian Development
Bank. Efforts to cope with the ever-present and
continuing problem of sustaining an accelerated
rate of development, formidable enough in itself,
were subject to major strains and setbacks. Concurrently, foreign assistance increased marginaily
while the externat debt service payments due on
existing debt became more pressing. Armed conflict,
insurgency and political upheavat absorbed scarce
resources and impeded development activity in some
countries; the Bank’s regional members in general
were not immune from the effects of the convulsions

Note

in the international monetary system and adjustments
will need to be made in the light of new values of the
major trading currencies.

The events of 1971 that will undoubtedly have
serious repercussions for the developing member
countries have cast a shadow of uncertainty over the
future of their economies. The consequences of the
impending enlargement of the European Economic
Community, the effect of generalized trade preferences
for the products of developing countries, the efforts
of the major powers to disengage from their military
involvements in Asia and the uncertainty over foreign
assistance programs are alt of great significance for
the region, but as yet their precise effects are unpredictable.

Where United States dollar equivalents have been given in this Report, the par
values, provisional or parity rates existing before 18 December 1977 have

been used.THE YEAR IN BRIEF

For the Bank itself, the outstdnding event of 1971
was the decision by the Board of Governors to
increase the authorized capital stock by 150 per cent
from $1,100 million to $2,750 million. The increase
in capital becomes effective upon 100,000 shares
being subscribed by 30 September 1972. The final
date for payment of the first instalment of subscription
is 6 April 1973. The addition in capital will permit
lending operations to grow by more than 10 per cent
per annum over the next four years without damage
to the Bank's liquidity position or over-dependence
on borrowing.

The ability to raise funds in the capital markets is,
of course, of vital importance to the Bank's future and
the foundations for future borrowing on a sustained
and more substantial scale were further strengthened
during the year. The Bank borrowed $121.7 million
equivalent in 1971 by marketing five public issues
aggregating $101.7 million equivalent in Austria,
Belgium, Japan, Switzerland and United States, as
well as by private placement of $20 million bonds
with central banks and government agencies in the
region.

tn other respects, the past year—the Bank's
fifth—-was essentially one of consolidation. A high
rate of lending was maintained; loan approvals
reached $254 million, about 40 per cent of total loan
approvals since the first loan was made in January
4968. Electric power in 1971 accounted for 41.5 per
cent of the total lending; industry, including indirect
lending through industrial development banks—18.2
per cent; transport and communications—17.4 per
cent; agriculture, including irrigation and fisheries—
10.8 per cent; and water supply~12.4 per cent.

A feature of importance in the context of the
difficult debt-servicing problem of many regional
developing countries has been the growing share of
concessional lending from Special Funds resources
in the Bank's operations. Special Operations in 1971
accounted for 12 out of the total 28 loans approved

compared with 10 out of a total of 32 loans in 1970.
Of the 13 countries which were active borrowers in
1971 eight received concessional loans totatling
$51.5 million.

Apart from its primary task of providing loan funds
for development, the Bank continued to provide
technical assistance for project preparation and other
project-oriented purposes. Fifteen projects were
approved during the year at an estimated cost of
$1,536,000.

Two new capital contributions to the Bank's
Special Funds resources were received during the
year: 66.8 million Deutsche mark ($18.2 million)
from the Federal Republic of Germany payable in four
annual instalments, and 10.8 billion yen ($30 million)
from Japan. Both contributions were made to the
Multi-Purpose Specia! Fund, the Bank's main source
of funds for concessional lending. The MultiPurpose Special Fund was further strengthened by
the “setting-aside” of an amount of $9.9 million from
the Bank’s capital. The Technical Assistance Special
Fund received new contributions from seven
countries. Two other countries further extended the
arrangements under which contributions were made
in earlier years.

{mportant stages were reached during the year in
several major undertakings of regional significance:
the Regional Transport Survey—covering seven
countries but with much wider potential benefit—
was completed; a study of "Southeast Asia's
Economy in the 1970‘s” was published in November;
a study of the Coconut Industry in the region was
commissioned. Arrangements were made whereby
the Bank will be in a better position in future to
cooperate in the development of the Mekong Basin.

With the admission in April of the Territory of
Papua and New Guinea, the membership increased to
36, This broadening of the Bank's international
character was reflected in the recruitment of staff:

_ with the addition in 1971 of 32 professional officers

and 30 non-professional staff, the number of
nationalities represented increased from 31 to 34.In 1971 the Bank continued to review, as necessary, policy matters relating to its lending operations.
in connection with the proposals for an increase in
the capital stock of the Bank, various policy issues
including interest rate, commitment charge, coverage
of commitments by resources and loans in local
currency were examined by the Bank.

Selection of Projects

The operations of the Bank consist principatly of
financing specific projects, with a view to fostering
economic growth in and ccoperation among the
developing member countries. The limited resources
available to the Bank in comparison with the needs of
its developing members require a careful and judicious
selection of projects. A general review of a country's
economic development, with emphasis on the
national and sectoral development programs and
prospects, is therefore a prerequisite to the selection
of projects. After confirming that a project is located
in a sector which justifies investment, the Bank
undertakes economic evatuation of the project. Only
those projects with sufficient economic justification
will be considered for financing. The Bank would
also have to be satisfied with the overall financial
arrangements for the projects, and in the case of a
revenue-earning project, an appropriate financial
return will have to be achieved. Needless to say, the
project to be chosen by the Bank should be sound in
technical, organizational and managerial aspects.
In this connection, it may be mentioned that the Bank
provides technical assistance, either on a reimbursable
or non-reimbursabie basis, to help its developing
member countries identify and prepare projects.

No particular economic sector is singled out for
special emphasis in the process of project selection;
sound investment opportunities may be available in
any branch of the economy but the requirements of a
country’s current development strategy may lead to
concentration at times in a particular area. Nevertheless, it is expected that over a period, the range of
the Bank’s operations in different economic sectors
would be substantially diversified.

In its approach to the selection of projects for
financing from Special Funds, similar criteria have
been used as for projects financed from the ordinary
capital resources of the Bank. Generally, projects
are selected which have a distinct and justifiable
priority in the development plans of the countries
concerned, and which could generate substantial
economic benefits even if these would not always be
translated into corresponding financial or foreign
exchange returns. .

There is no predetermined country allocation for
the Speciat Funds loans. The general guideline
followed by the Bank has been that no developing
member country should be denied access to such
loans. While in the main, recipients have been the
less-developed of the developing member countries,
Special Funds loans have also been made for prajects
related to agricultural development, communications,
infrastructure and technical éducation in other
developing member countries.

Based on the experience gained in Special
Operations, a study was prepared on the criteria for
the use of Special Funds resources for consideration
by the Board of Directors early in 1972.

Interest Rate

The Bank has endeavored to keep the interest rate
on its loans from ordinary capital resources as low as
possible in view of its role as a development financing
institution and the needs of the developing member
countries. It is to be kept in mind, at the same time,
that earning capacity is important in order to build up
adequate reserves and to achieve the financial
soundness without which it would be difficult to
raise additional resources in the world capital markets
at reasonable cost. Apart from maintaining a reasonable bafance between these two objectives, it is also
important to keep the Bank's lending rate sufficiently
compatible with the rate charged by other international financing institutions operating in the region.
Based on these considerations, the Bank’s lending
rate of 7-1/2 per cent per annum was maintained in
1971.

Commitment Charge

The Bank levies a commitment charge on undisbursed portions of joans from ordinary capital
resources, The rate of commitment charge, initially
fixed at 3/4 of one per cent per annum, was fowered
to 1/2 of one per cent per annum in May 1970, as
indicated in the Annual Report for 1970. Towards
the end of 1970 and during the year 1971, the Bank's
loan operations expanded rapidly which also necessitated sizeable borrowing by the Bank in capital
markets. The average cost of these borrowings was
significantly higher than the average return to the
Bank on investments of borrowed funds pending
their use in loan disbursements, The short-term and
long-term interest rate structure in the major capital
markets in the last months of 19771 also indicated the
likelihood of a continuing— and possibly widening —
gap between high borrawing costs and lower investment returns. In view of this, it was decided in
December 74977 to restore the commitment chargested by a Bank loan.

 

Philippines: Improvement and expansion of Navotas Fisheries Port will be awe A

to the origina! level of 3/4 of one per cent per annum
to be applied to loans from ordinary capital resources
approved after 1 January 1972. In fixing the rate at
this level the Bank also gave due consideration to the
need to minimize the burden on its borrowers as well
as the desirability of maintaining reasonable comparability with similar charges levied by other international development financing institutions.

Loan Administration

The rapid growth in the Bank’s loan portfolio calls
for greater attention to Joan administration. As the
imptementation of the various projects gathers
momentum, problems appear in some projects and
these are dealt with by frequent consultations with
borrowers as well as continuous close supervision
and follow-up by the staff. The organizational
structure appropriate to handle this task, at this stage,
has been established.

In 1971 forty-nine review missions to 14 countries
covering 51 projects were mounted. These missions

(i) Percentage of Disbursements to Amount of Loans Approved

Amount of Loans

have enabled the staff to conduct useful discussions
with clients in overcoming problems connected with
the conditions to be met for loans to become effective, recruitment of consultants, preparation of tender
documents, issuance of invitations to bid, evaluation
of bids, project organization and management and
fulfillment of covenants incorporated in the loan
documents. The missions have also enabled the
Bank to assess the actual physical progress of project
construction and to provide on-the-spot solutions
to implementational problems. As a result of these
efforts, delays in completing the various legai,
administrative or other conditions required before
loans become effective have been greatly reduced.
In addition, the rate of procurement of goods and
services and the rate of loan withdrawals have
improved: the total value of contracts awarded
in 4971 was $66,254,370 while disbursements
amounted to $48,726,301. Percentages of disbursements to the end of 1977 for (i) loans approved and

The Bank continued to expand its tending
operations in 1971. Twenty-eight loans totalling
$254 million were approved during the year compared with 32 loans of $245.6 million in 1970. The
loans were spread over 43 countries, including the
Territory of Papua and New Guinea which received
its first loan from the Bank.

Since lending from Special Funds resources began
in mid-1968 there has been a continued increase in
the volume of Special Operations, reflecting the
extent of the need for concessional finance in the
developing member countries. In the year under
review 12 loans totalling $51.5 million were committed as against 10 loans of $33.7 million in 1970.
Eight countries—Ceylon, tndonesia, Laos, Nepal,
the Philippines, Territory of Papua and New Guinea,
Republic of Viet-Nam and Western Samoa—-received
Special Funds loans. In the case of one project— for
a fisheries port in the Philippines—ordinary and
Special Funds loans were blended.

As the table below shows, cumulative loan
approvals at the end of 1977 stood at 85 foans
totalling $638.5 million, comprising 57 loans for
$531.3 million from ordinary capital resources and
28 loans for $107.2 million from Special -Funds
resources.

A wide range of development activities was
financed by the Bank in 1971, including for the first
time a project for a multi-purpose dam, a com
munications project and an animal husbandry project.
Electric power development absorbed the largest
portion of the Bank's lending—41.5 per cent.
Industry, including indirect lending through industrial development banks, accounted for 18.2 per
cent; transport and communications for 17.4 per cent;
water supply for 12.1 per cent; and agriculture for
10.8 per cent. Cumulative approvals as at the end of
1971 showed a more even spread over the various
sectors, Loans to industry, both direct and through
the intermediary of industrial development banks, had
the largest share with 32 per cent; electric power
accounted for 23.7 per cent; transport and communications —21.4 per cent; agriculture—14,4 per
cent; water supply—8 per cent; and education—
less than 1 pet cent. Aggregate lending on a sectoral
basis, both for 1971 and cumulative to the end of
1971, is shown in the table on page 16.

As the Bank’s lending covers only the foreign
exchange cost of the various projects, the total
development effort assisted by the Bank far exceeds
the amount of Bank financing. 1t is estimated that the
total cost of projects directly financed by the Bank in
1971 was $514 million, the Bank's loans representing
about 41 per cent. The provision of local currency
funds is generally the responsibility of governments
or the executing agencies of the projects. With
respect to loans to national developments banks,
local currency resources would also be required to
supplement the Bank's financing.

Technical Assistance

Considerable emphasis has been given by the
Bank to its technical assistance activities in order to
help developing member countries in project preparation and implementation, sectoral studies, policy
formulation and institution building. Excluding
regional activities 15 technical assistance projects
totalling $1.5 million were approved during 1971.
These covered such economic activities as rural
development, irrigation, crop plantation, timber
marketing, a fisheries port, chemicals, power supply
and road work, bridge and port studies.

About 80 per cent of the technical assistance
commitments entered into in 1971 was for project
preparation, Such technical assistance normally
leads to “bankable projects and constitutes an
important source of projects in the pipeline. ft is
notable that among the 28 loans approved during the

SERVICES TO MEMBER

yeat, nine originated from eatlier technical assistance
extended by the Bank. In addition, the Bank has
continued to provide technical assistance for the
implementation of loan projects as well as advisory
services in certain fields of economic activity.

The Bank has provided technical assistance grants
either out of its net income or from contributions to
the Technical Assistance Special Fund. Technical
assistance projects financed on a reimbursable basis
are treated as foans. Provision has usually been made
that should the technical assistance provided as 4
grant result in a loan from the Bank, part or ali of the
grant may be charged against the foan at the option
of the Bank. In 1971 the Bank exercised this option
in five loans which resulted from previous technical
assistance.

2 Excluding regional projects.Regional Activities

As a regional financing institution ane of the
important functions of the Bank is to promote regional
cooperation and development. Two regional studies
were initiated in 1971-—a study of the Coconut
industry in the region and an Evaluation Study of
Nong Khai/Vientiane’ Bridge across the Mekong
River between Laos and Thailand. .

As a follow-up to the Conference of Development
Banks held in 1969, a pane} of experts is expected to
meet in Manila early in 1972 to consider a program
of action based on a report on development bank
training facilities prepared by the Bank.

An important regional event was the completion
during the year of the Regional Transport Survey
which had been initiated by the Bank in October
1969 at the request of seven Southeast Asian

countries with the primary objective of providing abasis for coordinated development of transportation
in these countries.

The Bank has also made a contribution to
the Asian Industrial Survey which is being sponsored
by the United Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East.

As of the end of 1971 the Bank had been engaged
in several loan and technical assistance activities in
the Mekong Basin. Further activities in this area are
envisaged under an arrangement with the United
Nations Development Programme, the World Bank,
and the Committee for Investigations of the Lower
Mekong Basin whereby the Bank will act as delegated
executing agent for selected agricultural pioneer
projects. Regional projects, both current and completed, are listed in the following table:

AGRICULTURE

The agricultural sector (including forestry and
fisheries) provides economic sustenance for over 70
per cent of Asia's population and accounts for almost
50 per cent of its gross annual product and an equally
high proportion of export earnings.

To equip itself to work effectively in this vast and
vital sector, the Bank, as its first operational activity,
undertook the Asian Agricultural Survey, a study
which provided a basic inventory of resources and
problems of agriculture and its various subsectors,
including crucial aspects of irrigation, agro-industries
and rural institutions. The Bank's operations in this
field have, since that time, been guided by the study
as well as by subsequent developments, such as the
iessened concern about food shortages as a result

ot advances in new technologies for rice and wheat, .

and the increased attention to the resulting need for
ctop diversification: Considerable emphasis has been
placed by the Bank on water resources development
—not simply the construction of major dams but also
effective irrigation, drainage, flood control, crop
development and water management so that the
real benefit will be felt at the farm level.

Loans to the agricultural sector by the Bank have
been coupled with ‘technical assistance in various
forms to a greater degree than in other sectors. As at
the end of 1970, the Bank had approved for agriculture 20 loans totalling $64.6 million plus 24 technical
assistance operations. The principal areas of attention
were water resources, integrated agricultural development, industrial crops, agro-industries, farm mechanization, fisheries and livestock. The technical

.assistance extended by the Bank to development

financing institutions kas often aided institutions
much involved in providing agricultural credit.

In 4971 six loans totalling $27.3 million were
approved in the agricultural sector, with four
countries— Indonesia, Nepal, Republic of Viet-Nam
and Western Samoa—as recipients. The foans
ranged from $330,000 for a beef cattle project in
Western Samoa to $9.2 million for a dam project
in indonesia. The other loans were for a rubber and
oil palm rehabilitation project, two other water
resource development projects and a loan to assist
in the modernization of an agricultural development
bank. All six loans were given on concessional
terms from the Special Funds of the Bank. In addition,
the loan of $22 million to the Republic of Korea for

Technical Assistance

APGHANISTAN: Baikh River Irrigation
Project

A technical assistance grant of up to $202,000
was approved for the Balkh River Irrigation Project
in Afghanistan. The Balt&h River, located in the north
of Afghanistan, provides irrigation water for about
100,000 hectares in Balkk Province and 80,000
hectares in Jozjan Province. These regions are the
ieading producers of important export products such
as cotton, oi] seed, karakul pelt, wool and fruit. At
present, only one-third of the farm land receives
irrigation water in any one year. The present diversion
structures are farmer-built and lack any control

structures. This leads to an inequitable distribution
of water. In addition, the area suffers from flood
damage. These problems have been studied by
various agencies and individuals but no comprehensive pian for the development of the irrigation,
drainage, road network and integrated agricultural
development of the area has been formulated. The
proposed technical assistance is directed toward these
objectives as well as an assessment of the importance
of flood damage to the diversion system itself and to
the agricultural lands, and to providing suggestions
for remedial measures. The Balkh Canal, serving
4,500 hectares, has been selected as the pilot area
for the proposed technical assistance.

AFGHANISTAN: Kama Irrigation Project

Asecond technical assistance grant to Afghanistan
of up to $127,000 was approved for the Kama Iitigation Project. This is a quick-yielding and smallscale investment project, located near Jalalabad.
It commands 5,500 hectares of arable land and it is
proposed to extend this irrigable area depending on
the findings of a soil survey. The area is capable of
producing at least two crops per year and farmers
claim that they could obtain marked increases in
yield with adequate water supplies. Under this
technical assistance project, a plan will be developed
for the irrigation and drainage of the area, a soil
survey will be undertaken to determine the extent
of new land that is suitable for irrigation development,
a program for integrated agricultural development
will be proposed and a feasibility study will be undertaken.

In conjunction with the loan for the rehabititation
and development: of the National Estate Enterprise
Perusahan Negara Perkebunan |! (PNP II), the
Bank approved a technical assistance grant of
$90,000 to cover the cost of the following: (a) visits
by an expert agronomist and by an expert engineer
each year from 1973 to 1976 to evaluate the progress of the Project and to suggest improvement
measures after the technical experts provided for
under the loan have completed their assignments;
(b) an expert in accounting systems analysis to work
with PNP {I for six months to review the entire financial, accounting and cost system and formulate an
improved system; and (c) suitable training and observation visits to successful plantations for selected

INDONESIA: Market Survey of West Irian
Timber

A technical assistance grant of up to $45,000 was
approved for a market study of the timber and timber
products of West Irian. The Manokwari area of West
lrian has been the subject of a systematic investigation of forest resources and is the site of asawmill and
prefabricated housing unit. In recent years, however,
the intake of the sawmill has been well below plant
capacity due to a fack of skilled personnel to operate
the plant, worn-out machinery and equipment anda
severe shortage of spare parts. Before preparing plans
for the rehabilitation and expansion of the Manokwari complex, however, it was deemed necessary
to review the possible market outlets, especially as
the two major. commercial species, Instia and Pometia,
differ trom other tropical timbers popular in international markets. Timber export to Japan and the
domestic prefabricated housing market would appear
to be the most promising fields for development.

  
   

Development Project.

NEPAL: Chitwan Valley Development Project

A grant of up to $242,000 was approved for the
preparation of a feasibility study of an irrigation
system and foy the formulation of an integrated
agricultural development program in the Chitwan
Valley in Nepal. The Chitwan Valley, in the flat Terrai
region, has good prospects for agricultural development because of its fertile soil and its accessibility to
internal and external markets, It is also a new settlement area. The Bank-assisted study will recommend
the most suitable irrigation system for the Lohathar
area covering 12,000 hectares in the Valley. The
integrated agricultural development program, 10 be
planned for both Lohathar and the adjoining 7,000hectare Upper Khageri area, will cover soil conservation and improvement, irrigation, cropping patterns,
animal husbandry, product processing, marketing,
agricultural research and extension, and farm organizations and institutions. In the Upper Khageri area,
the Bank's technical assistance will help also with
plans for setting up a 300-hectare pilot farm involving
100 to 150 farmers.ELECTRIC POWER

The largest section of the Bank's lending in 1971
— $105.5 million or over 40 per cent of the total —
went to the power sector.

The provision of adequate power generation,
transmission and distribution facilities is a vital basis
for industrial growth in a developing country, in
addition to the significant demand for power for
domestic and agricultural uses. It is to be expected,
therefore, that international financing organizations
such as the Bank will be asked to play a major role in
this field. : 2 :

To the end of 1970 five loans for power supply
totailing $46 million had been extended by the Bank.
Two technical assistance operations in the power
field — one for project preparation and the other for
project implementation — had also been approved.

in 1971 the Republic of China and indonesia each
teceived two loans for power development. The
Philippines received a loan of $23.4 million—the
largest loan for the year—for a transmission and
hydropower generation project in Mindanao. Loans
were also made for power projects in Republic of
Korea, Laos, Singapore and Thailand and there was a
substantial power element in the loan for the Andong
Bam Multi-Purpose Development Project in the
Republic of Korea. Technical assistance grants were
extended during the year to Western Samoa and
Indonesia for the preparation of power supply projects
for possible future financing.

Loans

REPUBLIC OF CHINA: $500,000 for the Li-Wu
Chi Hydroelectric Power Development Project.

The toan is to be used by the Taiwan Power Company (TAIPOWER) to finance the foreign exchange
cost of the detailed design and preparation of tender
documents for the development of the Li-Wu Chi
hydroelectric facilities in Eastern Taiwan

In order to meet the expected demand of power
and to strengthen system planning, TAIPOWER has
evolved a Ten-Year Power Development Program
covering the period 1971-1980. The Program provides for the construction of large thermal power
stations for economic generation of system base load
and of hydropower plants for low cost peak load production. Detailed studies carried aut for the assessment of the hydropower schemes in Taiwan show
that only the 53-kilometer long Li-Wu River and the
Mukua River still have untapped major hydropower

fesources capable of economic exploitation. Li-Wu
Chi is the more important prospect because of its
high peaking potential: a peak power capacity of 240
megawatts in two separate plants with an energy production of 1,036 million kilowatt hours per annum is
considered to be economically feasible.

The Project is estimated to cost $1,020,000 of
which the local currency component will be provided by TAIPOWER. i

REPUBLIC OF CHINA: $22,500,000 for the
Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project.

The purpose of the loan is to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the power transmission and dis
Republic af China: A Bank toan for the second power transmission
and distribution project will enable the Taiwan Power Company
fo meet system demand at the end of 1974.26

tribution program of the Taiwan Power Company
{TAIPOWER) to enable it to meet demand at the
end of 7974.

In keeping with a high rate of economic growth
in the Republic of China, there has been a rapid expansion of electricity demand which TAIPOWER has
found difficult to satisfy. Electricity sales have been
increasing at an average annual rate of over 14 per
cent. A Ten-Year Power Development Program
(1971-1980) has been evolved by TAIPOWER in
order to meet this demand. The transmission and
distribution section of this Program is divided into
annual projects. {n 1970, the Bank approved a loan
of $42,880,000 to TAIPOWER for power transmission
and distribution to meet system demand at the end of
1973. The present Project will provide the facilities
for meeting system demand at the end of 1974.

The Project entails mainly the construction and
extension of 345 kilovolt, 161 kilovoit and 69 kilovolt
transmission lines, construction and extension of the
distribution network and provision of communications
and construction equipment. Two double circuit
345 kilovolt transmission lines will connect the new
nuclear power station at Chinshan in northern Taiwan
with the big load center at Taipei and the 345 Kilovolt
north-te-south line presently under construction,

The tota! cost of the Project is estimated at $66.5
million, the local currency component of which will
be provided by TAIPOWER from its own resources.

INDONESIA: $4,600,000 (Specia! Funds) for the
Pontianak Power Project.

The loan witi meet the foretgn exchange cost
invoived in the rehabilitation and expansion of
electric power generation, transmission and distribution facilities in Pontianak.

Pontianak, the provincial capital and the economic
center of West Kalimantan province, is also the
principal port of West Kalimantan with shipping connections to Singapore. Due to the growth in the
export-oriented economy of the province, which is
based on rubber, coconut and forest products, there
is a serious power shortage in the capital.

The Project to be financed by the loan consists of
the construction of a new power station with three
diesel generating sets of four megawatts each, rehabifitation and expansion of the power distribution
system and procurement of construction and maintenance equipment.

The totat cost of the Project is estimated at
$6 million, the local currency component of which
will be met by the Government.

INDONESIA: $7,100,000 (Special Funds) for the
West Sumatra Power Project.

The joan will meet the foreign exchange cost of
power generation, transmission and distribution in
Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra,
and in the agriculturally important Bukittinggi area.

A feasibility study for this Project, including a
detailed review of the Batang Agam Hydropower
Project, was catried out under technical assistance
approved by the Bank in 1970. The Project entails
the completion of the Batang Agam hydropower
plant near Bukittinggi, including the purchase of turbine generator sets with a total capacity of about 6.7
megawatts and additional diesel generating sets for
Padang and Bukittinggi, the reconditioning of existing
diese! sets and the complete rehabilitation and expansion of the transmission and distribution systems.
Auxiliary and workshop equipment, spares and engineering and advisory services are also included.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at $9.9
million. The Bank loan will cover the foreign exchange component of $7 million and $100,000 of
the expenditure incurred in providing technical assistance. The Government will meet the local currency
requirement.

an integral part of the rural electrification program
of KECO. it entails construction of 1,246 kilometers
of transmission and sub-transmission fines, 7,350
kilometers of distribution networks and eight substations.

After completion in 1973, about 43 per cent—in
contrast to 27 per cent in 1970—of the rural areas
will then have electric power, raising living standards
and increasing productivity in those areas and contributing to the dispersal of economic activity, which
is an objective of the country’s Third Five-Year
Development Plan (1972-1976).

The total cost of the Project is estimated at $36.9
million and the local currency cost will be met by
KECO, the Rural Electrification Fund and Government sources.

LAOS: $3,370,000 (Special Funds) for the Vientiane
Power Distribution Project.

Davao, Cotabato, General Santos, Cagayan de Oro,
Butuan and Aurora. The 50 megawatt hydrogeneration unit will supplement the installed.150 megawatt
generating capacity at the Maria Cristina power
station.

When the Project is completed in 1975, power
will be available in areas where the supply is now
inadequate or non-existent, thereby widening the
industrial base of Mindanao and stimulating economic28

activity and employment. There will be an annual
foreign exchange saving to the economy of about
$7 million, principally through a reduction in petroleum imports.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at
$37.8 million, the loca! currency component of which
will be met by NPC.

INDUSTRY INCLUDING
DEVELOPMENT BANKS’

The Bank has supported the industrial sectors of its
developing member countries through direct lending
for industrial projects and through lending to industrial development banks for re-lending to smalland medium-scale industries. By the end of 1971
32 per cent of total loan approvals by the Bank had
been channeled to industrial projects.

Seven toans totalling $68 million were extended
directly to the industrial sector up to the end of 1970.
During 1971 a loan of $4,150,000 pius technical
assistance was extended to Ceylon to develop its
mineral sands industry, while Ceylon was also the
recipient of a technical assistance grant for the provision of technical and marketing advice regarding
an oleo chemical project. A technical assistance grant
was also approved to meet part of the cost of the
Asian Industrial Survey sponsored by the United
Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far
East (ECAFE) which will lead to concrete proposals
for the formulation of coordinated industrial programs
and projects in the region.

The Bank's loans to industrial development banks
play a vital role in promoting industria! development
in those developing member countries where smalland medium-scale enterprises are the foundation of
the industrialization program. The Bank lends foreign
exchange to.the development banks which, in turn,
make the funds available to smal!- and medium-size
enterprises in the form of sub-loans. This lending
acts ‘as a catalyst in mobilizing funds from other
sources for investment and is an effective tool in
generating additional employment opportunities in
the country concerned. The national development
banks also play a pioneering role in familiarizing the
business community with modern concepts of development financing. The Bank has also made
“project loans’ for specific large-scale projects
through industrial development banks.

At the end of 1970 the Bank had made nine loans
totatting $90 million to development banks for relending in five countries—-Republic of Korea,
Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
In 1971 four loans of the credit line type totalling
$42 million were made to development banks for
re-lending. The recipient countries were Republic
ot China, Republic of Korea, Malaysia and Territory
of Papua and New Guinea.

Sub-loans from the credit line loans to industrial
development banks totalled over 200 by the end of

1 Excluding agricultural development banks.

 

1971. These sub-loans have assisted a wide range
of smati- and medium-size industries in the fields
of textiles, engineering, chemicals, electrical machinery and appliances, ceramics, paper and printing,
etc.

CEYLON: $4,150,000 for the Mineral Sands Project.

The purpose of the joan is to finance the foreign
exchange cost of the establishment of an expanded
and integrated mineral sands processing complex for
intensifying the exploitation of mineral sands resources at Pulmoddai beach on the northeastern coast of Ceylon,

The Pulmoddai beach mineral sands deposit is one
of the richest in the world, containing about 80 per
cent ilmenite and rutile, the highest natural concentration of these minerals in any known deposit.
it is estimated that there are at least 3,260,000 tons
of heavy mineral sands above the low water mark.

‘The deposit is being worked by the Ceylon
Mineral Sands Corporation (CMSC) ‘which is a
state-owned corporation established by the Governmentin 1957, Industrial minerals from the Pulmoddai
mineral sands are extracted by CMSC’s two mineral
dressing plants, one at Pulmoddai and the other at
China Bay.

The Project provides for expansion of CMSC's
plant at Pulmoddai and transfer of the China Bayplant to Pulmoddai and the integration of the two
plants. As a result, the input capacity will increase
from the present 120,000-130,000 tons of raw
sands per year to 220,000-230,000 tons, thereby
producing an additional yearly output of about 60,000
tons of ilmenite, 11,000 tons of rutile and 9,000 tons
of zircon for export. When completed in 1975, the
Project will result in net foreign exchange earings
of about $1.4 million annually.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at
$6,570,000, of which the local currency component
will be met by the Government of Ceylon.

MIDF is the principal institution in Malaysia
promoting industrial development by providing
medium- and long-term financing. It was established
in 1960 on the initiative of the Government. MIDF's
current paid-up capital is 34.7 million Malaysian
dollars, of which 50.4 per cent is owned by Malaysian
sharehoiders and the balance by foreign financial
institutions.

MIDF works closely with the Government in its
development programs and has contributed significantly to the rapid expansion of the Malaysian
industrial sector. By 31 March 1971 MIDF had made
490 loan commitments totalling 209 million Malaysian dollars for a wide variety of industries. MIDF has
also made finance available to industry through
underwriting issuing-house services, by organizing consortia of banks and through the promotion of
joint ventures with foreign concerns. In the Second
Malaysia Plan period (1971-1975), MIDF is expected to make new loan commitments of 592
million Malaysian dollars.

TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS

The transport and communications sector has
received considerable. prominence in the Bank's
lending and technical assistance activities. Recognizing the importance of careful survey and
planning of priority transport needs, the Bank has

taken full note of national transport surveys which

assess the available infrastructure in the light of the
growth and changing structure of the particular
economy. in this connection, the Bank completed
during the year a major Regional Transport Survey
begun in 1969 at the request of seven of its developing member countries {see pages 43-44).

As of the end of 1970 the Bank had made 12 loans
totalling $92.2 million’ for transport projects in eight
countries. They included highway projects in the
Republics of China and Korea and in the Philippines;
port projects in Ceylon, Republic of China, Malaysia
and Singapore; and air transport projects in Nepal,
Singapore and Western Samoa. Technical assistance
was also given for the preparation of five transport
projects.

In 1971 six toans totalling $44.2 million were
extended in the transport and communications sector
and four technical assistance operations were approved. A loan to Ceylon of $3.6 million for a satellite
earth station was the Bank's first telecommunications
loan.. -Two loans and a technical assistance grant
were extended to the Philippines for a modern
fisheries port and the Philippines also received
technical assistance for a road project and a port
project, both in Mindanao. Highway loans were
extended to Malaysia and the Republic of China and
a loan was approved for port improvement in
Singapore. A technical assistance evaluation study
of a bridge across the Mekong River between Nong

additional traffic needs. The establishment of the
Proposed satellite station is a matter of urgency to
avoid serious deterioration in the quality of overseas
telecommunications services and to meet growing
traffic needs. The new services will provide links with
Europe and North America (through the United
Kingdom) and with Australasia and other parts of
Asia.

The Project includes the construction of an earth
station, near Colombo, an international telephone
exchange center and a microwave link between the
earth station, the proposed international telephone
exchange center and the existing telegraph and telex
exchanges. The station is expected to be operational

A loan of $18 million in 1970 for the construction
of the Sanchung-Chungli section of the TaipeiYangmei Freeway was followed in 1971 by a loan of
$13.6 million for the two terminus sections of the
Freeway. This loan will meet the foreign exchange
Cost of the construction of @ terminus section of 2.7
kilometers in.the north from Sanchung to Taipei, a
new bridge over the Tamsui River and a terminus
section of 11.6 kilometers in the south from Chungli
to Yangmei. As in the case of the earlier toan in 1970
for the Taipei-Yangmei Freeway, the project arose
out of technical assistance extended by the Bank
in 1968.

The Taipei-Yangmei Freeway is intended to meet
the traffic requirements of the Taipei-Yangmei
corridor which is the hub of economic activity in
Taiwan and where existing transport facilities have
become saturated. The development of new industrial complexes and increased urbanization, including the proposed development of a new township
at Linkou, about 15 kilometers from Taipei, and a new
international airport at Taoyuan, about 20 kilometers
from Taipei, will further increase the need for more
modern transport facilities to serve this area. Construction work on some parts of the SanchungChungli section has already commenced and it is
expected that the Taipei-Yangmei Freeway, including
the two terminus sections, will be completed in 1974.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at $45.2

million, the local currency component of which will
be provided by the Government.

MALAYSIA: $73,400,000 for the Kuala LumpurKarak Highway Project.

development of the mid-eastern part of West
Malaysia. The Project also provides for the preparation of detailed engineering designs for substantial
realignment and improvements to the rest of the
highway, the construction of which is Proposed to
be taken up by the Government in mid-1973.

The loan follows technica assistance provided by
the Bank in 1969 for a feasibility study to determine
the alternative alignments for the Kuala LumpurKarak Highway.

The total cost of the Project, which is scheduled
for completion in mid-1976, is estimated at $23.6
million. The Bank's loan will cover the foreign
exchange cost of $13,303,000 and an amount of
$97,000 converted from the previous technica!
assistance grant. The local currency requirements

This Project will be financed by Joans from both
the ordinary capital and Special Funds resources of
the Bank, plus a technical assistance grant. The
foans are to meet the foreign exchange cost of construction of a fisheries port and a fish market in
Navotas, immediately north of Manila.

The Project entails the dredging of 2.4 million
cubic meters for the approach channel and the
anchorage, the reclamation of 67 hectares of foreshore area and the construction of breakwaters, piers,
wharves, quay walls and a fish market building. The
new facilities to be provided will accelerate the
existing trend toward the increased use of larger-size
vessels, which will improve the efficiency of fishing
operations and result in additional economic benefits

The Project results from earlier Bank technical
assistance, approved in 1968, consisting of site
investigation, detailed engineering and preparation
of final design and contract documents.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at
$7,960,000. The foreign currency requirement of
$5,415,000 will be financed by the two loans from
the Bank. An amount of $85,000 spent for the

of an office and auxiliary buildings and acquisition of
cargo-handling equipment. The Project, designed
to enable smooth and efficient cargo handling
activities, conforms to the Master Pian Study for
overall development of the Port of Singapore.

After completion in late 1976, the Project will
alleviate shortages of warehousing and berthing
space resulting from the implementation of the urban
renewal plans and the projected growth of trade. By
permitting direct cargo handling of regional vessels
at the new wharves and by eliminating trucking of
entrepot cargo into the city, the Project wil! also
relieve traffic congestion in the port area and city.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at $24.7
million, the foreign exchange cost being covered by
the loan, with PSA meeting the local currency cost
from its own resources.Technical Assistance

PHILIPPINES: Feasibility Study for Improvement of Higan-Cagayan de Oro-Butuan Road

A request from the Government of the Philippines
for technical assistance in conducting a feasibility
study of the lligan-Cagayan de Oro-Butuan Road
in the island of Mindanao was approved, involving
a grant of up to $222,000. This road, about 310
kilometers in length, is a national primary highway
serving the coasial belt of northern Mindanao, which
has considerable potential for industrial and agricultural development. The fow quality of pavement
and sub-standard geometric characteristics of the
existing road, coupled with numerous temporary
bridges with severe load restrictions, have contributed
to the high cost of commodity transport in this area.
The feasibility study to be conducted under the Bank's
technical assistance will define the nature and extent

economic justification.

PHILIPPINES: Fisheries Port

In conjunction with the loans for the construction
of the Fisheries Port, Navotas, the Bank approved a
technical assistance grant to the Philippine Government of up to $71,000. This technical assistance will
cover a supervisory expert for the operation of the
Mariveles quarry to supply rocks for the port construction; a study and recommendations on the
management and organizational set-up of the fisheries
port and market; and training of focal staff for the fish
market operation. This assistance is considered
essential for the efficient implementation of the
fisheries port project and the smooth functioning of
the port and market after the completion of the Project.

PHILIPPINES: Cotabato Port Development

A request from the Government of the Philippines
for technical assistance, involving a grant of $245,000
for the preparation of a port development project in
the Cotabato area of Mindanao was approved. The
port of Cotabato is the gateway to the Cotabato
Province and surrounding areas and a considerable
increase in port traffic is anticipated as a result of the
development of the rich agricultural and forestry
resources of the hinterland. Development of the
present port, however, has been hampered by the
heavy siltation of the river. A new sea port in a siltfree location and where deep draft inter-island vessels
can berth directly at a wharf has tong been considered essential. The Bank's technical assistance
will cover investigations of alternative sites, a de
tailed technical survey of the selected site, preparation
of a preliminary engineering design and cost estimates
and ‘determination of the financial and economic
viability of the Project.

WATER SUPPLY

Improvement of water supply facilities is an urgent
need in many Asian cities and large urban areas and
the Bank is playing an important role in this field.

By the end of 1970 four loans for water supply
totalling $21 million had been approved. Two projects were in Malaysia——in Penang and Malacca—
and a third in Singapore. The fourth project was fora
feasibility study of the Andong Dam Multi- Purpose
Development Project in the Republic of Korea which
was financed by a loan and a technical assistance
grants

in 1971 two further loans followed. The first was
for $8.8 million to expand and improve the water
supply system of Seoul, while the second was to
finance the $22 million foreign exchange cost of the
project resulting from the Andong Dam feasibility
study. The latter project will provide municipal and

The Project consists of the construction of the 83meter high Andong Dam, two 45 megawatt hydropower units, an afterbay weir and a 66 kilometerlong 154 kilovolt transmission line to connect the
Andong Power Station with the existing transmission
system.

The total cost of the Project is estimated at $69.5
million. The Bank’s Joan will cover the foreign exchange cost of $21.5 million and the refinancing of a
$50,000 loan extended by the Bank in providing
technical assistance. The local currency requirements
will be provided by the Government. Completion
of the Project is scheduled for October 1978.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA: $8,800,000 for the Seoul
Water Supply Project.

The loan is to finance the foreign exchange cost of
expansion and improvement of the water supply and

distribution system of the Special City of Seoul,
Rapid urbanization has caused the City’s population
to grow from 2.4 million in 1960 to 5.5 million in 1970,
@ compound annual rate of 8.5 per cent. This growth
has put a heavy strain on the City’s urban facilities—
originally designed for a much lower population—
especially the water supply.

The Project to be financed under the loan forms
the first stage of the long-term Water Supply Development Program of the City. It entails the construction
of anew supply works of 600,000 metric tons capacity
containing intakes, treatment plant and high-lift
pumps and extension and improvement of the
distribution system throughout the City. The total
cost is estimated at $27.1 million, with the local
currency requirement being met by the Seoul City
Government.

EDUCATION AND OTHERS

Although facilities for training have been built
into many loans and technical assistance operations
of the Bank, the Bank's first loan for technical education as such was given in 1970 to Ngee Ann Technical
College in Singapore. No further loans for vocational
education reached fruition during the year, although
a number of possible projects were under study. In
other areas, technical assistance wes extended during
the year to Singapore to help improve its national
accounts and to Ceylon for a comprehensive employment strategy mission sponsored by the international Labour Organisation.

SINGAPORE: Improvement of Nationat
Accounts

The Bank approved a grant of up to $34,700 far
technical assistance for the improvement of the
national accounts of Singapore. An experienced
statistician will assist in the development of new
series of gross national product (GNP) at current and
constant prices for the period 1956 to 1970. Existing
gaps in the present GNP series will be identified and
new series will be developed to replace these gaps.
The Project will also provide on-the-job taining for
the technical staff of the Department of Statistics
of the Ministry of Finance, who will have @ continuing
responsibility for the estimation of the national
accounts of Singapore.During the year the Bank continued its positive
rote in promoting regional cooperation in various
aspects. The Bank's own Regional Transport Survey,
which was inaugurated in 1969 at the request of
certain regional member countries, was cornpleted
and the report was being prepared for publication.
Countries participating in the Survey have set up 4
Coordinating Committee to consider the action they

can take, both individually and colfectively, to follow .

up the findings in the report.

of the Center by seven participating countries.

The Bank initiated a Study of the Coconut Industry
in the region and contributed to the Asian Industrial
Survey sponsored by the Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East.

Regional Transport Survey

The Regional Transport Survey of Southeast Asian
countries which was inaugurated by the Bank in
October 1969 was completed in 1971: the Draft
Final Report on the Survey was completed in September 1971 and the Final Report in December 1971.
The Survey covers seven countries: Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, the Phifippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Republic of Viet-Nam.

The Bank engaged an American consulting firm,
which collaborated with five other firms in carrying
out the Survey. The total cost of the Survey was
$2,893,885, $999,001 of which was contributed by
the United States Government and $1,139,530 by the
United Nations Development Programme. The bajance of $755,354 was provided from the Bank’sown
resources including technical assistance contributions
of member countries.

The Bank established a Steering Committee of
internationally recognized experts in the transportation and economic development fields to assist in the
supervision of the Survey. The Committee participated in the formulation of the terms of reference of
the Survey and in reviewing its progress from time to
time. The progress of the Survey was also reviewed
periodically by the seven participating Governments
individually as well as collectively through a Coordinating Committee of Senior Transport Officials
of Southeast Asian countries.

The overall objective of the Survey was to provide
a basis for coordinated development of transportation
in the Southeast Asian region. Some of the important
tasks covered in the Survey were (a) to study the
existing transportation network in the region—its
limitations and deficiencies, (b) to project future
transportation requirements of the region based ona
study of its potential economic growth, (c) to
recommend measures for development of transportation. networks to meet the future transportation
requirements and also measures for greater intercountry cooperation in regional transport and {d) to
inguize how transport, along with other inputs, could
help in the utilization of the region’s resources and
its overall economic development. The Survey,
as far as possible, viewed the transportation network
in the seven countries as a complete system,
going beyond the national or domestic systems in the
individual countries of the region.

The Survey Report makes a valuable contribution
to the understanding of the transportation problems
of the region. [It presents a comprehensive assessment of the existing transportation system of the
region and its weaknesses and deficiencies, and
recommends measutes to enable the system to meet
the growing transportation demands of the region.
The assessment of future transportation requirements
in the Report is based on a systematic analysis of the
prospective growth of the region including in-depth
studies of the growth potentials of individual economic sectors, namely, agriculture, forestry, fisheries,
minerats and manufacturing.

The recommendations in the Report cover physical,
operational and policy aspects of transportation as
well as areas of broader significance for the general
economic development of the region. As was expected, most investment as well as policy recommendations pertain to national transportation systems in
the seven countries covered in the Survey. The
Report, however, does make a number of investment
recommendations of regional significance involving
inter-country cooperation.

4344

Important among the regional projects recommended by the Survey are thase in the fields of sea
and air transport. In the case of sea transport, the

Survey recommends: (a) the improvement of regional 
matine navigation aid systems, (b) the development
of a regionally integrated ship building industry,
(c) a regional tanker fleet for carrying palm oil,
coconut oil, molasses and latex, (d) a regional
shipping fleet of log and lumber carriers, {e) a
regional fleet of dry bulk carriets for maize, ores, sugar
and possibly rice cargoes in the future, and (f) the
region's entry into a major world-wide containership
consortium. The Survey also recommends design
characteristics for development of a model multipurpose ship for regional and domestic trade.

in the field of air transportation, the Survey examines in some depth, after duly taking into account
the practical limitations, the scope for inter-country
cooperation in the standardization of airline equipment and the resuitant gains in the pooling of spare
parts and training and maintenance facilities. The
Report examines the regional airline concept, recommends a jointly owned airline by the countries of
the region as “a desirable long-term objective” and
spelfs out the conditions under which such an
objective could be realized. Regional cooperation,
according to the Report, has tangible advantages to
offer in training and flight inspection services. The
Report recommends the establishment of a regional
air flight inspection service as a high priority project.

The Report lays special emphasis on certain important institutional and policy changes which must
accompany the recommended investment program.
In relation particularly to regional projects, the Report
has underlined the need for an effective organization
which can pursue implementation of such projects
and watch their efficient management. The Survey
tecommends that these functions be handled by the
Secretariat of the Coordinating Committee of Senior
Transport Officials of Southeast Asian countries
which should be- suitably strengthened.

The recommendations of the Survey present what
is described as “a massive agenda for the Governments of the region, for multilateral agencies, for aidgiving countries and for the private sector in all of the
countries, both within and outside the transport field.”
Follow-up action on the recommendations of the
Survey is presently receiving consideration at various
levels in the participating countries. Clearly, the
implementation of the recommendations involves
resources which are beyond the capacities of the
Governments and a substantial measure of foreign
assistance will be needed from bilateral and multi
lateral institutions, The Bank has already initiated
consideration, in consultation with the Governments
of the countries, of specific areas of development in
which it could possibly assist.

Nong Khai- Vientiane Bridge Evaluation Study,
Laos and Thailand

An evaluation study of the Nong Khai-Vientiane
Bridge project was undertaken on the basis of a
technical assistance grant of $95,000 for the Governments of Laos and Thailand. The proposed bridge
across the Mekong River was conceived primarily to
facifitate the flow of goods and passengers across the
river, the flow being presently constrained by the
limitations of the existing ferry service. To provide
a basis on which its viability could be assessed, the
Bank agreed to evaluate the proposal in depth, taking
into account the technical, economic, legal, operational and financial aspects.

Southeast Asia‘s Economy in the 1970's

The report of a study of Southeast Asia’s Economy in the 1970's” sponsored by the Bank was
published in November 1971. A Penguin paperback
edition consisting of the opening chapter of the Study
entitled “Overall Report” by Prof. Hla Myint will be
published in January 1972 under the title “Southeast
Asia’s Economy-Development Policies in the 4 970's."'
This edition will include an additional introductory
background chapter on Southeast Asia's economy
before 1970.

Coconut Industry Study

A Study of the Coconut Industry in the region was
approved in February 1971. The main objective of .
the study is to identify “bankable" projects in the
coconut industry, i.e, to identify loan or technical
assistance activities which would be generally acceptable for financing by national or international banks
and other organizations. Possible areas ot projects
for multi-national cooperation in the coconut industry by members of the Asian Coconut Community
and/or other countries covered in the Study will also
be explored.

The Study includes the following countries: Ceyfon, Fiji, india, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Pakistan,
the Philippines, Singapore, Territory of Papua and
New Guinea, Thailand, Republic of Viet-Nam and
Western Samoa,

Preliminary work on the Study has commenced
and two consultants have been selected. The StudyPhilippines: A typical coconut grove.

will begin in January 1972 and is expected to be
completed by the end of September 1972.

Asian Industrial Survey

The Bank has agreed to contribute upto $200,000
to the Asian Industrial Survey for Regional Cooperation sponsored by the Economic Commission for Asia
and the Far East (ECAFE). The Survey will consider
the long-term perspectives for industrialization and
tegional cooperation in 12 developing countries of
the ECAFE region. It will assess the potential for
industrialization of the countries taking into account
the size of markets, availability of raw materials,
production costs, economies of scale and other
factors. It will make concrete proposals for the
formulation of industrial programs and projects based
on a coordination of investment, production and
trade policies between the countries to be studied.
The Survey, begun in September 1971, is expected
to be completed in 18 months at an estimated cost of
$617,000. The Bank is represented in the Consultative Committee for the Survey, which met initiafiy
in Bangkok in October, .

The countries to be covered by the Survey are:
Burma, Ceylon, Republic of China, Indonesia, Khmer

Republic, Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Republic of
Viet-Nam.

LAWASIA Credit and Security Research
Project

The Law Association for Asia and the Western
Pacific (LAWASIA) Credit and Security Research
Project involves a study of credit and security arrangements available to national development banks and
similar financial institutions. The study has been
made by LAWASIA. The countries covered are
Australia, Ceylon, Republic of China, indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Singapore
and Thailand. The Project began in 1969 with a
contribution of $25,000 from the Ford Foundation
and with technical advice and administrative assistance from the Bank. In August 1970, the Bank
provided $27,000 to enable extension of the Project
for the purpose of producing not only one integrated
report but nine additional reports on the respective
individual countries covered by the study.

All basic research and writing was substantially
finished in 1971 and the preparation of the 10 reports
will be completed in 1972.

Development Banks Conference—-Fofiow-up

A study of the training facilities currently available
at the national, regional and international levels for
development banks in the Bank's developing member
countries together with recommendations for an
action program for the Bank was completed during
the year. The Report, which was submitted to development banks in the region, selected international
institutions and individual experts, will be discussed
early in 1972 by a panel of experts as a basis for
further action.

Asian Vegetable Research and Development
Center, Taipei

The Charter of the Center was signed in May by
the Bank and seven participating countries—Republic of China, Japan, Republic of Korea, the
Philippines, Thailand, United States and Republic of
Viet-Nam. The Bank’s contribution of $300,000 to
support the Center's establishment and operation for
the first two years became effective in September.
A Director has been appointed and the work of
establishing the Center is proceeding. The cost of
the Center over the first five years is estimated at
$7.5 million.

45In accordance with its Charter, the Bank intensified
its cooperative relations during the year with its sister
institutions, the World Bank and the other regional
development banks and with the United Nations and
its various organs and specialized agencies.

Formal arrangements for cooperation are confined
to the Interim Arrangement for Cooperation with the
Food and Agriculture Organization, the joint arrangements with the World Bank for the collection of
debt-servicing data and the newly-established artangements with the World Bank, the United Nations
Development Programme and the Mekong Committee, whereby the Bank will act as delegated
executing agent for selected Mekong pioneer projects. In addition, discussions took place during the
year on an informal basis with organizations such as
the International Labour Organisation and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as well as the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, with which the
Bank has had a continuing and valued relationship.
Where matters of mutual interest were under consideration, Bank representatives attended conferences
and meetings organized by other international
organizations, although it was not possible to accept
all the invitations received.

Food and Agriculture Organization

Exchanges of information and consultations continued with the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAQ) in the agricultural, fishery and forestry fields.
A consultation under the Interim Arrangement for
Cooperation between the Bank and the FAO was
held in Manila in January 1971 when a number of
projects and possible areas of activity suitable for
cooperation were discussed. FAO experts have also
been invited as consultants to participate in the
Bank's missions.

Worid Bank

This Bank maintained close relations with the
World Bank throughout 1971. As the Bank's
Operations in its developing member countries have
been expanding, such cooperation has become increasingly necessary and helpful. There have been
frequent consultations, visits and exchanges of
information regarding operational practices, status of
individual projects and country economic development. .

The Bank's observers attended the aid coordination
meetings sponsored by the World Bank for Republic
of Korea, Pakistan and the Philippines during the year.

Since 1968 the Bank has participated with the
World Bank in studies relating to the external public
debt position of regional developing member
countries of the Bank. A new manual and forms for
reporting external debt and grants have been distributed for use by the member countries since the
beginning of 1970.

As a follow-up to this cooperative arrangement
and in response to a proposal from the 1970 Conterence of Asian Statisticians, the two Banks jointly
sponsored a seminar on External Debt Reporting in
Manila from 22 to 28 November 1971. The seminar
sought to improve the quality of external debt data
through the establishment of meaningful standards
in collection, tabulation and publication of debt
tables and to indicate the possible uses of these data
for economic analysis. Sixteen developing member
countries of the Bank' were represented at the
Seminar, the proceedings of which have been
published.

The Bank’s association with the World Bank in the
Mekong Basin is described on page 48.

Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research

During the year the Bank became a member of a
new Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research. Members of the Group, which was
sponsored jointly by the World Bank, the Food and
Agriculture Organization and the United Nations
Development Programme, include governments, international institutions and private foundations. The
Group was established mainly for the purpose of
identifying the needs of developing countries for
special efforts in agricultural research at the international and regional levels and of promoting
international assistance to fulfilt these critical needs.
The Group is supported by a Technical Advisory
Committee consisting of 12 distinguished scientists
with wide experience in the agricultural problems of
developing countries. Members of the Consultative
Group have complete freedom to make their own
decisions regarding possible assistance to any research project or feasibility study recommended by
the Group and, when interested, to follow their own
procedures in having their policy-making bodies
consider and approve assistance to the project or
feasibility study.

International Labour Organisation

The Bank participated during the year in a Comprehensive Employment Strategy Mission to Ceylon,
sponsored by the international Labour Organisation
(ILO), by providing a cansultant to join the Mission
(see page 40). In December the Bank sent an
observer to ILO’s Seventh Asian Regional Conference
in Teheran at which a review of the Asian Manpower
Pian was a principal agenda item. A number of ILO
staff members visited Manita in 1971 and the visits
provided. opportunities to exchange views regarding
further cooperation between the two organizations.

Mekong Committee

The Bank continued to maintain and expand its
project activities in the Lower Mekong Basin, In
addition to sponsoring direct technical assistance
and capital investment projects in each riparian
country, the Bank maintained close working relations
with the Committee for the Coordination of Investigations of the Lower Mekong Basin (Mekong Committee).

The most important recent development relates to
formation of a Plan of Operation for pioneer agricultural projects. Under the auspices of the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP), a fund
of $2,040,000 was established to finance the necessary studies on 15 pioneer agricultural projects
throughout the Basin. The contributors to the fund
are. UNDP $1,000,000, United States $500,000,
United Kingdom $240,000, Japan $200,000 and the
Netherlands $100,000.

In August 1971 the UNDP convened an informal
inter-agency meeting in Bangkok, which was attended by representatives from the UNDP, the World
Bank, this Bank and four riparian countries. While
the Plan of Operation envisages the World Bank as
the executing agent, the meeting recognized the
importance of the Asian Development Bank's cooperation and association in the execution of
individual pioneer projects to be agreed between the
Bank and the World Bank. The meeting agreed on a
draft Memorandum of Understanding under which
the Bank will exercise the de facto role of executing
agent by delegation from the World Bank. The draft
Memorandum of Understanding between UNDP, the
World Bank, the Bank and the Mekong Committee,
was approved by the Board of Directors of the Bank
in readiness for signature early in 1972. Under the
applicable terms of the Plan of Operation and the
Memorandum of Understanding, the obligations of
the executing agent will be transferred to the Bank in
respect of the pioneer project preparation activities,

subject to the reservation that the formulation of
terms of reference governing the work to be done by
consultants, the prequalification of consultants by the
Bank and the final drafting of contracts with consultants will be the subject of consultation with the
World Bank. :

As a delegated executing agent under the Plan of
Operation, the Bank will henceforth also formally
participate in all inter-agency consultations relating
1o the development of the Lower Mekong Basin.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development

The efforts of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) in promoting intra-regional cooperation and international aid
flows and understanding, especially in exchange of
information on development and development
financing, continues to be of interest to the Bank.
{In this connection, the Bank was represented in
Bangkok during October at the Regional Meeting of
Directors of Training and Research Institutes in Asia
in the Field of Social and Economic Development.
The meeting was sponsored by OECD and the Asian
Institute of Economic Development and Planning.
The objectives of the meeting were: {i} to form an
association of development research and training
institutes in Asia and (ii) to consider the potential for
cooperative research projects.

Regiona! Development Banks

The presidents and staff members of the three
principal regional banks-—the African, the Asian and
the Inter-American—held a joint meeting—the
second of its type-—at the headquarters of the
Inter-American Development Bank in Washington,
D.C. in September.

Under the chairmanship of the {nter-American
Development Bank President, Mr. Ortiz Mena, the
banks discussed matters related to the coordination
of bond issues, the mobilization of external resources,
the impact of recent international economic events
on developing counties, cooperation with the World
Bank and other international organizations, the role
of the regional banks in the United Nations Second
Development Decade and experiences in the identification of loan and technical assistance projects.

United Nations Development Programme

The Bank’s collaboration with the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) has been intensified within the framework of informal working
arrangements for regular consultations and exchangeof information on specific projects. The UNDP sends
summaries of new requests for pre-investment
assistance irom Asian countries for the Bank's review
and comments. The Bank keeps the UNDP and its
resident representatives informed about its ioan and
technical assistance operations. A Bank representative participated in the global meeting of the UNDP
resident representatives in New Delhi in February at
which a scheme for country and inter-country programming was initiated. The Bank has been cooperating in country programming in the Philippines
and towards the end of the year it received a high
level mission from the UNDP to exchange views regarding the programming of inter-country projects in
the region, the implementation of which is expected to
start in 1973. With the re-structuring of the UNDP
early this year, the Regional Bureau for Asia and Far
East was established, thereby facilitating cooperation
between the Bank and the UNDP,

The Bank’s association with the UNDP in the
Mekong Basin is described on page 48.

United Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East

_The Bank has maintained close working relations
with the United Nations Economic Commission for
Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) on matters of mutual
interest. In addition to cooperating with the ECAFE
on the Asian tndustrial Survey as already mentioned,
the Bank participated in several ECAFE conferences
during the year, including the 1971 Annual Conference, the Committee on Trade, the Asian Planners
Conference and the Asian Industrial Development
Council.

The Bank also continued to provide lecturers for
the Asian Statistical Institute, and to maintain close
contact with the Asian Institute for Economic
Development and Planning, both being ECAFErelated institutions. A proposal was made during the
year by the Institute for the Bank to make a special
study of its functions and requirements. This matter
was under consideration at the end of the year.

United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization

Discussions took place between the Bank and the
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Culturat
Organization (UNESCO) on the possibilities for
cooperation in the field of education.

The Bank sent an observer to the Third Regional
Conference of Ministers of Education and Those
Responsible for Economic Planning in Asia which

Was organized by UNESCO and held in Singapore

in May/June.Increase of Capital Resources

At its Fourth Annual Meeting in April 1971 the
Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 43 on
the Resources of the Bank directing that:

“The Board of Directors promptly undertake a
study of the resources position of the Bank and in
particular of the need to enlarge them through
an increase in the authorized capital stock of the
Bank and report as early as possible its findings,
with such recommendations in respect of the
said capital stock as are deemed appropriate, to
the Board of Governors for the latter's consideration and action.”

The Board of Directors accordingly studied the
resources position of the Bank and recommended an
increase in the Bank’s authorized capital stock. The
following were the findings of the Board of Directors
as reported to the Board of Governors in October
1971:

(a) an increase in the Bank's ordinary capital
resources is necessary;

(b) the Bank's Special Funds resources should
be augmented and the Board of Directors will
undertake a detailed study of this subject;

(c) the increase in the Bank's capital stock should
be 150 per cent of the present authorized
capital and a portion of the increase corresponding to 150 per cent of the present subscribed capita! should be available for subscription by members in proportion to their
existing capital subscriptions;

(d) of the increase in the capital stock, 20 per
cent should be paid-in and 80 per cent
callable, The paid-in portion of subscriptions
to the increase should be paid in three equal
annua} instalments in 1973, 1974 and 1975.
Each instalment should consist of 40 per cent
payable in gold/convertible currency and 60
per cent in national cutrency, subject to the
provisions of Article 6, paragraph 3;

(e) in all respects other than those specified in (c)
and (d} above, the provisions of the Articles
of Agreement relating to the origina): capital
stock should apply equally to the new capital;

(f) demand promissory notes or similar obligations representing the national currency
portion of subscriptions of members to the
existing paid-in capital which are not subject
to restrictions under Article 24, paragraph 2,
should be encashed in three equal instalments
in the years 1972, 1973 and 1974; and

(g) a further study of the capital stock of the Bank
is envisaged to take place in adequate time
before the end of 1975,

|n coming to its findings on the need, magnitude
and composition of the required increase in the Bank's
capital stock, the Board of Directors took into account
the Bank's operations so far, the desirable scale of
expansion of operations in the period 1971-1975
and the availability of resources on the basis of
present subscriptions to the Bank's capital and contributions to its Special Funds resources. The Board
of Directors studied various policy and operational
issues such as (i) the rate of interest charged on
loans from ordinary capital resources, {ii) the commitment charge, (iii) the coverage of commitments
by resources, (iv) the scope for raising funds through
borrowings in the light of capital market conditions,
{(v) the return on investment of surplus funds, (vi) the
adequacy of the Bank's reserves and (vii) the annual
income position of the Bank. The Board of Directors
recognized that these matters would be subject to
review from time to time. in all its considerations,
the Board of Directors took into account the needs
of the regional developing member countries in
which the Bank is undertaking operations and the
equally important necessity of maintaining a sound
and creditworthy financial institution.

The Boarc of Governors considered the report and
tecommendations of the Board of Directors, and in
November 1971 approved Resolution No. 46 authorizing the increase in the capital stock of the Bank
as recommended by the Board of Directors. As
stated in the resolution, the increase in authorized
capital stock “shall become effective only if and when,
on or before 30 September 1972 or such other date
not later than 28 February 1973 as the Board of
Directors may determine, subscriptions shall have
been made in accordance with this Resolution to an
aggregate of at least 100,000 shares.”

Payment of subscriptions to paid-in shares shall
be made in three equal instalments, the first of which
shall be paid not later than 6 April 1973, the second
not tater than 6 April 1974, and the third not later
than 6 April 1975. Of each instalment, {a} 40 per
cent shall be paid in gold or convertible currency;
and (b) 60 per cent shall be paid in the currency of
the subscribing member.

Capital Subscription

At the end of 1871 total subscriptions to the
authorized capital stock of the Bank stood at
$1,005,380,000. The Territory of Papua and New
Guinea became ‘the thirty-sixth member of the Bank

5152

on 8 April 1971, subscribing $1,380,000 to the Bank's
capital. The paid-in portion of the subscription of the
Territory of Papua and New Guinea amounted to
$690,000, payable in five equal annual instalments,
the first of which was paid on 31 March 1971.
“France and Fiji paid their second instalment of
capital subscription on or before the due dates.
Similarly, Hong Kong and Switzerland paid their third
and fifth {final} instalments of capital subscription,
respectively, on or before the due dates. Total subscription in convertible currencies paid under Article
6.2(a) of the Articles of Agreement amounted to the
equivalent of $246,669,000. Total subscription under
Article 6.2(b) in members’ own currencies, or in the
form of promissory notes, amounted to the equivalent
of $246,669,000; of the amount of subscription paid
under Article 6.2(b), convertible currency funds
amounted to the equivalent of $169,069,000.

Member Currencies: Changes in Value

Effective 10 May 1971, the Austrian schilling was
revalued from a par value of 26.00 schillings per
United States dollar to 24,75 schillings per United
States dollar. Also effective 10 May 1971, the gold
content of the Swiss franc was changed from 0.20322
grams of fine gold to 0.21753 grams of fine gold,
resulting in a revaluation of the Swiss franc from
4.37282 francs per United States dollar to 4.08411
francs per United States dollar. As a result of these
changes, the Bank revalued its holdings of Austrian
schillings and Swiss francs and refunded to the
Governments of Austria and Switzerland 3,125,000
schillings and 577,440 francs, respectively, being the
amounts required to adjust the vatue of the Bank’s
holdings of these currencies, in terms of Article 25.2.

Effective 23 August 1971 there was a reduction in
the foreign exchange value of Indonesia's currency
which was fixed at 415 rupiahs per United States
dollar. Consequently, Indonesia paid an additional
amount of its currency to the Bank in accordance
with Article 25.1.

Borrowings

During the year the Bank raised the equivalent of
$121.7 million by means of public issues in Austria,
Belgium, Japan, Switzerland and the United States
and a private issue placed in 12 regional member
countries. Aggregate borrowings reached the equivalent of $160 million at the end of 1971.

The Bank floated its first bonds in the United
States capital market in April. The issue was divided
into two parts: $25 million of 72% Twenty-Five-Year
Bonds offered at 98% and $25 million of 63% FiveYear Notes offered at par. The Twenty-Five Year

Bonds are.subject to a sinking fund which will retire
50% of the issue before maturity. The Five-Year

Notes are not subject to a sinking fund and are not

otherwise redeemable prior to maturity. Both issues,
rated ‘AAA’ by one of the leading rating agencies,
were underwritten by a nationwide syndicate headed
by Kuhn, Loeb & Co. and The First Boston Corporation and are listed on*the New York Stock
Exchange.

The Bank made its first bond issue in the Swiss
capital market in April 1971 when it sold SwF40
million ($9.8 million) of 7% Fifteen-Year Bonds
priced at 99%. The issue was underwritten by the
Union Bank of Switzerland, the Swiss Bank Corporation, and the Swiss Credit Bank and is listed on the
Stock Exchanges of Zurich, Basie, Geneva, Lausanne
and Berne.

in April 1971 the Bank raised $20 million by the
sale of 54% Two-Year Doliar Bonds at par to central
banks and governmental agencies of regional members. This issue was designed to promote cooperation
among the regional members by generating funds
within the region for the Bank's operations. Countries
which participated in the issue were Australia,
Republic of China, India, Japan, Khmer Republic,
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, New Zealand',
Singapore, Thailand, and Republic of Viet-Nam.

The Bank floated its second bond issue in Japan
in October, This issue, which was larger than the
first, was for ¥10 billion ($27.8 million) of 7.4%
Seven-Year Bonds priced at 99,75%. The issue was
underwritten by a nationwide syndicate consisting
of 18 securities companies in Japan managed by The
Nomura Secutities Co., Lid, The Daiwa Securities
Co., Ltd., The Nikko Securities Co., Ltd., and Yamaichi
Securities Co., Ltd.

The Bank's initial bond issue in Belgium took |

place in November when it sold BF400 million
($8 million) of 72% Twelve-Year Bonds at par. The
Bonds are redeemable in six annual instalments of
BF40 million from 1977 through 1982 and the balance
of BF160 million in December 1983, The issue was
underwritten by Société Générate de Banque, Banque
Lambert, Banque de Bruxelles, Kredietbank and
Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas Belgique. Arrangements have been made for listing on both the Brussels
and Antwerp Stock Exchanges. .

tn December the Bank made its second issue of
bonds in Austria with the issue of AS150 million
($6.1 million) of 7% Twelve-Year Bonds priced at
982%. The bonds will be redeemed in 10 annual

1 New Zealand's contribution included an amount of $30,000
from Western Samoa under bilateral arrangements between the
two Governments.instalments of AS15 million commencing December
1974, The issue was underwritten by an Austrian
banking syndicate headed by Creditanstatt Bankverein and Osterreichische Landerbank A.G. and
sold not only to domestic investors but also to
investors outside the country.

Investments

At the end of the year the Bank’s investments of

convertible currency funds were held invested in 18
currencies and amounted to the equivalent of $363
million, of which 24 per cent was held in government
securities or government-guaranteed obligations of
member countries and 76 per cent in time deposits
or certificates of deposit of banks in member countries
and with the Bank for International Settlements.
Of the total investments in government securities or
government-guaranteed obligations of members 49
per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 51 per cent was invested in securities
maturing after one year. Of the total investments in
time deposits or certificates of deposit of banks in
member countries and with the Bank for International
Settlements 82 per cent was invested: in deposits
maturing within one year and 18 per cent was invested in deposits maturing after one year.

Loan Participations

Participations during the year in the early maturities of the Bank's project loans by commercial banks
and other institutions amounted to $1.6 million,
bringing the total sold since the Bank commenced
operations to $6.7 million. .

Long-term interest rates in major money markets
remained at high levels throughout most of the year,
which made it difficult for commercial banks and
other institutions to participate more actively in the
Bank's loans at the current lending rate of 7% per cent
per annum,

Income and Expenditure

The gross income for the year amounted to
$25,893,507. After deducting commissions appropriated to Special Reserve amounting to $375,268,
the unappropriated income for the year was
$25,518,239. The total administrative expenses for
the year, net of those financed from Technical
Assistance Special Fund in the amount of $137,839,
was $7,464,382.

During 1971 an Administration Charge to Special
Operations was instituted, as mentioned in Note F in
Appendix 1-VII} and Note 6 in Appendix 1-M to
Financial Statements. The Administration Charge is
computed by the use of a formula of charging Special

Loans signed at an “experience rate” based on the
actual administrative expenses of the Bank in the
preceding five years in relation to both the numbers
and amounts of loans made by the Bank in the same
preceding five years. The total amount of such
Administration Charge determined to be allocated to
Special Operations was $4,766,000.' This amount
was deducted from the iotal internal administrative
expenses of ordinary capital resources and charged to
Special Funds resources. The total net amount of
internal administrative expenses attributable to ordinary operations for 1971 after such deductions was
therefore $2,698,382.

In addition, during the year the total services to
member countries, exclusive of expenses charged to
the Technical Assistance Special Fund of $1,025,715,
amounted to $1,158,439, and the total financial
expenses were $7,084,925. The gross expenses for
the year were therefore $10,941,746, and the net
income for the year was $14,576,493. This net
income is available for allocation by the Board of
Governors in accordance with the provisions of
Article 40.1.

Monetary Developments

1971 was an eventful year from the viewpoint of
international monetary developments. Effective 10
May 1971 the Federal Repubiic of Germany and the
Netherlands, without eny change in their par values
established with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), ceased to assure that exchange transactions
would take place within the established margins of
one per cent on either side of their respective par
values so that the exchange values of the Deutsche
mark and the Netherlands guilder were allowed to
fluctuate. On 15 August 1971 the United States took
action, inter alia, for temporary suspension of full
convertibility of the United States dollar into gold for
foreign treasuries and central banks and the start of
international consultation and negotiations to achieve
needed and lasting reform in international monetary
arrangements.

Thereafter, many countries including several
members of the Bank, permitted their currencies to
float in the international exchange markets, with the

result that most of such currencies appreciated in ~

relation to the United States dollar.

A number of meetings, under the auspices of the
“Group of Ten,” were convened during the fallowing
months to consider the international monetary
situation. At the Ministerial Meeting of the “Group
of Ten" held in Washington D.C. on 17-18 December

1 Of this amount $2,476,000 was based on loans signed prior
to 1971

5354

4971 the participants agreed on an inter-related set of
measures pursuant to which it was announced that
agreement on a pattern of exchange rate relationships
among the currencies of the “Group of Ten” had been
reached. Canada indicated that it intended temporarily to maintain a floating exchange rate: the
remaining countries indicated their intention of establishing exchange rates in the form of par values
or central rates and that provision would be made for
2.25 pet cent margins of exchange rate fluctuation on
either side of such exchange tates; representatives of
the United States agreed to propose to the United
States Congress a suitable means for devaluing the
dollar in terms of goid to $38 per ounce.

The Executive Directors of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) adopted a decision on 18
December 1971 establishing a temporary regime
under which a member may permit the exchange rates
for its currency to move within margins of 21
per cent on either side of the par value. or the new
exchange value of its currency resulting from . the
agreed realignment of exchange rates. The new
exchange value for a currency resulting from realignment if notified to the Fund only for the purposes of
this temporary regime of wider margins and not

immediately proposed by the member as a new par
value will be referred to as a central rate. The decision
enabled members to observe the purposes of the
IMF to the maximum extent possible during the
temporary period preceding the resumption of effective par values with appropriate margins in accordance
with the articles.

The Bank continued to maintain its books on the
basis of prevailing par values, provisional and parity
tates for its member currencies both during the period
between 15 August and 18 December 1971 when
the world’s major currencies were floating and during
the period following the 18 December 1971 agreement and the subsequent realignment of foreign
exchange rates on the basis of central rates.

The Bank's financial statements for the year ending
31 December 1971, appearing in Appendix 1 hereto,
have been prepared on the above-mentioned basis,
as indicated in Note A to such Appendix 1-VUt.
Consequently, the United States dollar amounts in
the financial statements do not reflect, in respect of
certain currencies, variations from such rates in
foreign exchange markets which have occurred as a
result of the 18 December 1971 agreement.Additional Resources in 1971

During 1971 the resources of the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund were increased by the addition of
further funds set aside from the Bank's ordinary
capital resources and by contributions from the
Federal Republic of Germany and Japan. Belgium,
Italy and Norway also indicated at the Fousth Annual
Meeting an intention to make contributions to the.
Bank's Speciat Funds.

The Board of Governors took action at the Fourth
Annual Meeting, pursuant to Article 19.1 {i) of the
Bank's Articles of Agreement, to set aside and
allocate to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund 10 per
cent of the portion of the Bank's capital paid in under
Article 6.2 (a) since the date of the previous set-aside
action at the Second Annual Meeting. The amount
thus set-aside was $9,941,900, bringing the total
set-aside resources to $24,516,900. The Board of
Governors also resolved that the full amount of
set-aside resources should be transferred to the
Multi-Purpose Special Fund, so that income earned
on the investment of such resources pending their
disbursement under loans will accrue to Special
Funds. Pursuant to the Board of Governors’ Resolution, the amount of $24.5 million in the form of
cash and investments in securities and time deposits
or certificates of deposit formerly held as part of the
ordinary capital resources has been duly transferred
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund.

In October 1971 a contribution agreement was
signed with the Federal Republic of Germany for a
contribution to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund of 64
million Deutsche mark ($1 7,486,339) in four annual
instalments, the instalment for 1971 being 11.2
million Deutsche mark ($3,060,110). In December
Germany agreed to add a further 2.8 million Deutsche
mark ($765,027) to its contribution, increasing the
total amount payable in 1971 to 14 million Deutsche
mark ($3,825,137). In December Japan also contributed a further amount of 10,8 billion yen ($30
million) to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, thus
fulfilling the pledge made at the Bank's First Annual
Meeting to contribute 36 billion yen ($100 million)
over four years.

Both the German and the Japanese contributions
may be used to procure goods and services from the
contributors own country, from other countries
which contribute to the Multi-Purpose or Agricultural
Special Funds and from developing member countries
of the Bank.

The year 1971 also saw a welcome number of
additional contributions to the Technical Assistance

Special Fund. Four countries contributed for the
first time to the Fund and another five countries made
additional contributions or extended atrangements
for contributions made in previous years, -Four
regional countries were among the nine contributors.

The four countries contributing for the first time
were Austria, Ceylon, Republic of China and Republic
of Korea. The Austrian contribution of 1.3 million
schillings ($52,525) is availabte for two years from
July 1971 to finance the services of Austrian experts
and facilities. The Céylonese contribution of 100,000
rupees ($16,800) is available for financing the costs
incurred in Ceylon in employing Ceylonese experts,
The contributions of the Republics of China and
Korea, of $200,000 and $30,000, respectively, are
both free from procurement restiictions, although a
preference has been expressed for the use of the
funds in financing services of consultants from the
respective contributor country and from other developing member countries of the Bank. .

India made a second contribution of 300,000
rupees ($40,000) to the Technical Assistance Speciai
Fund for financing the costs of indian expert services.
The largest contribution during the year was that of
Japan, which contributed 720 miltion yen ($2 million)
for financing the services of Japanese experts. The
Netherlands made a further contribution of up to
100,000 guilders ($27,624) for use during 1971 in
employing Dutch consultants. The Federal Republic
of Germany and United Kingdom each agreed to
extend for a further year the arrangements previously
made for meeting requests of the Bank for financial
assistance in respect of the cost of employing German
and British experts.

Utilization

Loans from Special Funds resources are described
in the chapter headed Loan and Technical Assistance
Activities.

Lending under Special Operations was
$51,510,000 in 1971. Twelve loans were approved
for projects in eight countries, primarily in the fields
of agriculture and power,

Since the beginning of Special Operations in 1969
28 loans have been approved for projects in 12
countries for a total commitment of $107.2 million,
nearly half of which was committed in 1971. The
table on page 58 shows the distribution of iending
among the 12 countries which have received concessional loans and the sectoral breakdown of these
loans.

Purpose and Agricultural Special Funds to the end of
1971 is shown on page 59,

The rate of utilization of each contribution is
related to the extent to which the contributor has restricted the permissible uses of the contributed funds,
and the nature of the restrictions. In practice, however, the primary use which has been made of each
contribution, after the usual processes of competitive
bidding, has been for the financing of procurement
from the contributor’s own country, even where the
contribution is on less restricted terms. There is
necessarily an interval, of course, before commitments
for loans-—as stated above now $107.2 million—
result in disbursements.

The use made of the contributions to the Technical
Assistance Special Fund to the end of 1971 is shown
on page 60.

Future Needs of the Bank
The Technical Assistance Special Fund has proved
to be a valuable source of funds for financing expert

most contributions to the Technica! Assistance
Special Fund have been tied to use in the relevant
contributor country and the amounts of contributions
have varied considerably, a noteworthy feature has
been the wide geographic range of contributions
received. In 1971 the Bank had at its disposal
resources contributed by twelve developed member
countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, United
Kingdom and United States) and by four developing
member countries (Republic of China, india, Republic
of Korea and Pakistan), Ceylon’s contribution besame effective in December 1971, while Belgium and
Italy have both indicated an intention to become
contributors.

4 In 1971 some 47 per cent of the grants for technical assistance
were financed from the Technical Assistance Special Fund, the
remainder of the funds being obtained from the income from
ordinaty resources.MULTI-PURPOSE AND AGRICULTURAL SPECIAL FUNDS

The most pressing need of the Bank, however, is
for sufficient Special Funds resources for its soft
lending operations. The Multi-Purpose Special Fund
must clearly play the central role, as the primary
channel by which these resources are made available
to the Bank's borrowers. The generosity of those
countries which have contributed to the Special
Funds of the Bank is very much appreciated. However, Specia! Operations cannot continue to grow at
the present rate unless substantial additional resources can be assured. Since lending from Special
Funds resources began in 1969, commitments, as
shown in the table on page 60, have grown at an
annual rate of over 100 per cent. But the in-flow of
contributed resources available for lending (excluding contributions to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund) has not kept pace with Joan commitments;
contributions to the Multi-Purpose and Agricultural
Special Funds grew from $68.1 million at the end of
1969 to $171.6 million at the end of 1971, an annual
increase of about 55 per cent. As stated in the report

of the Board of Directors to the Board of Governors
on the Capital Resources of the Bank, it is proposed
to undertake in the near future a study of the problem
of securing the resources needed to maintain and
strengthen this important branch of the Bank's
Operations.

Not only the amount, but also the terms of use of
contributed resources need to be appropriate for the
Bank's tequirements. With the growth of the Bank’s
Special Operations in 1971, it has become increasingly
difficult to administer funds contributed on different
terms and with different degrees of restrictions upon
use in a manner which is compatible with the reasonable requirements of the Bank's borrowers. Consuitations have been initiated with contributors in an
attempt to standardize the terms of contributions and
introduce greater flexibility in such terms. The
progress so far made in these consultations gives
grounds for thinking that a mode! form of agreement
could gain wide acceptance among Special Funds
contributors.

Board of Governors

During the year there were several changes in the
Board of Governors. The first meeting of the Procedures Committee for 1971-1972 held in Singapore

At the invitation of the Government of Singapore,
the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors
was held in Singapore from 15 to 17 April 1971. At
the meeting the Board of Governors resolved that the
Board of Directors promptly undertake a study of the
tesources position and of the need to enlarge the
resources through an increase in the authorized
capital stock of the Bank. (Subsequently in November 1971 the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 48 by which the authorized capital of the
Bank was raised from $1,100 million to $2,750
million.) The Board of Governors also resolved to
re-elect Mt. Takeshi Watanabe as President.

A list of the resolutions adopted during the year
appears in Appendix 3.

to 552 at the close of the year, comprising 194
professional staff and 367 non-professional staff and
representing among them 34 nationalities:

Owing to the upward trend in consumer price
levels in Manila, a general salary increase was given
to non-professional staff with effect from 1 August.

retain suitably qualified staff from a competitive
international market, a general salary increase was
given to professional staff with effect from 1
December.

Some improvements in staff benefits were’ implemented with effect from 1 December. The rates
of dependency aliowance both for professional and
non-professional staff were increased for reasons
similar to those which ted to the general salary
increases granted during the yaar. Staff members

whose duty station is outside their home countries
were previously entitled to the benefit of home leave
travel after every two years of service. These staff
members are now entitled to this benefit after their
first two years of service and every 18 months
thereafter.

The Office of the Financial Advisor was retocated
in April at Glarnischstrasse 30, Zurich 8002, Switzerland. Appropriate arrangements relating to this
office and its personnel were effected by an exchange
of letters between the Bank and the Federal Government of Switzerland.

Headquarters
The Philippine Coordinating Committee continued

to act as a liaison body between the Bank and - ~

agencies of the Philippine Government. The assistance of the Committee in providing additional
office accommodation as requested for the Bank’s
temporary offices was particularly appreciated. Thus,
in 1971 the Committee provided the Bank with
additional office space in the Prudential Bank
Building and expanded office accommodation in the
Rufino Building. The Bank is now located in five
buildings, namely, the Metropolitan, Amalgamated,
Rufino, Oledan, and Prudential buildings, which are
all situated on Ayala Avenue, Makati, Rizal.

Construction of the Bank's permanent headquarters building, which the Philippine Government
is providing, is well advanced and plans are being
made to occupy the building about the middle of
1972.

The budget for 1972 was approved by the Board
of Directors on 2 December and a surmmary thereof
appears in Appendix 2. internal Administrative
Expenses are estimated at $10,141,800" and Services

NOTE 1:

tn 1967 the Board of Directors, pending the adoption of rules and
regulations governing the administration and use of Special Funds,

sources available under Article 19, paragraph 1 (ii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank to provide technical advice and assistance
serving the purposes and coming within the functions of ihe Bank,

On 17 September 1968, the Board of Directors adopted the Special
Funds Rules and Regulations for the adminiswation of the Bank's
Special Funds Resources, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 4.
These Rules and Regulations provide for an Agricultural Special
Fund, a Technical Assistance Special Fund, a Multi-Purpose Special
Fund and such other Special Fund or Funds as the Bank might
establish or accept. Contributions made by contributors before the
adoption of the Special Funds Rules and Regulations and theroafter
have been accepted in terms of Article 19, paragraph 1 (ii) and have
been allocated to the relevant Special Fund in accordance with the
Special Funds Rules and Regulations,

NOTE 2:

Amounts in currencies other than United States Dollars have been
translated into United States Dollars at the following rates:

with the International Monetary Fund, at such pat values,
except as noted in paragraph (b) below,

{b) In the cases of the second Canadian contribution equivalent
to U$$100,000 and the first Netherlands contribution of
400,000 Guilders, both to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund, at market rates used by these countries in making such
contributions.

No representation is made that any of these currencies is convertible
into any other currency at ihe rate or rates specified above.

An agreement among international monetary officials on 18 December 7971 resulted in dovisions and proposals for realignment and
restructuring of the exchange values of major currencies.

The Executive Directors of the International Monetary Fund adopted
a decision on 18 December 1971 establishing a temparary regime
under which a member may permit the exchange rates for its currency
to move within margins of 2 1/4 per cen! on either side of the par
value or the new exchange value of its currency resulting from the
agreed realignment of exchange rates. The new exchange value
for a currency resulting from realignment if notified to the Fund only
for the purposes of this temporary regime of wider margins and not
immediately proposed by the member as a new par value will be
referred to as a central rate,

If and when new par values are established with the International
Monetary Fund, the financial statements — Special Funds Resources
—-of the Bank expressed in United States Dollars could be affected
by the follawing: (a) restatement of the capital of the Bank set aside
pursuant to the provisions of Article 49, patagraph t{i) [see Note
5(g)] to reflect any change in the weight and fineness of the United
States Dollar from that in effect on 31 January 1966 (which is the
basis specified in Article 4, paragraph 1), (b) translation of certain
_ other amounts in the financial statements at rates based on the new
par values or other appropriate rates and (c} recognition of minor

translation gains arising from aceumulated net income.

Afghanistan,.Jjndia; Republic. “of Korea and Pakistan
have made it known in various policy statements and
national development plans that they will put more
emphasis ‘on industrial ‘development. Judging from

‘growth,. this-may well-be true of Hong Kong and
»_ Singapore,-even-though they. have notso far articutated official development pians.
In the second category which. includes Republic
~ --of:Ckina, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand, Ceylon, ahd
Sto a lesser extent, Malaysia, stress has been put on
both, industrial’ and-agricuitural development. This
approach is*¢learly ‘stated..in the * various’ national
-e@conomic plans in the first four countries: ' Ceylon
seems to. have generally followed this approach in

belongs ‘to this category:

of sectors other. than industry:: Among the countries
adopting this approach, indonesia has clearly indicated in its current development:plan (1969/70 —

Evolution of Bank Lending

The Bank's mandate has been fa provide principally for
the financing of specific projects, including those which form
parl ol a rational, sub regiona! or regional program, A
measure of the Bank's success over its first 25 years has
been its readiness to respand creatively and positively to the
changing needs of ils DMCs. The composition of rrembersaip has changed and the new borrowing members pave
placed new and different demands on it. Also, the origina!
DMCs have experiewed major changes in thelr development needs as their economies have changed over time. The
Bank's principal response has deen to expand its range of
services by widening the sccne of lending activities and
modaiities vo teflect the changing needs and imperacives of
its DMCs,

In the early y as the Bank sought io establish itself
as a sound and repulabdle institution, if gave priority to public
sector, government-quaranteed investment projec:s wrich
were designed to have maximum imnact on economic
groath. Lending was predominantly project-oriented and
was provided for the creation of new preduclive capacily
and infrastructure and for the rehabilitation and
mcdernization of ex es. There was a strong
demand for projact dinancing from DMCs te suppiernen®
assistance fram lhe World Bank aod biateral sources.

The demand for Bask assistance rose sharpy in the
1970s as DMCs struggled te cope with the effects of two
iarge increases jn oil prices.’ Oil-deficient countries
experienced severe pressures on their dalance of payiminnts
as the cost of oi. imports rose at the same fire es the prices

meetithe special needs of the Bark’'s small DMCs,
Maldives and the PIDMCs, the Bank introduced
iproject, loans covering a number of small projects in
mrnore sectors. The first multiproject loan was made
nya in 1979, Ungerstandably, since nuultiproject loans
ade-lo the Bank's smallest DMCs, their share of total
nding has been modest. Nevertheless, lhey have
a valuable and cost-effective means of funding
otherwise too small for Bank involvements. By the
1991, the Bank dad made a total of 18 such loans
9-$383 rnillion to 11 countries.
Special implemeniatior. loans have been made available
nembers at times when the execution of ongo'ng Bankanced projects was being affecied adversely by 2 shortage
jacal currency resources.
While project lending was achieving its development
tives, the Bank realized that this form of assistance did
address fully the wider ancl deeper prablems facing some
f-the‘DMCs. Te tackle these, the Bank inilialed a number
new-lending modalities. Nevertheless, governmentwanteed project loans remained the principal tocus of the
k’s lending operations and, in 1991, still accounted for
hout-66 per cent of the value of total loan approvals,
»° Fn addition co loans for individual projects, the Bank
‘Gduced more flexible modalities for financing smaller
rajécts. The Kank extended credit lines wo development

‘Banik was able te assist burrowers whe would otherwise be
out of yeach. The Bank made its first loan to a DF, in
halland, as early as 1968 anc has since been associated
wth a growing network of OFIs in its DMCs. The bulk of the
’ Bank's assistance to industry and to the non-fuel minerals
” sector has beer: provided through lines of credit to DFis. In
the first ten years, this type of lending amounted te

gracn lending was initially restricted to 7.5 per cent of to%a!
Bank fending, wizh a limit of 20 per cent of amnusl iending
te any individual DMC. The ‘imait was revised in 1987 to
15 ver cent of tota: lending on a three-year average. Although all productive sectors were eligible, in practice slraust
all program ioans before 1987 were used ta finance agricul
tural inputs such as fertilizers anc pesticides.

in 1987, the Bank revised substantially its program
lending policies. The focus was shifted [rar financing inputs
10 supporting medium-erm sector paiicies and adjustment
pragrams, As such, program loang are now the culrination
of sustained policy dialegue with the DMC concerned. The
understanding reached between the DMC and the Bank ts
reflected ina Development Policy Leiter. In addition to being
quick-cisvursing, another salient feature of tae program loan.
facility is the tranching of loans in step with the progress in
palicy adjustments. By the end of 1991, the Bank hac
approved 39 program loans lotailing nearly $3 billion to 12
DMCs. The major recipients were Indonesia ($600 million),
Pakistan ($564 million), Bangladesh ($530 million) and
Philippines ($430 million}.

In 1980, the Bank intreduced sector lending under
pa single loan is used to firvatice a cluster of subprojects
within a specific sector or subsector. The subprojects cai
relate to a defined geographic area or to a time slice of an
investment program, The Bank has found sector loans to be
a cost-effective means of resource iransfer. Further, she
relatively iarge size of the loan and its tight sector focus has
enabied the Bank ia engage in ;olicy dialogue with DMCs
and te assist in Instiutional strengthening of the agencies
implementing the projects. By 1991, sector loans aznounted
(6 $4.2 dillon, or 11 per cent of total Rank lending.

[n response to the policy of several DMCs to encourage
the cevelopment of the private secter, the Bank began in
1983 io make loans and direct equity investments to the
private sector. This was a marked departura from the
previous policy af providing oniy government-guarantesd
loans. The Bank’s involvement in assisting the private sector
so far has beer relatively rnodest in cerms of the amounis
‘nvolved. By the’end of 1991, the Bank had provided direct
assistance to 79 enterprises ameunting to $655 million. A
‘arge part of the assistance has been directed towards 53
finanteial intermediaries in 70 countries,

The Bank as a Catalyst

The Bank's financial resources are very iuted corm

Bank's iviporlance lies not oaly in its capacity to provide
funds but also it: its ability <o modilize funcs from other
sources.

For this reason. co-financing has always been an importani part of the Bank’s activity aru! has assurned greater
significance in recent years. Co-financiny grew from
$85 million. in 1970 to 61.46 billion in 1991. Co-financing
was involved in one third of all laans approved in 1991. In
the early years, the impetus for co-financing stemned largely
frorn the need 16 fill gaps in the financing plans of Banix_ supporled projects at a relatively laie stage in the proyece

“towards the Droader goa. af assisting DMCs in their overall
~. resource mobilization eforts. The Bank expects lo broaden
* this ebjective by using its resources te facilitate, and perhaps
increase, the total resource transfer io DMCs.
‘ The Kank has been active in assisting iis DMCs in
mobilizing capital resources. The Bani has played a sig" niffeanl tole in encouraging investment in the region by
“helping DMCs restructure their economies, particularly their
financial sectors. By increasing emphasis ari pramoting
* sapital markets, strengthening stock markets and working
“with: straiegle private sector enterprises. the Bank has also
improved the business climate and raised investor confidence in several DMCs.

Crops Research Instilule for the Sem!-Arid Tropics, ihe
Asian Vegetable Research and Devejopment Center and
other insiiiutions, the Bank has been an imporiand factor in
this process.

However, continuing high popitation growch rates in
many DMCs, along with a trend towards converting agricul
sural land for pausing and industry, pose serious challenges
for the sector. The regiati's foo security balance is still
fragile. ‘he Asian and Pacific region comntinues to be a net
food and grain importer. There is still hunger and
maltautrition in many countries. The challenge teday is how
to produce adequate yuantities of food while promoting
equity and environmental sustainability,

In the early years, Bank lenaing to agriculawe averaged
only 14 ner cent of tetai iending. By the mid-1970s, the
share of agriculture had risen to 30 per cent and has
rernained around that level since then. Bank assistance :o

Adopting that approach, the Bank has adevessed

Overview of Developing
Member Counitries

The Bank's DMCs experienced a wider variation in
growth performance in 1991 zelative io the preceding year,
The range was trom. very high growth rates in PRC, Republic
of Korea and Malaysia to no grawth wr contraction in
Mongolia atid Philippines. [n spite of the siowdown in world
ecenomic activity and relatively tight domestic ecenornic
policies, the developing Asian region as a whole posied an
aggregate GDP growth of 5.8 per cent. However, the rate
was below thet achieved in 1990. Average growth acceleraled in the NIEs, PRC and Pacific island DMCs, whie
il slowed dean in. Southeast and South Asia,

Several things explain the divergence in the economic
performance of the Asian econornies,

First, growth acceleration in the NIEs (except in
Republic of Korea and Singapore} and PRC was attributable
to buoyant exports following supply-side adjust:nents and
market diversification. including new markets in Europe and
within Asia,

Second, respectable, if slower, growth was achieved in
Southeast Asia owing to the s:renath: of domestic demand,
particularly invesument in manufacturing, construction arid
infrastructure, which had become a major econaric driving
force in a rumber of DMCs, including the NIEs, int the past
lew years

Third, generaliy slow growth was experienced in South:
Asia on account of structural adiustments, weak Escai
positions and shortage of foreign exchange.

Finally, a sharp covilraction ir. outuut was recorded ‘or

increase in interest rates. [co dampen a sharz rise in properiy
orices, tne Government made land available for pyoic
housing and private residential construction. In Singapore,
slow money supply growth and 2 strong currency helped
contai: inflation at a ‘ew level. Or the other hanel,
Taipei,China relaxed ils cnorelary palicy as itflationary
pressures eased. Kediscount rates were lowered four times
and the reserve recuirement ratio was reduced three times
during the year.

Exchange rate policies of tne NIEs differed significanny.
The Republic of Korea. which experienced a big wade
deficit, desreciated its currency against the US cellar and
other maicr currencies during tre year. Hong Keng mainjainec the Exed exchange rale between Hong Kong ant US
doliays despite a :er.porary strengthening of its currency.
Singapore jet ifs dcliay appreciate subscartialsy agains! the
US currency, believing thal a slrong exchange rale policy
wou.d neutralize foreign infladonary pressures anc prevent
sharp increases in wages anc other domestic costs, thereby
raaintain'ng Singapore's export competitiveness. In 1990,
the New Taiwan dollar nad depreciated against the US dollar
after a few years of appreciation. This depreciation continued in 1991.

Both: Repubiie of Korea and Taipe!, China continued to
signizicantly reduce their tarilf and non-tarif] barriers to
imports. As a result, {he Republic of Korea's import
liberaiizacion ratio increased sharply from 69 er cent in
1980 to 97 per cent in 1991. Taipei,Cnina lowered the
averaye tariff rate to 4.9 per cent from 7,8 nex cent in 1986.
The ‘iberalization of inports helped lesser: iifllationary pressures ang encouraged competition in tne domesiic rearket.

As part of ‘ts effort to liberalize and internationalize the
financial sector, Taipe!,China granted 15 new private comynercial bank licenses and opened the stock market partially
lo direct investments by foreign irstiuutions. In the Repuolic
of Korea, a slep-by-slep approach in opening the stock
market began in January. Singayere, with its emphasis on
nancial soundness through a higher capital adequacy ratic
and new requiarory measures, allowed foreign seeusi
vanies to operate iullycwned suosiciaries and ts become
stock exchange members under a special status. On the
I long Kong financial scene, an interesting phenomenon was
the emergence of tanks ownec py residents of Taipei ,China.
Three stich darks set up representaive offices during the
year and appied for banking licenses.

Labor shorlage posed a serious prabler: for all lhe NIEs.
To overcome the prodiern, the Republic af Korea is tanning
to institute measures 7o utilize all sectars of live population,

Pacific Island DMCs?
A Mixed Bag

Vollowing the disappointing economic performance ini
1990, the Pacific island DMCs (PIDMCsi had varied
experiences in 1991. The ccanomy of Papua New Guinea
recovered significantly to record an estimated GDP growth
of about 9.3 per cenl, a slong sebound from negative
grawr in the lwo previous years. There was a 24 ner cer
expansion in incustrial output, as the productian of
increased sudstantially frenem the nev
ima and Porgewa mines. However, a surge in dumestic
investmens, mostly related vo tinea! Cevelop:ent and the
Katubu vil prowect, resulted in some overheating of the
economy. In Tanga, GDP grawth inzproved to 3.9 ser cent
from 2,8 per cent i che previous year. primarily hecause of
righer agricultural production due le favorzble weather end

Following twe consecutive years of strong growth, Fiji's
economic grawth slowed down significantly tc 0.4 per cent.
against 5.4 per cent in 1990. Wate industry performed
modestly, the services sectur declined by 0.9 per cent comaared with an increase of &.3 per cent in 1990. This selvack
was caused mainy by tne adverse performence at

Economie growth mn So.smier Islands narrowed to
3.7 per cent in 1991 from 4.2 per sect 1990 as a result
af a slowdown in the industrial and services sectors. In
Western Samoa, economic growth was -1 per cent,
reflecting an extensive cyclone camage. Other PIDMCs
experivnced an econemic siowaown largely retlecting she
generally poor performance of the primary sector because
ol unfavoracle weather.

Outlook for 1992

The world economy is expected to improve in 1992
Global econoinic activity is proincted to grow by near iy
2 per cent as most groups of countries will experience an
economic rebound. The Anglo-Saxon economies are expecied to ‘ead the recovery with positive growin rates of
\.6 per cent for US, 2.8 ner cent for Canada and
1.i per cent for UK.

A sisweewn is expected in Germany and Janan. Faars
about inflation are haun:ing Germany, although rebuilding
the Last is creating a busiaess boorn not just for che county
but also for iis trading partners. Tight insneiary oclicy will
most likely de usec to fignt tuilaien and the temptation te
raise interest rates will se stronger, much to the dismay of
the JS, wick has been urging Gennany to lower them.

Bank's Role in Resource Transfers

 

Dasyite the slowdown in world ecanomic activity, th
econainies of the DMCs comirzec to grow steadily in 1991.
With an adecuate supply of exterral sesources, a number of
DMCs were able to increase public ancl privace invest:nants
to susie’n their GDP growth. In the past two years. multi‘ateral fiows, including funds from the Bank, have become
an important source of external furids for the DMCs as there:
have deen new derands or. world savings arising from the
reconstruction of tne Middle East after the Gulf wer, ‘ne
uw fion of Germany, the economic irazstonmaiicn oF
Fastern Europe and reforms in the former Soviet Union.

Tire net transler of resources (gross lan disgursements
minus princial repayments and prepayments, payments of
interest end otter charges plus net equiry invesunenss) from
the Bank to DMCs increased ‘vy 11 per cent irom $],471
million ir, 1990 to $1,634 milion in 1991, the highest since
Bank wperations began i, 1067. The relative share of the
Bank's rescu:cee transfer in the total nel vansters of
resources ts DMCs trom all sources stund af 13.2 per cent

Since the initial mobilization of ADF resources,

The major fectors contributing to ine higher OCR

Positive net transfer of ADF was due ta highier cishursements

‘respectively, Among the facturs contribudag to increased

Bank io improve project implemencation; a greater

ipei,China and Thailand registered negative net transfers
Singapore and Taipei.China were in the net repayments
phase. Myanmar naz been a nor-active borrower since
1987. The net negative resource flew to Fiji was accounted
foe oy the absence of new loans in 1990-1991, to Malaysia
by increasing emortization payments, and to Solamon
Islands oy fiuctuating disburserneni and amortization
profiles. fn the case of ThaiJand, prepaymerit was a major
contributing factor,

Although the Philippines showed a pasitive net transfer
of Bani resources overall, it reyisiered « negative net
Sarsfer of OCK mainly due to slow project implementation
and iean disbursements. The flows of ADF resources were

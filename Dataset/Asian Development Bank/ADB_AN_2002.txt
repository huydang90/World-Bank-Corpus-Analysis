NDevelopment is not an end. It is a multidimensional
and multilayered process, sustained by partnerships
and projects that complement and build on each
other. In pursuing its vision of a region free of
poverty, the Asian Development Bank is both an
element in the process and the catalyst that brings
the elements together. This synergy is depicted on
the cover of this Annual Report. The infrastructure
development photographs are defined and bound
together by the outline of a tulip, the national
flower of Turkey—where the flower was first
discovered and which was to have been the venue
of the 36'" Annual Meeting of the Board of
Governors in 2003. Much like development, the
lines of the tulip fan out, branch off, and come
together again to create a new pattern. And the
process continues.

he Asian Development Bank (ADB) was established in 1966 through a multilateral agreement ratified by

31 countries.! It has 61 members, of which 44 are in Asia and the Pacific. ADB has its headquarters in

the Philippines, and has offices worldwide, including resident missions in Afghanistan,? Azerbaijan,

Bangladesh, Cambodia, People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao

People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea,? Sri Lanka, Tajikistan,?

Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. ADB also maintains a country office in the Philippines; a regional mission for
the South Pacific in Vanuatu; a special office in the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste; and an extended
mission in Gujarat, India. It has representative offices for Europe (in Frankfurt), for Japan (in Tokyo), and
for North America (in Washington, DC).

  
 
   
  
 
 
 
  
 

Dur vision
ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member countries (DMCs) reduce poverty and improve their living conditions and quality
of life. ADB pursues a strategic agenda—sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and governance for effective policies and institutions—with three
crosscutting themes: private sector development, regional cooperation and integration
for development, and environmental sustainability.

ADB’s main instruments in providing help to its DMCs are policy dialogues,
loans, technical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity investments.

ADB offers a range of modalities and terms for loans, aimed at improving
development performance. About 70% of ADB's cumulative lending comes from its
ordinary capital resources. These come from three distinct sources: private placements and capital markets in the form of borrowings; paid-in capital provided by
shareholders; and accumulated retained income (reserves), which provide a buffer for
risks arising from operations.

ADB also provides loans from its Special Funds resources. The Asian Development
ln Fund (ADF) is a special window for loans on concessional terms to members with

> low per capita gross national product and weak debt-repayment capacity. The ADF
F] is financed by periodic voluntary contributions from donors. Other Special Funds are
be the Technical Assistance Special Fund, Japan Special Fund, and ADB Institute

Special Fund.
In addition, ADB manages and administers other funds: Japan Scholarship Program,
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, Japan Fund for Information and Communication
: Technology, and channel financing of grants provided by bilateral donors to support
—S = technical assistance and soft components of loans. In recent years, thematic trust funds—
“ t vr focusing on governance, poverty reduction, water, energy, and environment—were established

 
    
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
  

to support technical assistance operations and selected components of loan projects.
Technical assistance activities funded through grants or loans help maximize ADB's
development impact. Most technical assistance grants are used for preparing projects and
supporting advisory activities in areas such as law and policy reform, fiscal strengthening, good
governance, capacity building, and natural resource management.

ADB has a triple-A rating and typically raises about $4 billion-$5 billion a year from bond
issues. It actively mobilizes financial resources through its cofinancing operations, tapping
official, commercial, and export credit sources.

ADB's assistance to governments creates an enabling environment for private sector
development. ADB participates directly in financing private sector projects to assist commercial
investors and lenders.

Our policy-making structure

ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors, which meets annually and
comprises one representative from each member. The Governors elect the 12 members of the
Board of Directors, with each Director appointing an Alternate. The President is elected by the
Board of Governors for a 5-year term and is Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The President,
assisted by three Vice-Presidents, manages the business of ADB.

1 The term “country,” as used in the context of ADB, refers to a member of ADB and does not imply any view

on the part of ADB as to the member's sovereignty or independent status.
To be operational in 2003.

N ANNUAL REPORT 2002 | iii
tee abMESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

trong partnerships are essential for
achieving our goal of an Asia and Pacific
region free of poverty. We forged many such
partnerships in 2002—global, regional,
organizational, and individual. These

partnerships strengthened ADB as an
organization and brought us that much closer
to our goal.

   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

ADB as a voice in the
global community

The importance of many
voices speaking to an
agreed objective—the
voices of institutions and
governments alongside
the voices of civil
society, businesses, and
stakeholders—was
vividly underscored at
the World Summit on
Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
It was also evident at
other conferences and
symposiums I attended
in 2002. At the International Conference on
Financing for Development, for example, more
than 50 heads of state or
government and over 200
ministers agreed to place
development finance at the
forefront of the global agenda.
At this meeting, ADB and other
organizations reiterated a shared
commitment to the Millennium
Development Goals. | noted in my
address the importance of working
closely with development partners
to complement and build on one
another's strengths.

ADB as an alliance
broker

Several partnerships we developed
in years past reached important
milestones in 2002. For example,
in 1992, ADB had helped broker
an alliance of six countries
that shared a common
resource, the Mekong

River. The six developing member countries (DMCs) have
met often since then, and have formed what has
become known as the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
They have developed shared projects and programs that
are bringing benefits to the entire subregion. The GMS.
has become a model of regional cooperation and, in
2002, it held its first summit to celebrate a decade of
partnership. This gathering set the stage for many more
years of cooperation and allowed all of us to reaffirm
our commitment to creating a prosperous and equitable
subregion.

Another partnership ADB helped nurture in 2002—
Protecting the Coastal and Marine Waters of South
Asia—brought regional groups, such as the South Asia
Cooperative Environment Programme, together with
national agencies and international organizations such
as the United Nations Environment Programme. Through
a network of centers of excellence in policy, legislation,
education, and communication, the partnership is
expected to build capacity and encourage knowledge
transfers to contribute to human security and conservation of the region's natural resources.

We also helped organize a meeting in 2002 at
which a regional group of governments of small island
nations of the Pacific, nongovernment organizations
(NGOs), and others concerned about water came
together to develop a unified approach to the problems
these nations face in managing this scarce resource. The
result was a regional action plan for sustainable water
management.

Alliances often grew out of existing relationships
and previously agreed priorities, such as working to
clean the air we breathe. A partnership—the Clean Air
Initiative for Asia Cities—was launched by ADB, the
World Bank, and others in 2002 to address the problem
of air pollution in the region, We also joined the
International Labour Organization in promoting a decent
work environment for all people in the region, and we
collaborated with the World Trade Organization in
promoting knowledge and capacity for open trade.

ADB in partnership with its members

ADB is, of course, a partnership of 61 members, and it
enjoys a high level of trust and confidence among
governments and civil society. Through this partnership, ADB has a tremendous opportunity to forge the
broad-based strategic initiatives needed to enable the
poor to achieve peace and prosperity in the decades
to come.

In 2002, we continued to build on this trust. Several
of our donor members have over the years provided
ADB with untied grant funds to support technical
assistance and the soft components of loans. In 2002, a
new thematic poverty-focused multidonor financingarrangement was established, with the first contribution
coming from the United Kingdom. The Netherlands made
another contribution to the cooperation fund for the
water sector; Norway contributed to a fund on promoting governance; and Switzerland to a fund for consulting
services. Japan maintained trust funds set up earlier with
ADB for poverty reduction and for promoting information and communication technology.

We signed poverty partnership agreements in 2002
with six Asian and four Pacific island DMCs, bringing to
17 the total number we have signed. These partnership
agreements are based on long-standing relationships
between ADB and each DMC, and every agreement I
signed reminded me of the trust and commitment that
has grown over the years.

Commitment to a common goal was also evident
in the reorganization we effected in 2002. We improved
our own internal work environment to raise our
output and enhance the management of our knowledge and information resources. Management and
staff alike joined our DMC partners to ensure DMC
leadership and ownership of the development agenda.

Integral to the reorganization was the need to
develop better mechanisms and products for engaging
NGOs and other civil society groups as partners in
development. A new department was formed to work
with development partners on thematic and sector
issues. ADB’s NGO Center, as part of this department,
continued to serve as an important focal point.

ADB in partnership with the poor

The three pillars of ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy—
pro-poor sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and good governance—provide a solid
basis for partnerships to reduce poverty in Asia and the
Pacific. Our promotion of the private sector in development, our support for regional cooperation and
integration, and our advocacy of environmental
sustainability—add further strength to each partnership
we forge.

It is our common vision, our shared strategic
objective, that makes the partnerships we formed in
2002 so meaningful. Each summit I attended, each
memorandum of agreement | signed, each partnership
ADB renewed has, | believe, moved us closer to
realizing our vision of an Asia and Pacific region
free of poverty.

At a meeting in September 2002, I reiterated ADB's
commitment to Afghanistan, assuring our development
partners of our determination to contribute to the
reconstruction of the country. My words and our
commitment would have meant little, however, were it
not for the commitment of our primary partners in
Afghanistan—the country's people. I had seen their

involvement when I visited Kabul earlier in the year.
Their enterprise and determination to begin life anew
was impressive. The energy of the people was evident.
Private enterprises were springing up everywhere despite
a near absence of financial services.

I remember too with fondness and humility other
people I met in 2002: street children in Bangladesh,
small business entrepreneurs in India, farmers in the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, slum dwellers in the
Philippines.

It is the alliances we have formed with these
individuals that bring us closer to understanding the
nature and structure of poverty. And it is these alliances
that strengthen our resolve to make a difference.

Partnerships at the heart of ADB

Our greatest challenge in 2002 continued to be the
poverty that blights the lives of so many in the Asia and
Pacific region. Our greatest strengths in the fight to
overcome poverty are the partnerships we have joined
o meet that challenge. Partnerships are at the heart
of ADB.

PORN
Wie),

BOARD OF DIRECTORSeveloping Asia grew faster than expected in

2002, despite global security and economic

uncertainties and increasing concern about

the possibility of deflation. The Asia and

Pacific region's developing member countries

(DMCs) posted an overall economic growth
of 5.7%. While development progress for most countries
followed a fairly even path, some witnessed special
challenges in 2002. Timor-Leste (formerly East Timor)—
the world’s newest country—took its first steps.
Afghanistan set about turning mounds of brick and
roofless buildings into schools and hospitals. Sri Lanka
began a peace process to end decades of civil unrest.
Nepal saw strife worsen. Terrorism struck Indonesia, and
the continuing threat of terrorist strikes and talk of war
gave little cause for optimism.

Yet, it was also a year when the international
community endorsed a shared vision for protecting the
region’s most vulnerable.

For the Asian Development Bank (ADB), 2002 was a
year when existing partnerships were strengthened and
new ones forged, when the value of partnerships at every
level—between developed and developing countries,
between multilateral development institutions and
developing countries, between regions, between public and
private sectors—was stressed. ADB joined the international
community in endorsing the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) (see Box on the MDGs on page 36). ADB
participated in the United Nations International Conference
on Financing for Development, at which a consensus was
reached to build a new global alliance for financing development and an agreement was signed to better measure,
monitor, and manage development results. Recognizing the
need for a broad coalition of development partners to free
the Asia and Pacific region of poverty, ADB sought to work
more closely with other bilateral and multilateral development agencies. Agreements between ADB and the
International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), World Bank, World Trade
Organization (WTO), and others reflect this determination.

Reconstructing nations

Partnerships played an important role in nation rebuilding
in 2002. Multilateral organizations joined nongovernment
organizations (NGOs) in meeting the immediate humanitarian needs of Afghanistan as it faced the enormous task of
reconstructing itself for the 21% century. In 2002, the Board
of Directors approved ADB's first loan to the country in

23 years and opened an office (now a resident mission) in
Kabul. Coordinated international efforts also proceeded in
rebuilding another Asian country torn by civil strife, TimorLeste, which joined ADB as an independent nation in 2002,
and where ADB has set up a special office. Likewise, ADB
and other development partners assisted Sri Lanka in 2002,
helping the country rebuild its economy and work toward
enduring peace. For more on postconflict reconstruction

and rehabilitation, see the Special Theme chapter and
http:/Avww.adb.org/Afghanistan/.

 

Supporting regional cooperation

By acting jointly, countries can improve their development
prospects and strengthen their ability to reduce poverty,
increase private sector investment, promote peace and
security, and achieve sustainable development. Together,
they can mitigate the adverse effects of negative externalities and create an environment where common services
and development programs can be shared.

As a regional institution, ADB has a clear comparative
advantage in promoting regional cooperation in Asia and
the Pacific, and has done so since opening its doors in
1966. In November 2002, ADB and the six DMC partners of
the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Program—Cambodia,
People’s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam—celebrated an
important milestone, which ADB had helped broker. The
first GMS Summit, held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in
November, commemorated the 10" anniversary of the GMS
Program. For more on the GMS Summit, see the Operational
Priorities and Performance chapter and http://www.adb.org/
Documents/Events/Mekong/2002/summit.asp).

ADB also joined DMCs from other regional groups in
furthering their shared development goals. ADB hosted the
first ministerial meeting on economic cooperation in
Central Asia for the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation program in March (see http:/Avww.adb.org/
Documents/Events/2002/CAREC/), and helped organize a
meeting of country advisors for the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation initiative in October. For more on
regional cooperation, see page 49 and http://www.adb.org/
RegionalCooperation/.

Reorganizing internally

The new organizational structure, approved by the Board of
Directors in 2001, came into effect on 1 January 2002.
ADB's close working relationship with its development
partners, combined with the new structure and new
business processes implemented throughout the year, will
help ADB deliver services more quickly and efficiently.
ADB's services to its DMCs are organized under regional
departments, one each for a defined geographic area

(see the Country Reports chapter on page 74). This move
strengthened the role of the operational Vice-Presidents in
delivering ADB’s strategic agenda and in overseeing
compliance with strategies and policies.

Overall, the major structural changes were accomplished
as scheduled. However, as with any change of this magnitude, adjustments were needed in this transitional year. The
implementation of the reorganization will be evaluated in
2003. This will be followed in 2004 by an independent review
that will assess the development impact of the reorganization’s objectives—balancing country and sector considerations,
improving quality and expertise, enhancing safeguard policy
compliance, providing greater accountability, and placing
greater emphasis on regional cooperation and knowledge
management. For more on the reorganization, see the
Operational Priorities and Performance, Knowledge and Support

Adopting new policies and procedures

The Board of Directors reviewed and approved several
policy, financial, and administrative papers in 2002 (see Box
on page 4), including ADB’s lending and borrowing
limitations; establishing resident missions in Afghanistan,
Papua New Guinea, and Tajikistan; Afghanistan's
classification under ADB's graduation policy; and the
country classification for Turkmenistan (see Box on the
Classification of ADB’s Developing Members on page 66).

The main objective of ADB's liquidity policy, which the
Board of Directors approved in June, is to ensure ADB’s
capacity to meet its cash requirements even in the event of a
major disruption in its cash flow. The cash flow-driven liquidity
requirements addressed in the policy include a new minimum
level of liquidity, ceiling on discretionary liquidity, and funding
for the core liquidity portfolio. For more on ADB’s liquidity
policy, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis chapter.

In approving the education policy in August, the Board
of Directors furthered ADB’s commitment to helping DMCs
achieve universal primary education and gender equity in
primary, secondary, and tertiary education. The policy promotes increased equity and access, improved educational
quality, better resource mobilization, and greater use of
innovative technologies, such as information and communication technology (ICT), in schools in the Asia and Pacific
region. The policy also encourages strengthened partnerships with civil society, including NGOs and local communities. For more on ADB’s 2002 activities in the education
sector, see the Operational Priorities and Performance chapter |

In November, the Board of Directors approved a new
Environment Policy to help ADB meet the challenges of the
region’s rapidly increasing environmental degradation.
Consultations with stakeholders, including a Board seminar,
country workshops, and several rounds of interdepartmental review, were incorporated in the policy. The policy
addresses the need for environmental assessment at the
time of country programming, structured consultation in
the conduct of environmental assessments, and monitoring
and compliance with environmental requirements during
project implementation. It underscores the need to view
environmental assessment as an ongoing rather than a
onetime event (see http://www.adb.org/Environment/envpol/).

Reviewing existing policies

Management and effectiveness of ADB’s
technical assistance operations

Technical assistance is an important component of ADB's
operations. It supports poverty reduction by financing
project preparation and implementation, advising on policy
reform, building capacity in DMCs, and helping promote
regional cooperation. Unfortunately, resources for technical
assistance are limited.

To meet the growing demand for technical assistance,
and to ensure the most effective use of its resources, the
Board of Directors reviews ADB's technical assistance
operations periodically, with a view to improving technical
assistance monitoring and coordination; long-term
management, quality, and cost-effectiveness; and country
ownership of the process and products. In 2002, the Board
of Directors discussed a working paper, identifying several
variables that influence the effectiveness of technical
assistance. The paper proposed remedial actions and policy
revisions for improving technical assistance management,
including designing systematic and long-term approaches
that are supported by in-depth diagnostic analysis, ensuring
commitment and ownership of the recipient DMC, ensuring
stakeholder participation in processing and implementing
the assistance, paying attention to training requirements
and change management expertise, and continued
monitoring of the implementation of recommendations.

Another measure for strengthening technical
assistance effectiveness is to disseminate as widely as
possible the knowledge created for, and derived from, the
technical assistance activities. ADB's technical assistance
activities result in a range of knowledge services, including
the formal knowledge products and services (KPS) that are
programmed into the technical assistance and are targeted
to specific clientele, and the less formal knowledge byproducts and services. Both formal and informal products
and services contribute to knowledge development; with
wide dissemination, their effectiveness is maximized.

ADB's role as a provider of knowledge for development is in line with the Directors’ review of the management and effectiveness of technical assistance, and in
keeping with the objectives of the Medium-Term Strategy
and the new business processes implemented in 2002. Thenew Regional and Sustainable Development Department
(RSDD) was established in the reorganization to maintain
quality and technical excellence and help ensure that
knowledge is horizontally integrated across ADB. A
framework for knowledge management is being prepared.

Inspection Function

When ADB approved its Inspection Function in 1995 as a
forum for project beneficiaries to file requests alleging
ADB's noncompliance with its operational procedures and
policies, the Board of Directors stipulated a review within
2 years from the approval of the members of the initial
Roster of Experts. In 1999, the Board of Directors discussed
a working paper on the review of the Inspection Function,
in which varying views were expressed on whether ADB’s
private sector operations should be subject to the
Inspection Function. Also, by 1999, only two requests for
inspection had been filed, and both had been deemed
ineligible; hence, with limited experience on the process,
the review could draw few conclusions.

While the review continued, the
first full inspection process relating to
the Samut Prakarn Wastewater
Management Project in Thailand was
conducted from April 2001 to March
2002, and it became evident that the
inspection process and procedures were
lengthy and confusing. This first full
inspection also raised concerns about
the independence, credibility, transparency, and effectiveness of the Inspection Function.

In 2002, ADB conducted extensive external and internal
consultations as part of the ongoing review. ADB solicited
the views of its stakeholders—member governments, civil
society (including NGOs), and private sector—through
external and internal consultations. Information about the
review, including a consultation work plan and timetable;
external comments received by ADB; and documents,
including an issues paper and two drafts of the working
paper, were posted on ADB's web site http:/Avww.adb.org
and sent to its partners for review and comment. In addition,
the outcome and report for each of the two rounds of public
consultations, covering 10 member countries, were also
posted on the web site. Internal consultations included
regular meetings of the steering committee and working
group (the two groups merged in September as the
Inspection Function Review Committee), and discussions at
informal Board briefings and at an informal Board retreat.

The consultations reinforced broad support for an
independent accountability mechanism that addresses the
alleged grievances of adversely affected people in ADBassisted projects, and increased problem-solving and
problem-prevention measures by ADB. The new mechanism
was expected to complement and enhance ADB’s
objectives of poverty reduction, development effectiveness,
and improved project quality. The inputs and recommendations from the external and internal consultations formed
the basis for the Working Paper, for circulation and
consideration by the Board of Directors in 2003. The

 

ADB's technical assistance
activities result in a range
of knowledge products
and services; with wide
dissemination, their
effectiveness is maximized.

Broadening development partnerships

Management and the Directors visited several DMCs in 2002,
and met with senior government officials and high-level
representatives from multilateral and bilateral organizations.

President’s visits

ADB President Tadao Chino traveled widely in 2002,
visiting projects, meeting ADB stakeholders, and participating in major international events.

In meetings with senior officials, representatives of the
private sector and NGOs, as well as other development
partners, the President noted the need for basic physical
and social infrastructure to achieve
higher levels of sustainable, pro-poor
economic growth. He also noted the
need to address corruption and improve
the efficiency of administrative services.

Within the region, the President
visited Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Cambodia, India, Lao People's
Democratic Republic, Maldives, Sri
Lanka, and Timor-Leste. During his visit
to Bangladesh, the President helped set the foundation stone
for ADB's new resident mission building in Dhaka, and
attended the Bangladesh Resident Mission's 20" anniversary
celebration. In the Maldives and Sri Lanka, the President
strengthened cooperation and signed poverty partnership
agreements with both.

The President joined other multilateral development
bank presidents at the UN International Conference on
Financing for Development, held in March in Monterrey,
Mexico. Among the themes addressed were mobilizing
domestic financial resources and foreign direct investment;
and issues related to international trade, official development assistance, debt relief, and trading systems. The
President also led the ADB delegation at the World Summit
on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in August and
September in Johannesburg, South Africa (see Box on the
World Summit on page 42).

Board group visits

To increase DMC awareness of ADB's work and provide
the Directors and Alternate Directors with an opportunity
to view the development conditions of DMCs firsthand,
several Directors and Alternates took part in group visits to
Pakistan and Sri Lanka in February; Indonesia in June; and
Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in August.

In each DMC, the Directors and Alternates met the
leader of the country, senior government officials, ADB
governors, public and private sector representatives, and
members of civil society, including NGOs.

Khushali Bank, Punjab Community Water Supply and
Sanitation Project, Ghazi Barotha Project, barani/forestry/
urban development projects, and Court Room Delay
Reduction Project. In Sri Lanka, they met with representatives of the 800,000 displaced people, and looked at road
networks, tea plantations, and the South Asia Gateway
Terminals Limited.

In Indonesia, topics addressed with senior government officials included fiscal, monetary, and other
economic issues; decentralization; privatization; and
social development. Partnerships were strengthened with
representatives of the private sector and of other
multilateral and bilateral agencies, including the
Australian Agency for International Development, Japan
International Cooperation Agency, United Nations
Development Programme, United States Agency for
International Development, and World Bank. Project and
field visits included observing firsthand ADB projects on
flood control storage and street children and destitute
mother care centers, as well as education facilities to
view the traditional madrasah school system.

In the Kyrgyz Republic, the Directors and Alternates
visited ADB's microcredit and school projects in the
Issyk-Kul Lake area, and the Bishkek-Osh Road Project.
In Turkmenistan, they visited a potential project site
aimed at improving the main road from Atamurat to
Imamnazar on the northern Afghanistan border, and they
were briefed on other projects of interest to the
Turkmenistan people. In Uzbekistan, they were taken to
Samarkand, where they visited an ADB project that
supports the development of small- and mediumsized enterprises.

Agreements signed

ADB joined the international community in adopting a
platform for better measuring, monitoring, and managing
development results in March, and in adopting the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in April. ADB also

 

forged several agreements with development partners in
2002, such as ILO and WTO, to strengthen the region’s
knowledge base, training capacity, and ability to monitor
development objectives (see Box below).

Undertaking its work

Meetings and approvals

The Board of Directors met formally on 57 occasions, and
held 21 informal meetings in 2002, including briefings,
discussion seminars, and presentations.

The Board approved a total of $5.7 billion for 89 loans
covering 71 projects, compared with loan amounts of
$5.3 billion for 76 loans covering 60 projects in 2001. This
represented an increase in lending of nearly $337 million.
Of this, $272 million was accounted for by loans from the
Asian Development Fund (ADF), and $65 million from
ordinary capital resources (OCR).

The higher level of ADF lending resulted, for the most
part, from a $150 million loan to Afghanistan. The
remaining increase was mainly in loans to Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka. The increase in OCR lending resulted from
higher lending to Indonesia, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.

In keeping with its mission to reduce poverty, 41% or
38 projects in 2002 were categorized as poverty interventions. The largest share of loans went to the transport and
communications sector.

The Board also approved directly, or through authority
delegated to the President, a total of 324 technical
assistance grants amounting to $179.0 million, of which
$56.0 million came from OCR current income, $46.7 million
from the Technical Assistance Special Fund, $36.4 million
from the Japan Special Fund, $9.6 million from the Asian
Currency Crisis Support Facility, and the remaining $30.3
million from other multilateral and bilateral sources. This
represented a 23% increase over 2001 (255 grants worth
$145.5 million). For more on loans and technical assistance,
see the Operations chapter and the Statistical Annex.

social protection interventions.

In July 2002, ILO and ADB discussed mainstreaming ILO’s core
labor standards in ADB’s country
operations in 2003-2005, such asin
the summary labor market assessments required in preparing new
country strategies and programs
(CSPs) and CSP updates. See http://

World Trade Organization
An MOU between ADB and the
World Trade Organization (WTO),

signed in 2002, supports ADB's
efforts to promote the economic
and social development of DMCs
through trade and integration. In
its first major activity under the
agreement, ADB approved a
regional technical assistance to
help DMCs better understand and
implement the WTO trading
system. A high-level meeting on
the WTO trading system for negotiators and an intensive course on
trade facilitation were completed
in 2002 (see http://www.adb.org/
Documents/Events/2002/WTO_
Trading_System/).In their informal meetings, the Directors examined a
range of issues, including the Inspection Function review,
the reorganization, and knowledge dissemination.

Membership

Portugal and Timor-Leste joined ADB in 2002, bringing the
total membership to 61. For a list of regional and nonregional members, see page xv.

United Nations

ADB achieved Observer Status at the United Nations
General Assembly in February 2002.

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) was host to
over 3,000 participants, comprising government
delegations, bankers, representatives from multilateral and bilateral institutions, civil society
including nongovernment organizations, and
media, at ADB's 35'" Annual Meeting of the Board
of Governors in Shanghai. Delegates attended
thematic seminars and country presentations prior
to the Governors’ business sessions from 10 to
12 May.

The Governors reviewed ADB's 2001 activities
and discussed the outlook for ADB's developing
member countries. They endorsed the implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, ADB's
reorganization, and proposals to enhance ADB's
country focus, as well as its continuing efforts to
promote regional cooperation. Echoing the importance of regional cooperation, PRC President Jiang
Zemin pledged his country’s continued support of,
and involvement in, cooperation initiatives.

The Governors agreed on the need for Asian
economies to continue with structural reforms,
capacity building, and improved governance if they
are to attain sustainable growth. The challenge of
environmental degradation and the importance of
the private sector in development were also
underscored.

The Office of the Secretary provides advice and
counsel to the Board of Governors, Board of
Directors, and Office of the President. Its other
principal functions are to help organize the Annual
Meeting; plan the calendar of the Board of Directors and organize and facilitate meetings of the
Board and its Sanding Committees; edit, classify,
and circulate Board documents; administer the
terms and conditions of engagement of Management and the Board; process applications for ADB
membership; administer the Inspection Function;
and provide protocol support and services.

SUPPORTING THE BOARD

 

 

Board committees

The Board of Directors had four standing committees
and one working committee in 2002. For membership,
see Appendix 5.

Audit Committee

The Committee continued to examine the adequacy of
ADB's internal controls and its internal and external audits.
Pursuing its main focus of the previous year, the Committee monitored in 2002 the implementation of the newly
adopted international accounting standards (Financial
Accounting Standards [FAS] 133) and their potential impact
on ADB's financial management. In particular, the
Committee examined ADB's practice of parallel reporting—
with one report following the FAS 133 and another,
prepared simultaneously, following the presentation of
ADB's financial statements with reference both to

pre-FAS 133 reporting practices and to the new currentvalue reporting practice (see the Management's Discussion
and Analysis chapter). Given the difficulties experienced in
2002 in accounting and reporting globally, the Committee
emphasized the importance of monitoring the reporting
practices used. The Committee also noted the need for the
multilateral development banks (MDBs) to cooperate
closely among themselves, and the importance of engaging
the professional partnership of the independent auditors in
this complex issue.

A second major focus in 2002 was the further
development of an integrated and independent institutional risk management capability in ADB, made possible
by an initiative of Management, the independent
auditors, and the Audit Committee. The Committee
continued to monitor the implementation of new
initiatives to improve internal and external controls,
specifically but not exclusively through the Integrated
Financial Management and Human Resource Management Information System (INTEGRA), the integrated
computerized control system that became operational in
2002. The Committee also reviewed and endorsed the
2002 work program of the Office of the General Auditor
(OGA), noting the successful completion of a peer review
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; reviewed and endorsed the annual report of the
Anticorruption Unit of the OGA, citing the close
coordination with other MDBs; and reviewed the Audit
Recommendations Implementation Report, noting the
high percentage of audits directly or indirectly related to
the issue of risk management either in operations or
in financial management.

Budget Review Committee

The Committee met in May to review the implementation
of INTEGRA and future directions of the Information
Systems and Technology Strategy for ADB. In November,
it reviewed Management’s 2002 work accomplishments,
and 2003 budget proposal and work plans of
departments and offices.

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 7

MAIAI¥Y NI 7007

1YOd3du ,SYOLIAYIG 40 GuUvOdAt the May meeting, the Committee was informed of
the removal of the “operations” module from the original
scope of INTEGRA and urged careful consideration of the
lessons learned from this. The Committee also provided its
views on the future directions of ICT in ADB.

During budget deliberations in November, the
Committee requested information on the reorganization
and its effectiveness. Concerned about the transitional
impact on operations and on the budget, it suggested that
a progress review clarify and refine the roles of regional
departments and the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. The Committee was advised that new
business processes had streamlined processing of new
projects and project administration.

On ADB strategies and policies, the Committee
expressed the view that all new policies should include an
assessment of cost implications to allow for better
measurement of resource requirements and ensure that
new policy mandates are adequately funded and staffed.

The Committee noted a need for prioritizing the
knowledge networks and thematic/sector committees (see
the Operational Priorities and Performance chapter), for being
selective in forming new committees, and for minimizing
disruption of the operational departments. The Committee
noted the importance of knowledge management for
development effectiveness. It suggested that coordination
with bilateral and multilateral development partners
be improved to avoid duplication of work and to
ensure more effective use of ADB's limited technical
assistance resources.

On the regional departments, the Committee
recommended a review of the loan classification system to
ensure that it accurately reflects poverty reduction impact,
including that of infrastructure projects; increased
cooperation with other MDBs; and the need to address the
issue of work distribution between and within the regional
departments. The Committee supported an expansion of
ADB's regional cooperation activities.

On the Resident Mission Policy, the Committee
emphasized the need for a clearer relationship between the
resident and regional missions and the operations
coordination division, and fuller integration of the missions
into their respective regional departments; more vigorous
deployment of staff and budgetary resources to the
missions; more interaction among missions in the same
region; increased use of national officers/local experts; and
strengthened external relations and outreach programs.

The Committee expressed reservation about the
expansion of the Private Sector Operations Department
(PSOD) into new areas, and suggested that PSOD's 2003
work program be trimmed, considering resource
constraints. It recommended that PSOD should concentrate
on helping smaller DMCs, strengthening collaboration
with the regional departments and DMC governments,
and developing appropriate instruments for niche
markets and sectors.

On portfolio management, the Committee noted that
the regional departments, Central Operations Services
Office (COSO), and Operations Evaluation Department

8 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

(OED) have distinct functional responsibilities for managing
ADB's portfolio. It noted COSO’s continued efforts to build
DMC capacity in portfolio management by supporting
procurement legislation and project accounting and
financial management.

With more poverty and purpose-specific grant funds
being managed by ADB, the Committee noted the need for
a structured marketing strategy to attract funding agencies.

The Committee noted the increase in cofinancing in
2002 over the previous year (see the Operations chapter).

It noted the accumulation of in-house expertise on
guarantees through recent credit enhancement operations
and staff training. It encouraged cooperation among the
Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO), PSOD, and other
departments/offices and expected better results and
performance in this area.

On budget management, the Committee noted that in
2003 the Budget, Personnel and Management Systems
Department (BPMSD) aims to further the link between work
program and resource allocation by updating the staff time
coefficient for some products and services. It recommended
exercising more selectivity in work programs, eliminating
low-priority work, and optimizing the use of budgetary
resources in meeting urgent and unplanned requirements.

The Committee recommended approval of the budget
for 2003 (see Appendix 10).

Development Effectiveness Committee

The Committee, established in December 2000, is
mandated to help the Board ensure that ADB’s country
strategies and programs, through its lending and
knowledge products and services, achieve their desired
development objectives and use ADB resources
efficiently and effectively.

The Committee continued its focus on ADB’s
operations evaluation program and results, as it reviewed a
balanced selection of OED reports (see Box at right);
examined the annual programs for project and technical
assistance completion reports coordinated by COSO; and
discussed OED’s Annual Review of Evaluation Activities in
2001 (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/pers/
annualrev2001.pdf} and Annual Report on Loan and
Technical Assistance Portfolio Performance for the Period
Ending 31 December 2001 (see http:/Avww.adb.org/
Documents/Reports/Portfolio_Performance/2001/2001_12.pdf}.

In its report on loan and technical assistance portfolio
performance in 2001, the Committee noted that the
proportion of projects rated unsatisfactory had decreased; a
more robust project performance monitoring system had
been introduced; disbursement under project loans was
proceeding well; and the use of technical assistance
resources was being prioritized. However, it concluded
that further efforts should address delays in loan
effectiveness, contract awarding under project loans,
submission of audited project accounts, and technical
assistance implementation.

In its report on ADB's evaluation activities in 2001, the
Committee highlighted the importance of measurable
objectives for assessing development effectiveness. It notedProject/Program Performance Audit Reports

that, although evaluation improves development effectiveness, operations can be improved only if the evaluation
findings and recommendations are translated into staff
guidelines. The Committee thus agreed that evaluation
should become a core business process of ADB.

Inspection Committee

In 2002, the Committee held 13 formal and several
informal meetings. It considered six requests for inspection
during the year.

At the beginning of 2002, two requests for inspection
were pending—the Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management Project in Thailand and the Southern Transport
Development Project in Sri Lanka. In February, the
Committee received Management's response to the
Inspection Panel's report on its inspection of the Samut
Prakarn Project. As required under the Inspection Function,
the Committee submitted its recommendation on the
Panel's report and Management's response to the Board
within 14 days. The Board of Directors considered the
Committee’s recommendations in March.

The Committee received four requests for inspection of
the Southern Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka.
The first was received in December 2001, and the other
three in 2002. Each was submitted by a different group of
requesters who would be affected by the project. The
Committee decided that, prima facie, two of the requests

 

were neither clearly frivolous nor clearly ineligible, and
requested Management to respond to them. After
consulting with a member of the Roster of Experts, the
Committee determined with respect to both requests that
there was insufficient basis to warrant an inspection. The
Board approved the Committee’s recommendation. The
Committee determined that the other two requests were
ineligible under the Inspection Function and that a
response from Management was not required.

In November, the Committee received a request for
inspection of the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project in
Pakistan. The Committee reviewed the request in December
and decided that, prima facie, the request was neither
clearly frivolous nor clearly ineligible, and requested
Management to respond to it. For more on the Inspection
Function, see http://www.adb.org/inspection/review.asp.

Working Group on the Annual Report

ADB's annual reports, including its special theme chapters,
reflect broad consultations between the Working Group and
staff members. The Annual Report Readers’ Survey
responses are also considered. The Working Group guides
the structure and process. To facilitate the work of future
Board working groups, the Working Group on Annual Report
2002 recommended several changes in the process and
timing of inputs for future annual reports and theme chapters.

In addition, they effected structural changes in Annual
Report 2002:

¢ An expanded Operational and Financial Overview
includes more data and provides a more complete
summary of the year.

¢ — The Operational Priorities and Performance
chapter, organized according to ADB's operational themes
and sectors, provides discussion of their role in meeting
ADB's overall objective of reducing poverty.

¢ Presentation of DMCs by regional department in
the Country Reports chapter highlights DMC partnerships.

¢ The Knowledge and Support Activities (which
replaces the Strategic Planning and Support Activities) and
the Institutional Matters chapters show how the reorganization has been institutionalized.

¢ The Glossary attempts to harmonize terminology
across ADB.

* Cross references and links to specific pages on
ADB's web site (see http://vww.adb.org) are included
throughout the report.

¢ Partnership Points, included in most chapters,
reflect the many ways ADB and its development partners—
governments and civil society including nongovernment
organizations, multilateral and bilateral organizations, and
the private sector—worked in 2002 to reduce poverty in the
Asia and Pacific region.

multilateral development banks can and do play a critical catalytic
and supportive role.

bee VO) CC) (ET SU SUT the tot ad Fore than 5 decades ago, in July 1944,

representatives of 44 countries met

in New Hampshire, United States

(US), for a set of meetings that led to

the establishment of the Bretton

Woods institutions, and a spirit of a
true “international community.” The first test of the new
group's collective will—and its first success—came in 1948
in Europe as the world community joined under the
Marshall Plan to help the continent reconstruct its battered
economies and infrastructure in the wake of World War II.
Building on this experience, the international community
has since compiled an impressive, albeit depressingly long,
record of postconflict rehabilitation and reconstruction in
many parts of the world.!

Asia has seen several conflicts resolved in recent
decades. In 2002, Asia, and indeed the world, again focused
on postconflict as Afghanistan began to rebuild after more
than 20 years of fighting. As it is doing in Afghanistan, the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) played an important role in
postconflict rehabilitation in several countries, including
Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste.

This chapter examines the rehabilitation and reconstruction process, drawing lessons from postconflict
countries with Afghanistan as the case study.

Challenges of rebuilding

Every society that suffers conflict must rebuild on several
fronts: humanitarian, human and social, security, political,
rehabilitation/reconstruction, and development. For decades,
the international community has struggled to devise an
optimal set of strategies to deal with these challenges. Given
the diverse nature of postconflict situations, a single strategy
will not suffice. For every situation, there must be a unique,
multipronged approach that can be flexibly applied in view
of the objective realities on the ground.

Providing humanitarian and social assistance

The first task of postconflict reconstruction is often
providing basic humanitarian relief such as food, medicine,
nutritional supplements, shelter and repatriation, reintegration, and resettlement assistance. The scope of the
challenge can be daunting, but the international community
has done well in providing humanitarian relief both during
and after conflicts.

The need for basic assistance reflects the devastating
human cost of conflict. People pay a high price in conflict
situations. Their lives are disrupted. They lose selfconfidence. Many fall into despair and experience feelings
of helplessness, fear, insecurity, vulnerability, and a loss of
faith and confidence in others, including institutions.
Fighting can leave large numbers of people ill, disabled,

widowed, orphaned, displaced, or suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. The scars can take many years to
heal and often remain for life. National governments,
international donors, and nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) have developed programs to help individuals deal
with the harsh realities of conflict.

On a broader level, the impact of conflict is in the
fragmentation of society; the loss of social persona and
identity; and the breakdown of social norms, traditional
values, respect for elders and authority, and the informal
social safety net. Social cohesion, values, and norms are not
easy to restore. The international community can facilitate
the process by helping create an enabling environment. But
communities must work together to regain their lost
harmony. Old relationships need to be revived. New
relationships need to be established to reflect changes in the
environment and to take advantage of opportunities
presented by the prospect of lasting peace and stability.

Ensuring security

The security challenge rests primarily in the law-and-order
situation in a postconflict region. The lack of security can
threaten public safety. And the situation can be aggravated
by the presence of many armed men and women who lack
leadership or organization. Disarming war combatants and
warring factions has proven to be most difficult in
postconflict reconstruction. Building trust in the ability to
provide mutual safety and security takes time; and
rehabilitating combatants can present a financial, logistical,
and physical nightmare for governments. In many
postconflict countries, this transition to real security is
excruciatingly painful. A weak government structure or
central authority can further complicate the process as it
becomes difficult to police demobilization and violations of
human rights. Hostile neighbors and the presence of large
amounts of unexploded ordnance can accentuate physical
insecurity. The international community can, as it has
occasionally, come forward with a security assistance force
to keep conflicting parties apart and to preserve peace. The
international community’s assistance in removing
unexploded ordnance has saved many lives.

Establishing a political authority

Each postconflict situation also poses a political challenge,
as various factions must agree on an acceptable political
contract. The primary need is for national political
reconciliation to bring all parties together to seek peace
and stability, and the establishment of an acceptable
political authority with representation from all groups
concerned. The representative nature of the political
authority must be embodied in new codes, laws, and
constitutions, or constitutional provisions that facilitate the
transition to democratic, efficient, transparent, and
accountable governance. Without a legal, constitutional,
and representative political authority, peace and stability
can be very short-lived and the dream of rapid rehabilitation and reconstruction can easily be shattered.

The central challenge is to establish a nexus among
security, political stability, and reconstruction. The three do

showed that reconstruction can strengthen the political
process and enhance security.

Reconstruction and
the development continuum

Successful reconstruction requires a clear conceptual
understanding of the nature of relief, rehabilitation,
reconstruction, and the development “continuum.”
Although it is called a continuum, the progression of
development is not necessarily linear and the transition
from one stage to the next is not seamless, although this is
a cherished goal. The pain of transition, in fact, can be as
acute as the pain inflicted by conflict.

To ease the transition, three key elements for
maintaining peace must be strengthened: physical security,
political stability, and economic growth. This requires
coordination and consultation among key players, an
understanding of the multisectoral and multidimensional
nature of reconstruction, and the establishment of political
and economic linkages at all levels.

Broadening the approach

These challenges form the backdrop of each postconflict
situation. They must be considered as the international
community conceptualizes and operationalizes the
strategies for short-term rehabilitation and reconstruction
that set the foundation for medium- and long-term
development.

Early success in dealing with these challenges is no
guarantee of lasting peace. Tension resulting from poor
governance, economic difficulties, or political struggles can

quickly thrust a country back into conflict. This reality has
led the international community to broaden its approach to
postconflict assistance to include conflict prevention,
preparedness, and mitigation (see Box below). Prevention
and preparedness require an understanding of a
country's social and political landscape, the presence and
nature of antagonistic forces, the areas of contention,
and the situations that could trigger conflict. Each aspect
must be mapped to form a prevention strategy that,
when coupled with well-defined actions in case of
conflict and mitigation, will constitute an integral part of
postconflict assistance.

From postconflict to reconstruction

Stages of transition

Postconflict countries go through stages during rehabilitation and reconstruction. In the days and months immediately following a conflict, relief efforts are spearheaded by
international agencies such as the United Nations (UN)
High Commissioner for Refugees, World Food Program,
International Committee of the Red Cross, and various
NGOs. This period may be relatively short and may include
some reconstruction activities.

Reconstruction starts in earnest once the situation is
stable and the environment is secure. Resource gaps are
large during these phases and a country must often depend
on external assistance.

Development resumes when normal economic
activities are revived, internal resources are generated, and
financial intermediation is dynamic and rapid.

* conduct periodic surveys and publish vital indicators

* establish a legal, security, policing, and regulatory framework to avoid conflict

* accelerate growth, development, and poverty reduction

* maintain a knowledge base, build partnerships, and position for rapid response

* balance development by region and population groups

* establish an appropriate power sharing and leadership rotation structure

+ strengthen democratic institutions and values

* ensure appropriate mechanisms are in place to ease tensions

+ mobilize communities against, and sensitize about, the potential for conflict

* set national, regional, and international mechanisms to promote and assist discussion among

* promote institutional capacity building and good governanceSometimes the transition is more complex. In
Afghanistan, for example, a war against terrorism is
ongoing. Relief operations are constantly under threat and
new faces join the relief lines every day. In this situation,
relief must be carried out simultaneously with resettling
displaced persons, disarming people, demining, and
neutralizing armed opponents of the legitimate authority.

Financing the transition

Each phase of postconflict recovery and development
requires substantial external financing. The international
community has usually been generous in the years
immediately following a conflict. Much of the aid is
directed toward relief and limited amounts toward
reconstruction. This usually reflects a country's limited
absorptive capacity in the initial phase, hence
considerable early attention must be paid to capacity
building and policy and institutional reforms. A funding
problem may arise later, however, because the initial
enthusiasm to provide assistance can wane before a
postconflict country is ready to absorb larger amounts of
aid for reconstruction and development.

Postconflict assistance and
the international community

The international community has had mixed experiences in
delivering postconflict assistance.

To be most effective, aid pledges must be translated
promptly into accessible resources that can be flexibly used
for reconstruction according to the priorities of the country
concerned. Slow disbursement of funds pledged by donors
only adds to the problems that the postconflict country
faces. In Cambodia, Lebanon, Mozambique, Rwanda, and
West Bank and Gaza, there was a considerable lag
between pledges and commitment, and between commitment and disbursement.

Aid pledges must be realistic. Given the high public
profile of pledging conferences, promised assistance can be
overstated and then be difficult to deliver. The ad hoc nature
of pledging conferences makes it difficult to bind donors to
their commitments. Sometimes pledges are made according
to donors’ priorities rather than those of the recipient.

Pledges are often linked to policy conditionalities:
macroeconomic; peace; and governance, human rights,
and democratic reform. But the donors’ approach and
emphasis in each of these areas may differ, thereby
creating confusion in the recipient country and ultimately
reducing the effectiveness of postconflict aid. Sometimes,
in an effort to organize assistance at the onset, donors
impose conditions that a postconflict government finds
impossible to achieve.

Linking or bridging relief and development efforts
should be improved. The availability of resources and their
allocation among relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and
development can pose problems. Donors often fail to
resolve the overlapping nature of different activities, and
are usually reluctant to shift resources from relief to
reconstruction or from reconstruction to relief—even if the
case for the shift is well understood.

 

The challenges and problems discussed in this chapter
manifest the difficulties of aid coordination. Considerable
work is under way to improve the situation. Success has
been slow, but collective efforts continue.

Role of MDBs

In the aftermath of World War II, reconstruction, initially of
Europe, was facilitated by transferring resources from
capital-surplus to capital-deficient countries. The World
Bank was founded to facilitate this transfer. With restrictive
capital flows and associated high risks, many postconflict
countries were unable to attract the capital needed to
finance their social and economic development. The four
regional development banks were founded on the same
principles, given the congruity of needs of postwar Europe
and the newly independent countries of Africa, Asia, and
later Eastern Europe.

Throughout much of the postwar period, the
operations of multilateral development banks? (MDBs) were
guided by their founding principle: provide finance for
government-led investments in development projects. Over
time, their operations evolved to include responding to
emerging world challenges such as oil price shocks, natural
disasters, and civil conflict.>

MDBs are usually not involved in relief efforts. Their
operations are designed to take a longer-term perspective
and provide much-needed assistance for capacity building,
rehabilitation, reconstruction, and eventually, development.

MDBs play a primarily catalytic role, helping the
country rebuild its institutions, formulate policies, and train
people needed to maintain peace and establish a
sustainable system of government that will enable the
economy and the people to prosper.

MDBs as financiers

Initially, MDBs handled postconflict assistance within their
general assistance framework for developing member
countries (DMCs). Some special funds were available for
lending at concessional rates, but none were targeted
specifically for war-torn countries. Most funding available
specifically for postconflict assistance was provided in grants
and each institution allowed only limited amounts to be
disbursed for such uses. The practice in four MDBs is shown
below; ADB’s role in providing postconflict assistance is
included in the discussion on Afghanistan.

African Development Bank: AfDB’s emergency
assistance operations are geared primarily toward

2 The term “multilateral development banks” is used collectively for the
following institutions: African Development Bank, Asian Development
Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American
Development Bank, and World Bank.

At their June 1995 Summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the leaders of the
G-7 nations (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and
United States) called on the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund "to establish a new coordination procedure to facilitate a smooth
transition from the emergency to the rehabilitation phase, and to cooperate more effectively with donor countries in assisting postconflict
reconstruction.” Patrick, Stewart. 1998. "The Check is in the Mail: Improving

resuscitate development activities, and creating the
conditions necessary for other donors to intervene in a
country. AfDB’s approach to peace building and conflict
prevention is to design and finance, in collaboration with
other donors, projects that contribute to economic growth
and poverty reduction. In postconflict situations, it assists
in institutional reforms and capacity building to change
systems and structures, which may have contributed to
creating economic and social inequities.

Relief and some preparedness operations are financed
by grants from the $5 million annual budget for AfDB’s
Special Relief Fund. Rehabilitation and reconstruction
operations are financed mainly through regular loans, and
are subject to normal processing and implementation
procedures. Such assistance may not exceed $500,000 for
any one operation in a given country.

Inter-American Development Bank: IADB
established its special financing mechanism, the Emergency
Reconstruction Facility (ERF), to respond to natural and
unexpected disasters. The ERF complements IADB’s
Operational Policy for Emergencies arising from natural
and human-made disasters. The President of IADB is
authorized to expedite, with board consent, up to
$100 million for loans that meet emergency eligibility
criteria.° The maximum amount of an individual ERF loan
approved under this delegation may not exceed $20 million
for ordinary capital and $10 million for concessionary
financing for preestablished eligible activities. These
include help in hastening the restoration of services,
financing temporary repairs, and cleaning up in the
aftermath of a disaster.

International Monetary Fund: The primary role of
IMF in postconflict situations is to help countries restore
macroeconomic stability and the basis for sustainable
growth. IMF provides technical assistance and policy
advice, with financial assistance given once a situation is
sufficiently stable for it to be used effectively. In 1995, IMF
expanded its policy on emergency assistance to cover
postconflict situations.® Its emergency postconflict
assistance is provided from its General Resources Account
and is thus on nonconcessional terms. Since 1995, eight
countries have received this assistance from IMF.’

Through its Emergency Postconflict Facility, IMF can
provide 25-50% of quota with limited conditionality and
front-loading of disbursements in a lump sum.

14 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

World Bank: The World Bank also has emergency
reconstruction loans (ERLs) for assisting countries
experiencing natural or human-made emergencies.* The
ERLs typically have no ceiling, use standard International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development/International
Development Association rates, and, where possible, use
blend funding or mobilize bilateral money to subsidize the
loan interest rate.

In postconflict situations, the World Bank—in
partnership with UN agencies, bilateral donors, and
NGOs—contributes to the establishment of a peace process;
economic revival and resumption of trade, savings, and
domestic and foreign investment; macroeconomic
stabilization, and appropriate legal and regulatory
frameworks; social safety net building; improvement of
governance and civil society activities; rebuilding of
physical and social infrastructure and human capital;
development of food security; reintegration of displaced
populations, and demobilization and reintegration of
ex-combatants; demining; community development;
and aid coordination.

The World Bank lent more than $6.2 billion to 18
postconflict countries between 1980 and 1998.’ To develop
policy, cross-country learning, and expertise in specific
postconflict skills, it created a Postconflict Unit in July 1997.
In August 1997, the World Bank established a new grant
facility—the Postconflict Fund—as part of a larger
Development Grant Facility to help it respond rapidly to
early postconflict reconstruction.

MDBs as long-term partners

From a conceptual and practical point of view, rebuilding
social and physical infrastructure requires a long-term
perspective. Most postconflict societies, including
Afghanistan, are forced to deal with profound change.
Principal players have changed; new alliances have been
and are being established; people’s attitudes are being
altered; prospects for foreign assistance may be improving;
and new opportunities may not be far off. Expectations
may be high.

MDBs know that a knee-jerk solution has little chance
of producing a lasting solution to problems associated with
these changes. Postconflict reconstruction must be based
on a detailed needs assessment and adequate contextual
analysis, and must take into account the policy and
institutional framework, regional context, global dimension,
environmental and social impact assessments, and
psychosocial impact of the conflict.

There is a need for a comprehensive medium- to longterm strategic framework into which rehabilitation and

The World Bank Articles of Agreement call for special consideration for
war-torn societies. In determining the conditions and terms of loans made
to such members, the World Bank pays special regard to lessening the
country’s financial burden, and to expediting restoration and
reconstruction.

Afghanistan.reconstruction activities can fit. But again, creating a
successful framework depends on the quality and viability
of the economic, financial, social, and environment
investments during and after the rehabilitation and
reconstruction phases. Some rehabilitation projects—such
as those with immediate impacts—can be undertaken
provided they will not negatively impinge on the long-term
strategy. Other investments should proceed only when all
options have been evaluated and the advantage of a
particular proposal has been established.

MDBs as catalysts

Postconflict reconstruction is much
more than just new roads, bridges, and
schools. It is primarily about capacity
building, which suffers most during a
conflict. It is also about identifying and
implementing the right set of policies
and institutions to develop free
markets, enable individual initiatives to
thrive, encourage women to participate
equitably in all aspects of society and
economy, allow civil society including
NGOs to operate freely, enhance trade
and commerce, restore internal and external financial
linkages, reopen and strengthen regional links, and
increase factor mobility. Postconflict reconstruction is
largely about building capacity for market-based recovery
and sustainable growth. This is where MDBs can and do
play a critical catalytic and supportive role.

ADB's approach
and comparative advantage

Postconflict reconstruction is closely linked to ADB's
overarching goal of reducing poverty in Asia and the
Pacific, which aims to improve living standards in the
region. This objective assumes even greater urgency in
postconflict situations because the human cost of civil
conflict is felt most acutely by the poor who are most
vulnerable to external shocks.

ADB follows a three-pronged approach for postconflict
reconstruction, which is designed to support government
efforts at overcoming the challenges of establishing and
maintaining security and a stable political environment.
ADB focuses on building capital; rehabilitating production
and income, especially for the poor; and building capacity
to improve aid absorption. This focus and the corresponding outputs are designed to contribute both directly and
indirectly to the central objective of poverty reduction.

ADB does not have a separate mechanism for providing
postconflict assistance; like other MDBs, ADB deals with
these situations through its existing mechanisms.'°

In postconflict situations,
multilateral development
banks are the catalyst,
helping the country rebuild
its institutions, formulate
policies, train people needed
to maintain peace, and
establish a sustainable
system of government.

 

The sequence of actions in developing a postconflict
strategy closely follows ADB's programming cycle (see
Figure on page 19). Each conflict situation in a DMC is
monitored and reports are prepared for, and reviewed by,
Management. During a conflict, staff members develop a
detailed knowledge base on the changing situation and
create an analytical framework for postconflict response.
When possible, missions are fielded to conduct needs
assessments and an interim country strategy and program
(CSP) is prepared for providing
emergency assistance. Assistance is
extended for both natural and humanmade disasters, with the natural
claiming over 90% of the total
disbursed to date. In the past,
emergency loans were concentrated on
infrastructure rehabilitation.

Comparative advantage

ADB's database of knowledge about
DMCs in the Asia and Pacific region
positions it to act quickly and
efficiently in postconflict situations. Its
regularly updated in-house database on
each DMC is supplemented by its worldwide network of
resident missions and offices (see the Knowledge and
Support Activities chapter). Through its country economic
reviews (CERs) and CSPs, ADB learns lessons that can be
internalized and disseminated to its development partners.
These instruments, along with annual CSP updates, provide
a picture of each DMC and enable the rapid articulation of
an emergency response should it be required.

Ways MDBs could respond to emergencies in DMCs
include streamlining the production of knowledge
instruments and emergency preparedness programs;
monitoring reports; and conducting needs assessments
and environmental and social assessments prior to
formulating transitional assistance strategies (see
Box on page 16).

Operational flexibility

Speed is crucial to a successful postconflict response.
ADB's knowledge base allows it to respond rapidly and
effectively when opportunities for providing aid arise. A
rapid response requires flexibility over a range of areas,
including mobilizing staff and budgetary resources and
interpreting administrative procedures. The existing
emergency policies provide for some latitude in
decreasing the time involved in project and program
processing cycles. This flexibility is extended to fund flow
and payment systems to enable rapid disbursements of
committed capital.

Operational and administrative flexibility, combined
with the ability to undertake rapid assessments prior to
formulating an intervention strategy, has enabled ADB to
effectively address diverse conflict situations in Cambodia,
Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste, among others.
Further streamlining procedures and softening loan terms
could be elements of an emergency policy.

The reconstruction process is long and complex. The
difficult decisions made by the government in the early
stages will impact on the future of the nation and its ability
to remain peaceful. ADB and other funding agencies
provide the government in this situation with financial and
technical support, which, in turn, signifies the international
community's confidence and commitment to rebuilding the
country, its institutions, and infrastructure.

Political stability is central to postconflict reconstruction and must be assured by the ruling authorities. As ADB
learned in Cambodia (see Box on Cambodia on page 17),
early reconstruction assistance is as much about building
partnerships with the government as it is about providing
aid. The relationships formed early on will facilitate
implementation in the long term.

Economic growth can be expected to be rapid in the
initial years of peace, before returning to levels that
more accurately reflect the country’s situation. To
capitalize on this growth, assistance should peak in the
first postconflict year, and should focus on strengthening
the government’s absorptive capacity. Further allocations
would depend on the availability of concessional funds
and aid effectiveness.

Countries emerging from conflict in recent years have
been able to take advantage of the ongoing revolution in
transport and information and communication technology,
allowing them to regain more quickly the economic
strengths and capabilities lost or destroyed by conflict. This
may allow them to extend the initial period of high growth.
In this case, the approach used by the funding agencies to
implement postconflict assistance would differ. It requires a
commitment to maintain assistance at a relatively high

level for a longer period and to focus such support toward
creating the capacity necessary to take advantage of new
technologies. This pattern of aid and expected growth
would imply a much greater impact on ADB's central
objective of poverty reduction.

Financing reconstruction

As a premier regional financial institution, ADB has
committed relatively large sums to the reconstruction of
postconflict DMCs as of 2002:

* Cambodia, $122.7 million;

¢ — Philippines, $192 million;

¢ Solomon Islands, $10.5 million;

« — Sri Lanka, $84 million;

¢ — Tajikistan, $28.6 million; and

* Timor-Leste, $8.7 million.

In addition, ADB has committed $500 million in
assistance to Afghanistan over a 30-month period from
January 2002. This represents 11% of total donor commitments to the country.

Macroeconomic and sectoral involvement

ADB's assistance to postconflict DMCs emphasizes its
catalytic role in both macroeconomic and sector development issues. To achieve macroeconomic stability, it is
important to implement both sector policies and
institutional reforms, and follow these with capital
investments. ADB has followed this pattern.

In Cambodia, for example, early assistance was geared
toward macroeconomic management, followed by
assistance for multisector rehabilitation. In Sri Lanka,
ADB's postconflict program largely supported rehabilitation
of roads, schools, petroleum storage facilities, and
community infrastructure (see Box on Sri Lanka at right).

countries. The agenda for economic

the challenge of poverty reduction

Since 1983, armed conflict between
the Sri Lankan Government and the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) has claimed more than
60,000 lives and displaced a further
700,000-800,000 people. The conflict is estimated to have cost the
equivalent of the country’s 1996
gross domestic product, and to have
lowered economic growth by 2-3%
per-year for the past 20 years.

In February 2002, the Government and the LTTEsigned cease-fire
agreements that essentially ended
daily conflict. The Government lifted
restrictions on the movement of
essential commodities into and out

Hectricity was restored in the major

ADB has accumulated rich experiences in postconflict reconstruction through its activities in
Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Timor-Leste

opportunities are broad-based,
addressing the narrow base of economic growth, and achieving fair distribution of the benefits of growth.
_ ADBhas approved 10 loans to
Tajikistan totaling $173 million. The
loans cover postconflict rehabilitation, road and power sector reform,
agriculture sector support, emergency assistance efforts, and
regional cooperation.

Support to strengthen human
and institutional capacity is key
to development, and ADB has
approved 29 technical assistance

TFET-funded projects with project
preparation and capacity building. —
A poverty assessment—undertaken by the Government, ADB,
Japan International Cooperation
Agency, United Nations Development Programme, and World
Bank—helped prepare the country’s
first National Development Plan,
released in May 2002. The Plan
includes a national poverty reduction strategy based on four elements: promoting opportunities for
the poor; improving access to basic
social services; enhancing security,
including reducing vulnerability to
shocks and improving food security;
and empowering the poor. For more
on Timor-Leste, see page 97 and
http: /www.adb.org/Timor-Leste/.(see http:/Avww.adb.org/Countries/). As ADB prepared to
resume operations in Afghanistan in 2002, it was able to
draw on these experiences and the following lessons.

Allocate significant resources for developing
institutions: Poorly performing projects are often
associated with an inappropriate policy or institutional
framework. Cambodia's policy-formulation capability could
not maximize the potential of international assistance and
external support was needed to formulate and implement
the additional policy changes required.

Sequence policy and institutional reforms
appropriately: In Tajikistan, ADB learned the importance
of sequencing policy and institutional reforms, especially
when the situation remained volatile. Early efforts were
followed by successful infrastructure rehabilitation in the
road and power sectors.

Prepare emergency loans: Lessons from Cambodia
suggest that emergency loans should exclude components
requiring long-term preparation; should adopt a process
approach to allow flexible adjustment during

Afghanistan and ADB:
a partnership renewed

ADB's return to Afghanistan after an absence of 23 years
started one cold, misty morning in February 2002. An ADB
team arrived at Kabul airport for meetings that would mark
ADB's first formal contact in the country with the ruling
Interim Administration of Afghanistan (IAA). It was a quiet
beginning to a new era of partnership.

The revival of the relationship between ADB and
Afghanistan was achieved through well-defined steps (see
Figure on page 19).

Afghanistan was a founding member of ADB, joining
in 1966. Operations began in 1969, and in 1970, the first
loan was approved. Nine loans to the country, totaling
$95.1 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF),
were approved by 1979.'' ADB focused on small- and
medium-sized agriculture and irrigation projects, and did
some work in transportation, hydropower, and vocational
education. In 1979, following the Soviet occupation of
the country, ADB suspended its operations in
Afghanistan. '?

In the more than 2 decades that passed before ADB
returned to Afghanistan, the country was devastated by
external aggression and civil war. Its economy and physical
infrastructure were in ruins; its social, political, and ethnic
fabric destroyed. The destructive impact of Soviet
aggression, civil war, and the brutally repressive Taliban
regime was aggravated in the late 1990s by 4 years of
drought, which seriously affected agricultural, horticultural,
and livestock production. For all practical purposes, the
economy came to a standstill. Production, consumption,
trade, savings, investment, and capital accumulation either
collapsed or fell to very low levels. Between 1998 and
2002, per capita gross national product declined an
estimated 35% to about $205.

'l ADB also provided technical assistance grants totaling $2.5 million.
12 all outstanding loans were canceled and disbursements stopped.

20 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

In December 2001, with the signing of the Bonn
Agreement, power in the country was vested in the IAA,
which quickly proclaimed its desire to revive the nation’s
economy and restore peace and stability. The Afghan
people have shown a strong commitment to take control of
their destiny and transform their land into a well-governed
country focused on reconstruction and spreading prosperity
to all Afghans.

They face three formidable challenges: They must
answer the human costs of decades of fighting; they must
establish a viable peace; and they must develop the
administrative and political capacity needed to run a modern
state. The reconstruction of Afghanistan will test its people
and the will of the international community. It will also be a
testing ground for the latest thinking and theory on the best
way to establish a close and continuous connection between
humanitarian assistance and reconstruction.

Postconflict rebuilding

Ensuring country leadership

A broad-based political authority, the IAA was established
in December 2001 following the Bonn Agreement. It was
agreed that Afghan men and women at the national,
provincial, local, and grassroots levels should be involved
in and lead the reconstruction process in all stages, from
planning to implementation. Afghan ownership is crucial to
the success of rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts.

ADB, as a partner in the international coalition for the
reconstruction of Afghanistan, worked closely with the
Government in developing an approach to postconflict
assistance that is largely driven by the country itself. The
Government is deeply committed to promoting a lasting
peace-building process, which will be the bedrock for all
future work. Without government support, rehabilitation
and reconstruction efforts will yield little in improving the
well-being of the Afghan people.

At the International Conference on Reconstruction
Assistance to Afghanistan in Tokyo on 21-22 January 2002,
the IAA presented its vision of a prosperous and secure
Afghanistan that would contribute to the prosperity of its
trading partners and increase regional stability. The IAA
intends to build a credible state with an efficient and
transparent government accountable to Afghan citizens and
the international community. The IAA stressed the
importance of building a vibrant and competitive private
sector and a well-developed civil society with democratic
institutions. The IAA identified key outcomes for the
reconstruction program, including political stability and
security, access to basic services, an adequate standard of
living for the people, economic growth—and, in the longer
term—independence from foreign aid.

Building a new identity

Postconflict reconstruction is predicated on building
institutions and infrastructure to bind people together and
infuse country leadership with meaning. What does this
mean for Afghanistan?Zz

NGOS IN AFGHANISTAN

 

Women are returning to work outside the home and girls are back in
school. These are symbols of anew
beginning—a new era of opportunity for women in Afghanistan.

During the Taliban rule, women
could not work outside the home
and girls could not attend school.
Now they actively participate in government and civil society. But equality remains a far way off. In the
Government, women head 2 of the
29 ministries. There are four women
deputy ministers, five female generals, and two commissioners on the
nine-member panel drafting the
constitution.

Despite this progress, the number of women employees in government offices has not reached
pre-Taliban levels. Indeed, most
Afghan women remain bound by
traditional practices, limited rights,
and economic hardship.

The Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are
working to change attitudes and
promote women’s status. The new
Ministry of Women’s Affairs seeks

Nongovernment organizations
(NGOs) have worked in Afghanistan
and in support of Afghan refugees
abroad for more than 20 years. As
of mid-2002, more than 400 groups
were active in the country, including
some 280 local organizations.
Together, they administered an
estimated $125 million in relief aid
in 2001. That figure may exceed
$200 million in 2002.

NGOs support projects in a
wide range of sectors, including
agriculture, construction, education,
immunization, health, income generation, mining, relief and repatriation, community and social work,
veterinary services, and water and
sanitation.

to advance women’s status and
improve their welfare on a longterm sustainable basis.

During the Taliban rule, NGOs
helped women in various areas,
including health and livelihood.
Many of these efforts are being
carried out now in cooperation
with the Government. There are
over 30 NGOs in Kabul alone
working to create opportunities for
women to gain or improve vocational skills and commence or
restart their education. Although
many are underfunded, NGO
projects are helping. The number
of health facilities for women is
increasing, and small-scale job
creation programs have begun.

ADB recognizes that women
are vital to the rehabilitation,
reconstruction, and reconciliation
of societies. The Government's
National Development Framework
(NDF) recognizes that national
development could not be achieved
without the input of women in
policies and resource allocation and
without specific programs for

NGOs provide crucial assistance to refugees and populations
in remote areas, and successfully
filled the gap when political circumstances prevented multilateral and
bilateral activities inside the country. Many have long experience in
Afghanistan and their deep understanding of local needs and culture
enables them to provide fast and
effective aid.

In March 2002, ADB contributed to the design of the World
Bank’s Community Block Grants
Project. This community-based,
grant-funding mechanism aims to
provide a framework for local governance and institutional development to support local action, to

women. “All programs must pay special attention to gender, and not
include it as an afterthought. We
have to engage in a societal dialogue
to enhance the opportunities of
women and improve cooperation
between men and women on the
basis of our culture, the experience
of other Islamic countries, and the
global norms of human rights.” '

Women’s empowerment is an
integral part of ADB efforts in
Afghanistan. The Kandahar-Spin
Boldak road rehabilitation project,
for example, includes livelihood
training and credit facilities to create
income-generating activities for
home-based returning women
refugees. Nutrition and child care
will also be offered. Support to
community-based basic education
will promote the education of girls.
The challenge of improving the
status of Afghan women is enormous and success will require the
continued support of development
partners.

Also, NGOs are involved in
ADB technical assistance activities
that provide advisors, equipment
and supplies, repair and maintenance of offices, as well as training to ADB counterpart agencies

Establishing priorities

Rehabilitation and reconstruction activities were carried out
sporadically at first, with NGOs, bilateral donors, and UN
agencies undertaking small-scale rehabilitation work mostly
outside the national budget process. Funds pledged at the
Tokyo conference were used primarily for relief operations.
Following the presentation of its ordinary budget in April
2002, the Afghan Government had to regroup and augment
its capacity to prepare a development budget that could
capture all rehabilitation activities and their financing. Much
of the Government's time was spent seeking funds for relief
and reconstruction: the budget deficit of $244 million was
met without resorting to deficit financing.

ADB and other development partners welcomed the
IAA's initiative to consolidate its leadership role in
reconstruction and development, and more specifically in

and create a viable private sector for
sustainable, pro-poor growth.

_ Afghanistan’s 25 million people

basic services and emergency relief.

to explore a more coordinated role

mong the displaced;

 

aid coordination. To streamline both areas and claim full
Afghan ownership of the nation’s destiny, the IAA
established, through a decree issued by its Chairman, the
Afghanistan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA).!> A
point of reference for dialogue, discussion, debate, and
path finding was thus established.

The Government also recognized the importance of
creating a development framework to lay out the direction
for policy and institutional changes, and underlying
national objectives, goals, and priorities. In preparing the
NDF, the Government drew on the information contained in
the preliminary needs assessment prepared by ADB, UNDP,
and World Bank; and the comprehensive needs assessments for the agriculture, transport, education, and
environment sectors prepared by ADB, as the lead agency,
and other development partners. The Government
presented the NDF at the First Meeting of the Implementation Group in Kabul in April 2002.

NDF: The goal of the NDF is to provide a strategic
plan for the development of Afghanistan, around which all
players can unite to address poverty and provide economic
opportunities through a series of concrete programs and
projects. The NDF is based on five principles.

¢ The development strategy must be domestically
owned, with the Government in the driver's seat.

¢ Markets and the private sector are more effective
instruments than the state in delivering sustained growth.

¢ Aid cannot be effective without the state investing
in human capital and without an institutional framework
that allows the rule of law to prevail.

¢ Sustainable economic growth requires the active
participation of the population.

« Externally funded investments must be anchored
in the Government's development program to be successful
over the longer term.

18 According to the decree, the primary activities of the AACA include
(i) coordinating funds, agencies, and technical assistance; (ii) developing
an information system for monitoring and evaluating programs;
(iii) establishing financial control and procurement systems; and
(iv) directly managing a limited portfolio of national programs.

The NDF focuses on three pillars of development:
promoting security and human development, rebuilding
physical infrastructure, and enabling the creation of a
viable private sector as the engine for sustainable and
inclusive economic growth (see Box on page 25). Restoring
security and reestablishing law and order, administrative
and financial reform, and gender equity are crosscutting
priorities. The key short-term challenges and priorities are
to quickly establish basic security for the population,
revitalize agriculture, facilitate private economic activity,
and rebuild infrastructure and social services.

CSP: These elements were at the foundation of the
initial country strategy and program (CSP) for Afghanistan,
endorsed by ADB's Board of Directors on 28 May 2002,
paving the way for the approval of a $187 million
emergency assistance package (including $15.1 million
in technical assistance and $22 million in grants) to
Afghanistan in 2002. For more on these grants,
see Box on page 141 in the Management's Discussion
and Analysis chapter.

24 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

 

ADB's initial CSP is designed to assist the Government
in rehabilitation and reconstruction to ensure a seamless
transition from humanitarian relief to reconstruction and
development assistance. In a daylong visit to Kabul in early
April 2002, ADB President Tadao Chino discussed elements
of ADB’s assistance strategy with the authorities, including
the IAA Chairman.

The initial CSP identified transport as a key sector for
ADB assistance, along with education, agriculture, and
environment. ADB has taken the lead in these sectors;
however, it will also provide major assistance for
rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts in health, energy,
rural development, and finance. The transitional Government's priorities are fully reflected in ADB's 2003 proposed
assistance program, consisting of capacity-building
technical assistance and a program loan.

Monitoring early achievements

Early indicators show improvements in the macroeconomic picture, although it remains far from normal oroptimal. Production is increasing and agricultural
production, especially wheat, is projected to be well
above levels in 2002. Small-scale industrial, trade, and
commercial activities have gained momentum. In secure
areas like Kabul and other major cities, a miniconstruction boom is under way. Transport and services
including hotels, restaurants, and others are expanding.
Healthy markets have developed in Kabul, Kandahar, and
other areas for used or reconditioned cars imported from
the Gulf area and Pakistan. Small private sector activities
are thriving while large private initiatives, both domestic
and foreign, seem to be lagging behind, primarily due

to inadequate financial resources and lingering

concerns about security.

The Government drafted a new “Law on Domestic and
Foreign Private Investment in Afghanistan,” addressing tax
waivers, land leasing, transfer of capital and profits, share
transactions, banking, seizure and confiscation, and dispute
resolution. The Government has successfully floated a new
Afghan currency, the new afghani, which has had a
stabilizing influence on prices and exchange rates.
Kabul’s consumer price index declined about 3% in
December 2002, reversing increases in previous months.
The exchange rate appreciated from 59.8 new afghanis
per US dollar in November 2002, to 50.8 in December
2002, and 46.0 in January 2003. For more on Afghanistan’s
economy, see page 101 of the Country Reports chapter
and the Asian Development Outlook 2003 at http://www.
adb.org/publications/.

The Government is maintaining and strengthening
this momentum by developing a coherent budgetary
process and improving government-led aid coordination.

 

The National Development Budget (NDB) of about

$3.2 billion for 2002-2004, presented by the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) on 12-13 October 2002, has five
objectives.

¢ Develop the capacities of the public administration for good governance.

¢ Accelerate reconstruction of basic infrastructure
and services.

¢ Accelerate economic growth as the precursor to
any policy for poverty reduction.

¢ Improve economic competitiveness and reduce
national and household vulnerability to economic shocks.

« Extend access to basic services such as education
and health.

The NDB translates the priorities of the NDF into
programs and projects!’ while simultaneously providing a
vehicle for policy development. It provides an outline
of ongoing and proposed investments for 2002-2004'§
and consolidates investments under national development programs.

14 The national development programs under pillar 1 include (i) returnees
and internally displaced persons, (ii) education and vocational training,
(iii) health and nutrition, (iv) livelihoods and social protection, and
(v) cultural heritage, media, and sports; under pillar 2 include (i) transport, (ii) energy, mining, and telecommunications, (iii) natural resource
management, and (iv) urban management; and under pillar 3 include
(i) trade and investment, (ii) public administration and economic man
agement, and (iii) justice, security, and rule of law. The national priority
subprograms are (i) education infrastructure, (ii) solidarity program and
emergency public works, (iii) transport, (iv) water resource investment,

(v) urban infrastructure, and (vi) governance infrastructure.
'5 The Ministry of Finance presented a new National Development Budget
for 2003-2005 at a donors’ meeting in Kabul in March 2003.

PRIVATE SECTOR

The Interim Administration of
Afghanistan (IAA) recognizes the
importance of the private sector as
the engine of economic growth.
However, during rehabilitation
and reconstruction, and while an
enabling environment is being
created for the private sector, the
Government expects to play a lead
role. Agricultural markets are largely
managed by private operators and
this should continue, with the Government providing policy, institutional, and infrastructure support.

The private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) can
play an important role in rural
finance. Improved land titling will
help develop land, labor, and capital markets in rural areas.

In the nonfarm industry and
informal sectors, private small- and

medium-scale enterprises can create
employment opportunities that are
beyond the capacity of the Government. Gas production and distribution as well as exploitation of other
minerals need to be opened up to
private investments on a competitive basis. The same is true of fuel
and electricity supply. The private
sector could participate in the
development of hydroelectric
resources; distribution of electricity
to towns, cities, and rural communities; and repair and creation of
fuel storage facilities, bottling
facilities, and distribution outlets.
The Government plans to open
up the energy and infrastructure
sectors to private investment and
to establish an appropriate policy
and regulatory framework. NGOs
are involved in urban water supply

and sanitation. Private companies
could provide urban services, with
the public sector providing investment support.

Private provision of health
care services, including private
clinics and pharmacies, will be
more efficient in serving the
public. Market-based health care
delivery may have to be supplemented by affordable basic
health care delivery by the public
sector and NGOs. Nationwide, a
community-based approach to the
delivery of infrastructure services
in rural areas would be welcome.
Finally, the private sector is likely
to take the lead in investment and
service expansion in the telecommunications sector, assuming that
a policy and regulatory framework
is developed quickly.

preconditions for reconstruction

Ensuring security

Security in Afghanistan is essential not only for efficient
humanitarian action, but also for rebuilding the country:
without assured security and stability, further progress will
be seriously compromised. Security in both Kabul and
outside the city remains tenuous, and the Government's
grip on the country as a whole is not as strong as had
been hoped for at this stage. Warlords continue to exercise
power in their areas of influence and indulge in factional
fighting. In Kabul, the 4,800-strong International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF), first under British, then Turkish,
and now German and Dutch leadership, has been a power
for peace and stability.

Security and stability will, however, continue to be a
problem as long as warlords retain their own armed forces.
This point was highlighted by the Government in October
2002 and was an important theme of the Wilton Park
Conference in London in the same month. On its first
anniversary, the Government issued an appeal to the
international community for assistance in disarming the
warlords.'¢

The process of disarming the population has also been
painfully slow. Although the Government comprises ethnic
factions and is holding together, there is ample evidence of
widespread serious factional tensions. Efforts are under way
to establish rule of law, bring provincial and local authorities
under central control, build a national army and a police
force, and extend the tenure and expand the role of the ISAF.

Another issue closely linked to security is the illegal
production, trade, and consumption of opium. In January
2002, the Government issued a decree banning poppy
cultivation. Two other decrees have been issued since
then—one in April 2002 outlining an eradication program
and another in September 2002 for enforcing the ban on
cultivating, producing, abusing, and trafficking drugs. But,
according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, 3,400 tons
of opium were produced in Afghanistan in 2002.'7

Facing the political challenges:
constitution and elections

Stability in Afghanistan is contingent upon the establishment of secure political processes. The country has not
held an election since the 1970s, neither has a national
census been undertaken. The current Government has been
charged with two key tasks that will shape the nation’s
future: writing a new constitution and preparing for
national elections in 2004. A Constitution Commission has
started work on the new constitution but progress has

16 at a conference in Tokyo in February 2003, donor nations pledged an
additional $50.7 million toward a UN-backed program to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate Afghanistan's fighters.

'7 The 2002 opium production was on 74,000 hectares in five provinces
(Badakshan, Helmand, Kandahar, Nangarhar, and Uruzgan). Although
less than the peak production of 4,600 tons in 1999, the 2002 production
level was well above that in 2001, when production plunged to 185 tons
following a strict ban on poppy cultivation by the Taliban regime.

been slow. Concern has been raised over whether a draft
document and election preparations will be completed by
the end of the 24-month term of the Government, which
began following the Emergency Loya Jirga, a grand council
of Afghan political and tribal leaders, in June 2002.

As it works toward these goals, the Government must
also proceed with a third crucial task—that of extending
civilian authority over the entire country.

Three political parameters are essential to the
rehabilitation and reconstruction process:

* — accepting the supremacy of the central Government;

* creating conditions for political plurality and
democracy without external interference; and

¢ — improving the capacity and efficiency of the
Government to provide political leadership.

Establishing a durable political balance will require
further progress in developing democratic institutions,
creation of a framework for equitable power sharing
among ethnic groups, and agreement on an acceptable
relationship between the central Government and the
provinces. These issues will shape the fundamental
character of the new constitution.

Preparations for Afghanistan’s first elections in over
20 years are progressing slowly. A census is being planned
with assistance from the UN Population Fund. A key
element in election planning is the development of a
smooth succession plan. For the donor community's
contributions to be used effectively beyond humanitarian
aid, a workable balance must be struck among all
conflicting parties in the country. Without that balance,
time and resources will be wasted and the suffering of the
Afghan people will continue.

Cooperating regionally

Afghanistan's reconstruction must be viewed in a regional
context. Peace, stability, and prosperity in Afghanistan
could be a catalyst for rapprochement or closer bonds
between its neighbors such as Iran and Pakistan, or India
and Pakistan, and between any one of these countries and
the Central Asian republics.

Pakistan is a main trading partner of Afghanistan, and
reexports to Pakistan through unofficial channels form an
important component of total trade. It is clear that an open
trading regime and deeper subregional integration would
have many advantages for Afghanistan and its partners
(see Box on regional cooperation at right). Afghanistan may
consider entering into mutual trade agreements with
neighboring countries such as Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and to allow the free
movement of goods and services and implementation of a
common external tariff system. In exploring the option of
greater subregional cooperation in trade, the complementary and competitive nature of production among
participant countries should be considered. A process of
harmonization and convergence of policies and strategies
would help remove constraints to growth and development,
allowing each participating economy to reach its production potential. The aim would be to improve the competitive efficiency of each country. Regional trade will befostered by regional cooperation in transport initiatives and
resource management and development.

ADB has identified projects in the transport, power,
and energy sectors for possible assistance, including a
1,600-kilometer natural gas pipeline project from
Turkmenistan to Pakistan through Afghanistan. A technical
assistance project in support of the pipeline is now
under way.

Setting the policy and institutional framework

ADB is working to see that an appropriate policy and
institutional framework is in place in Afghanistan to
support investments in rehabilitation and reconstruction.

The governance, policy, and institutional frameworks
necessary for a well-functioning economy must be
established urgently. This is imperative for significant
investment in Afghanistan's reconstruction, and for
stimulating confidence among private investors, both
domestic and foreign, to participate in development
opportunities. Transparency, accountability, community
participation, and the rule of law are the basis for good
governance, which must be established at all levels of
government. Policy reforms are needed to help mobilize
resources and ensure their productive use. Substantial
institutional capacity building is necessary to ensure
effective reconstruction and development of the economy
and social systems.

Toward reconstruction:
financing the transition

Coordinating the response

Aid coordination on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
Afghanistan has been intense. In late 2001, several

 

international conferences were held to ensure that donor
activities would avoid duplication and waste.

During these meetings, the Afghanistan Support Group
(ASG),'® founded in 1996 by the 15 largest donor countries
and the European Union, emerged as an important Afghan
advocacy group. The ASG contributes to reconciliation,
social and economic development, and sustainable peace
and progress in Afghanistan. It is focused on improving
coordination between donors and promoting human rights
in aid initiatives, thereby laying a foundation for urgently
needed reconstruction.

The Afghanistan Reconstruction Steering Group (ARSG,
also known as SG) was established'? to provide policy
guidance for Afghanistan's reconstruction. It created an
Implementation Group (IG), which served as the primary
umbrella for coordination among funding agencies until the
Consultative Group (CG) mechanism took charge.?°

A Senior Officials’ Meeting in Washington, DC, in
November 2001 requested ADB, UNDP, and World Bank to

18 The members are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, United
Kingdom, and United States.

'9 It was established at the Senior Officials’ Meeting on Reconstruction
Assistance to Afghanistan on 20 November 2001. The European Union,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, and United States are the cochairs of the SG.

20 The IAA chairs the IG. ADB, the Islamic Development Bank, UNDP, World
Bank, and the ASG Chair (currently Norway) act as vice-chairs. The IG
was mandated to prioritize requirements identified by the ongoing needs
assessments; monitor the coherence of aid activities within an integrated
reconstruction framework, and seek to prevent overlaps or gaps; identify
logistical and policy shortcomings in program execution; suggest potential solutions and seek political guidance from the SG as necessary; and
inform the SG of the progress and issues related to the program. The IG
participants include all bilateral and multilateral assistance agencies
directly involved in Afghanistan, including neighboring states; Afghan
official representatives as determined by the IAA and its successors;
representation from the international and domestic NGO community; and
a UN representative nominated by the UN Secretary-General’s Special
Representative to Afghanistan.

Afghanistan is central to the promotion of regional trade and commerce. For several thousand years
up to the 16'" century, Afghanistan
was a meeting ground: a route for
trade and the communication of
ideas, religions, and skills between
Europe and the Middle East, and the
People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
the Far East. With the advent of
commercial shipping, which proved
safer and cheaper than trade over
land, the region lost its geographic
importance and turned inward.
Afghanistan’s isolation deepened in the 19" century with the
industrialization of Europe and the
partial de-industrialization of Asia.
In the mid-20"" century, the country
acted as a buffer between Cold War
groups. Isolation and occupation of

the country in 1979 prevented
implementation of the planned
Asian-Eurasian East-West highways
envisaged to connect Europe and
Turkey with Southeast Asia and the
PRC through Central Asia.

The collapse of the Soviet
Union, the emergence of Central
Asian republics, the defeat of the
Taliban, and the subsequent
assumption of power of the present
Afghan administration, should allow
the country to resume its central role
in regional economic cooperation.

Afghanistan could potentially
engage in regional cooperation in
trade, energy, power, transportation, agriculture, mining and industry, and water resources.

Essential to realizing greater
benefits from regional cooperation

is rehabilitation of Afghanistan's
road infrastructure, harmonization
of customs systems, and rationalization of existing transit trade
agreements.

The Government has demonstrated interest in reactivating
Afghanistan’s role in regional cooperation. With help from ADB, it is
reviving road linkswith Turkmenistan
and Uzbekistan in the north, and
Pakistan in the southeast. Ongoing
rehabilitation of damaged transmission linesin the northern power grid
will enable imports of power from
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
Transit rights are being negotiated
for the proposed TurkmenistanAfghanistan-Pakistan natural gas
pipeline. Cross-border trade facilitation initiatives are also under way.

Reconstruction Steering Group Ministerial Pledging
Conference held in Tokyo on 21-22 January 2002.

ADB stated in late 2001 that its assistance program to
Afghanistan would evolve in full partnership with the
Afghan people and in full collaboration with other
international financial institutions and international
agencies. In preparing the preliminary needs assessment,
ADB worked closely with UNDP and the World Bank, and

participated in extensive consultations with Afghans, NGOs,

and UN agency staff experienced in and familiar with
Afghanistan. Staff of the three institutions also traveled to
Kabul to consult with the Government.

Assessing preliminary needs

The preliminary needs assessment presented at the
Ministerial Pledging Conference provided the basis for the
international community’s pledge of $4.5 billion in
development assistance around agreed sector priorities
and policy and institutional frameworks. ADB pledged
$500 million in highly concessional loans and grants over a
30-month period ending 30 June 2004. It was agreed at the
conference that comprehensive needs assessments of all
key sectors would follow to put sector development plans
on a firmer footing. ADB acted as the lead agency for the
assessments of the agriculture, transport, education, and
environment sectors.

28 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

In-depth consultations were held with the IAA in
preparing the comprehensive needs assessments. The Government expressed concern that the process and the outcome
were largely supply-driven and that government involvement
was not optimized. The Government also perceived that
work on the assessments had pulled scarce human
resources away from formulating projects and programs for
immediate implementation. The contribution made by the
assessments in providing for sector development frameworks—including policy and institutional frameworks—was,
according to ADB, important for immediate implementation
and long-term sector plans and should be valued.

Establishing the mechanism

The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) was
conceived in December 2001 to provide a coordinated
financing mechanism for the Government's operating and
development budget, including investment projects and
programs in priority sectors. The ARTF is an important
multidonor initiative designed to

* promote transparency and accountability of
reconstruction assistance;

¢ help reinforce the national budget as the vehicle
to align the reconstruction program with national
objectives;

« reduce the burden on limited government capacity
while promoting capacity building over time; and¢ help fund the recurrent budgetary expenditures
required for the Government to function effectively.

The ARTF covers salaries, nonproject technical
assistance, operation and maintenance, and other recurrent
costs, including interest payments in the IAA’s budget;
relatively small unfunded investment activities and
programs, including quick-impact recovery projects;
contributions to reconstruction by Afghan experts residing
abroad; and in-country training programs for Afghans. The
fund is administered by the World Bank, which carries
overall fiduciary responsibility. ADB, together with the
Islamic Development Bank, UNDP, and World Bank are
members of the management committee, which is
responsible for determining resource allocations in
consultation with the Government. The key principle
guiding ARTF financing is its response to country
requirements as articulated by the Government. A
monitoring agent has been appointed by the World Bank to
ensure proper fiduciary management.

The ARTF has grown rapidly, with pledges topping
$376 million by 22 countries. This has exceeded expectations, but remains short of Afghanistan's needs. Of these
pledges, paid-in contributions totaled $184 million as of
7 March 2003. Disbursements have picked up in recent
months, with cumulative disbursements reaching over
$114 million or 63% of total paid-in contributions as of
7 March 2003. Disbursements are expected to reach
$147 million by the end of the Afghan fiscal year on
21 March 2003. Seven ARTF investment projects have
been approved, for a total commitment of $48.6 million.7!

Despite a slow start, commitments for the Government'’s operating budget have increased significantly and, to
a large extent, closed the government deficit, with the ARTF
serving as the main instrument for funding recurrent costs.

During its first 10 months, the ARTF has shown its
capacity to disburse funds throughout the country in
support of the national operating budget and to account for
these expenditures, with progressive improvements in
documentation and timeliness. Early indications suggest
that the same is likely to be true for the development
budget. Based on these encouraging early results, the
Government has requested a major increase in donor
contributions to the ARTF.

The Government intends to use the ARTF as the
primary funding mechanism for moving forward.” This
reflects its view that the National Development Budget
should be the central instrument for policy and resource
allocation, implying a high premium on coordinated
financing instruments that provide resources to and
through the budget. The Government sees the ARTF as a
source of funds for providing services, and it is deemed
effective by Afghan citizens in helping build a legitimate
and sustainable state. The Government also sees the

21 The seven projects include salaries of police officers (two projects totaling $4.9 million), Feasibility Study Fund ($8.0 million), National Emergency Employment Program ($25.4 million), Microfinance Project
($1.0 million), Chief Financial Officers Project ($9.0 million), and Telecommunications Microwave Link to Pakistan ($0.3 million).

?2 Letter to donors dated 25 February 2003 from the Government.

 

ARTF as a capacity-building instrument. In line with this,
the Government proposes to sharply increase donor
contributions to the ARTF to about $600 million for the
fiscal year ending 21 March 2004, including about

$200 million to cover recurrent costs and an estimated
$400 million for investment projects, expatriate Afghans,
and training. (Preliminary estimates suggest that the
operating budget will be about $500 million, with domestic
revenues around $200 million, and external financing of
security expenditure at $100 million, leaving a deficit of
$200 million to be covered by the ARTF.) Compared with
the current level of pledges for the year to 31 March
2004 (approximately $156 million as of 7 March 2003),
the ARTF has a funding gap in relation to the Government's request of about $450 million.

In addition to the ARTF, the Government intends to
use the National Development Budget as a planning tool
for mobilizing both domestic and external resources. This
budget will remain the central instrument for policy and
institutional reform, and for coordinating aid resources. The
Government has expressed strong views on assistance
modalities, and wants each donor to focus on three sectors
to achieve greater effectiveness. The Government also
perceives the sector focus as necessary to avoid stretching
the capacity of the funding agencies.

ADB appreciates the Government's desire for ADB to
focus on the transport, energy, and agriculture and natural
resource management sectors. How this policy might
affect ongoing and planned ADB support for Afghanistan’s social sectors is not known. ADB was the lead
agency in preparing the comprehensive needs assessment
for education, and several grant-financed activities are
planned and under implementation. In addition, the
interim CSP envisaged several loan-financed operations
during 2003 and 2004. The Government is apparently
favorably disposed to ADB continuing its existing grant
programs in health and education, despite strong
reservations on borrowing for social sector investments.
Dialogue with the Government will continue.

Limiting donor activities to three sectors is intended to
maximize the benefits of assistance while achieving better
coordination. The Government created a new consultative
group as an institutional counterpart for aid coordination
that is linked closely to the budget process. The national
budget will be planned, financed, and implemented within
the CGs. This CG structure (see page 24) will be led by the
Government. The Government has established local level
donor-government CGs, covering national development
programs with one designated donor acting as the focal
point for each group. An annual forum will review the
progress of the previous year, discuss the budget for the
coming year, and outline national priority areas and
policy objectives.”

In addition, the Government has established
crosscutting donor-government advisory groups for gender,

23 The first meeting of the CG, the Afghan Development Forum, was held
in Kabul in March 2003.

Resources for education are limited
in Afghanistan. And with the lifting of Taliban restrictions on girls
attending school, demand for learning opportunities is rising fast.

About 900,000 students
attended school under the Taliban
regime, and donors expected that
number to rise to 1.5 million in 2002
under the new Government. Instead,
3 million students enrolled. Donors
now expect 4 million children to be
in school by the end of 2002.

Their needs span the full range
of formal education, nonformal
education, and skills training.
Classes are now made up of students
of varying levels of skills and ages.
During the conflict, some children
attended nongovernment organization (NGO)-run schools in Pakistan,
others went to government schools
in Iran. And many, especially girls,
had no opportunity to study.

As these children return to
classes, their desire to learn is hindered by the limitations of devastated infrastructure. Afghanistan
has about 5,000 schools, two
thirds of which require reconstruction or major repairs. Many
schools lack a water source or
toilets. To teach at least 3 million
students, more than 7,500 schools
are needed.

The needs go beyond physical infrastructure. Teachers have
not been trained for some time,
particularly women who were
prevented from working during
the Taliban regime. Qualified new
teachers will remain scarce in coming years as most teacher training
institutions have been damaged or
destroyed. Schools are seriously
underresourced in terms of facilities, equipment, teaching-learning
materials, and supplies. The cost

of education reconstruction has
been estimated at more than
$1 billion over 10 years, excluding
annual recurrent costs.

To support the rehabilitation of
the system, ADB, in coordination
with its development partners, is
helping build professional capacity
at the Ministry of Education and the
Ministry of Higher Education to
improve training, planning, and
management activities. ADB is also
implementing a community-based
basic education project.

Afghanistan’s expectations for
an improved school system are high.
Classrooms crowded with eager
boys and girls represent early
success in the drive for better
education. Now the Government
and donors must work to keep these
children in school by providing
accessible, secure, and quality
education.

 

environment, humanitarian affairs, and human rights, with
one donor acting as the focal point for each group. ADB
has been designated as the focal point for two national
programs (transport and natural resource management),
and one crosscutting area (environment). ADB is also a
donor member of two other CGs—energy, mining, and
telecommunications; and public administration and
economic management—and is actively engaged in the
proceedings of the CGs.

Borrowing

The Government favors obtaining flexible financing to
undertake complex reforms in key economic sectors.
Accordingly, ADB approved in December 2002 a $150 million Postconflict Multisector Program loan. By accepting
the loan, the Government demonstrated its determination
to carry forward policy and institutional reforms vital for
long-term sustainable growth. Rapid economic recovery
depends on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of
infrastructure and its efficient and environmentally sound
management. With this in view, the program loan
focuses on three sectors—governance and finance,
transport, and energy.

The program loan is a milestone in cooperation
among the Government, ADB, IMF, and World Bank; and
the governments of Italy, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom,
and others in arranging clearance of Afghanistan’s arrears
with ADB prior to loan approval.

The Government of Afghanistan has been reluctant to
borrow funds for financing the budget gap or reconstruction, maintaining that these should be financed through
grants. Also, the Government believes that social sector

30 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

activities should be funded from bilateral and multilateral
grant resources. The Government and ADB have agreed,
however, that while ADB will do its part to increase
grant financing in its total assistance to Afghanistan, the
bulk of aid will be provided through highly concessional
loans. ADB's Postconflict Multisector Program loan
carries an extended repayment period of 40 years,
including a 10-year grace period. The interest rate is

1% per annum and the interest charge during the grace
period will be capitalized, implying that no payment on
the loan to ADB will be required until 2011.74 Efforts to
convince the Government of the benefits of borrowing,
taking into account the full range of debt sustainability
issues, are ongoing.

Toward development:
setting the stage

Building capacity

Afghanistan suffers from a serious capacity gap that
hinders governance and economic management. ADB
responded to the Government's request for rapid provision
of grant assistance for capacity-building and quick-impact
projects by extending $15.1 million in technical assistance
and mobilizing $22 million in bilateral grants to finance
three innovative pilot projects in transport, education, and
health in 2002.

24 ADF loans usually have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace
period of 8 years, and carry an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during
the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.2)

ADB soperationsin postconflict situations resulted in several lessons.

General

+ Allplayersshould have a clear
mandate.

* Rehabilitation and reconstruction after a long conflict provides an opportunity to introduce
new methods of development, but
all interventions should be sensitive
to acountrysculture and traditions.

Country leadership

* Client orientation must be
strongly embedded in postconflict
operations. People should be at the
center of all operations, and the
Government should be a genuine
partner in reconstruction.

+ The strategic focus of donor
operations should be closely linked
to the Government's own strategies
and priorities, allowing synchronization of sector and government
priorities.

Security and stability

* Security and stability are preconditions for reconstruction and
development.

+ Implicit in the above isa new
paradigm establishing a nexus
among security, political stability,
and reconstruction. Reconstruction
supports and strengthens the political process and security. Government
stability should be enhanced through
capacity building.

* Central government authority must be established on all fronts
within a framework of equitable
power and resource sharing.

Regional cooperation
and development

* Regional economic cooperation should be fostered. The international community should assist the
Government in realizing its potential
for regional cooperation in trade,
energy, power, transportation, agriculture, mining and industry, and
water resources.

Aid coordination

+ Aid coordination is crucial to
avoid duplication and delays. The
responsibility for managing external

resources rests with the recipient
government, and cannot be abdicated to donors.

* The aid management entity
should be located in a core organ of
government, normally the ministry
of finance. External resources should
be integrated with domestic
resources into a single overall budget and financing program. The central aid management entity should
collate project selection decisions
and maintain a central database.

+ ADB should continue to
coordinate its activities closely with
its partners. The essence of cooperation isworking together in accordance
with the division of labor and comparative advantage of donors.

Policy and institutional
framework

* An appropriate policy and
institutional framework is required.
The Government's commitment to
the reform process must be strong.

* Sound macroeconomic
management is essential for noninflationary growth and strengthened investor confidence.

* The Government should be
assisted in formulating a comprehensive and realistic budget. Current
attempts to present ordinary and
development budgetsin Afghanistan,
for example, are moves in the right
direction. Work should start on a
medium-term expenditure framework. To the extent feasible, donor
funds should be channeled through
the budget for accountability.

* Broad-based participation in
market and democratic processes
should be fostered.

+ A balance between the private and public sectors should be
agreed.

Capacity building

+ Emphasis must be given to
capacity building to improve administration, financial management,
planning, and project design and
implementation.

* Sector ministries should be
provided additional technical assistance to enable them to contribute
to project and program formulation
and implementation.

* Funding communities must
work closely with the ministry of
finance and the central bank to
develop a viable and working payment system to facilitate funds flow.
The establishment of banks, other
financial intermediations, and credit
is essential.

* Contracts for consulting
services should engage local staff for
working with experts to build local
capacity.

Reducing risks of renewed conflict

« Risk and vulnerability analysis should be undertaken to design
mitigation measures. The structure
of risks should be identified to
establish priorities for risk reduction.
Risks associated with dominance,
deprivation, lack of participation, and
traditional enmity and misunderstanding must be addressed. Constitutional
safeguards and international guarantees may have to be considered.
Military, financial, and technical assistance are required to sustain peace.

Communications strategy

+ Aproactive communications
strategy should be developed to
manage expectations and prevent
misunderstandings.

Operational flexibility

+ Particular emphasis should
be placed on providing management support during project implementation.

+ Donors’ guidelines for procurement should be flexibly applied
to expedite procurement of equipment and services.

NGO partnership

+ NGOs can play a vital role in
rehabilitation, reconstruction, and
development. The donor-governmentNGO relationship should be close,
trusting, and complementary.

Other considerations

+ Long-term productive rehabilitation of displaced populations
should be factored into all assistance
programs.

+ Postconflict countriescan benefit greatly from recent advances in
information and other technologies.

provide long- and short-term advisors, equipment and
supplies, repair and maintenance of offices, and training
opportunities to ADB counterpart agencies in the transport,
energy, education, health, agriculture, and financial sectors.
Substantial progress is evident in strengthening the
capacity of key government and civil society institutions to
support the country’s rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Sector reviews are under way and sector plans are being
prepared. Training programs are being implemented and
visits abroad are being organized. Policy, institutional, and
investment options are also being analyzed and evaluated.
A supervisory and regulatory framework is being developed
and options for privatization of public services and private
sector development are being explored and promoted. The
technical assistance also supports basic steps toward
creating a foundation for transparent, well-functioning
public administration and finance. A
second technical assistance of $500,000
is helping the Office of Disaster
Preparedness improve readiness and
management efforts during calamities.

Two thirds of the Postconflict
Multisector Program loan was disbursed
rapidly, but implementation of pilot
projects and technical assistance grants
has been slowed by procedural delays,
security issues, and administrative and
implementation capacity. ADB is
working with the Government to
overcome these hurdles. To build local capacity, for
example, consulting services contracts should include
provisions for engaging local staff to work with experts.
Emphasis should be on providing management support
during project implementation. Guidelines for procurement
should be flexibly applied to expedite procurement of
equipment and services.

Recent advances in information and other technologies
provide Afghanistan with an opportunity to advance in
these areas. The relative proliferation of information
technology, Internet cafes, computerization, and mobile
phones in Kabul and other parts of the country testifies to
the usefulness of these new technologies. ADB supports
computerization in Afghanistan under its technical
assistance grants.

Conflict prevention

The transition from reconstruction to development can be
undone by renewed conflict. The risks of renewed conflict
can be minimized through growth and poverty reduction.
Poverty is endemic in Afghanistan. A large proportion of
the population lived below any acceptable poverty line
prior to the outbreak of civil conflict. The conflict has left

them poorer and has forced even more people into poverty.

A preliminary ADB estimate suggests about 53% of the
population live below the poverty line of $102 in annual
per capita income. Clearly, a much higher percentage live
below the $1-a-day poverty line. All donor projects,
including those financed by ADB, are aimed at addressing

the specific problems of these vulnerable groups through
rehabilitation, production, employment, and incomegeneration support.

It is important to address social issues as well. ADB
worked with its development partners to conduct an
analysis of social sectors and identify areas where
assistance would be most helpful. Basic health, nutrition,
and reproductive health of the rural poor have improved
through an innovative partnership of the Government,
NGOs, and communities in developing sustainable
community-based health care (see Box on page 23). In the
education sector, ADB supports a sustainable and
comprehensive approach to community-based, gendersensitive basic education (see Box on page 30). The longterm goal is to reduce poverty by equipping the young
people of Afghanistan, particularly girls, with education
that stimulates their self-help capacities for overcoming
poverty (see Box on page 21).

To reduce the risks of renewed
conflict, the Government must address
the situation of displaced populations
and former combatants. Both settled
and displaced populations have been
provided relief. The rehabilitation of
refugees is moving slowly, but
significant progress has been made. All
programs and projects supported by
development partners must, on a
priority basis, provide for full integration
of the displaced population into the
rehabilitation process, preferably in their places of origin. It
is not enough to create temporary employment for the
unemployed or destitute. Conditions need to be created to
generate longer-term employment and income generation
in productive pursuits.

Looking ahead

ADB completed its country strategy and program update for
Afghanistan in April 2002. In 2003-2005, an appropriate
mix of modalities of assistance could be developed, taking
into account the evolving situation in Afghanistan and the
Government's desire to achieve a balance between project
and program assistance. Drawing from the NDF and NDB,
ADB assumes it will need to meet requirements of

$600 million in concessional assistance and $58 million in
grant assistance over the period. Detailed programming is
being worked out in consultation with the Government.

In 2003, if approved, ADB could build on the progress
made in policy and institutional reforms under the
Postconflict Multisector Program loan to support an
Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction
Project (EIRRP). The validity of this sequence of actions
was proven in ADB’s operations in postconflict Tajikistan.
The main objective of the EIRRP would be to help the
Government rehabilitate and reconstruct key infrastructure
in the transport and energy sectors. The Project would
contribute to reviving economic activities across the
country, thereby providing employment and reducing
poverty, and would maximize the use of local labor andprovide equal opportunity to women. Other EIRRP
objectives would include the promotion of peace and
security, social integration and stability, regional cooperation and integration, natural resource development and
conservation, and private sector development.

The way forward: lessons from
postconflict reconstruction

Reviews of ADB emergency policies and lending over the
past decade have identified key gaps and limitations,
including the failure to fully address critical issues such as
sustainable livelihoods, weak governance, institutional
capacity, and human and social capital depletion; the need
to place greater emphasis on early warning, prevention,
mitigation, and preparedness; inadequate financing; and
the dispersed and ad hoc organizational response to
emergency assistance. ADB is drafting a comprehensive

 

emergency policy to address these concerns and strengthen
the link between postconflict operations and ADB's
overarching goal of poverty reduction.

Postconflict reconstruction is about growth and
poverty reduction to accelerate the transition from
reconstruction to development, and to minimize the risk of
resumed conflict. Achieving these goals requires developing
income-generating activities, providing safety nets, and
improving governance and institutional capacity as well as
human and social capital. Actions should be designed for
all phases of reconstruction: conflict prevention, transition,
and emergency recovery.

Throughout these phases, ADB must continue to act
as catalyst in helping its members in postconflict situations
to address the human costs of conflict, to establish and
maintain security, and to develop a political process that
enables the country to move forward with confidence as it
builds a brighter future for its people.

fundamental to the process of reducing poverty.

OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES
AND PERFORMANCEhen the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

rededicated itself to reducing poverty in

the Asia and Pacific region, it adopted a

strategy for reaching this objective.

Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific:

The Poverty Reduction Strategy provided
the direction for all new operations and activities (see http:
//www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Poverty_Reduction/).
That was 3 years ago. Between then and end-2002, ADB
adopted the framework for implementing the strategy in
the medium and long term, and supported detailed poverty
analyses and intensive stakeholder consultations to provide
the database from which to target changes. Poverty
reduction issues and targets were agreed upon and
integrated into new country strategies and programs and
project-level interventions. ADB reclassified its lending,
strengthened its operations, and reorganized itself. As part
of the reorganization, ADB created a new department—
Regional and Sustainable Development Department
(RSDD)—to maintain quality and technical excellence
across ADB, and to ensure ADB’s policies and guidelines
are applied consistently in all its developing member
countries (DMCs).

In 2002, the Poverty Reduction Strategy continued to
guide ADB's work as detailed poverty analyses were
completed and several poverty partnership agreements
(PPAs) between DMC governments and ADB were signed
(see boxes below and at right). Also in 2002, ADB joined the
international community in adopting a framework for
measuring development progress (see Box on page 36),
assessed the implementation process outlined in the
strategy, and reviewed the initial results. These developments, as well as ADB's priorities and implementation
performance, are examined in this chapter.

The poverty partnership agreement (PPA)—the
mechanism by which ADB and its developing
member countries (DMCs) measure and address
poverty—describes a DMC’s macroeconomic, structural, and social conditions, and outlines a longterm set of goals, policies, and programs for
reducing poverty.

Ten DMCs—Cambodia, Cook Islands, Maldives,
Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tonga, and Viet
Nam—signed PPAs with ADB in 2002. Each PPA
concluded to date summarizes the respective
government's main vision and strategy for poverty
reduction, the role of ADB in assisting that process, the modalities that such assistance will take,
and the medium- and long-term goals and targets
for poverty reduction that ADB and the government will jointly monitor and assess. For more
on PPAs, see http://www.adb.org/Poverty/pdf/
partnership.pdf.

The commitment to review and update a PPA
comes from DMCs, which take ownership of the
process and program.

Toward the Millennium
Development Goals

As part of its 2000 Millennium Declaration, the United
Nations (UN) proposed a set of Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs), which in 2002 were endorsed by the

Mongolia was the first ADB developing member
country (DMC) to formalize a partnership to reduce
poverty. Since March 2000, ADBhas conducted two
reviews of how the agreement has been implemented. For more on Mongolia’sstrategy, see http:
/www.adb.org/Documents/CSPs/MON/2002/. The
reviews helped in updating and refining ADB'sstrategy and operational program for Mongolia and
provided data for the Government’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), finalized in 2002.

The first review, conducted in April 2001, highlighted the coexistence of the income and
nonincome aspects of poverty and emphasized the
importance of providing essential services to the
poor. It also recognized the need for countryadapted targets for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). The review pointed
out that the MDGs used 1990 as the base year,
the year when Mongolia began its transition and
when poverty was not considered a phenomenon.
The review recommended adjusting the targets
used for Mongolia to take this into account. ADB
provided technical assistance to help the Government develop more realistic measures of progress
against the MDGs. The Government followed
recommendationsto maintain and increase its commitment to basic physical and social infrastructure
by targeting investments in social services and
social protection programs.

Monitoring progress

The second review, conducted in March 2002,
indicated that Mongolia had made progress in
achieving the MDGs: infant and child mortality had
been reduced, health care had improved, and
school enrollment had increased.

The second review also highlighted the importance of economic growth and employment in
reducing poverty. Consistent with the conclusions
in the Government’s draft PRSP and with concerns
expressed at the Consultative Group meeting held
in Mongolia in July 2002, the second review noted
that although access of the poor to essential services had improved, income poverty had remained
almost unchanged. The poverty incidence of 36%
was almost the same level as in 1995. Concluding
that social sector investment alone could not
provide a long-term solution to the problem of
unemployment-related poverty, the review emphasized the importance of private sector participation in economic growth and employment.

ADB's policy framework for
reducing poverty

The strategies and policies that guide ADB's efforts at
reducing poverty in the Asia and Pacific region were in
place in 2002. The Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF)
2001-2015 focuses on achieving sustainable economic
growth, inclusive social development, and good governance, providing a 15-year plan for ADB’s all-out assault
on poverty. The LTSF presents several fundamental
operating principles for reducing poverty: ensuring DMC
ownership of their poverty reduction programs, enhancing
strategic partnerships, and measuring development impact
(see http://www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/LTSF). The
Medium-Term Strategy (MTS) 2001-2005 guides ADB's
activities in its DMCs. Designed to enhance the development impact of ADB assistance, the MTS advocates ADB's
strong commitment to addressing the institutional and
policy issues that support its priorities (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/MTS/2001/) .ADB's programming and planning processes reflect
the MDGs. The MDGs, along with country-specific
poverty indicators, have been reflected in national
poverty strategies and have been incorporated into the
PPAs and country strategies and programs (CSPs) and
CSP updates. ADB is working with its development
partners to achieve the MDGs, and is establishing
mechanisms for monitoring progress. In 2002, ADB
joined the UN ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific) in developing MDG indicators
for Asia and the Pacific.

Measuring development effectiveness

Both the LTSF and the MTS also highlighted the importance of measuring the impact of development, noting that
the ability to identify, measure, and report impact in a
timely manner is fundamental to the process of reducing
poverty. Participation and accountability are promoted
when development goals and benchmarks are articulated
and when results are regularly monitored. In 2002, ADB
continued to harmonize its relevant practices and
procedures with those of other multilateral development
banks (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/News/2002/
nr2002102.asp and the Institutional Matters chapter).

ADB also conducted two studies on implementing and
monitoring the development impact of the Poverty
Reduction Strategy (see Box below). And, ADB
implemented a performance-based system for allocating
its concessional resources.

The success of ADB's operations is not gauged
solely by its projects and programs, but rather on the
outcomes achieved in terms of development effectiveness
and sustainability. To ensure that ADB's scarce resources
effectively contribute to sustainable development and
poverty reduction in its DMCs, ADB adopted in 2001,
and began implementing in 2002, its performancebased allocation (PBA) policy for Asian Development
Fund (ADF) resources.

 

The PBA system is premised on the understanding that
efficient and equitable resource allocation requires an
assessment of performance, needs, and absorptive capacity
of the recipient DMC. Country performance is evaluated in
terms of policy adoption and implementation, not merely
outcomes. Needs are measured by per capita gross national
product and population size.

The PBA system evaluates the effectiveness of the
policies and institutional frameworks in place
(divided into policies and framework on sustainable
economic growth, socially inclusive development, and
governance and public sector management), and the
quality of portfolio performance.

Annual performance assessments were reflected in the
allocations in the CSPs in 2002. However, performance
criteria, indicators, and guidelines for performance
assessment will continue to be refined and improved.

For more on the PBA system, see http://www.adb.org/
Documents/Policies/ADF/Performance_Based_Allocation/
petformance0900.asp.

Thematic priorities

ADB worked in 2002 toward integrating into its operations
several strategic areas and themes it had adopted in the
LTSF: inclusive social development (including gender and
development, social protection, participatory development,
indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement);
environmental sustainability; governance and capacity
building; regional cooperation; and private sector
development. Several other crosscutting themes, also
featured in the MDGs, received attention: financial
management, information and communication
technology, and civil society, including nongovernment
organizations (NGOs).

Ten thematic commitees were formed in 2002 for
developing best practices for project operations and
formulating guidelines for staff. Each committee and its

Measuring development impact is
fundamental to the process of
reducing poverty. In 2002, ADB
conducted two studies to assess
how the development impact of the
Poverty Reduction Strategy was
being monitored.

In the first study, ADB examined
the efficacy of itsloan classification
system in tracking whether the
typology of loans approved in 2001
had addressed ADB's target of
channeling at least 40% of lending
resources to poverty interventions.
Concluding that the system did not
accurately reflect the range of
support for poverty interventions,
the study highlighted the need for

a more refined methodology for
linking assessment to probable
results, and provided the groundwork for further improving the
monitoring system.

The second study reviewed how
the Poverty Reduction Strategy had
been implemented in developing
member countries (DMCs) receiving
Asian Development Fund assistance.
Preliminary results indicate that
although process-outputs are
discernible, time and sustained
effort are needed for greater development impacts. National poverty
reduction strategies need to be
integrated into the respective DMCs’
broader macroeconomic framework

and development program. Poverty
definitions, measurements, and
monitoring systems are being
included in target-driven development planning, but the institutions
collecting and evaluating the data
need to be strengthened if performance indicators are to be meaningful. Although links are evident
among poverty reduction targets,
the Millennium Development Goals,
and ADB's assistance pipeline, these
could be improved. Ongoing efforts
are being directed at incorporating
better baseline data with indicators
that can monitor objectives. For
more on ADB's studies, see http://

(see discussion on page 52).

Poverty

Poverty continues to plague the Asia and Pacific region,
affecting close to 900 million people, or two thirds of the
poor in the world. Although much more needs to be done
to make the region free of poverty, several DMCs made
significant progress in 2002 in reducing poverty and
improving the lives of their citizens. Several South Asian
DMCs—Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and
Sri Lanka—completed their poverty analyses in 2002; in the
Pacific and Central Asia DMCs, the process is ongoing.
Several DMCs also formulated national strategies for
reducing poverty after conducting extensive country
consultations involving representatives from government,
civil society, private sector, and the development
community. The consultation process ensured that the
voices of the poor were heard, and participation encouraged ownership of the process.

Consultations played a role in helping the Government
of Papua New Guinea (PNG) formulate its PPA. The
Government's In-House Committee of the Department of
National Planning and Rural Development, the Special
Committee, and the Poverty Task Force held communitylevel consultations, workshops, and interviews in
18 communities. The process revealed common perceptions
and identified community priorities for poverty reduction,
and the participatory approach encouraged PNG ownership
of the process and the outputs.

In the 2002 project pipelines, several developing
member countries featured initiatives that will
promote increased expenditure on the social
sectors within the context of broader economic
investment programs. Bangladesh invested in a
new social protection program for disadvantaged
women and children. India introduced participatory and pro-poor fiscal and administrative reforms
to improve provincial-level governance in delivering
basic services to the poor and marginalized in
Kerala State. Nepal supported six new project
proposals over 3 years to increase food security
for the poor in the insurgency-challenged rural
sector. Pakistan deepened governance reform
through the Decentralization Support Program to
build the capacity of provincial and local governments in delivering efficient, equitable, and
accountable use of public resources to the poor.
Si Lanka helped poor refugees return to their home
communities in the aftermath of civil conflict in
the northern and eastern parts of the country.

Elsewhere in the region, the 2002 initiatives
focused on aligning new loan and technical assistance project proposals to country-specific poverty
reduction targets as articulated in the poverty
partnership agreements (PPAs) (see page 35).

In the Mekong countries (Cambodia, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand,
and Viet Nam), new road infrastructure and
agricultural development investments are designed
to link poor communitiesin the border and remote
areas to the mainstream economies.

In Southeast Asia, both Indonesia and the
Philippines have PPAs that support site-specific
poverty reduction initiatives by devolving resources
to the local governments. In 2002, implementation
of these strategies focused on strengthening the
fiscal and institutional capacity of local governments to service loan resources for such projects.

Indonesia will strengthen the governance
capacity of district governments, while a technical
assistance project will develop a modality for
onlending concessional and nonconcessional
resources to regional governments. A second technical assistance project is setting up a monitoring
and evaluation system for assessing the implementation performance of regional governments.

In the Philippines, technical assistance was
approved for setting up a system for performancebased public resource allocation for local government poverty reduction programs and to test
revenue-generating approaches that would allow
local governments to sustain projects delivering
social services.

In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), ADBsponsored workshops and training aimed to broaden the
skills of government officials and villagers in participatory
planning approaches. The PRC Government began testing aparticipatory strategy involving the poor at the village level
to define poverty as they perceive it, and thus combine
nonincome with income measures to hone the targeting
strategy. Progress was evident in the PRC's efforts to reduce
poverty. Although the number of poor was still large in
absolute numbers, in relative terms, the proportion of the
poor below the poverty threshold—whether the Government'’s poverty line or the international standard of $1 a day
earning per person was used—had declined in relative terms.

ADB worked closely with its DMCs in 2002 to better
understand the causes of poverty and to set goals that can
be achieved together (see Box at left). ADB also worked
closely with its development partners, investing in human
and physical capacities that will promote equitable growth,
build the skills of people, and help governments function
efficiently and prudently.

Social development, gender,
and social protection

Poverty can be reduced only when programs promote
socially inclusive development. This means supporting the
disadvantaged and vulnerable members of society by
providing them with access to basic services such as
education and health care, creating opportunities for their
economic empowerment, and giving them a voice in
decisions affecting their lives. In the Asia and Pacific
region, supporting the poor and most vulnerable groups
means removing gender disparities; improving the lives of
indigenous peoples in remote communities; and providing
social protection to marginalized and disadvantaged groups
against illnesses, natural disasters, and civil conflicts.

Within the reorganized ADB, four networks—gender
and development, social protection, participatory
development, and involuntary resettlement—promote
inclusive social development. The Social Development,
Gender, and Social Protection Committee serves as an
anchor to the networks.

 

Gender and development: ADB's commitment to the
internationally endorsed MDGs underscored its objective of
addressing gender issues and reducing the gender gap. The
commitment also placed renewed emphasis on the need
for ADB to promote gender equity if ADB is to realize its
vision of a region free of poverty.

Several activities in 2002 bolstered ADB's efforts to
promote gender equity, and others provided evidence of
ADB's commitment (see Box below). An interim progress
report on the implementation of the 1998 Gender and
Development Policy, submitted to the Board of Directors in
2002, noted the progress achieved in addressing gender

The number of loans classified in the gender
category doubled in 2002 to 12 loans, from six
loansin 2001. The loans covered a range of sectors
such as governance, infrastructure, health,
education, water supply, and rural development.

ADB approved the second phase of a regional
technical assistance—Enhancing Gender and
Development in DMCs—in 2002, following the
success of the first project. In the first project, locally
recruited gender specialists were placed in six
resident missions—Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam—to assist with
gender capacity building of executing agencies and
increase the portfolio of ADB activities that focused
on gender. Under this new phase, three additional
resident missions—Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Si
Lanka—will be allocated gender specialists (see
http://www.adb.org/gender/regional/gisr001.asp).

Also in 2002, ADB approved advisory technical assistance in support of national gender
policies and strategies for Indonesia, Pakistan,
and Viet Nam.

The face of poverty in Bangladesh
is the face of rural women. It is in
the rural areas where gender
inequalities are most pronounced,
where the head of the household
is most often a woman who has
limited access to the mainstream of
rural economy, and where basic
services are lacking and access to
education, health, and economic
activities is low.

ADB—committed to improving
the status of women—is addressing
the needs of these rural women in
its Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (see http: /www.adb.
org/Documents/Profiles/LOAN/
31304013.ASP). Although not
classified as a gender project per se,

the project objectives are to reduce
rural poverty through sustainable
economic growth, rural development, and improved infrastructure,
which will benefit women.

The project addresses the need
for increased participation of
women in community-based activities and decision making. Nongovernment organizations will help
mobilize local women for active
participation in local governance.
Women will also be trained in business management, infrastructure
management and maintenance, and
other income-generating activities.
Linkages with microfinance institutions will be explored to enable shop
owners to avail of capital.

Gender-specific interventionsto
empower women and increase their
participation in development
include the construction of separate
toilets with water and sanitation
facilities, women’s private corners
in the market for use in emergencies, and separate seating arrangementsfor women ward membersin
the Union Council complex. In
addition, about 30% of the estimated 100,000 person-years of
employment opportunities created
for unskilled laborers will be for
women construction and road maintenance workers, which will lead to
an added benefit—gender-based
wage disparity in the construction
industry will be reduced.

reports also identified further improvements and actions,
particularly the need to increase the number of loans
directed toward gender equity objectives (see Box on page 39).

ADB's External Forum on Gender (EFG), established in
2001, held two sessions in 2002 and conducted two
in-house seminars for staff on Gender and Postconflict
Reconstruction and Gender, Macroeconomics, and Trade
(see http://www.adb.org/Gender/forum.asp). The EFG
consists of experts on gender and development and
women’s rights from several ADB members, representing
various disciplines and perspectives. As an external group,
the EFG provides ADB with opportunities to tap into
current thinking on gender issues and to dialogue on
emerging gender concerns in the region.

For more on gender and development, see http://
www.adb.org/Gender/.

Social protection: A progress report on the
implementation of the Social Protection Strategy (see http:
//www.adb.org/SocialProtection/strat.asp)—submitted to the
Board of Directors in 2002—indicated that a significant
number of ADB loans have been designed to address social
protection concerns. Several loans have aimed to help
eliminate labor standard violations, and have focused on
improving living conditions of former bonded laborers,
reducing child labor by retaining children in school, and
promoting occupational health and safety in the workplace
(see Box below).

In addition, ADB held several social protection
workshops and training seminars in 2002. A regional

In 2002, ADB completed a year-long regional
technical assistance study on Combating Trafficking of Women and Children in South Asia,
involving Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (see
http://www.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/
Combating_Trafficking/). The study identified
the key entry points for ADB to integrate
antitrafficking concerns into its poverty-reducing
operations at the regional, country, and project
levels, and recommended that ADB sharpen its
operational focus on vulnerable women and children through social protection; sustainable livelihood development; and improved access to
health, education, and legal assistance.

For example, ADB loans that are likely to
accelerate movement of people, such as large-scale
infrastructure construction projects, can include
measuresto prevent human trafficking and HIV/AIDS.
Likewise, regional economic cooperation programs
involving trade, tourism, and transport can address
the potential impact on cross-border regional
human mobility and trafficking. In Cambodia, the
magnitude of trafficking women and children was
included as one of the indicators to be monitored
in its poverty partnership agreement.

workshop focused on the role of labor standards—
particularly those related to child labor, occupational health
and safety, and gender discrimination in the workplace—in
broad-based development. The Regional Workshop on
Disability and Development looked at rehabilitation
strategies to maximize the functional capabilities of
physically challenged persons, inclusion and empowerment
strategies to facilitate their active participation in
communities and economies, architectural and design
strategies to remove and prevent physical barriers,
supporting and engaging in constructive arrangements with
physically challenged persons’ organizations, and
formulating strategies that provide cost-effective technologies to assist the physically challenged (see http://www.
adb.org/Documents/Events/2002/Disability_Development/).

ADB's policy framework on good governance, gender
and development, and social protection, and its practice of
encouraging public consultation and community participation provide the mandate and the instruments to engage
more effectively in combating trafficking. ADB’s partnerships with various organizations, including the International Organization for Migration, the International Labour
Organization, and many bilateral agencies and nongovernment organizations, are also helping address key elements
of the challenge (see boxes on page 6 and at right).

Also in 2002, ADB's social protection network was
established and a social protection web site (see http://
www.adb.org/SocialProtection/) was launched.

Participatory development: ADB saw progress in
2002 in its efforts to engage stakeholders in participatory
decision-making processes, by enhancing the degree of
horizontal communication, learning, and team-based
problem solving. ADB emphasized participatory development in the reorganization and new business processes
and in several workshops and functions involving staff
members from the resident missions and headquarters.
Staff members benefited from “just-in-time” training on
projects being prepared by project and country teams
(see Glossary). Awareness of the participatory process was
enhanced with a special edition of ADB's newsmagazine,
ADB Review, which featured case studies and essays on
social capital and participation in governance
(see http://www.adb.org/Documents/Periodicals/
ADB_Review/2002/vol34_2/), and an essay on the
various modalities of participation.

ADB completed its evaluation of the second regional
technical assistance on Capacity Building and Participatory
Activities in 2002, which showed the importance of
employing participatory approaches not only during project
planning but also throughout project implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation.

Indigenous peoples: ADB continued to strengthen
the implementation of its 1998 Policy on Indigenous
Peoples (see http:/Avww.adb.org/Documents/Policies/
Indigenous_Peoples/) by monitoring ADB's project
compliance with this safeguard policy (see page 43).
Twenty-seven of the 82 projects (33%) reviewed involved
indigenous peoples, of which 3 projects required indigenous peoples development plans, 7 required indigenousTo promote internal and external networks and
partnerships, and further strengthen staff capabilities, ADB held a seminar in 2002 on social
protection for the poor in Asia and Latin America
in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the ADB Institute. The
seminar brought together social protection experts
and practitioners from IADB, International Food
Policy Research Institute, International Labour
Organization, International Social Security
Association, United Nations Research Institute for
Social Development, World Bank, and nongovernment organizations such as the Save the Children
Fund and Self-Employed Women’s Association (see
http: //www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2002/
SocialProtection/).

Also in 2002, ADB hosted the second regional
International Confederation of Free Trade Unions—
Asian and Pacific Regional Organization (ICFTUAPRO), which focused on potential partnerships
between labor unions and international financial
institutions. Discussion at this event centered on
efforts to combat poverty; promote employment;
and involve stakeholders in policy design, monitoring, and implementation (see http://www.adb.
org/Documents/Events/2002/ICFTU_APRO/).

PROMOTING NETWORKS

The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, established in July 2002 by the United Kingdom's
Department for International Development, assists
ADB's learning in reducing poverty in its developing member countries by supporting policy
dialogue and strategy formulation on poverty
reduction; developing new poverty-reducing
programs and projects; monitoring and assessing
the impact of poverty reduction efforts; supporting pilot poverty reduction project design; and
promoting broad stakeholder consultation at all
stages of project design and implementation.

peoples development frameworks, and 17 required specific
actions. ADB also provided training for project implementers in DMCs to strengthen their capacity to address
indigenous peoples issues.

In 2002, ADB participated in local and global
discussions on safeguarding the interests of indigenous
peoples and published several monographs and books
dealing with issues related to indigenous peoples/ethnic
minorities and poverty reduction (see http://www.adb.org/
Documents/Reports/Indigenous_Peoples/). ADB also took
part in an international conference to review the European
Union's Policy on Indigenous Peoples and in the International Policy Dialogue organized by the German Foundation
for International Development. In Cambodia, ADB was
involved in a discussion of the Government's draft general
policy guidelines for development of highland peoples.

 

Involuntary resettlement: ADB reviewed the
compliance (see page 43) of loans processed in 2002 with its
1995 Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Involuntary_Resettlement).
The review encouraged early screening of projects to assess
trade-offs, manage risks, and set standards for resettlement
planning and implementation. Thirty-three of the 82 projects
(40%) reviewed were found to have involuntary resettlement
(IR) impacts that required resettlement plans, resettlement
frameworks, or both. Of the 33 projects, 21 had significant IR
impacts, 9 had insignificant impacts, and 3 projects required
resettlement frameworks.

In 2002, ADB assisted DMCs in developing national
resettlement policies and helped build the capacity of
executing agencies in implementing social safeguards and
resettlement management. ADB held a Regional Workshop
on National Resettlement Policy Enhancement and Capacity
Building in February 2002 to discuss national resettlement
standards and issues on resettlement planning and
implementations (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Events/2002/RETA5935). Government agencies, civil society
including NGOs, funding agencies, and multilateral financial
institutions from 11 countries attended the workshop. ADB
also implemented country-specific technical assistance to
enhance national resettlement policy standards in Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam
(see http://www.adb.org/resettlement/activities.asp) and
expanded its web site on resettlement (see http://
www.adb.org/resettlement).

Environment

In 2002, ADB’s Environment Policy (see http://
www.adb.org/Environment/envpol/) was approved by the
Board of Directors; ADB was given direct access to Global
Environment Facility (GEF) resources (see Box on GEF
resources on page 44); the environmental assessment
guidelines were updated in line with the new Policy; and
SPC requirements for the environment were institutionalized. Also, ADB continued to promote environmentally
sustainable development by mainstreaming environment in
poverty analyses, country programming, and lending and
technical assistance operations.

Thirteen loans with major environmental objectives
totaling about $700 million were approved in 2002. Several
loans aim to improve the natural resource base on which
many of the poor depend for livelihood and sustenance.
Other loans ensure that the poor will have better access to
improved water sources and sanitary facilities, and clean
air. Such amenities will help protect health, which the poor
often consider to be their most precious asset. Other loans
protect the poor from the risk of natural disasters, such as
landslides and floods, which could adversely affect their
health, livelihood, and shelter.

All loans approved in 2002 were reviewed for
environmental impacts: 51 environmental assessment
reports outlining safeguard measures for environment
category A (projects with the potential to have significant
adverse environmental impacts) and category B (projects
with some adverse impacts) were reviewed by environment

The global commitment to sustainable development was strengthened by the World Summit on
Sustainable Development (WSSD),
held from 26 August to 4 September 2002 in Johannesburg, South
Africa. More than 20,000 participants from 191 governments
attended. ADB's delegation was led
by President Tadao Chino.

The WSSD identified poverty
reduction as the highest priority
for sustainable development, and

In 2002, several projects were
designed with the dual objectives
of environmental protection and
poverty reduction.

In Bangladesh, a clean fuel
project was approved to increase
the sustainable use and supply of
domestic natural gas resources in
place of imported liquid fuels for the
transport sector. The project will
improve ambient air quality in
Dhaka and reduce respiratory
diseases, especially among the
urban poor who are the most
vulnerable.

An ADB/Global Environment
Facility (GEF) project in the Tonle
Sap basin in Cambodia will develop
natural resource management

as community-based natural
resource management and biodiversity conservation.

A project in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC) will improve

economic growth in the rural areas

recognized the need to tackle
environment and natural resource
degradation as prerequisites for
reducing poverty. The Summit also
reaffirmed political commitment
to the Millennium Development
Goals on poverty reduction, water
supply, and health, and extended
the targets to include sanitation.
The WSSD provided a clear focus
on the need for regional implementation, coordination, and
delivery mechanisms; and placed

provinces. Fundswill be provided to
small household farms to develop
an integrated farm production
system; expand livestock, vegetable,
fruit, and other crop production
systems; and establish on-farm
biogas digesters and biomass
gasification plants.

A project in Indonesia will
enhance the national and local
capacity to manage the country’s
coral reef resources and rehabilitate
and effectively manage priority coral
reef ecosystems, thereby raising
income levels and improving the
living standards of the poorer
coastal communities. Another
project in Indonesia will expand
renewable energy use by about 82
megawatts. This will displace energy
generated by fossil fuels (about 480
gigawatts annually) and limit the
emission of greenhouse gases.

A project in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic will help the
Government develop the potential

initiatives with the private sector
and civil society, including nongovernment organizations.

The themes addressed by the
WSSD are contained in ADB's

ADB's country strategies and programs. It is expected that the outcome of the WSSD will be reflected
in the national development planning priorities defined by ADB's
developing member countries.

of the Nam Ngum River basin, one
of the country’s most vital river
basins, by adopting integrated
water resource management in the
Government’s mainstream process.
Investment activities in relatively
degraded watersheds of the basin
will provide sustainable livelihood
opportunities for the poor.

Also in 2002, ADB funded
projects that would protect the
vulnerable poor from the onslaught
of natural disasters. A project in
Bangladesh will establish costeffective and sustainable riverbank
erosion mitigation measures for the
Jamuna and Meghna rivers, as well
as support institutions to protect the
livelihood of 2 million people living
in the vicinity of two flood protection and irrigation schemes. A
project in the PRC will help reduce
flood damage through integrated
river basin management and is
expected to improve flood protection in the PRCs third largest river
basin, the Songhua River basin.

specialists deployed in the regional departments. In
addition, to ensure that the safeguard measures designed
for these projects complied with ADB’s SPC requirements,
environment specialists in the Environment and Social
Safeguard Division reviewed project-specific SPC measures
and provided additional recommendations. After loan
approval, projects were monitored to ensure proper
implementation of safeguard measures.

Technical assistance grants were provided for DMC

policy and regulatory and institutional frameworks. These
technical assistance grants, totaling nearly $27.5 million,

Governance and capacity building

ADB recognizes that good governance—one of the three
pillars of its Poverty Reduction Strategy—continues to be a
sensitive issue for many DMCs, and appreciates that
governance issues must ultimately be addressed at the
country level. Nevertheless, ADB made progress in 2002 in
promoting and supporting good governance in the Asia
and Pacific region.

Initially, ADB focused on economic and financial
management, particularly on strengthening budgetary

In October 2002, the Council and Assembly of the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) approved ADB's
direct access to GEF project resources, which
enables ADB to

+ identify, prepare, appraise, and implement
GEF projects on behalf of GEF;

* submit project proposals for financing to
GEF rather than indirectly through an implementing agency; and

* receive project grants directly from the GEF
trustee and be accountable for their use.

Recently replenished at a level of $2.9 billion,
the GEF provides grants and concessional resources
for projects that address global environmental
issues related to climate change, biodiversity,
international waters, ozone depletion, land
degradation, and persistent organic pollutants.

South Asia's coastal seas have some of the richest,
most diverse marine and coastal habitats and
species in Asia. These seas also provide an important resource for coastal communities, especially
where a substantial proportion of the population
is either vulnerable or living in poverty. Coastal
zones and watersheds in the region are increasingly being converted for agricultural and urban
development, which has led to elevated nutrient
levels, sediment loads, and changes in coastal
configurations. Many marine species are now
threatened.

ADB; the World Conservation Union (IUCN);
and the governments of India, Maldives, Pakistan,
and Si Lanka have taken initiatives to address these
problems through an 18-month regional technical
assistance project. The Coastal and Marine
Resources and Poverty Reduction program in South
Asia will promote regional cooperation to
strengthen the management of environmentally
sensitive coastal and marine resources through
assistance in policy, regulation, institutions, methodologies, and information management. IUCN is
implementing the project.

Participating countries are using integrated
coastal zone management (ICZM) asa planning and
development tool. By systematically categorizing
issues and threatsin each country, and developing
a compendium of high-priority areas, ICZM plans
are being targeted to coastal areas with a concentration of poorer communities. This work will lead
to an analysis of institutional and policy barriers
and constraints to effective ICZM, study of the
interrelationships between poverty and the environment, and, ultimately, a South Asian Regional
Strategic Pian of Action.

systems, enhancing public sector management, building
capacity in key central ministries, and upgrading technical
expertise for lawmaking. More recently, ADB's focus has
been on improving governance in its DMCs by encouraging
decentralization and devolution of administration to the
regional, provincial, and village levels—a strategy that is
consistent with ADB’s commitment to adopt consultative
processes and to help DMC governments be more
responsive to civil society. Strengthening local government
capacity frequently involves improving the balance between
national accountability and local choice in services delivery;
helping governments overcome the problems of fragmentation that exist in some big cities; building relationships
between public administrations and the private sector; and
increasing the representation of the poor in the forums
where policies are developed.

Recent world events have increased the spotlight on
improving corporate governance and regulatory frameworks in public and private entities. Key constraints to
building good corporate governance in the private sector
include establishing independent legal entities and selecting
the appropriate agents to represent the government. Sound
corporate governance and corporate regulatory frameworks
are central to reforming public enterprise, but reforms are
often resisted. Key constraints include the process of
corporatizing and establishing the independent legal entity,
and selecting the appropriate agent to represent the
government. In many transitional economies, the solution
has been to establish a semiautonomous agency and
improve its management. The capability and performance
of public enterprise boards must also be improved. ADB
involves the private sector in drafting good governance
laws; works closely with DMCs to establish consistent
and predictable commercial laws and regulations; and
improves the availability of information, including
relevant laws, to ensure that companies are accountable
to their shareholders.

ADB's Governance Action Plan (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Good_Governance/),
approved in 2000, addresses these concerns.

¢ Enhancing the quality of governance: Country
governance assessments (CGAs) are incorporated into the
country strategies and programs (see Glossary) and are
used to develop measurable objectives for inclusion in the
poverty partnership agreements (see Box on page 35). ADB
also measures governance activities in the performancebased allocation exercise (see page 37).

¢ Elevating good governance: ADB, the ADB
Institute, and other regional partners are working to
build DMC capacity in key governance areas, including
public expenditure management; results-based management; and accounting, auditing, and procurement
practices.

¢ Prioritizing anticorruption: Country-specific and
regional technical assistance projects address corruption in
general and, at the same time, tackle specific problems
such as money laundering.Zz

GOVERNANCE

 

By pooling their intellectual
resources and facilitating opportunities for exchanging information,
ADB, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development
(OECD), and Asia and Pacific governmentsare helping build effective
anticorruption mechanismsand lay
the foundation for a sustained fight
against corruption.

The initiative—an Anticorruption Action Pian for Asia and the
Pacific—endorsed by 17 regional
countries" in 2001, adopts an integrated approach to policy making
while respecting country differences
and without interfering in internal
corruption cases.

Activities under the initiative
initially focused on capacity and
knowledge building, regional cooperation, and action framework
development. Since 2001, the focus
has been on implementing concrete
regional and country-specific anticorruption reforms.

The endorsing countries, which
make up the Initiative’s Steering
Group, met in the Philippines in

In 2001-2002, a total of 25 loans (about 12 loans
per year, or 16% of all public sector loans approved
during the period) had governance as a primary
or secondary thematic priority. During the same
period, 65 technical assistance projects (about 32
per year, or 14% of all technical assistance

2002 to adopt a medium-term
strategy and review projects and
progress reports submitted by each
country.

Four principles guide the
initiatives policy work: cementing
country ownership, fostering
regional cooperation, involving
citizens and the business sector, and
enlarging the participating group of
countries.

Cementing country ownership: The endorsing countries have
the primary responsibility for
addressing corruption. For each
implementation cycle of 12-18
months, the countries prioritize a set
of national anticorruption reforms.

Fostering regional cooperation: Regional steering group
meetings provide the venue for
the countries to share their selfassessments, discuss progress
and lessons learned, and identify
additional policy reforms and
capacity-building needs. These
lessons are disseminated to other
countries and key stakeholders
in print (see http://www.adb.

org/Documents/Conference/
Combating_Corruption/; or see the
OECD web site at http://www.
oecd.org/daf/ASIAcom/), and at
biannual regional anticorruption
meetings.

Involving the public: Countries are encouraged to develop
proactive strategies for promoting
citizens’ participation in anticorruption efforts. To encourage
their support and input into national
reforms, regional nongovernment
organizations and business associations are members of the Steering
Group and attend the regional
anticorruption meetings.

Enlarging the participating
group of countries: ADB, OECD,
and the Steering Group encourage
more regional countries to endorse
the Action Pian.

‘The 17 original members are Bangladesh,

Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic,
Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore,
and Vanuatu. Cambodia and Kazakhstan
have since endorsed the Action Plan.

Organizational improvements, including the formation of
the Governance Committee and Network, provide the
internal mechanisms for sharing information about
governance concepts, projects, and strategic oversight.
In addition, ADB monitors its Governance Action
Plan and provides feedback to stakeholders. The external
web site (see http://www.adb.org/Anticorruption/

approved during the period) had governance as
a primary or secondary thematic priority.

¢ Supporting good governance partnerships: The
Multilateral Development Banks Working Group on
Anticorruption, Governance, and Capacity Building meets
twice a year by videoconference to coordinate and
harmonize work and share best practices. Links with
bilateral development agencies are also being strengthened
in the governance area (see Box above). The governments
of Canada and Norway have signed agreements with
ADB to contribute to the Governance Cooperation Fund.
The United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID) and ADB are establishing a similar
collaborative arrangement for mutually supportive
objectives in the Pacific.

¢ Improving ADB's governance ability: The 2002
reorganization and new business processes are aimed at
improving ADB's ability to support governance initiatives.

Private sector development

DMCs received $15.6 billion in official flows and $89.4 billion in private flows in 2000. These figures underline the
importance of the private sector in development and the
resulting economic growth in Asia.

Support for private sector development is an integral
component of ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy, and
private sector development as an engine of growth is a
pillar of ADB's LTSF for poverty reduction. Mobilizing the
resources required to achieve economic growth necessary
for poverty reduction—including providing infrastructure,
social services, and employment—needs the active
participation of the private sector.

Continued budgetary pressures increasingly lead DMCs
to look for private sector investments to stimulate growth
and create jobs. Public involvement in the productive

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 45

EPA AR COE REL meh Me TRAP CO) P Tah Co PAR EL Le)sectors is often not the most effective use of scarce funds,
particularly if done at the expense of the social sectors
where these funds are truly needed. Private investment and
management in properly regulated infrastructure and
sustainable social services projects can relieve pressure on
public budgets and enable the government to redirect more
resources to social spending. Consequently, governments
need to shift from playing the role of an owner/producer to
becoming a facilitator/regulator to ensure markets work
and protect the public interests.

ADB is committed to expanding and facilitating the
role of the private sector in its DMCs. With its capacity for
both public and private sector operations, ADB is uniquely
positioned to effectively promote and foster private sectorled growth. ADB assistance, combined through the public
and private sector windows to address private sector
development, can deliver synergistic solutions to problems
that impede private sector-led growth in DMCs.

ADB has developed two complementary strategies in
support of private sector development: the Private Sector
Development (PSD) Strategy, approved in March 2000, and
the Private Sector Operations: Strategic Directions and
Review (PSO Strategy), approved in September 2001
(see boxes at right).

The PSD Strategy represents a systematic and
coherent framework within which ADB seeks to promote
the private sector to support growth and reduce poverty.
This framework provides broad strategic direction for both
public and private sector operations in terms of major
strategic thrusts and priority areas for private sector
development. The PSO Strategy is an operational
framework for providing direct financial assistance to the
private sector in the context of the broader ADB strategy
for private sector development.

The PSD Strategy guides ADB’s private sector
development activities across a region where the stage and
status of private sector development differ widely among
DMCs. The actions proposed in the Strategy have to be
tailored at the country level to meet the diverse conditions
and changing needs of individual DMCs and to maximize
their contribution to growth and poverty reduction. In
pursuing the goals of the PSD Strategy, ADB conducts
private sector assessments to identify constraints to, and
opportunities for, private sector development in each DMC
and addresses these through strategically planned private
sector development operations. The assessments and
priority operations identified therein serve as inputs to
ADB's country-specific strategies and programs, which are
being formulated within the framework of the PSD
Strategy. Through these programs, ADB assists DMCs in
building and reinforcing the confidence of investors and
commercial lenders.

ADB's operations in support of the PSD Strategy range
from public to private sector operations and comprise trade
and investment facilitation, including customs harmonization
to foster cross-border trade; strengthening of the financial
sector through financial sector reforms and capital market
development programs; state-owned enterprise reforms,
including governance and privatization programs; small- and

Private Sector Development Strategy
Development of a strong and dynamic private
sector is essential to long-term economic growth,
a necessary condition for sustainable poverty
reduction. ADB's Private Sector Development (PSD)
Strategy (approved March 2000) aimsat strengthening the role of the private sector in Asia and the
Pacific by addressing the complex challenge of how
ADB's public and private sector operations can
better promote private sector-led growth. Such a
combination requires public sector assistance to
pay more systematic attention to private sector
interests and concerns, and private sector assistance to promote development impacts in their
activities.

The PSD Strategy has three mutually reinforcing strategic thrusts: creating enabling conditions,
generating business opportunities, and catalyzing
private investment.

Creating enabling conditions: The right policy
environment is critical for the long-term viability of
the private sector. One of ADB's strengths lies in
conducting policy dialogue with governments on
needed reforms. Under the PSD Strategy, the reform
agenda seeks to achieve a stable macroeconomic
environment; investment, trade, and price liberalization; reduced barriers to competition;
well-functioning financial and capital markets;
flexible labor and land markets; appropriate
physical, social, and technological infrastructure;
equitable tax systems; and legal and judicial
systems that protect property rights, enforce
contracts, and provide for dispute resolution.

Generating business opportunities: Under
the PSD Strategy, ADB takes deliberate steps to
ensure that, where appropriate in its public sector
projects, business opportunities are generated for
the private sector, particularly for the domestic
private sector. ADB's public sector operations can
be formulated to provide specific opportunities in
which the private sector can participate. Such
opportunities may include model private sector
projects designed to include poverty reduction
impacts.

Catalyzing private investments: ADB provides direct financial assistance to private sector
projects. While ADB's participation is usually
limited, it leverages a large amount of funds from
commercial sources to finance these projects. As
amultilateral development organization, ADB does
not finance private sector projects based solely on
their financial viability. Projects must also have clear
development impacts and/or demonstration effects
that go beyond the benefits captured in the
financial rate of return.

The three strategic thrusts of the PSD Strategy are pursued in four priority operational areas:
governance, financial intermediation, public-private
partnerships, and regional cooperation.2

Private Sector Operations: Strategic Directions
and Review

The third thrust of ADB's Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy (see Box at left) is to catalyze
private investments through direct financing, credit
enhancements, and risk mitigation instruments.
ADB performs this function through its Private
Sector Operations Department. ADB approved the
Private Sector Operations: Strategic Directions and
Review (PSO Strategy) in September 2001 to
enhance the impact of such operations.

ADB's strategic objective for private sector
operations is to increase the flow of capital into
and within its developing member countries (DMCs)
and, more importantly, to broaden the flow into
more countries and sectors. The PSO strategic
framework demands a sharper focus on development impact, and emphasizes private sector
participation in infrastructure and capital market
development, gradual broadening of the country
and sector reach, wider use of credit enhancement
and other instruments, and strategic alliances with
other development agencies.

In its PSO, ADB builds on its existing strengths
in infrastructure and capital market development
and seeks to assist private sector projects in these
two areas in more DMCs. Priorities include
infrastructure projects in the energy, water,
telecommunications, and transport sectors. In
capital markets, ADB emphasizes investments in
key market institutions and investment funds that
can serve as vehicles for mobilizing resources to
finance small-scale infrastructure and small- and
medium-sized enterprises. ADB also intends to
gradually extend its reach to new sectors, such as
education and health care. This is being done
selectively on a pilot basis.

ADB provides direct funding assistance through
loans and equity investments. In addition, it uses
its political risk guarantee and partial credit guarantee instruments to enhance transactions, thus
attracting foreign commercial lenders to projectsin
the DMCs or domestic banks and institutions to
stretch the maturities of their local currency loans.

ADB has long enjoyed constructive partnerships with other international financial institutions
and development agencies. Such strategic alliances
are being intensified to facilitate the knowledge
and risk sharing needed to make challenging
projects bankable. Joint support by multiple agencies for a given project also gives a strong signal
of confidence in the overall country environment
and paves the way for further private capital.

Investment officers in the resident missions
enhance ADB's private sector activities in-country
and help facilitate processing of new projects. More
importantly, in-country presence allows closer
project administration and risk management, which
are critical for sustained operations.

 

 

The ADB and Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory
Facility (PPIAF) conference on infrastructure development—Private Solutions for the Poor: The Asian
Perspective—in October 2002, facilitated discussions on methods for identifying, disseminating,
and promoting best practices in pro-poor infrastructure projects; increasing private sector
participation in financing, owning, constructing,
operating, rehabilitating, maintaining, and
managing pro-poor infrastructure activities; and
strengthening pro-poor public-private infrastructure partnerships.

The conference was attended by over 160
senior developing member country (DMC) decision
makers, including representatives from government
ministries and agenciesinvolved in formulating and
implementing policy on infrastructure reform;
representatives of civil society, including nongovernment organizations working with low-income
households and communities to improve infrastructure services delivery; multinational and regional
private sector providers and financiers of infrastructure services; and funding agency representatives.
For more on the conference, go to http://www.
adb.org/Documents/Events/2002/Infrastructure_
Poor/. The conference supported ADB's efforts to
develop the private sector, and strengthened
ADB's cooperation with the PPIAF, which helps
DMCs eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable
development through private sector involvement
in infrastructure.

medium-sized enterprise support; and public-private
partnerships in infrastructure, particularly in the power,
transport, water, and social sectors.

ADB operates under the principle that DMCs must
exercise leadership and ownership of their own development agenda and priorities by demonstrating initiative,
commitment, and accountability. Country ownership and
leadership in the PSD process require capacity building, as
well as continued dialogue and consultation between ADB
and key stakeholders. ADB facilitates such exchanges
through policy dialogue, workshops, conferences, and
training. The highly successful conference on infrastructure
development—Private Solutions for the Poor: The Asian
Perspective, held at ADB headquarters in Manila in October
2002—is an example (see Box above). In addition, ADB's
resident missions interact closely with governments,
chambers of commerce, and the private sector to facilitate
exchanges on PSD.

Financial management

ADB strives to be an effective partner for its DMCs in
responding to the challenges of achieving sustained and
equitable development, improving the quality of life, and

An effective partnership between
the public and private sectors can
increase private sector participation.
ADB seeks to harness the partnership between the public and private
sectors to promote development,
and minimize costs and enhance
efficiency in meeting its strategic
objectives, particularly in reducing
poverty. More private sector investment can be expected in a country
if the government creates an
effective macroeconomic, regulatory, contractual and institutional
environment.

ADB has a comparative advantage among development banks in
creating public-private partnerships.
It provides both public sector policy
and private sector finance. It can
discuss policy and regulatory issues
with governments and, at the same
time, catalyze resources for specific
private sector projects.

ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy articulates the importance of public-private partnerships,
allowing scrutiny of public sector
activities to identify potential areas
of private sector operations. ADB

assists governments in moving
from owner-producer to facilitatorregulator of certain industries. It
also provides help in various
government initiatives—upgrading
public sector accounting and reporting systems, encouraging corporatization, introducing structural sector
reforms, establishing independent
regulatory bodies, privatizating
public sector bodies, designing
concessions for developing new
infrastructure, and establishing
agencies that help promote smalland medium-sized enterprises.

good public sector management, fully accountable
government institutions, and transparent policy-making
and implementation procedures. Improving accountability

Although ADB is not directly involved in the joint
International Monetary Fund and World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and Reports on

and tracking audit trails will promote such transparency
as well as ensure the proper use of funds, minimize
corruption, and make a difference in delivering services
to the poor. Strengthening public financial management
of expenditure and revenue collection is one of the most
vital concerns ADB can address to help its DMCs meet
the challenges of improving their fiscal discipline,
bringing resource allocations in line with development
priorities, and creating an enabling environment for
public financial managers.

To improve DMC understanding of financial management processes, ADB completed a regional technical
assistance for the second phase of a diagnostic study of
accounting and auditing practices in five DMCs. An
international workshop was conducted and action plans
were published and distributed to the respective DMCs for
implementation (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/
Diagnostic_Study_Accounting_Auditing/). Also, in 2002, ADB
disseminated its new Guidelines for the Financial Governance
and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB (see
http:/Avww.adb.org/Documents/Guidelines/Financial/) and
conducted two in-house training workshops—one for financial
analysts and the other for mission leaders.

 

MDB HARMONIZATION

As a member of the working group on harmonization of financial management practices among
the multilateral development banks (MDBs), which
was endorsed by the presidents of the MDBs in
2001, ADBjoined the Inter-American Development
Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, World Bank, and othersin developing good practice papers on financial reporting.
The three areas studied for possible harmonization were affordability, tariffs, and subsidies;
financial management assessment, reporting, and
auditing; and financial covenants and ratios. Based
on the summary reports prepared in 2002 for each
area, the MDBs are expected to determine the
policy and procedural changes necessary to implement these recommendations. Also, in 2002 there
was positive progress in the ongoing pilot-testing
of the Viet Nam country harmonization activities
involving ADB, World Bank, the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation, and the Government.

ADB undertook several initiatives in
2002 to support improved financial
management and governance
arrangements both internally and
externally.

In 2002, ADB carried out
34 technical assistance projects
totaling nearly $19.5 million, involving financial management activities.
The significant outputs of these
projectsinclude the development of
the accounting profession, training

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

in accounting and auditing, development of accounting regulations/
procedures/policies, establishment
of common accounting and
auditing standards, and support
for the implementation of antimoney laundering legislation.
Nine technical assistance projects
totaling $2.8 million were for
regional activities. The rest were
country-focused on 11 developing
member countries.

For example, a project in
Cambodia will strengthen public
financial management, and another
in the People’s Republic of China
aimed to strengthen the government auditing system. In the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, a
project enhanced government
accounting regulations and procedures; and in the Philippines, a
project strengthened regulatory and
market governance.Observance and Codes, ADB's financial sector and
corporate governance work in its DMCs provides input for
the FSAP. In 2002, the FSAP for the Kyrgyz Republic
benefited from the technical assistance program launched
by ADB as part of the Financial Intermediation and
Resource Mobilization loan, the ongoing Corporate
Governance and Enterprise Restructuring loan, and technical assistance supporting these loans. ADB helped review
several laws, including the central bank law, the commercial banking law, insolvency law, and joint stock company
law. ADB's assessment of issues in banking regulation and
supervision, problems with the nonbank sector, and the
judicial system in debt and corporate resolution have all
contributed to furthering the understanding in the Kyrgyz
Republic of financial sector assessment.

Information and communication technology

Information and communication technology (ICT) is a
growing addition to ADB's lending and technical assistance
portfolio. In June 2001, ADB adopted a strategic approach
for promoting the use of ICT to bridge the digital divide—
the gap between those with ready access to information
and those without—for its DMCs. The strategy—Toward
E-Development in Asia and the Pacific: A Strategic
Approach for Information and Communication Technology—calls for greater access by DMCs to information and
knowledge, allowing them to compete in global markets and
move out of poverty (see http:/Avww.adb.org/Documents/
Policies/ICT/). ADB advocates applying ICT to improving
human welfare, expanding economic growth, and extending
good governance practices. All stakeholders—governments,
private sector, civil society including nongovernment
organizations, and international organizations—must work
together to leverage their collective resources to ensure that
the benefits of ICT improve the lives of the poor.

As ICT is a crosscutting field, its application in ADB’s
lending and technical assistance is wide-ranging. In 2002,
ADB focused its ICT activities on creating an enabling
environment in ICT infrastructure and the regulatory
framework, building human capacity, and helping DMCs
develop ICT applications and information content.

 

DMC interest in ICT is keen, as was highlighted in the
seminar “Unlocking the ICT Potential in Asia and the
Pacific,” at ADB’s 35"" Annual Meeting in May 2002. The
seminar examined the diverse and innovative ICT
applications in the region, emphasizing those being used to
improve education, health, public welfare, and employment
opportunities, and to provide disaster-alert information.
The seminar concluded that, for Asian countries to remain
competitive, governments must provide a solid leadership
and a strategic vision in developing national ICT plans and
in establishing partnerships with the private sector.

Regional cooperation

By acting jointly, countries can improve their development
prospects and strengthen their ability to reduce poverty,
increase private sector investment, promote peace and
security, and achieve sustainable development. Joint action
enables countries to mitigate the adverse effects of
negative externalities, such as cross-border pollution and
the spread of infectious diseases, and creates an
environment where common services and development
programs can be shared.

Mandated by its Charter to promote regional
cooperation, ADB has supported regional economic
cooperation activities in its DMCs since 1966
(see http://www.adb.org/RegionalCooperation/). The
mandate was reaffirmed in the LTSF in 2001 and in the
reorganization in 2002. As a regional institution, ADB has a
clear comparative advantage in promoting regional
cooperation, and is preparing a regional cooperation
strategy to respond more effectively to this mandate.

ADB's support for regional cooperation revolves
around three related dimensions: facilitating the economic
development of participating countries through cooperation
and integration; providing key regional public goods that
address shared constraints and opportunities; and
encouraging regional stability through processes associated
with broader and deeper cooperation.

ADB supports several subregional cooperation
initiatives: Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program
(see Box on page 50); Central Asia Regional Economic

Several information and communication technology (ICT) loans were
approved in 2002. In the Maldives,
the Information Technology Development Project provides a networking mechanism for government
agencies delivering public services
electronically, including public
health services. Vehicle registration
will be facilitated by community
Internet kiosks in the capital, Malé,
and in 20 atolls.
Reformsin the telecommunications sector provided the publicwith
low-cost Internet access. In Viet

Nam, a program loan will reform the
public administration sector by
establishing the legal framework to
support the computerization of
the state administrative management system and by building a
network of E-government services.
The Government's capacity in ICT
management, planning, and support will be strengthened.
Several technical assistance
activities were approved in 2002.
Technical assistance to the People’s
Republic of China is helping assess
the viability of distance education

and ICT in the western region,
which would greatly improve
access to quality primary and
secondary education. In the
Greater Mekong Subregion, ICT
was used to develop trade networks for small- and mediumsized enterprises, providing
them with information on trade
regulations and cross-border
trade flows. In the Pacific DMCs
and Timor-Leste, ADB conducted a comprehensive review of
Ereadiness—a country’s capacity
to take advantage of ICTnetworks.

“Our most important achievement
has been the growing trust and
confidence among our countries,
which has provided a favorable
environment for trade, investment,
economic growth, and social wellbeing.”

This joint declaration was made
at the first-ever GMS Summit, held
in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, in
November 2002. The summit, which
marked 10 years of successful
regional cooperation (see http://
www.adb.org/GMQ)), was attended
by leaders of the six Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) countries—Cambodia, People’s Republic of China,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

Pledging to work more closely
to reduce poverty and promote

Astrong and dynamic private sector is crucial to long-term and
rapid economic development. For
many years, ADB has provided
support to private sector initiatives in South Asia, a subregion
that has the economic potential
to become an important highgrowth area. The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation
(SASEC) initiative (see http://
www.adb.org/SASEC/)—comprised of Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, and Nepal—is home to the
highest concentration of the
world’s poor. Cross-border trade
and investment promotion can be
instrumental in promoting employment and increasing incomes,
and private sector initiatives can
play a significant role in driving
trade and investment.

greater subregional integration,
the GMS leaders adopted a fivepronged strategy to realize their
shared vision. The strategy aims to
+ strengthen infrastructure
linkages through a multisectoral
approach;

+ facilitate cross-border trade
and investment;

* — enhance private sector participation in development and improve
its competitiveness;

+ develop human resources and
skills competencies; and

* protect the environment and
promote sustainable use of shared
natural resources.

The leaders agreed to flagship
programsin 11 key areasto support
the strategy: transportation/economic corridors, telecommunications

The importance of the private
sector to SASEC was highlighted in
2002 at the Second Meeting of the
SASEC Trade, Investment, and
Private Sector Cooperation Working
Group (TIPWG) and at the First
Annual Meeting of the South Asia
Business Forum (SABF). Considered a milestone in developing
subregional business-to-business
cooperation, the annual meeting
provided the venue for the secretaries of commerce of the four countriesto express their support for the
establishment of the SABF, and to
urge the SABF to develop measures
that would accelerate the growth of
trade and investment in the region.

Other SABF activities in 2002
included establishing business facilitation cellsin the four countries; and

and energy interchanges, crossborder trade and investment,
greater private sector participation
in development, human resource
development, joint initiatives for
managing the subregion’s shared
environment and natural resources,
and tourism development.

ADB President Tadao Chino
expressed ADB's continued support
and commitment to regional cooperation and the shared development
aspirations of the GMS leaders. He
also announced ADB's approval of
technical assistance for developing
the subregion’s human resource
potential (see http://www. adb.org/
Media/Articles/2002/733_
Cambodia_Phnom_Penh_Scholarship_Program/).

At the request of the participating countries, ADB approved in
December 2002 a small-scale
regional technical assistance to
undertake a comprehensive study of
trade facilitation in the subregion.
The study is expected to identify
measures to encourage intraregional trade and identify and
remove nontrade barriers. Sector
studies will support private sector
cooperation in human resource
development, information and
communication technology, tourism, audiovisual industry, and
agribusiness.

In addition to the TIPWG, ADB
has also supported SASEC cooperation initiatives in several sectors, including energy, transport,
tourism, and environment.In 2002, ADB supported education reform in countries
in transition (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,
Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) to exchange
experiences among education policymakers in curriculum
development, teacher education, textbook production,
budgeting, management decentralization, and publicprivate partnerships. ADB is promoting effective water
management policies and practices in the Asia and Pacific
region. Activities at the regional, subregional, and country
levels, including a pilot demonstration of innovative
approaches in the water sector, include a public
awareness campaign, development of a water information system, comparative analysis of water sector
reforms in the region, regional water partnerships, and
participation at regional events.

ADB also promotes regional research and knowledge
sharing. In 2002, ADB supported regional research in
developing energy indicators, assessing issues of trafficking
women and children in South Asia, and promoting
transport control and air quality standards. Conferences,
forums, workshops, publications, and a new regional
cooperation web site were also supported (see http://
www.adb.org/RegionalCooperation/). In 2002, ADB hosted
the regional cooperation session at the Bo’ao Forum, which
promotes high-level dialogue among the region's
government and business leaders and focuses on trade,
investment, and regional cooperation in the Asia and
Pacific region (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Conference/Moving_Regional_Cooperation_Forward/
proceedings.pdf). A cosponsored workshop on citizen
participation and fiscal decentralization, and a conference
on Regional Public Goods and Regional Development
Assistance looked at regional public goods as a development tool and at the interrelationship between participation
and financial administration.

 

Nongovernment organizations
and civil society

ADB's policy on NGO cooperation (see http://www.adb.org/
Documents/Policies/Cooperation_with_NGOs/ seeks to
integrate NGO and civil society experience, knowledge, and
expertise into its operations so that development services
are more effective, sustainable, and of higher quality.
ADB's dedication to poverty reduction as its overarching
objective requires increasingly more attention to the
benefits that can be gained by strengthening ADBGovernment-NGO cooperation.

Cooperation between ADB and NGOs continued to
expand. In 2002, a total of 42 projects, or 52% of all
approved projects, involved some level of NGO collaboration, with most focusing on the agriculture and natural
resource sector. The majority of NGOs partnering with ADB
are local and community-based groups, who help improve
project quality by identifying the specific needs of their
communities, and encouraging greater participation of
intended project beneficiaries. In addition to project
consultations, NGOs also continued to be involved in
project implementation, monitoring, and other activities.

ADB's NGO Center (see http://www.adb.org/NGOs/
ngocenter.asp) gave further impetus to ADB-GovernmentNGO collaboration through a 2002 regional technical
assistance project, entitled Technical Assistance for a
Framework for ADB-Government-NGO Cooperation (see Box
below). The project was cofinanced by the governments of
Australia and the United Kingdom.

In 2002, NGOs were involved in consultations on
ADB's new environment and water policies, as well as in
the review of ADB’s Inspection Function. In addition, some
80 participants attended the NGO Open Forum at ADB’s
35" Annual Meeting in Shanghai, PRC.

The objective was to bring people
together where they could find
common ground and shared goals.
The result was the development of
a guide for enhanced cooperation:
ADB-Government-NGO (nongovernment organizations) Cooperation: A Framework for Action
2003-2005.

ADB's NGO Center began the
consultation process by widely disseminating an “Issues Note” that
addressed key elements of the current tripartite relationship, and
served as the background document for country workshops in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, India,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and
Thailand, and for subregional workshops held in Sydney (for Australia

and the Pacific), Almaty (for East
and Central Asia), Phnom Penh (for
the Mekong), and Kathmandu (for
South Asia). Nearly 500 government, NGO, and private sector
representatives attended the workshops. A Manila workshop solicited
input from ADB staff.

The country and subregional
workshops were organized and
facilitated by local NGOs or consulting firms, with the country-level
workshops largely conducted in
local languages. Workshop participants proposed activities to increase
tripartite cooperation. These suggestions and activities were debated
in plenary sessions.

The proceedings of each workshop were posted on ADB’s NGO
web site. Synthesis documents were.

produced so that each workshop
built on the recommendations of
earlier workshops.

From the syntheses and other
background materials, the NGO
Center prepared a preliminary or
“zero draft” framework document. In mid-November, selected
participantsfrom the earlier workshops met in small groups in
Manila to draft or refine sections
of the framework. To provide
maximum public feedback, the
document was posted on ADB's
web site at the same time it was
circulated to ADB's Board of
Directors and staff.

The Framework reflects
the shared vision and understanding of government and
NGO stakeholders.

EPA AR COE REL meh Me TRAP CO) P Tah Co PAR EL Le)Economics

Two knowledge departments of ADB—the Economics and
Research Department (ERD) and the Regional Economic
Monitoring Unit (REMU)—in collaboration with the regional
departments, continued in 2002 to provide the analyses
and understanding of economic issues necessary for
developing quality projects and programs. For more
information on the products of ERD and REMU, see the
Knowledge and Support Activities chapter.

To further support ADB’s economics work, the
Economics Committee and Network formed in early 2002
addressed issues relating to interdepartmental coordination
in developing economics knowledge products, provision of
economics services and collaboration, and maintenance of
ADB-wide consistency in economic products and services.

In 2002, the Committee mainly provided independent
assessment of, and feedback on, interregional knowledge
products from ADB's knowledge departments; checked for
overlap and duplication of products; facilitated collaboration among regions addressing similar functions; and
promoted consistent analytical approaches. The Committee
evaluated the macroeconomic reporting being done against
expected macroeconomic reporting needs. The role of the
Committee is to be expanded to provide oversight of the
ADB-wide 3-year rolling plan for economics knowledge
products, ensuring consistency between the plan and
economics knowledge product development, and to identify
issues for interdepartmental discussion. Although most of
the 2002 seminars on economics issues were arranged by
ERD, the Economics Network also hosted seminars,
including the Doha Development Round (see http://
www.adb.org/Economics/pdf/doha/).

Sector priorities

The nine sector committees (see Box above right) formed in
2002 have the same mandate as their thematic counterparts. Each sector committee and its interdisciplinary
network encourage professional development and quality
output. The committees aim to ensure that projects are
relevant to ADB policies, and that country strategies and
programs are designed to a high standard, have appropriate institutional arrangements, and address sustainability
and risks. The committees provide inputs and advice at the
project concept, design, and feasibility study stages.

Agriculture, natural resources,
and rural development

Ensuring environmental sustainability and better natural
resource management continued to challenge resource
managers in 2002. Accelerated growth has contributed to
the degradation of the region's natural resources. Forest
depletion has increased the vulnerability of soil erosion
that, in turn, has affected catchment areas. Overfishing
threatens fish stock regeneration. Drier regions face the
threat of reduced water availability and competition for
scarce water resources as urban and industrial demand
continues to rise. Protectionism re-emerged with the

subsidies among OECD countries.

ADB addressed these issues in 2002 with assistance
focused on agricultural productivity, natural resource
management, and rural development. Loans and technical
assistance addressed poverty reduction; improved food
security and diversification; aimed at alleviating natural
resource depletion, particularly in the forest and fisheries
subsectors; provided better access to basic public goods
and services; assisted governments in formulating policies
and undertaking policy reforms; enhanced economic
growth in the rural areas by investing in social services,
rural infrastructure, and rural support services; and
strengthened institutions for better resource management.

ADB joined the Asia Forest Partnership (AFP), an
initiative of the governments of Indonesia and Japan that
promotes sustainable forest management in Asia by
addressing good governance and forest law enforcement,
developing capacity for effective forest law enforcement,
countering illegal logging, preventing and fighting forest
fires, and rehabilitating and reforesting degraded lands. The
AFP was launched during the World Summit on Sustainable
Development in Johannesburg (see Box on the World
Summit on page 42).

ADB's Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Development
Committee was formed in 2002. Also in 2002, ADB prepared
a strategic framework for agriculture and rural development
and drafted an update of the 1995 forestry policy. More than
500 stakeholders participated in the review of the old policy,
providing valuable input for new policy development (see
http://www.adb.org/Projects/ForestPolicy/abt_flow.pdf).

Water

One in three Asians does not have safe drinking water and
one in two Asians lacks access to adequate sanitation
facilities. Water for food security remains a problem inIn 2002, ADB assistance in the water sector was
directed toward improved water services, integrated water resource management, and better
water governance—areas considered central to
ADB's poverty reduction mandate.

Twelve new loans were approved totaling
$667.5 million, consisting of four projects in water
supply and sanitation; five in water resource
management; and one project each in wastewater
management, irrigation, and hydropower. Water
sector loans represented about 12% of total ADB
lending. Twenty new water sector technical assistance grants were approved for about $23 million,
representing 13% of all ADB technical assistance
approvals.

In 2002, ADB provided wide-ranging assistance to
the agriculture, natural resources, and rural
development sector, including mobilizing resources
for forestry and poverty reduction; tackling Asia’s
brown cloud; addressing land degradation particularly in fragile environments; promoting sustainable development in mountain ecosystems;
reversing coral reef degradation; and promoting
regional cooperation.

Agricultural research to enhance productivity
continued to be a high priority. In 2002, ADB
approved the seventh regional technical assistance
on agriculture and natural resource research to
develop and disseminate technologies for environmentally sustainable farming systems. The technical assistance proposes to improve nutrition;
develop more efficient livestock systems; manage
agriculture and natural resources through improved
watershed management; and reduce poverty
through an advisory network, policy research, and
capacity strengthening.

In 2002, ADB approved 17 loans in the agriculture, natural resources, and rural development
sector totaling $492.9 million, and 24 technical
assistance grants amounting to $15.8 million.

development in the water sector and promote dialogue
with development partners for addressing the water sector
challenges in the Asia and Pacific region. Water Week
themes included promoting national water policies and

Education

ADB approved a new Policy on Education in 2002, aimed at
providing all children and adults in the Asia and Pacific
region with equitable access to an education that will
empower them to break out of the poverty cycle and
participate effectively in national development (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Education/). ADB's 1988
education policy had emphasized the importance of
investing in primary and secondary education in the
context of broader human and social development. The
new policy underpins ADB’s support for the MDGs, which

 

include enrolling all children in primary school, promoting
gender equality, and empowering women. The policy
focuses on increasing equity and access, improving quality,
strengthening management and partnerships, mobilizing
resources, and applying innovative technologies, especially
in information and communication technology.

In literacy and nonformal education, innovative and

PROVIDING QUALITY EDUCATION

 

ADB's resources are increasingly
being used to support capacity
building, enhance efficiency,
analyze policy, and improve quality. Two books published by ADB
in 2002 support these objectives.

To ensure that its lending to
education reflects the needs of the
region and its own strategic priorities, ADB financed a major study of
education trends, issues, and policies in the region. The output of
these efforts—Education and
National Development in Asia—
examines the trends and potential
problemsin education in the region,
in the context of the rapid social,
demographic, economic, and educational changes taking place. The

NUTRITIONAL SECURITY

 

The feasibility and effectiveness of
having nongovernment organizations (NGOs) deliver health services,
asan alternative to the Government
providing such services, was studied
under an ADB-financed project by
the Cambodia Government's Ministry of Health. The research conducted in 2001 and 2002 tested
two models: contracting out, where
contractors had complete responsibility for services delivery, and
contracting in, where the contractors worked within the government
system (see http: //www.adb.org/

Based on encouraging prospects for enriching rice germ plasm
with trace minerals, ADB approved
a project and organized a donor
consortium to support biofortification, which is research for
breeding iron- and zinc-dense rice
as alow-cost, sustainable approach
to reducing iron-deficiency anemia
and zinc deficiencies in Asia.

The broad objectives of ADB's

coverage of health services in contracted districts resulted in significant
improvements in a short time.
Contracted districts consistently outperformed the control districts with
respect to the predefined coverage
indicators. The contract-out model
outperformed the contract-in model.

Contracted districts experienced an impressive increase in the
use of reproductive health services,
child health services, and curative
health services. NGO-contracted
services were generally more effective in reaching the poor, both in
absolute and relative terms. Also,
there wasa significant decline in the

ADB's Health Committee provides guidance to the
regional departments in addressing health, nutrition,

integrated into projects. In 2002, the Health Committee
launched the six-volume ADB Nutrition and Development
Series; assessed the impact of the health policy on ADB and
DMC operations; and attended regional and global health,
nutrition, and agriculture strategy meetings.

In 2002, two health loans were approved totaling
$40 million.

Urban development, municipal services,
and housing

Most of the world’s urban growth is occurring in Asia. The
region's urban population grew from about 320 million
people in 1965, to over 1 billion people in 2002 and is
forecast to reach 2.2 billion people by 2020. Urban centers
are also increasing in size and number. A review of the
world’s 25 largest cities shows that 13 are located in Asia,
including 11 megacities, each with a population in excess
of 10 million. In addition, hundreds of millions of people
live in thousands of small, medium, and large towns and
cities throughout the region.

Urban areas are important to national economies.
They are the focal points for trade, commerce, industry,
and government administration. Cities and towns are
centers of excellence for education, health care, culture,
technological innovation, entrepreneurship, social services,
and governance. In addition, cities generate opportunities
for jobs, employment, and livelihood.

Most Asian towns face significant problems,
particularly high incidence of urban poverty; inadequate
and dilapidated water supplies, sanitation, and drainage
infrastructure; poor standards of public health and
hygiene; degraded urban environment; slum housing;
traffic congestion; ineffective land management; and
inadequate development control. These problems have a
disproportionate adverse impact on the lives of the urban
poor, compounding their misery. ADB's vision for the urban
sector is to promote safe, liveable, well-managed urban
centers, free of poverty, that fulfill the promise of
development. This vision is in line with the MDGs.

In 2002, ADB joined the Cities Alliance (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/TARS/REG/173_02. pdf), an

Energy

The energy sector continued to occupy a prominent
position in ADB’s lending and technical assistance
operations in its DMCs. The nature of ADB's assistance for
this sector has changed substantially over the years, with
increasing emphasis on sector reform, restructuring,
poverty reduction, climate change, and governance.

A seminar on electricity sector reforms in Asia at
ADB's 35" Annual Meeting in 2002 identified challenges
facing DMCs in ensuring access to stable and affordable
electricity supplies. The participants—senior DMC
government officials and private sector representatives—
agreed that deregulation and privatization are essential
elements of a power sector development strategy for the
region. The private sector participants proposed that DMC
governments divest themselves of their shareholdings in
the industry and focus instead on regulatory functions.

The impact of energy and transport infrastructure on
poverty reduction is being assessed by ADB, in collaboration with World Bank, Japan Bank for International
Cooperation, and the Department for International
Development of the United Kingdom. The study is aimed at

REFORMING THE ENERGY SECTOR

 

Viet Nam is rich in natural resources,
including natural gas, yet its energy
production is among the lowest
in Asia. To meet expected growth
in power demand and reduce
dependence on seasonal hydropower generation, Viet Nam must
develop its natural gas reserves for
power generation.

Gas reserves at the offshore
Nam Con Son Basin will be tapped
to fuel a least-cost power development plan. Five gas-fired combinedcycle power plants are planned for
the Phu My Power Generation
Complex, about 75 kilometers from
Ho Chi Minh City in southern Viet
Nam. ADB is providing financial
support for two of these plants (Phu
My 2.2 and Phu My 3) on a buildoperate-transfer (BOT) basis.

The projects are expected to
improve governance in the energy
sector by promoting best practices
and effective management of
public-private partnerships. The
projects will establish performance
benchmarks and promote the
sector’s financial sustainability.
Private sector participation in the

ADBassistance to the energy sector
in 2002 focused on sector reform
and restructuring, private sector
initiatives, energy conservation,
renewable energy development,
environmental protection, and
energy efficiency. Loans were
approved for Indonesia and the
Philippines to create the information and communication technology-based market facilities required
for bulk electricity trading, following the enactment of laws for
restructuring the power sector in
these two countries. In Sri Lanka, a
Power Sector Development Program
aims to establish an independent
regulatory and tariff-setting mechanism, and to encourage private
sector participation by developing
an enabling and transparent
business environment.

projects will also positively influence
other sectors.

The Phu My projects represent
an environment-friendly solution to
the power supply problem in Viet
Nam and will make competitively
priced power available within a
short period. They will feed the
national power grid, as well as the
industrial and residential areas of
southern Viet Nam. Areas covered
by the projects will increasingly
attract investments that can spur
economic growth and help reduce
poverty. The projects will also
contribute to government effortsto
electrify 85% of Vietnamese households by 2005.

The Phu My 2.2 Power Project,
a 715-megawatt plant, is ADB's
first private sector power project
in Viet Nam. It is also Viet Nam’s
first privately sponsored BOT
power project awarded through
internationally competitive bidding. The Project also marked the
first use of ADB's guarantor-ofrecord political risk guarantee
(PRG). The Project has been cited
as the project finance deal of the

publications.

The Project will be developed
and operated by Mekong Energy

among Hectricité de France International, Sumitomo Corporation of
Japan, and Tokyo Electric Power

For the Phu My 2.2 Project, ADB
provided a $50 million loan without
government guarantee and a $25
million PRG. Through the PRG, ADB
is catalyzing for Viet Nam up to $25
million of long-term debt from
commercial banks. As guarantor-ofrecord, ADB doesnot retain any portion of the risks covered.

The Phu My 3 Power Project—
with a capacity of 716.8 megawatts—is being undertaken by the
Phu My 3 BOT Power Company Ltd.,
jointly owned by BP Holdings BV,
SembCorp Utilities Pte Ltd., and the
consortium of Kyuden International
Corporation and Nissho Iwai Corporation. ADB is providing a $40 million loan and a $35 million PRG
(see box on page 65 in the Operations chapter).

ADB continued in 2002 to ensure that its assistance to
the energy sector is consistent with its objective of
protecting the environment. A project ADB is administering—Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency,
and Greenhouse Gas Abatement (PREGA)—is stimulating
interest on ways to control greenhouse gas emissions other
than carbon dioxide, such as methane and nitrous oxide,
emissions from sanitary landfills, solid waste dump sites,
wastewater treatment plants, rice paddy cultivation, coal
mines, and livestock. The PREGA will generate a pipeline of
renewable energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas
abatement investment projects for possible financing
through commercial, multilateral, and bilateral sources,
including specialized treaty-linked mechanisms such as the
Global Environment Facility and clean development
mechanism. The PREGA will also identify policy and
institutional barriers to disseminating renewable energy,
energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas abatement
investment projects of technologies, and study and
develop financing models.

Transport

Mobility and accessibility are important factors contributing to and resulting from economic and social development. As domestic economies in most DMCs expand, the
need for national transport infrastructure increases,
which in turn increases the demand for assistance to
the transport sector.

In 2002, ADB emphasized sustainable transport
development by implementing sector reforms on improving

 

governance, establishing more efficient and effective sector
agencies, introducing regulatory reforms for increased
participation by the private sector, and improving sector
financing and cost recovery. In the railway sector, support
was provided to Indian Railways to implement institutional
and policy reforms designed to strengthen the commercial
orientation of railway, increase private sector participation
in its activities, and finance strategic investments in highdensity traffic corridors. In several countries—including
Cambodia, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—ADB supported
the restructuring of sector institutions responsible for road
sector management. ADB provided assistance to improve
provincial roads that serve rural communities, study
options to improve public transport operations, and
prioritize future national road investment requirements.

In addition to country-specific assistance, ADB
implemented regionally focused projects in 2002, which
examined the serious environmental problem of deteriorating air quality. As vehicles are the primary cause of air
pollution, a regional technical assistance examined how
vehicle emissions could be reduced. Policy guidelines were
prepared on fuels and alternative fuels, vehicle inspection
and maintenance, the special problems associated with
two- and three-wheeled vehicles, and improved transport
planning and traffic management. ADB also initiated, with
the World Bank group and others, the Clean Air Initiative
for Asian Cities (see http://www.adb.org/Vehicle-Emissions/),
designed to promote awareness and improve air quality
through partnerships and shared experiences.

A second regional project is examining the linkage
between transport and poverty; field investigations and
analyses are ongoing.

Regional considerations featured
prominently in ADB's transport
operationsin 2002. In Cambodia,
support for road development will
benefit the Greater Mekong
Subregion and reduce poverty in
remote rural areas of the country.
While improvements in road asset
management and effective road
maintenance are key concerns,
improving links with neighboring
countries will facilitate subregional trade and tourism. ADB

help improve the northern economic corridor and, together with
financial assistance from the governments of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand,
road travel will be possible from

to northeast Thailand. In addition
to facilitating subregional trade,
the corridor will enable the northern portion of the Lao PDR to
participate in the region’s growing market economy.
Rehabilitating and repairing
the road network in Afghanistan
was accorded priority by ADB as
part of a postconflict multisector
program. Grant assistance was
also provided to restore effective
institutions and establish transparent processes for sector operations. In Bangladesh, assistance
was approved for improving
feeder roads that would provide
all-weather access to rural growth
center markets. In Cambodia, large
rural areasin the north will be made
accessible upon completion of the
primary road network around Tonle
Sap. Assistance was also provided
to Pakistan to support the reform
of road sector institutions, and

rehabilitate and maintain provincial
roads in Punjab Province.

In the Pacific, ADB aimed to
develop ports in the Fiji Islands and
improve outer island transport
infrastructure in the Marshall Islands.

In India, a sector development
program to the state of Madhya
Pradesh supported road sector
institutional reformsand rehabilitation of the state road network. A
loan to the National Highway
Authority of India also supported
institutional development, aswell as
provided resources to extend the
interurban expressway network.
Following extensive policy dialogue,
Sri Lanka initiated a program to
reform the national and provincial
road administration departments.

In 2002, ADB approved
13 loans for $1.6 billion and provided 35 technical assistance grants

Transport contributes to poverty
reduction by enabling the productive activities that create pro-poor
economic growth, and by providing poor people, especially those
living in rural areas, with access to
economic opportunities and social
services, and means of participating fully in society.

The extent of this contribution
is affected by the overall economic,
social, and governance setting in the
country or region in question; and
by the framework of transport
sector policies, institutions, and
governance arrangements.

Since the utility of transport
requiresthe complementary roles of
infrastructure and services, ADB
assistance increasingly involves
support for both infrastructure and
services improvement to ensure the
whole transport package works
effectively.

In some countries, ADB is
promoting the development of link
roads alongside investment in primary roads, for ensuring that the
poverty reduction gains from both
efficiency and accessibility are realized. A further dimension isthe need
to incorporate mitigation of possible adverse impacts of transport,
including road safety and social and
environmental hazards.

Recent studies have tried to
quantify the poverty reduction
impact of transport, but without
great success, because most of the
contributions of transport to poverty reduction are indirect, often
widely dispersed among the population, and take place through
multiple rounds of effects.

In principle, general equilibrium econometric modeling may
be a tool for sifting out these
impacts. However, it isfar from clear

whether such a complex relationship
can be reliably modeled.

Another approach to improving
our understanding of this subject is
through micro- and meso-level
studies to examine how past transport interventions contributed to
poverty reduction at the community
level. While this approach does not
quantify the impacts outside of the
selected communities, it may identify the mechanisms through which
transport contributes, and the
complementary and inhibiting factors; and may quantify impacts at
the community level. Studies of this
kind are being undertaken in the
People’s Republic of China, India,
and Thailand as part of an ADB
project that is assessing the impact
of transport and energy infrastructure on poverty reduction. The
results of this work are expected in
the second half of 2003.

 

ADB also continued to find ways of improving road
sector management. Work focused on improved road
financing mechanisms and support for the highway
development and management model planning tool, which
was designed in conjunction with other funding agencies.
Several DMCs now use this tool for highway planning and
sector resource programming. With an increasing number
of people killed and injured on the region's road networks,
a regional study (see http:/Avww.adb.org/Documents/TARs/
REG/tar_stu_36046.pdf) was formulated to address road
safety issues in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) region.

Finance, industry, and trade

Financial sector issues continued to impact on the region's
development in 2002. Many countries affected by the Asian
financial crisis and transitional economies continued efforts
to restructure their banking systems to achieve financial
stability and ensure that new lending is based on sound
commercial principles. Banking supervision is being
improved in several DMCs in line with the Basel Core
Principles to prevent future systemic crises. The Basel
Capital Accord was discussed at a seminar in the 35"
Annual Meeting in May 2002 (see http://www.adb.org/
AnnualMeeting/2002/Seminars/presentations/elmekkawy_
presentation.pdf). The legal and institutional framework
for debt recovery is being strengthened to deal with
unresolved problems of nonperforming loans that
impede new lending.

To reduce dependence on short-term bank financing
for long-term investments and enhance allocation
efficiency, several DMCs also sought to further develop

 

their capital markets. ADB supported efforts to strengthen
the regulation and supervision of securities markets in
accordance with international standards and practices. ADB
also supported efforts to improve market infrastructure,
introduce more stringent corporate governance requirements, establish a policy environment that ensures efficient
allocation of domestic savings, and develop an institutional
investor base. Financial governance regimes in several
DMCs are being strengthened by introducing international
accounting standards and more stringent financial
disclosure requirements.

Also, in 2002, ADB increased its trade-related
technical assistance to help its DMCs participate in the new
trade round and address various difficulties arising from
the implementation of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
agreements. Several regional technical assistance projects
focused on capacity building for WTO agreements, trade
facilitation, trade promotion, and cooperation.

Rural and microfinance

Asia's rural financial markets need to be improved to meet
the challenges of the 21% century, according to an ADBfunded study published in 2000 (see http:/Avww.adb.org/
Documents/Books/Rural_Asia/Rural_Financial_Markets/.
Given this, and the fact that two thirds of the world’s
poor live in Asia and the Pacific and about 60% of the
region's total population live in rural areas, ADB
continued in 2002 to emphasize the development of rural
financial services.

ADB's goal in the sector is to ensure that rural
households have permanent access to a broad range of
sustainable financial services. Recognizing the correlation

ADB addressed financial sector
issues in several of its developing
member countries (DMCs). The
Financial Sector Program (Subprogram Il) loan in Cambodia resulted
in the adoption of a system and
supported policy sector reform
efforts in several transition
economies for the early identification of problem banks, and
improved surveillance and inspection procedures for banking
supervision. Accounting and auditing standards and an enforcement
system are also expected. In the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR), policy dialogue, in conjunction with the Banking Sector Reform
Program loan, led to the adoption
of aperformance-based operational
and financial restructuring program
for state-owned banks.

Amendments to the capital
markets, pension, and insurance
laws to strengthen supervision and
regulation and provide for international best practices and standards
are being promoted in Indonesia's
2002 Financial Governance and
Social Security Reform Program
(Phase 1). Pakistan’s Financial
(Nonbank) Markets and Governance
Program seeks to strengthen
investor confidence through
improved governance, transparency, and investor protection.

ADB supported policy dialogue
for alegal framework for antimoney

laundering in Indonesia, and
assisted Fiji Islands, Indonesia, and
Philippines in establishing financial
intelligence units in line with the
reporting and monitoring requirements under their respective
antimoney laundering legislation.

In the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) and Thailand, ADB
provided assistance to facilitate the
transformation of pension systems
from unfunded pay-as-you-go
systems toward fully funded defined
contribution systems. In Indonesia,
social protection is being strengthened through measures that seek
to improve governance, supervision, and regulation of pension
funds and mandatory social insurance programs.

need to be in line with financial
sector development to achieve real
sector growth. Technical assistance
to Indonesia, Philippines, and
Samoa supported the provision of
SME finance by developing sustainable credit enhancement and information mechanisms. ADB also

expanded its support for subregional project development facilities. In 2002, regional technical
assistance was approved to promote
SME growth in the subregion of
Bangladesh, Bhutan, (northeast)
India, and Nepal.

In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Cambodia, Lao PDR
Thailand, and Viet Nam agreed on
the mechanisms needed to harmonize customs declaration documents, and on the inspection
procedures and the evaluation
criteria for use along the GMS economic corridors. Technical assistance projects were initiated for
enforcing World Trade Organization rules by the judicial system in
the PRC, regional customs cooperation in the Kyrgyz Republic, and
a trade policy review in Mongolia.
In addition, two loans were
approved for the Kyrgyz Republic
and Tajikistan to strengthen the
governance and operations of customs organizations, improve the
customslegal and regulatory framework in line with international standards, and develop amechanism for
regional cooperation.

In 2002, ADB approved 9 financial sector, 2 trade sector, and
1 SME-related loans totaling
$735 million; and 22 financial sector, 9 trade sector, and 11 SMErelated technical assistance projects
totaling $26.3 million.

between rural finance and broad-based, inclusive rural
development in reducing poverty, ADB placed integration
of rural and microfinance with the broader financial
system at the core of its strategic thrusts and adopted the
financial system development approach in its rural and
microfinance operations.

ADB focuses on three broad strategic areas in its rural
and microfinance operations: creating an enabling policy
environment; building the financial infrastructure necessary
for improving rural and microfinance services; and
strengthening rural and microfinance institutions.

ADB held workshops in 2002 in Bangladesh and the
Philippines to improve DMC understanding of the
commercialization of microfinance, and began publishing
the study results (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Reports/Commercialization_Microfinance/BAN/).

In partnership with other funding agencies to support
the development of microfinance services, ADB continued
to assist the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest

60 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

(CGAP) (see http://Avww.adb.org/Documents/TARS/REG/
tar_oth35011.pdf).

A highlight of ADB's rural and microfinance sector
operations in 2002 was its participation in the voluntary
donor peer review of microfinance operations, a program
initiated by the CGAP and the Government of the United
Kingdom to help funding agencies improve the effectiveness of their microfinance assistance. ADB was among the
first six funding agencies to volunteer for the review. An
international multi-donor team of microfinance experts
reviewed ADB's microfinance operations in July. Recommendations were made available to the public shortly after.
ADB also participated in the review process with the United
Nations Development Programme and the United Nations
Capital Development Fund in October.

Following its policy to support aid coordination, ADB
assisted in formulating CGAP’'s new strategy and charter.

Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, policymakers
have attached considerable importance to the
development of bond markets in Asia to reduce the
vulnerability of overdependence on bank financing
and provide alternative investment options to
investors. Essential to bond market development is
credit rating; it provides a risk pricing mechanism
and assists investors and financial intermediaries to
differentiate among debt issues and arrive at informed
investment decisions. Quality credit rating also has
an important role to play in promoting sound corporate governance and financial market supervision.

The development of domestic credit rating
agencies (CRAs) has been slow and uneven across
the region, limiting investors’ access to affordable
quality rating services. To strengthen the capacity
of domestic CRAs, the Association of Credit Rating
Agencies in Asia (ACRAA) was established in
September 2001 by members from Bangladesh;
India; Indonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea;
Malaysia; Pakistan; Philippines; Taipei,China; and
Thailand to harmonize rating standards and adopt
best practices. ACRAA encourages its members to
share sound practices and policies, and to attain
high performance standards. Establishing greater
credibility is the bedrock of credit rating services.

ADB was a sponsoring partner of ACRAA.
Through its Regional Economic Monitoring Unit,
ADB provides technical assistance to ACRAA and
its members in capacity building. The technical

To translate its operational priorities in rural and
microfinance into concrete actions in Pakistan,
ADB approved a Rural Finance Sector Development Program in 2002 to assist the Government
in addressing key constraints in rural and
microfinance and to strengthen the reform
program. A loan for Uzbekistan for Small and
Microfinance Development will create a viable and
sustainable institutional framework and mechanism for effective delivery of financial services,
particularly to poor, low-income households, and
small and microenterprises.

A technical assistance grant is aimed at
strengthening the Central Bank of Uzbekistan’s
institutional capacity for prudential regulation
and supervision of savings and credit unions. In
addition, ADB approved a microfinance component project to test interventions on a limited
scale in urban sectors in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and one rural finance
component project for plantation development
in Sri Lanka. ADB continued its technical assistance to improve rural finance operations in the
Lao PDR, initiating a diagnostic study on the
Agriculture Promotion Bank, which is expected
to assist policymakers in reforming this bank to
provide rural financial services more efficiently
and sustainably.

A Project and program evaluations highlight the importance of
beneficiary participation and stakeholder ownership, multiple
synergistic interventions based on client demand, capacity building
for local government, social preparation for the poor prior to
physical investments, and arrangements for effective implementation

with nongovernment organizations and communities.n pursuing its objectives, the Asian Development

Bank (ADB) provides various forms of financial

assistance to its developing member countries

(DMCs). The main instruments are loans, technical

assistance, grants, equity investments, and

guarantees, which are met through funding sources
such as ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR); its Special
Funds—resources for funding operations that are solely
under ADB's administration; or trust funds—external monies
that ADB administers on behalf of donors. ADB's resources
and operations in 2002 are summarized in this chapter. Also
included in this chapter is a summary of the evaluations
conducted in 2002 of ADB’s projects and programs. For more
on the OCR and the Asian Development Fund (ADF), see the
Management's Discussion and Analysis chapter.

Loans

Lending for both public and private sector operations in 2002
amounted to $5,676 million for 89 loans in 71 projects,
compared with $5,339 million for 76 loans in 60 projects in
2001. The $337 million increase in total lending from 2001
to 2002 was largely due to a $272 million rise in ADF
lending—of which $150 million went to Afghanistan as ADB
resumed operations in the country after 23 years. The
average loan size in 2002 was $64 million.

Of the total lending, loans with government guarantee
were over $5,531 million for 67 projects, comprising
$3,898 million for 32 loans from the OCR and $1,633 million for 53 loans from the concessional ADF. Of the public
sector loan approvals, 15 were policy-based programs
amounting to $1,685 million, representing 30.5% of total
public sector lending. Of the program lending, $1,300 million or 77.2% will be funded by the OCR and $385 million
or 22.8% by the ADF. Policy-based programs include program loans and program loan components of sector development program loans, provided to support DMCs’ effort to
improve the policy, institutional, and investment environment, and help meet short-term adjustments costs. Lending
to the private sector without government guarantee
amounted to $145 million for four loans in four projects.

The largest borrowing DMC was India ($1,184 million,
or 21% of total), followed by Pakistan, People's Republic of
China (PRC), Indonesia, and Viet Nam. The transport and
communications sector received the largest share of loans,
$1,613 million or 28.4% of total lending in 2002, followed
by energy, finance, social infrastructure, agriculture and
natural resources, multisector, and industry and nonfuel
minerals. The “Others” sector received 14% of total lending.
This includes projects not falling under the economic sector
classification that ADB uses, such as central government
administration, operation and regulation, customs operations, public sector reform programs, judicial and legislative
operations, public finance management, fiscal reforms,
environment projects, gender and governance, and tourism.
For details, see tables 1-6 in the Statistical Annex.

The project mix of the 67 public sector loan projects
and programs, based on a thematic classification, consisted
of 18 projects (26.8%) supporting economic growth;

 

6 projects (9%) supporting human development; 3 projects
(4.5%) supporting environmental protection; 2 projects (3%)
supporting good governance; 1 project (1.5%) supporting
gender and development as the main theme; and 37 projects
(55.2%) classified as multithemes/others. Multithematic
projects include a combination of two or more themes such
as economic growth, environmental protection, good
governance, private sector development, human development, regional cooperation, and gender and development.
For more on lending, see http://www.adb.org/Finance/.

Technical assistance

A total of 324 technical assistance grants for $179.0 million
were approved in 2002. This represents a 23% increase,
compared with $145.5 million in 2001. The increase is
primarily attributed to funds made available by multilateral
and bilateral sources. Of the technical assistance grants
approved, 87 were for project preparation; 160 for advisory
and operational purposes; and 77 for regional activities
such as conferences, research, studies, and training. Of the
total, $56 million will be financed from the OCR current
income, $46.7 million from the Technical Assistance
Special Fund (TASF), $36.4 million from the Japan Special
Fund (JSF), $9.6 million from the Asian Currency Crisis
Support Facility (ACCSF), and the remaining $30.3 million
from other multilateral and bilateral sources.

The largest recipient of country-specific technical
assistance grants (excluding regional technical assistance)
was Indonesia ($19.1 million or 14%), followed by
Afghanistan ($15.1 million or 11%), India ($13.2 million or
10%), and PRC ($13.2 million or 10%).

By sector (excluding regional technical assistance),
social infrastructure ($22.1 million or 16%) received the
largest share, followed by multisector ($20.3 million or
14.6%), finance ($17.5 million or 12.6%), transport and
communications ($16.2 million or 11.7%), agriculture and
natural resources ($15.8 million or 11.4%), energy
($11.5 million or 8.3%), and industry and nonfuel minerals
($6.3 million or 4.6%). Other technical assistance received
$28.8 million or 20.8% of the total. For more on technical
assistance activities, see http://www.adb.org/ta/ and tables

Fifteen ADB projects received grant cofinancing amounting
to $221.4 million from bilateral and multilateral sources in
2002. Components of ADB projects were cofinanced by the
Netherlands ($71.8 million), Japan ($50.0 million), United
Kingdom ($34.2 million), Denmark ($30.3 million), Germany
($16.9 million), and the Global Environment Facility ($10.3 million). Other donors contributed a further $7.9 million.

Sixteen projects were fully funded by grant financing
provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR)
($49.3 million), and two by the Japan Fund for Information
and Communication Technology ($0.68 million). For details,
see the Management's Discussion and Analysis chapter, and
tables 7, 35, and 36 in the Statistical Annex.

Equity investments

ADB approved equity investments in four private sector
projects in 2002 amounting to $35.5 million, which are
expected to mobilize $175.1 million in additional capital
flows. The approvals were made in a central depository
facility in Bangladesh, two investment funds in the PRC and
India, and a mortgage credit guarantee in India. For details,
see Table 10 in the Statistical Annex.

Cofinancing and guarantee operations

Cofinancing from both official and commercial sources
enhances the benefits and impact of ADB projects. ADB's
intensified efforts in 2002 to mobilize additional resources
led to a significant increase in cofinancing, both in the
number of cofinanced loan projects and in the volume of
commercial cofinancing and guarantee
operations. Cofinancing mobilized from
all sources amounted to $2,851 million
for 38 public and private sector loan
projects. Total cofinancing mobilized in
2002 was more than double the
amount mobilized in 2001, and
equivalent to half of ADB’s total
lending of $5,676 million during the
year. This was the sixth consecutive
year in which cofinancing was
arranged for more than 40% of ADB
loan projects. For details, see Table 7 in
the Statistical Annex.

Fifteen DMCs received cofinancing in 2002. The PRC received the
largest amount of about $767 million,
primarily from its domestic financial institutions, followed
by Viet Nam with $609.5 million and the Philippines
with $545.5 million.

Since 1970, cofinancing and guarantee operations
have mobilized a cumulative total of $38.3 billion,
providing additional resources for 609 ADB-assisted loan
projects and programs. The cumulative total comprises
$22.3 billion from official sources, and $16 billion from
commercial sources and export credit agencies. The

followed by transport and communications ($8.2 billion
or 21%), agriculture and natural resources ($4.2 billion or
11%), social infrastructure ($3.3 billion or 9%), and other
sectors ($5.8 billion or 15%).

Official cofinancing: ADB maintained proactive
and close interaction with its development partners
through regular consultations and discussions. In 2002,
a total of $754.5 million in official cofinancing was
provided by ADB's development partners in grant funds
($221.4 million) and loans ($533.1 million) for 29 loan
projects. Japan provided cofinancing of $275.5 million for
six loan projects, followed by France with $80.3 million
for four loan projects, and the Netherlands with
$71.8 million for four loan projects. The European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development provided $49 million
for the Regional Power Transmission Modernization
Project in the Central Asian republics. Other major
multilateral cofinanciers include the OPEC Fund for
International Development ($30.9 million), International
Development Association ($27.0 million), International
Finance Corporation ($20.0 million), and Nordic
Development Fund ($14.1 million).

In 2002, 64 technical assistance projects were
cofinanced by 71 grants for a total of $30.3 million from
the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, and United Kingdom; the
ADB-administered multidonor cooperation funds; the
World Bank; and the Global Environment Facility.

Fifteen loan projects received grant cofinancing
amounting to $221.4 million from bilateral and
multilateral sources in 2002.

During the year, the United
Kingdom made an initial contribution
of $60 million toward the establishment of the Poverty Reduction
Cooperation Fund, a multidonor fund
administered by ADB (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/
PRF/). Norway committed $2 million
for the existing Governance
a Cooperation Fund. The Netherlands
made an additional contribution of
$4 million to its existing Cooperation
Fund for the Water Sector (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/Others/
Cofinancing/IN30_03.pdf). The Swiss
Cooperation Fund for Consulting
Services was also replenished in the
amount of $600,000 (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Others/Cofinancing/IN70_02. pdf).

Commercial cofinancing and guarantee
operations: Commercial cofinancing in 2002 amounted to
$2,097 million for 12 projects, compared with $933 million
for 8 projects in 2001. Of the 2002 total, $885 million was
raised using ADB guarantees, $249 million was export
credit, and $963 million was parallel cofinancing, mainly
from domestic financial institutions in the PRC.ADB guarantees played a key role
in resource mobilization efforts in
2002; this is illustrated by the
transactions described below.

Philippines: Power Sector
Restructuring Program

In 1998, ADB approved this program in the amount of $300 million to support the power sector
restructuring process in the Philippines. ADB's financial support was
further augmented by $300 million
cofinancing from the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC). In
late 2002, ADB further extended its
support for the program by guaranteeing a 61.8 billion Japanese yen
Eurobond issued by the project
executing agency, the Philippines’
Power Sector Assets and Liabilities
Management Corporation (PSALM).
The bond proceeds will help in the
initial stages of power sector
privatization. This increased the
total financial assistance to the vital
power sector reformsto more than
$1 billion. The bond issue was lead
managed by Nomura International.
ADB supported the issue by means
of a partial credit guarantee,
covering the repayment of principal at final maturity and the payment of interest coupons for the

Of the 12 projects funded by
commercial cofinancing in 2002, four
projects were supported by ADB
guarantees. Guarantee operations
comprised a partial credit guarantee
(PCG) of $500 million in support of a
bond issue for the Power Sector
Restructuring Program (see box above)
in the Philippines, and four political
risk guarantees (PRGs) in three projects
with an aggregate total of $385 million.! From 1988 to end-2002, ADB
issued a total of 12 PCGs and 6 PRGs to
mobilize about $2.4 billion in
commercial cofinancing through
syndicated loans and capital market
instruments. For more on ADB's

last 10 years of the bond. The ADB
guarantee was backstopped by a
counterguarantee provided by the
Government, and ensured PSALM’s
access to competitive and long-term
(18- and 20-year) funds. This led to
reduced financing costs and enabled
PSALM to pass savings on to consumers at an earlier stage than
would otherwise have been possible.

In the words of ADB President
Tadao Chino, ADB's support of the
bond issue helped the Philippines
“maintain the momentum of essential reforms in the power sector.
These will provide clear benefits to
the poor through lower electricity
prices, better service, and stronger
growth, as well as send an important positive message to private
investors.” For more on this program and the President’s comments,

sponsors are Hectricité de France
International, Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, and Tokyo Hectric
Power Company Incorporated.

ADB support for this pioneering BOT power project consisted
of a $50 million direct loan and a
$25 million political risk guarantee (PRG). The PRG supported
borrowing from a syndicate of
commercial lenders. ANZ Investment Bank, Société Générale, and
Sumitomo Mitsui Bank acted as
co-lead arrangers for the PRG
facility. Other lenders to the
project include JBIC, Proparco of
France, and World Bank.

This transaction marks the
first PRG in which ADB acted as
guarantor-of-record, supported by
Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd., a
private political risk insurer. ADB's
guarantee was provided without a
government counterguarantee.

The Phu My 2.2 Power Project
was recently awarded “Project

Asia and AsiaMoney, and “Asian
Power Deal of the Year” by Project
Finance, among others. For more on
this project, see page 57 and http:

Portfolio management

In 2002, ADB continued to strengthen
its ability to monitor and manage its
loan and technical assistance portfolio.
Improvements were made to ADB's
project performance reporting system—
an automated, in-house reporting tool
for monitoring ongoing loan projects—
based on operational experiences
gained in 2001. Work commenced on
developing a similar performance
reporting system for technical
assistance projects. Revised Project
Administration Instructions (PAIs) were
issued to staff. These incorporate
improvements in business processes

and changes in the delegation of authority. To complement

the revisions, an electronic question-and-answer facility
was launched to assist staff with the PAlIs.

ADB's portfolio reviews with governments were
expanded in 2002, bringing to 17 the number of countries

covered by this exercise. Portfolio reviews in several

Arevised classification system for
ADB's developing member countries (DMCs), approved by the
Board of Directors in December
1998, took effect on 1 January
1999. Two criteria—per capita
gross national product and debt
repayment capacity—are used to
determine the classification of
borrowing DMCs" into Groups A,
B1, B2, and C. The classification
determines the eligibility of DMCs
to borrow from the Asian Development Fund (ADF).

Group A (ADF only) includes
Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia,
Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic,
Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar,
Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands,
Tajikistan, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Group B1 (ADF with limited
amounts of ordinary capital
resources [OCR]) includes
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cook
Islands,? Marshall Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tonga, and
Viet Nam.

Group B2 (OCR with limited
amounts of ADF) includes People’s
Republic of China, India, Indonesia,°
Nauru, and Papua New Guinea.

Group C (OCRonly) includes Fiji
Islands, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan.

In addition, the criteria for
graduation from regular ADB
assistance were established. Four
members—Hong Kong, China;
Republic of Korea; Singapore; and
Taipei, China—have graduated from
regular ADB assistance.

The country classification also
impacts on operations with regard
to cost-sharing limits and domestic
preferences. The normal costsharing limits for project loans by
ADB change for the borrowing
DMCs as follows: 80% for Group A,
70% for Group B1, 60% for Group
B2, and 40% for Group C. On 28
November 2002, the Board of
Directors approved a paper “Review
of Cost-Sharing Limits for Project
Financing as an Element of ADB's
1998 Graduation Policy.” Effective

1 January 2003, ADBwill apply new
cost-sharing limits for project loans
as follows: 80% for Group A,* 75%
for Group B1, 70% for Group B2,
and 65% for Group C. The government contribution to technical
assistance should be at least 15%
of the total technical assistance
costs for Group A, 20% for Groups
B1 and B2, and 30% for Group C.
The contribution will be subject to

www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/Resident_Mission/.

Ninety-seven projects were completed during the year.
Sixty-eight project completion reports were circulated in
2002, bringing to 1,057 the total number of reports
prepared as of end-2002. For details, see Table 14 in the
Statistical Annex.

Contract awards: Contracts totaling $4.3 billion
(excluding contracts for technical assistance projects)
were awarded in 2002 by executing agencies in DMCs for
engaging consulting services and procuring goods,
related services, and civil works. Contract awards
increased 69% over 2001, but this was still less than the
annual projection due to contract awards slippages in a
few borrowing countries. Consultancy contracts under
loan projects totaled $125.2 million. For details, see tables
15-23 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements: In 2002, loan disbursements of
$4.2 billion achieved the projection for the year, and were
higher than disbursements of $3.8 billion in 2001, mainly
due to an increase in program loan disbursements. Of the
total disbursements, $2.0 billion or 48% was for project
loans, followed by program, sector, and private sector
loans. For 2001 and 2002 disbursements by lending modality,
see tables 8 and 15 in the Statistical Annex.

Project implementation and administration
seminars: ADB continued to conduct seminars in 2002 to
help DMCs adapt to ADB's current project implementation
and administration policies, practices, and procedures.
Eight seminars highlighted key aspects and specific
features, including new developments, the use of
consultants, and procurement and disbursement procedures. Each session lasted 2 weeks. Seven of the eight
were in-country seminars held in Bangladesh, Cambodia,
PRC, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka, attracting a
total of 258 participants. A regional seminar for the Kyrgyz
Republic and Tajikistan, attended by 40 participants, was
held in Bishkek, Kyrgyz Republic. Another regional seminar
was held at ADB headquarters where 47 DMC representatives and 4 observers participated. In addition, two project
implementation seminars were held at ADB headquarters
for ADB staff.

ADB conducted five seminars for government and
executing agency officials in 2002 to explain ADB's
procedures for recruiting consultants under loan projects.
These seminars, attended by 156 participants, were held in
Bangladesh, India, Lao PDR, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea.
Five seminars for DMC consultants explained business
opportunities with ADB and the procedures for consultants
to register and express interest in assignments. These
seminars were conducted in Bhutan, PRC, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
and Viet Nam, with a total of 262 participants. Feedback
received from participants indicated a high level of
satisfaction and noted the relevance of the seminars.

 

Business opportunities seminars: Twenty-seven
seminars on business opportunities were conducted in 2002
in 15 countries: Australia; Canada; Denmark; Finland;
Germany; Indonesia; Japan; Malaysia; New Zealand;
Norway; Portugal; Sweden; Taipei,China; United Kingdom;
and United States. The 1,625 participants received an
overview of business opportunities under ADB-financed
loans and technical assistance, and were given advice on
procurement policies and procedures, including evaluation
and comparison of bids and consulting proposals.

Based on participant feedback, the seminars helped
create an awareness of business opportunities from ADBfinanced projects. The seminars also helped increase
competition among prospective suppliers and consultants
in offering ADB DMCs the most appropriate goods and
services at the lowest price.

Introduction of quality and
cost-based selection

In line with the prevailing practices of other multilateral
development banks, the Board of Directors approved in
2002 the introduction of quality and cost-based selection
(QCBS) as a method for selecting consulting firms under
ADB-funded technical assistance and loan projects. As of
1 April 2002, the QCBS is ADB’s preferred method. While
the QCBS requires ADB and borrowers to consider the
competing firms’ proposed prices, quality of services
remains the most important consideration. The evaluation
of a firm’s proposal is weighted at 80% for technical quality
and 20% for cost.

To support the introduction of the QCBS, ADB
conducted five briefings at its headquarters and 14
briefings in resident missions to explain the procedures for
using the new method to staff and executing agency
officials concerned. Relevant documents were revised,
including the handbook for users of consulting services, the
PAIs, and the request for proposals. A new guide for
preparing terms of reference was developed for staff and
executing agencies.

The introduction of the QCBS is expected to help ADB
use its limited funds for engaging consultants more
efficiently. The QCBS also increases the transparency of
selections because the shortlisted firms’ financial proposals
are opened in public and the firms’ technical scores are
read out loud to those attending. The Board of Directors
will review the implementation of the QCBS in 2004. For
more on the QCBS, see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Guidelines/Consulting/con_selection.asp.

Private sector operations portfolio

ADB's private sector portfolio continued in 2002 to
leverage and catalyze other funding sources. Cumulative
approval since ADB's first private sector investment in 1983
amounted to $2.2 billion in the form of direct loans and
equity investments, financing 155 projects, mobilizing
$18.4 billion in total resources, and leveraging ADB
investments by a ratio of 7.4 times. Of these approvals,
cumulative disbursements amounted to $1.5 billion.

(50.2%), followed by
investment funds
and financial
institutions at $464.9 million (37.7%), with the balance
accounted for by other sectors at $148.8 million (12.1%).

To free up capital resources for new investments,
ADB actively sought the full and partial divestments of
equity shareholdings in 14 project companies, resulting
in net returns of 68% over investment cost. Five loans
totaling $65.5 million in approvals were fully repaid
during the year.

At the end of 2002, 91 private sector projects were
under administration, net of repayments, cancellations, and
divestments. Of the total number of projects, 16 were in
regional financial entities and funds. Operationally,

65 companies demonstrated strong financial performance,
6 performed marginally, and 20 underperformed. Risk
management continued to be directed toward resolving
underperforming accounts. Two projects were liquidated
and foreclosed, two projects were restructured, and one
project was repaid in full.

Interest, net realized capital gains, and other income
earned on the private sector portfolio decreased to
$29.8 million in 2002, relative to the $32.7 million level of
2001. Dividend income decreased from $13.2 million
(4.9% yield) in 2001 to $8.6 million in 2002.

Allowance for possible losses on the portfolio
decreased from $144.5 million in 2001 to $137.3 million in
2002. The loss reserve ratio was at 20.1% of the outstanding portfolio as at end-2002, compared with 21.1% in 2001.

In its private sector operations, ADB continues to
strengthen risk management by implementing an
independent credit review process at every stage of project
processing prior to approval. Project administration is
enhanced by more rigorous reviews. Investments that
exhibit early signs of vulnerability are given special
attention to arrest further deterioration of project quality.
Intensive recovery efforts on impaired and nonperforming
investments, mostly of earlier discontinued investments in
manufacturing and industry, have achieved substantial
results with the closure of two such projects in 2002. ADB’s
experience from these impaired investments provides
crucial lessons for future investment activities. For details,
see tables 10-13 in the Statistical Annex.

Resource transfers

Compared with the net transfer of resources from ADB to
its DMCs of $464.3 million in 2001, there was net inflow of
$1.4 billion to ADB from its DMCs in 2002. During the year,
net transfers from ADB to ADF borrowers increased from
$658.4 million in 2001 to $717.8 million in 2002. However,
there was a net
inflow of $2.1 billion ($194.1 million
in 2001) to ADB

tables 8 and 15 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan service payments reached $5.6 billion in 2002,
compared with $3.4 billion in 2001. The increase was
mainly because of higher prepayments ($2.0 billion in 2002,
$52.5 million in 2001).

In 2002, the four largest net resource transfers from
ADB were to Viet Nam, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and
Afghanistan (by magnitude) (see tables 29 and 30 in the
Statistical Annex).

Performance evaluation and
development impact

The Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
independently evaluates ADB's operations, including the
performance of selected projects, programs, and technical
assistance about 3 years after completion. It also
undertakes thematic evaluation studies in the form of
impact, special, and country assistance program evaluations. In 2002, OED completed 48 evaluation reports. This
included 31 project or program performance audit,

6 technical assistance, 3 country assistance program,

6 special and impact evaluation, and 2 annual reports.
OED prepared for the first time a report evaluating the
performance of ADB's portfolio of ongoing projects and
programs. OED was further strengthened in 2002 with an
advisor post for identifying appropriate indicators for
measuring development effectiveness.

Project and program performance
audit reports

In 2002, 27 public sector projects and 6 programs that
were completed in or around 1998 were assessed in
30 reports. Based on five evaluation criteria—relevance,
efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, and institutional/other
development impacts—4 projects/programs (12%) were
rated highly successful, 23 successful (70%), and 6 partly
successful (18%). None was rated unsuccessful. These
results continue a trend toward higher success rates for
projects and programs. There is little difference in success
rates among country groups. Partly successful and
successful projects/programs appeared in all four country
groups (A, BI, B2, and C; see box on country classification
on page 66), and highly successful projects in three of
them. Of 15 infrastructure projects and programs—6 in
energy and 9 in transport and communications—3 were
highly successful, 11 successful, and 1 program partly
successful. Of 10 agriculture and 5 social sector projects,
10 were successful and 5 partly successful. The other
3 projects/programs were successful or highly successful.
In addition, one private sector project was evaluated and
rated successful. To view evaluation reports, go to http://
www.adb.org/evaluation/.

Of the six programs, four (67%) were rated successful
and two (33%) were partly successful. All four successful

 

 

programs, including agriculture sector programs for the
Kyrgyz Republic and Viet Nam, achieved their program
purpose with impacts likely to be sustained. On the other
hand, the partly successful Agriculture Sector Program in
Mongolia accomplished only three fourths of policy reform
measures and experienced some key policy reversals. Of
the 27 public sector projects, 4 (15%) were rated highly
successful, 19 (70%) successful, and 4 (15%) partly
successful. The sector lending approach resulted in the
highly successful Third and Fourth Power Transmission
(Sector) projects in Thailand and the successful Tenth and
Eleventh Road (Sector) projects in Indonesia.

The highly successful National Air Navigation
Development Project in Mongolia generates significant
foreign exchange earnings from overflights, and has
improved safety and efficiency at Ulaanbaatar Airport. The
highly successful Laiwu Steel Modernization Project in the
PRC has been a model for modernization in the steel
industry and the reform of state-owned enterprises. On the
other hand, the four partly successful agriculture projects
showed some weaknesses in their design and implementation. The Employment Generation Project in Mongolia and
Second Barani Area Development Project in Pakistan were
not effective in reaching out to the majority of their
intended poor beneficiaries. For some successful projects,
outcomes were constrained by the lack of beneficiary
participation and limited impact on poverty.

The performance audit reports confirmed project
completion report ratings for 27 public sector projects/
programs, and reclassified 6. The Bangladesh Railway
Recovery Program was reclassified from generally
successful to partly successful owing to a relapse in both
program components and progress toward financial
sustainability. Exceptionally, another five projects/programs
were reclassified from partly successful to successful in
recognition of sustainable achievements, and associated
institutional and socioeconomic development impacts.

Lessons: The evaluations provided several lessons.
For poverty reduction, the evaluations highlight the
importance of beneficiary participation and stakeholder
ownership, multiple synergistic interventions based on
client demand, capacity building for local government,
social preparation for the poor prior to physical investments, and arrangements for effective implementation with
nongovernment organizations and communities. For
program lending, the success of a reform process depends
on the sustained commitment of all stakeholders to policy
reforms, stemming from ownership built before reforms, a
sharply focused program design that recognizes implementation capacity and the sensitivity of reforms, and flexible
program implementation.

Special and impact evaluation studies

Beneficiary perceptions of the impact on poverty
reduction of agriculture and social infrastructure
projects: A special evaluation study using surveys
examined beneficiary perceptions of the impact on poverty
reduction of selected agriculture and social infrastructure
projects in six DMCs. Depending on the type of impact,

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 69

SNOILVYddO24-50% of the beneficiaries felt they
gained substantially from ADB-financed
operations. The proportion was higher
for income and general well-being
benefits than for more specific benefits
to women and the environment. Projects
approved in the 1990s were more
effective than those approved in the
1980s. A significant survey finding was
that among the poor, only a small
improvement in income was needed for
them to perceive themselves as no
longer poor. Major lessons included the
need for a balanced program of poverty
intervention projects at the macro level;
consultation with beneficiaries during
project preparation and implementation;

reviewed 50 loans and technical
assistance and undertook 6 in-depth
assessments in selected DMCs. All
projects substantially increased water
consumption by households, with more
than half the beneficiaries living below
the poverty line, although satisfaction
with improved water services from piped
connections varied among domestic and
nondomestic consumers. Sanitation
received less attention than water supply
systems; its impact has been limited and
mixed. None of the water utilities
concerned had achieved full cost
recovery. Important lessons were the
need to include sanitation, hygiene, and
health promotion in more projects; apply

 

more time and resources in promoting

social capital for every poverty intervention project;
beneficiaries’ trust in development partners; and timing in
the projects’ turnover to beneficiaries prepared to handle
the responsibilities.

Impact of rural road improvements on poverty
reduction: A case study-based impact evaluation examined
the impact on poverty reduction of ADB-financed rural road
improvements in road project investments and rural
development projects. Better rural roads are a necessary
but not sufficient condition for graduating from poverty.
The poor first need to accumulate a surplus, for example
by reducing time for collecting water, allowing them time
to seize new opportunities from motorized transport. The
study recommends designing interventions that concentrate
on removing access and mobility constraints of the poor in
their existing livelihoods, through improved transport
modalities and carrying capacity; providing transport services
by the government as a public service obligation and later
developing sustainable private transport services; establishing transparent criteria for selecting a particular road; and
encouraging labor-based technology for income generation.

Investment fund operations (IFOs): An evaluation
study examined the development impacts of 29 IFOs
relating to infrastructure, venture capital, portfolio
investment, and special purposes, representing about 19%
of cumulative private sector and about 59% of cumulative
equity investment operations of ADB. The IFOs had
significant impact on mobilizing resources particularly for
infrastructure, supporting small- and medium-sized
enterprises, developing capital markets, and generating
employment opportunities. However, financial performance
was generally modest, affected by the Asian financial crisis;
changes in regulations such as in the telecommunications
sector; and the ability of fund managers to identify,
appraise, and supervise projects. The study recommended
follow-up actions for ADB in the selection and remuneration of fund managers, administration of IFOs, monitoring
and evaluation of projects financed by IFOs, and an
exit policy for ADB.

further measures to manage demand
and reduce nonrevenue water; assess alternative means of
distributing water, such as bottled water for drinking;
involve beneficiaries at all stages of rural water supply
projects; and aim utility pricing at full cost recovery to
ensure continued and expanded water supply and
sanitation services. The recommended actions are
consistent with the Water for Asian Cities Program,
announced by ADB President Tadao Chino at the World
Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.

Primary education projects: A special evaluation
study examined government and nongovernment provision
of primary education in three DMCS, to assess whether the
private sector provided higher quality, better school
management, and greater access to primary education.
Using interviews with primary education stakeholder
groups and secondary data, the evaluation concluded that
private provision reduces the financial burden on government and improves access; and that while for-profit private
schools also improve quality and efficiency, they may do so
at a cost to poor families. The quality of education continued
to be a problem: teachers lacked qualifications and the
number of classroom hours was inadequate.

The study showed that a long-term sector framework
should be developed on interaction between government
and nongovernment, religious, and general agencies, and
formal and nonformal schooling systems; more resources are
required for reaching and retaining in school the children
from the remote areas; school management and committees
need legal powers, budget, and training; local governments,
communities, and parents should be included in capacitystrengthening efforts; and financial norms should be
established to maintain a minimum acceptable level of per
student and nonsalary proportion of recurrent expenditure.

Country assistance program evaluations

Three country assistance program evaluations were

undertaken for Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Philippines.
Bangladesh: From 1973 to 2001, Bangladesh received

141 public sector and 8 private sector loans and equity

investments, and 272 technical assistance grants. Of

Asian Development Fund (ADF)
resources, a key instrument for poverty reduction through concessional
lending to low-income developing
member countries (DMCs), have
funded about 28% of ADB's total
lending activities. The 2002 evaluation of ADF operations during
1992-2000 (ADF VI-VII) assessed
projects, processes, and policies.
Sources included ADB databases,
such as the loan financial information system, project performance
monitoring system, and project
completion and evaluation reports.
Project case studies were undertaken in five DMCs covering five
sectors and three thematic areas.
Governments, project stakeholders,
representatives from the private
sector, and other bilateral and multilateral agencies were consulted.

Ten areas were targeted by
donors for ADF VI-VII: (i) stimulating growth, (ji) assisting in family
planning and human development
activities, (iii) reducing poverty,
(iv) addressing gender concerns,
(v) improving environmental mitigation and management, (vi) strengthening policy adjustments that
contribute to growth, (vii) implementing a more strategic planning
process, (viii) improving project
quality, (ix) adopting a policy on
country graduation, and (x) introducing a more formal process for
ADF allocation.

There were 318 concessional
projects approved during ADF VIVII with loans totaling $12 billion,
about 24% of ADB's total approval,

and about 4% of the total net resources to ADF borrowing countries.

ADF VI coincided with the
introduction of five strategic development objectives for project
classification: economic growth,
human development, poverty
reduction, gender and development, and environmental and natural resource management. Several
new policies were successively introduced, such as governance, resettlement, inspection, indigenous
peoples, nongovernment organizations, and gender.

While almost 60% of projects
financed under ADF VI-VII are still
under implementation, there is
evidence of satisfactory progress,
although uneven, in meeting
the ADF VI-VII objectives. The
evaluation reached the following
conclusions.

* Highly satisfactory. A strategic planning process was adopted
and has become an integral part of
the institutional culture. Countrybased programming has improved
each year and project selection and
design have followed the strategic
directions.

* Satisfactory. Project investments directed toward stimulating
balanced economic growth have
continued and show a solid rate of
return. Practices on project-related
issues that affect the poor, such as
resettlement and environmental
damage mitigation, have improved.
While family planning activities
have not been sustained, investmentsin human development have

continued to expand. Poverty reduction investments have improved
with experience, a greater institutional understanding of the issues,
and more defined targets and goals.
ADF project quality and performance have improved. More work
is needed, however, in project
monitoring and management. ADF
allocations have been generally
consistent with the formal
performance-based measures
adopted for the ADF VIII.

+ Partly satisfactory. Improving environmental management has
proceeded unevenly within ADB.
The number of projects specifically
addressing environmental issues is
low. ADB'slending for policy adjustments—program lending—has had
mixed success. Reform programs
sometimes have been overambitious and governments have
lacked the capacity, or the will, to
implement difficult reforms. Some
countries have graduated formally
from the ADF under the Graduation
Policy. However, changes in access
criteria have had little effect on
country borrowing patterns.

+ Unsatisfactory. Incorporating gender concerns continuesto be
difficult for ADB. Project selection
and design have not effectively supported this development objective.
Mainstreaming gender concerns
under the Gender and Development
Policy has had limited impact.

Overall, ADBhas adapted to the
change agenda for ADF VI-VII, in a
way that has affected all operations,
not just those financed by the ADF.

SNOILVYddO

successful, 52% partly successful, and 10% unsuccessful,
showing a much higher proportion of partly successful
projects than ADB's average. ADB's country strategies and
operations recognized the need for mainstreaming
governance issues, took a long-term approach to structural
reform, and provided a significant impact on economic
growth and poverty reduction through infrastructure projects.

Weaknesses included failure to achieve sufficient
structural reform in some sectors, inability to implement
governance reforms affecting local communities, inadequate support for health and education, and failure to
mainstream the environment in the country program.

There is a need for

* amore proactive approach to governance, both at
central and local government levels;

¢ more lending for small enterprise development for
employment generation;

* support for increasing the recurrent budget for
health and education; and

¢ focus on fewer sectors to enhance poverty
reduction and development effectiveness. The last of these
implies reduced support in sectors where sector performance is poor, the potential for catalyzing is limited, and
ADB has no comparative advantage. Commitment to
reforms to improve sector efficiency should be a
key criterion.

Mongolia: An assessment of all operations in
Mongolia since 1991 focused on four themes: policy
reform, economic diversification, capacity building, and
financial system reform. Policy reform assistance was

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 71all-encompassing in the context of transition and
development, and led to a major change in ownership
patterns. However, policy matrixes were overloaded, and
policy-based lending to agriculture and industry was only
partly successful. Changes in price and trade policies with
investment in infrastructure sectors laid the foundation for
unbundling industries and increasing private sector
involvement. Capacity building was supported in all
operations, but mostly focused on inputs and was equated
with training and the provision of consulting services. The
fragmented approach did not promote overall public sector
resource management. The sector strategy became clearer
in the mid-1990s partly through assistance to the financial
sector, which was starting to have a positive impact in the
late 1990s. All three country operational strategies
recognized key transition issues, but did not convert them
sufficiently into sector strategies and projects. Overall,
ADB's country assistance program made significant
contributions to transition, with an acceptable portfolio
performance. Its impact on poverty is difficult to assess
because of external and natural influences.

The evaluation underscored the importance of

¢ providing strategic guidance to operations;

¢ undertaking necessary background work to, and
using a logical framework approach in, formulating country
strategies and programs (CSPs); and

¢ setting specific monitorable targets for country
operations.

Philippines: ADB's operational strategy for the
Philippines tracked the national strategy and lent support
to the country’s overall development objectives of
macroeconomic stabilization, poverty reduction, and social
development. The outcome of investment projects was
disappointing: 33% of all completed projects from 1986 to
2001 were rated unsuccessful, although there was some
improvement through the 1990s. Issues of sustainability
arose in all lending and nonlending interventions,
stemming from lack of institutional capacity, inadequate
budget allocations, and lack of political will.

There were four main lessons.

¢ Political and macroeconomic stability is a critical
factor in the success of development assistance.

* Project success requires careful project preparation
and relatively simple project design.

¢ Sustaining development impact requires careful
monitoring during implementation and beyond.

¢ The success of the assistance program depends on
the degree of institutional development.

Technical assistance performance
audit reports

Six technical assistance performance audits were
undertaken in 2002. Thirty-three technical assistance
activities were evaluated: 6 were rated highly successful,
18 successful, 8 partly successful, and 1 unsuccessful.
Capital market development: Six technical
assistance supported reforms and institutions for capital
market development in Pakistan. Expected results were
largely realized with a stronger regulatory framework in

72 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

the capital market; effective functioning of the Securities
and Exchange Commission; updating of regulations on
mutual funds; privatization of public sector mutual funds;
and enactment of a new insurance law and issuance of
rules. Two public sector insurance entities were restructured and interest rates on the national savings were
rationalized and are being adjusted periodically based

on market signals.

The main lessons are that strong government
ownership is critical to the success of policy and institutional reform, and sharply focused technical assistance
projects have a better chance of success.

One technical assistance was rated highly successful,
three successful, and two partly successful.

Road sector institutional development: Five
technical assistance projects for institutional development
and policy support in the road sector were attached to
projects in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia;
and a regional technical assistance for road design and
construction standards in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic,
Mongolia, and Uzbekistan. Initial assistance supported
organizational change. Progress was made in developing
road departments to manage the road network and become
the client for maintenance and construction contractors.
Follow-on technical assistance had less impact; the
governments failed to implement some politically sensitive
recommendations such as establishing a road board in
Mongolia, and giving control of the road fund to the road
department in the Kyrgyz Republic. The revised design and
construction standards from the regional technical
assistance are not in use in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz
Republic; in Mongolia, some are in use.

The main lessons are that workshops and training on
procurement processes may be less appropriate than
clarifying job classifications and descriptions; a road fund
by itself is not a guarantee that sufficient funds will be
provided to meet sector needs; greater clarity is required
on the issue of road funds among development partners;
and regional activities should take note of government
priorities and relevant ongoing activities.

The three initial technical assistance were rated
successful, the two follow-on technical assistance
partly successful, and the regional technical assistance
unsuccessful.

Education sector reform: Six technical assistance for
reform of the education sector in Central Asian countries
were evaluated. For Kazakhstan, a comprehensive sector
review led to planning and establishing the rationalization
process, developing curriculum reforms, strengthening
textbook development capabilities, and training teachers.
One technical assistance for the Kyrgyz Republic produced
a blueprint of policy reforms; a second suffered from
uncooperative consultant team members and frequent
changes of senior counterpart staff. In Uzbekistan, a
functional reform monitoring system was developed, as
were strategies for improving the cost-effectiveness of the
education system.

Lessons included the following: inception missions
should familiarize consultants with the goals and objectivesof the technical assistance, and establish the critical
achievement factors; technical assistance designs should
allow for flexibility; continuous dialogue on education
policies is needed to respond to changing needs and
aspirations of the beneficiaries; and evaluation capacity
development should include training in data management.

The two technical assistance in Kazakhstan were
rated successful, one each in the Kyrgyz Republic
successful and partly successful, and the two in
Uzbekistan highly successful.

Pacific audit capability: Six technical assistance for
strengthening audit capability in 12 Pacific DMCs included
four regional technical assistance cofinanced by supreme
audit institutions. The design and purpose were appropriate. The expected benefits were improved audit knowledge
and skills of the Office of the Auditor General staff,
improved internal audit work and work processes,
increased number of trained audit staff, and enhanced
sharing of audit experiences and solutions. Weaknesses
still need to be overcome in legislation, reporting
processes, accounts preparation, and management of
financial accounts and computer systems.

Lessons for the 12 Pacific DMCs include the need to
ensure that legislation and government preparation of
accounts and computer systems are consistent with the
purpose of the technical assistance; amend legislation to
expand the scope of auditing; and ensure follow-up after
auditing to increase the overall effectiveness of the process.

Three technical assistance were assessed highly
successful and three successful.

Road sector management: Four technical assistance
for improving road sector management included two
technical assistance attached to road improvement projects
in the Lao PDR and the Philippines for promoting
privatization and management of road sector institutions,
respectively; and two stand-alone technical assistance to
Papua New Guinea (PNG) for supporting the establishment
of a road asset management system (RAMS) for the central
and provincial governments. The privatization of some
transport sector functions in the Lao PDR, and restructuring
in the Philippines, were carried out. The first PNG
technical assistance established the RAMS in the central
Government; the second has not yet installed the RAMS
in the provinces.

The lessons were that a politically sensitive technical
assistance attached to a loan may be a more effective
mechanism than a stand-alone technical assistance; longterm involvement of external funding agencies is necessary
to maintain momentum; where staff retrenchment is
considerable, transition arrangements need to be designed
to minimize social and political costs; and management
buyouts may be considered an appropriate form of
privatization for transition economies like the Lao PDR.

Three technical assistance were rated successful and
the technical assistance aimed at the provinces in PNG,
partly successful.

Agricultural planning in Nepal: Five technical
assistance supporting agricultural planning, statistics, and
institutional strengthening in Nepal were designed to assist

 

the Government in setting a new direction for the
agriculture sector through a 20-year Agriculture Perspective
Plan. The policy directions of the first technical assistance
were relevant. Two subsequent technical assistance, in the
context of an agriculture program loan, assisted in shifting
the strategy toward less reliance on public investment and
subsidies, and more on deregulation and market forces.

The lessons were as follows: difficulties can arise with
a change in ADB staff; participation needs to be properly
managed to create the opportunity to introduce innovative
approaches; and without extensive local participation the
plan produced was overambitious.

Discontinuing the institutional structure established for
plan implementation, and the Government's reluctance to
publish the updated agricultural statistics, limited the
impact of the other two technical assistance. Overall, three
were rated successful, and two partly successful.

Portfolio performance

An annual evaluation report on portfolio performance
showed a reduction in the percentage of problem projects,
from 31% in 2000 to 25% in 2001; a substantial gap
between projected and actual contract awards with only
69% achievement; and declining compliance on the
submission of audited project accounts.

The report concluded that to improve portfolio
performance and reduce the number of projects at risk,
high-level support is needed for ADB's project performance
management system by highlighting the results of project
performance report assessments in management decision
making; assigning adequate resources for project
performance report preparation and validation; and
providing adequate resources for internal skills development. For more on annual evaluation reports, see http://
www.adb.org/Evaluation/annualreports.asp.

Other activities

OED provides direct support to operations through its
review of new projects and project completion reports. In
2002, it also assessed the new loan classification system,
and took the lead in reviewing the process for
performance-based allocation of ADF resources.

The ADB Board of Directors’ Development Effectiveness Committee's discussion of the annual report of
evaluation activities for 2001 resulted in a study in 2003 on
project cost estimation, recognizing the high number and
extent of cost underruns in recent years. For more on the
Development Effectiveness Committee, see the 2002 in
Review: Board of Directors’ Report chapter.

The Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral
development banks (MDBs), having completed good
practice papers for individual public and private sector
operations, turned its attention to higher-level evaluations,
including country assistance programs and evaluation of
policy-based lending, a study for which OED has prepared
a framework and terms of reference. OED and the other
evaluation departments are responding to the MDB
presidents’ statements in 2002 on the need for resultsbased monitoring and management.

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 73

> + COUNTRY REPORTSkey objective of the 2002 reorganization of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was to
strengthen its country! focus, in part by
unifying accountability for operations in a
particular developing member country (DMC)
within one department. ADB's policy on
resident missions in its DMCs, adopted in 2000 and
reviewed in 2002 (see http://www.adb.org/Documents/
Policies/Resident_Mission/), reinforced this objective, as did
ADB's key planning tool for DMCs—the country strategy
and program (CSP) (see Glossary and http://www.adb.org/
Documents/CSPs/).
The reorganization took the process further. As of
1 January 2003, each regional department—East and
Central Asia Department, Mekong Department, Pacific
Department, South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia
Department—covers a group of geographically contiguous
countries with similarities in culture, economic systems,
and social organization. Other considerations for the
groupings were operational convenience, and scope for
subregional cooperation and linkages with subregional
groups. Each department aims to promote integrated
development suited to the needs of the individual DMC.

Subregional cooperation is supported wherever appropriate.

The regional departments replaced the programs
and projects departments, which had reported to the
vice-presidents East and West. With the reorganization, the
roles of the operational vice-presidents were strengthened:
Vice-President (Operations 1) oversees the South Asia and
Mekong departments; and Vice-President (Operations 2)
the operations of the East and Central Asia, Southeast
Asia, and Pacific departments. The duties of Vice-President
(Finance and Administration) were relatively unchanged
by the reorganization.

The regional departments ensure implementation of ADB's
strategic agenda. Their tasks cover a range of ADB activities,
including developing the CSP and its regular updates, and
designing and implementing programs and projects.

Each country has a team, which includes staff
members from headquarters and, if applicable, the resident
mission, to maintain a country perspective in all operations. In this chapter, DMCs with ongoing operations? are
presented alphabetically by regional department (see Box
below for page numbers). For each of the five departments,
a brief regional overview is followed by a discussion
of the individual DMC within that region, including
economic performance and highlights of ADB's activities
in the DMC in 2002.

A more complete picture of the economic performance of
each DMC appears in the Asian Development Outlook 2003

DB’s new East and Central Asia Department covers a

large and diverse region. Because economic performance across the region is not uniform, in this short regional
overview, the three East Asia DMCs with ongoing operations—People’s Republic of China (PRC), Republic of Korea,
and Mongolia—are discussed individually, after the six DMCs
with ongoing operations in what ADB groups as Central Asia.

Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan had overall positive growth in
2002. Inflation was low overall, fiscal balances improved,
and current account balances were manageable, despite the
persistent slowdown of major world economies and further
uncertainty shrouding recovery prospects. For the six DMCs,
gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.7% in 2002,
which was lower than rates in 2001 and 2000. The average
inflation rate was about 12.3%, the second consecutive year
of decline. The fiscal balance remained the same, exports
improved, and imports declined for some countries, resulting
in current account deficits of close to 2.1% of GDP,
compared with about 3.3% in 2001.

With the opening of the trade sector after accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the strong growth
of private consumption and investment, the PRC continued
its rapid economic growth in 2002. GDP growth rose to
8.0% in 2002 slightly higher than the recent 5-year average
of 7.8%. Industry was the key engine of economic growth.
Despite a spring drought, agriculture sector performance in
2002 improved slightly. A shift in exports toward high-tech
products was noticeable, and exports and imports rose
significantly.

The Republic of Korea continued its economic
recovery in 2002, with real GDP growth of 6.3%. The
services sector made the strongest contribution, followed
by the manufacturing sector.

Mongolia’s GDP grew at 3.9% in 2002, breaking
2 years of stagnation. Inflation slowed from 8% in 2001 to

76 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

1.6% in 2002. Imports outpaced exports, leading to a trade
balance of about 20% of GDP. The fiscal balance was
contained at 5.7% of GDP, below the Government's target.

Azerbaijan

Economic performance

Real GDP growth in Azerbaijan was 10.6% in 2002, up from
9.9% in 2001. While oil sector-related construction
accounted for much GDP growth, output growth was
buoyant in all sectors, reaching 4.2% in industry and

6.4% in agriculture.

This fully financed the external current account deficit, which
widened from 1.3% of GDP in 2001 to 12.5% in 2002 due to
a sharp increase in imports related to oil development.

Macroeconomic policies remained fairly tight.
Although the general government deficit increased slightly
from 2.1% of GDP in 2001 to 2.2% in 2002, it was less than
the target deficit of 4.0%. The refinance rate of the National
Bank of Azerbaijan was lowered from 10% to 7% per
annum, but remained positive in real terms. Broad money
increased by 16%.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's interim operational strategy,
approved in 2000, continued to guide ADB’s activities in
2002 and was the basis for the CSP Update approved in
2002. Given the high level of poverty incidence, ADB
proposes to improve the delivery of essential public goods
and services to those in greatest need, and strengthen the
environment for private investment and job creation. The

AZERBAIJANgoal to reduce poverty and raise living standards will be
addressed through human development, good governance
and institutional strengthening, and broad-based growth.

Policy dialogue: In 2002, ADB's policy dialogue
focused on helping formulate a national program for
poverty reduction. In particular, ADB’s advice helped
improve the quality of the outputs of five sector working
groups for refugees and internally displaced persons, rural
development, poverty monitoring, regional development,
and fiscal policy. Discussions were also held with the
Government, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and
other funding agencies to find ways to assist refugees and
internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: No loans
were approved in 2002. A grant of $2.5 million and a
technical assistance of $700,000 were approved in 2002
(see tables 24, 25, and 35 in the Statistical Annex).

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in 1999,
Azerbaijan has not borrowed from ADB. There have been
delays in the implementation of the technical assistance
due to a lack of familiarity with ADB procedures. ADB is
addressing this issue by inviting government officials to
seminars and workshops on ADB procedures, and
supporting capacity building at key government agencies.

People’s Republic of China

Economic performance

Real GDP growth in the PRC accelerated from 7.3% in 2001
to 8.0% in 2002, mainly from the industry sector. The
industry's value added increased by 9.9%, compared with
8.7% in 2001. Investments grew by 16.1% in 2002,
compared with a 13.0% increase in 2001, because of fiscal
policy stimulus. Retail sales rose by 8.8% in 2002. Inflation
turned into deflation due mainly to excess domestic supply
of many agricultural and manufactured goods and tariff
reductions related to the country’s accession to the WTO. The
CPI fell by 0.8% in 2002, following a 0.7% increase in 2001.
Merchandise exports increased to 22.3% in 2002 from
6.8% in 2001. Imports rose by 21.0%, compared with 8.1% in
2001. The trade surplus expanded to $44.6 billion. With
foreign investor confidence strengthening after WTO
accession, FDI inflow continued to rise. Actual FDI increased
by 12.5% in 2002
and reached
$52.7 billion. Foreign
exchange reserves
were $286.4 billion
by the end of 2002.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: Work on a CSP was begun in 2002.
Reflecting recent economic and social developments, the
CSP will focus on providing policy support for the PRC’s
evolving market economy and business environment,
reducing regional disparities and inequalities, and ensuring
socially and environmentally sustainable growth. The CSP
will emphasize increased assistance to the central and
western regions and will strengthen the economic,
thematic, and sector work.

The thrust of the proposed CSP and future poverty
reduction activities was endorsed at a meeting of
14 poverty and ethnic affairs offices mainly from the west
and northeast provinces. Consultations with more than
350 villagers in 10 provinces, and local and international
NGOs also provided input into the CSP.

Policy dialogue: As an active member of the
international advisory board of the China Council for
International Cooperation on Environment and Development, a high-level advisory body to the Government, ADB
emphasized the importance of evaluating the income
distribution impact of environmental policies, and adopting

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for Kazakhstan supports the Government's reform agenda, institutional change,
and social protection; promotes natural resource management;
strengthens long-term growth potential; and encourages
private sector development. The strategy focuses on management reform at the central and local government levels;
infrastructure development, particularly rehabilitation projects;
education and training; industry, reforming medium-sized
enterprises; agriculture and rural development; and private
sector development. In 2002, ADB began preparing a new
CSP that will include the assistance program for 2004-2006.

sector output. Industrial production decreased following a
steep fall in production at the Kumtor gold mine and a
slump in the energy sector, which together accounted for
over 50.0% of industry sector output. The agriculture sector
grew at 3.3%—less
than the 7.3%
growth in 2001 due
to late sowing and
harvest as a result
of adverse weather

The Government continued its fiscal adjustment; however, the fiscal deficit at 5.9% of GDP was slightly higher than
the revised target of 5.6%. The fiscal targets were reset to
reflect the revenue setback caused by low growth. The Paris
Club members agreed in March 2002 to reschedule debt
repayments due between December 2001 and December 2004.

privatization program was furthered by technical assistance
for banking sector privatization and policy development in
the civil aviation sector.

Policy dialogue: The second annual review of the
PPA, in March 2002, confirmed that Mongolia was making
progress toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals, with the notable exception of reducing poverty
incidence. On accelerating economic growth to address
persistent income poverty, ADB emphasized the need to
maintain macroeconomic stability in providing an environment conducive to private sector-led growth. Dialogue on
public sector reform continued, particularly in implementing
the Public Sector Management and Finance Law.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: Two loans
totaling $34.1 million were approved in 2002, to provide
basic urban services in provincial towns and to improve the
education sector. Nine technical assistance totaling $3.5 million and two grants totaling $3.2 million were approved (see
tables 1, 6, 24, 25, and 35 in the Statistical Annex).

Poverty Reduction Strategy, endorsed by the Parliament in
June 2002, ADB prepared and concluded with the Government a PPA in December 2002. A CSP will be prepared to
reflect Tajikistan’s stabilized political and social situation.

Policy dialogue: Dialogue with the Government
focused on governance, private sector development, and
cross-border trade and transportation, in addition to the
power, transportation, social, and agriculture sectors. The
Government confirmed that ADB's operational strategy
adequately supports its development priorities.

Loans and technical assistance: Four loans totaling
$70.3 million were approved in 2002 for the emergency
Baipaza landslide stabilization and agriculture rehabilitation
project; a loan component for facilitating regional trade
and customs cooperation between the Kyrgyz Republic and
Tajikistan; and a component for a regional power transmission modernization project. Five technical assistance

Turkmenistan

Economic performance

Turkmenistan’s GDP growth rate slowed in 2002 to about
8.6%, from more than 20% during the previous year, as a
result of weak agriculture sector performance, particularly in
cotton output. The 2002 cotton harvest was around

484,000 tons, compared with output of 1.2 million tons in
2001 and a government target of 2.0 million tons for 2002.
Despite this, agriculture sector output rose by nearly 10% as
a result of increased grain production. The production and
export of natural gas remained the mainstay of the
economy, and a further increase of 8.9% in exports
contributed to GDP growth in 2002. The industry and
services sectors also improved their performance. Private
sector activity did not increase, except in some joint ventures
in textile processing. Inflation was 8.8% due to continued
subsidies on basic goods and services. The official exchange
rate was pegged at 5,200 manats to one US dollar. The trade
balance was positive for the third consecutive year.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: An economic report and ADB's interim
operational strategy (IOS) were approved in June 2002. The
Turkmenistan Economic Report and IOS focus on three
strategic objectives as follows: (i) enhancing human and social
development, (ii) supporting sustainable and stable economic
growth, and (iii) promoting regional economic cooperation.

ADB was initially approached by the Turkmenistan
Government and subsequently also by the governments of
Afghanistan and Pakistan for a technical assistance grant to
undertake a feasibility study for a natural gas pipeline for
transporting nearly 30 billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas
to Pakistan and other markets in Asia. The regional technical
assistance for the study was approved in December 2002.

Policy dialogue: In 2002, policy dialogue focused on
finalizing the IOS. This was followed up by ADB Board
members and senior staff who visited Turkmenistan during
the year and held initial policy discussions with the
authorities, impressing upon them the need to improve
data availability and to implement policies for encouraging
foreign investment and private sector growth.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were
approved in 2002. Two technical assistance totaling $415,000
were approved (see tables 24 and 25 in the Statistical Annex).

Project implementation: No loans have been made
to Turkmenistan.

Uzbekistan

Economic performance

Uzbekistan’s GDP growth rate slowed from 4.5% in 2001 to
4.2% in 2002 according to official estimates. Agriculture
and industry were strong performers, while services sector
growth weakened during the year as the Government
clamped down on retail trade. The reported official annual
average inflation rate declined to 27.6%. The current

Operational strategy: ADB's CSP for Uzbekistan aims to
manage the transition from a centrally planned to a market
economy by supporting basic reforms and minimizing the
social costs of transition; and enhance growth potential
through regional cooperation, investment in the rural
sector, and direct support for the private sector. The
strategy also addresses the Government's emerging
priorities, including assisting the drought-affected areas
of western Uzbekistan, improving the health sector, and
mitigating the social costs of macroeconomic and
structural reforms.

|: 2002, GDP growth in the Mekong DMCs—Cambodia,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar,
Thailand, and Viet Nam—was robust, ranging from 4.5% in
Cambodia to 6.4% in Viet Nam. Compared with 2001,
growth accelerated in all except Cambodia where weatherrelated conditions affected agriculture sector output. A
common factor in the region was the strong performance
of exports. Compared with 2001, export growth increased
in all except Cambodia, and moved from negative to a
positive in the Lao PDR and Thailand. Strong domestic
demand in private consumption also helped growth,
particularly in Thailand and Viet Nam, and was also
reflected in increased imports across the Mekong DMCs.
Inflation remained low in all except Myanmar. The budget
deficits remained manageable, ranging from 2% of GDP in
Thailand to about 8% in the Lao PDR. All, except Thailand,
are running current account deficits, but these do not
present external financing difficulties, and are sustainable.
External debt was about 50% of GDP in Thailand and Viet
Nam. Cambodia and the Lao PDR have significant debts to
the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the status of
which is currently under negotiation.

Cambodia

Economic performance

Cambodia's GDP growth rate slipped from 6.3% in 2001 to
4.5% in 2002. The growth of agriculture sector output,
which accounted for nearly 40% of GDP, was hampered by
structural factors and compounded by drought and
floods. Industry sector growth, led by garments, slowed
relative to 2001, while growth of the services sector, led by
tourism, increased. Inflation was low and the nominal
exchange rate stable.

The fiscal deficit was 5.9% of GDP, fully financed by
grants and external borrowing. The share of governmentCambodia

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy focuses on economic
growth and poverty reduction. For broad-based rural
development, the strategy promotes water resource
management, decentralization, natural resource management, and agriculture sector reform. The social development focus is on sectorwide initiatives in education and
health, and complementary support in water supply. To
promote private sector development, the nation’s road
network is being developed. Governance is promoted in
economic planning, public finance, and legal reform; and
gender issues are a focus in all interventions.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue focused on public
financial management; decentralization; agriculture and
natural resource management; education; and civil service,
financial sector, and governance reforms including
anticorruption initiatives. Policy dialogue between the
consultative group of funding agencies and the Government
emphasized forestry management, public administration
reform, and legal and judicial reform (see the Special Theme
Chapter). ADB helped prepare the National Poverty Reduction
Strategy. Further support was provided to the country's
increasing involvement in the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS) Program, culminating in a Summit of GMS Leaders in
November in Phnom Penh (see Box on page 50).

deficit declined from 6.9% of GDP in 2001 to 5.6% of GDP
in 2002, while the trade deficit went from $217 million in
2001 to $199 million in 2002. Garments, wood products,
and electricity from hydropower plants led exports. The
value of new foreign investment projects approved in
FY2002 increased.

Thailand

Economic performance

In 2002, Thailand's GDP growth was 5.2%, the highest rate
since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The growth was
driven by both domestic demand and volume of exports.
The private consumption grew by 4.7% (especially
consumption of durable goods), while private investment
grew 13.3% (particularly construction). Although the growth

Economic performance

Viet Nam's real GDP growth accelerated in 2002 to about
6.4% from 5.8% in 2001, partly due to a recovery in exports.

was 8.9%, followed by the services (6.0%) and agriculture

investment, continued to be the main source of economic
growth. The relatively high import growth of 19.5% turned
the current account balance into a deficit of about 2.8% of
GDP for the first time since 1999. The fiscal deficit,
including onlending, was 3.5% of GDP.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy reflects the
Government's commitment to poverty reduction through
growth, which has led to reduced poverty incidence from
58% in 1993 to 32% in 2000. ADB's strategy focuses on
sustainable growth through rural and private sector
development; inclusive social development by mainstreaming poverty, gender, and ethnic dimensions into relevant
areas of assistance, particularly secondary education and
health; and good governance, especially through public
administration reform and selected support for public
financial management. A focus on the poor provinces in
central Viet Nam will promote more balanced regional
development through community-level livelihood projects
and infrastructure expansion.

R: GDP for the Pacific countries—Cook Islands, Fiji
slands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States
of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu—grew in 2002 by a weighted average rate of
0.9%. The recovery reflected the strengthening of
international commodity prices, a rise in tourist arrivals,
and a gradual return toward normalcy in the crisisaffected countries in the Pacific. Generally expansionary
fiscal policies were accompanied by accommodative
monetary policies in most countries. Market perception
of the Pacific as a safe destination seems to have helped
boost tourism in the region. However, some Pacific DMCs
still suffered from the ethnic tensions that erupted in
2000. Internal problems accompanied by weak macroeconomic management in many countries prevented the
region from posting a higher rate of recovery overall.
With an annual population growth rate of 2.7%, the per
capita GDP continued to decline in the Pacific in 2002 for
the third consecutive year. Labor market conditions
improved slightly in some countries but unemployment
of educated youth continued to be a concern.

Nearly all Pacific DMCs faced fiscal stability,
vulnerability, or sustainability challenges. The average
inflation rate increased from 6.9% in 2001 to 7.1% in
2002, reflecting weakening of most Pacific currencies,
and increasing local food and transport prices. Despite
an increase in exports in several Pacific DMCs, overall
merchandise exports declined by about 10%, largely
reflecting a sharp fall in Papua New Guinea (PNG)
exports due to declining oil production. Imports also
declined (-5.8%), reflecting the impact of depreciating
currencies. The overall current account for the region
recorded a small deficit for the first time since 1997,
primarily reflecting deterioration in the current account
in PNG. The flow of remittance, vital to the economy of
some countries including Samoa and Tonga, remained

Tourism underpins the country’s economic growth but
loan assistance to small businesses is facilitating diversification into fisheries and agriculture. ADB’s strategy also
seeks to improve public services by streamlining government planning and execution, and aligning resources with
performance objectives.

continued growth through economic diversification and
private sector development, in particular, by limiting the
public sector's call on the available credit in the banking
system. ADB also supported better environmental
management through capacity building for monitoring and

capacity to formulate policies and implement reforms to
increase accountability and responsiveness in key
government departments, creating an enabling environment for private sector participation, and developing
public-private partnerships in revenue-generating projects.

Policy dialogue: In 2002, policy dialogue with the
Government focused on good governance; policy reforms
pertaining to the sugar industry; cost recovery; and
operation and maintenance in key sectors including
transport and water and sanitation.

Kiribati

Economic performance

GDP growth in Kiribati in 2002 was estimated at 2.8%, up
from 1.5% in 2001. Improved economic conditions were
mainly attributed to the continued increase in government
and donor spending; high consumer expenditure; and a rise
in construction activity, largely from government development projects. The inflation rate decreased from 6.0% in
2001 to 5.1% in 2002, reflecting a fall in the price of food,
beverages, and transport. The overall budget balance
deteriorated from a surplus of 15.0% of GDP in 2001 toa
deficit of 5.9% of GDP in 2002, primarily due to increased
spending from a wage and salary bill, subsidies to
government-owned enterprises and the copra industry, and
the Government's contribution to development projects.

Economic performance

In 2002, the Marshall Islands maintained prudent
expenditure and the financial position improved, favored by
the absence of debt repayments. In FY2002 (ending
September 2002), the Government placed $15.5 million in
the Marshall Islands Intergenerational Trust Fund (see http:

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy in the Marshall
Islands aims to strengthen public sector governance and
increase public sector productivity; support the creation of
new economic opportunities and improve the access to
basic social services in the outer islands; and enhance the
environment for private sector investment, job creation,
and growth. The Government remains committed to
reforms, fiscal targets are being met, and other public
sector reforms are on schedule.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s strategy focuses on good
governance, social service development, and pro-poor
economic growth. To promote good governance, ADB has
provided technical assistance for improving public sector
efficiency and effectiveness in both national and state
governments, particularly in formulating and implementing
economic policy and public financial management. In
social services development, ADB promotes equity, access,
and quality; strengthens management efficiency; and
mobilizes resources for sustainable delivery. For pro-poor
economic growth, ADB promotes the private sector and
infrastructure development.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy is three-pronged.
First, ADB supports initiatives that foster good governance
to build capacity for sound economic and public sector
management, sustain financial reforms, facilitate privatization, and improve performance by public agencies. Second,
ADB helps the Government upgrade living standards and
reduce income disparity through improved equity and
access to quality education. Third, ADB provides assistance
for private sector growth and increased employment
opportunities by promoting policies that create an enabling
environment for private sector development; improving
infrastructure; and developing micro-, small-, and mediumsized enterprises.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue related to private
sector participation in public services delivery, and the
implementation of the new legislative framework for stateowned enterprises. Dialogue also focused on the policy and
legislative
environment for
business development, legal
impediments in the

Timor-Leste

Economic performance

Timor-Leste’s GDP in 2002 is estimated to have declined by
about 1.0%-3.0%. The contraction, which had the greatest
impact on the construction and services sectors, was
primarily due to the decreased presence of the United
Nations and the slower-than-expected implementation of
bilateral projects and use of the budget. Agriculture sector
production rose due to increased availability of rural capital
and farm inputs. Following the reduced international
presence, commer

In FY2002 (ending 30 June 2002), Tonga’s real GDP grew
by 1.6%, mainly reflecting reconstruction work in the

compared with 6.9% in FY2001. A tight monetary policy

protected foreign reserves and eased inflationary pressures.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s strategy focuses on
promoting governance and economic management;
enhancing employment opportunities through skills
development; and improving services on the outer
islands, where the poor and vulnerable groups are
concentrated, partly through sustainable financing
mechanisms. In 2002, ADB helped the Government
upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute, the
country’s only higher educational institution.

Policy dialogue: Dialogue with the Government
continued on outer island development plans, including
decision making, good governance, services delivery, and
sound economic and fiscal management.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan of
$1.9 million was approved in 2002 to develop maritime
training. A technical assistance of $291,000 was approved
(see tables 1, 6, 24, and 25 in the Statistical Annex).

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in 1993,
Tuvalu has received two loans, of which one was active at

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy focuses on
improving economic management and governance;
ensuring access of the poor, both rural and urban, to jobs

Vanuatu’s growth suffers from frequent policy shifts, civil
unrest, high costs of doing business, and difficulties in
enforcing contractual agreements. The adult literacy rate is
only 34%; primary and secondary school enrollment rates
are low; and access to health services, particularly for
women and children, is limited.

Policy dialogue: ADB played a prominent role in
Vanuatu's development effort by helping the Government
prepare for its national summit on comprehensive reforms,
and develop an agenda aimed at strengthening and
accelerating the pace of economic reforms. Ways to
improve the environment for private business and to
reduce poverty were identified. ADB encouraged the
Government to strengthen oversight of financial institutions, and helped
prepare environment and water
resource management legislation.

Dw: the challenges faced in the region, the overall
economic performance of the South Asia DMCS—
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—was satisfactory, with the
region recording growth of 4.2% in 2002. Security
deteriorated in some South Asia DMCs, with a subsequent negative impact on economic growth and poverty
reduction. Erratic weather patterns, which produced
droughts and floods in different parts of the region and
affected agriculture sector output, also took their toll on
the region's economic growth. The region still faces
some important macroeconomic challenges. The fiscal
deficit in several countries is large and needs to be
contained. The region also faces uncertain external
demand for its exports, and while the current account of
the balance of payments of most countries improved,
this was largely due to depressed demand for imports.
The foreign exchange reserves of most countries
increased during the year and there was also a moderate
appreciation of the currencies against the US dollar. The
high price of oil is adversely affecting the balance of
payments and there could be some reduction in the level
of foreign exchange reserves.

Given the region's pervasive poverty, ADB focused its
operations in the region in 2002 on poverty-reducing
interventions. ADB and its development partners help
Afghanistan in its reconstruction efforts and assist Sri
Lanka in its postconflict rehabilitation (see the Special
Theme chapter). ADB continued to assist the South Asia
DMCs by supporting social and physical infrastructure
projects, improving governance, strengthening institutions
and building capacity, reforming sector policies, promoting
private sector initiatives, and improving public sector
resource management.Afghanistan

Economic performance

ADB estimates that Afghanistan's GDP in 2002 was about
$4.4 billion, and per capita GDP was $170 in current prices.

The interim and transitional government prepared a
national development framework and ordinary (recurrent)
budget in April, which was followed by a development
budget in October 2002. Financing of about 80% of the
recurrent budget and 100% of the investment budget came
from external assistance.

The most significant economic management agenda
for 2002 was the introduction of a new currency, which
exchanged old 1,000 afghanis (Afs) to 1 new afghani. This
simplified transactions and set the stage for more
effective monetary control by the central bank. The
exchange rate to the US dollar of Afs30,000-40,000
depreciated after the new currency was introduced in
October, and reached Afs50,800 to a US dollar in
December. The notes exchange operation was expected
to be completed by January 2003. For more on Afghanistan,
see the Special Theme chapter.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: After conducting a needs assessment with the Afghan authorities and its development
partners, as agreed with the then Interim Administration of
Afghanistan, ADB approved an initial CSP. The CSP has
two tracks: a combination of short-term, high-impact
projects, including grant-financed pilot projects in key
sectors; and medium-term policy and institutional reform
measures through capacity-building technical assistance
and program lending.

Policy dialogue: ADB consulted closely with the
Afghan authorities and development partners in formulating the CSP. Policy dialogue centered on policy and
institutional reforms to improve governance; strengthen
the financial, transport, and energy sectors; and contribute
to economic recovery and growth within a market-based
system, consistent with the Government's National Development Framework and National Development Budget.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: The
United Kingdom's Department for International Development provided grant funds of nearly $18 million to clear
Afghanistan’s arrears with ADB, thus lifting the final barrier
for ADB to resume operations. On 4 December 2002, ADB
approved a $150 million loan for a Postconflict Multisector
Program—the first loan to Afghanistan by an international
financial institution since lending was suspended in 1979.
The first tranche of $100 million was disbursed to the
Government on 6 December. Two technical assistance
totaling $15.1 million and three grants totaling $22 million
were approved in 2002 (see tables 1, 6, 24, 25, and 35 in
the Statistical Annex).

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in 1966,
Afghanistan has received 10 loans totaling $245.1 million,
of which 1 was active at the end of 2002. Contract awards
totaled $100.2 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$134.5 million. Disbursements in 2002 totaled $100.2 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $128.1 million
(see tables 14-23 in the Statistical Annex).

Economic performance

GDP growth in Bangladesh moderated to 4.4% in FY2002
(ending 30 June 2002) from 5.3% in FY2001 due mainly
to contraction in agriculture sector production because of

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy to reduce poverty
includes continued support for developing basic physical
and social infrastructure, with more attention on governance- and environment-related issues. ADB-assisted
projects in transport, energy, social infrastructure, water
resources, and finance are aimed at supporting key policy
and institutional changes to increase private sector
participation and improve sector efficiency.

Policy dialogue: In 2002, ADB emphasized local
capacity building to support the Government's decentralization policy and improve municipal and local governance.
Reforms to improve corporate governance and sector
efficiency were also targeted. These included rationalizing
tariffs, and creating and restructuring corporate entities in
the power and gas subsectors; establishing an independent
energy regulatory body; privatizing the marketing of
petroleum products; and promoting private sector
participation in the energy sector.

45decreased from 3.6% in 2001 to 2.7% in June 2002,
its lowest level since 1999. Low inflation in India
helped stabilize prices in Bhutan, particularly for
nonfood products.

In FY2002 (ending 30 June 2002), domestic revenue
exceeded current expenditure and financed capital
expenditure by 1.2% of GDP. The overall government
deficit decreased to 6.8% of GDP in FY2002, compared
with 11.8% in FY2001. In FY2002, the trade account
deficit narrowed, due to increased export of power to
India and a decline in imports from India as some
hydropower projects neared completion. However, the
current account went from surplus in FY2001 to deficit in
FY2002 mainly because of a substantial decrease in the
net income flow—reflecting lower interest income of the
financial sector deposits held abroad. Bhutan’s foreign
exchange reserves stood at $317 million, equivalent to
20 months of merchandise imports.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s strategy was refined in
2002 to reflect the partnership agreement signed by
Bhutan and ADB in 2001. In line with the country’s Ninth
5-Year Plan (July 2002-June 2007), the strategy focuses
on rural infrastructure, financial sector, and private
sector development. The strategy targets rural poverty

India

Economic performance

For FY2002 (ending March 2003), the official GDP growth
estimate for India was 4.4%, compared with 5.6% in
FY2001. The consolidated fiscal deficit of the central and
state governments together as a percentage of GDP was
targeted at 9.3% in FY2002, lower than the revised estimate
of 10.0% in FY2001. The lower deficit ratio was due to the
expected higher growth in revenue receipts relative to
aggregate expenditure.

Despite poor harvests, which usually trigger inflation,
the annualized average inflation, as measured by the
wholesale price index, remained low at 2.8% during AprilDecember 2002. This enabled the central bank to adopt an
expansionary monetary stance to boost industry sector
growth. The central bank's midterm review of the Monetary

interventions will also be complemented by social
development interventions that deal with poverty

operations,

including support for improved delivery of pro-poor
social services, will also be extended to a few more focal
states that are poor but have also demonstrated their
commitment to reforms.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue has focused on fiscal
consolidation; improving the state-level governance and
policy environment, particularly in the power and roads
subsectors; fostering reforms in and modernizing the Indian
Railways; providing a policy and operational framework to
attract private sector participation; and promoting
subregional economic cooperation.

Loans, technical assistance, grants, and equity
investments: Seven loans for six projects—five public
sector and one private sector, totaling $1,183.6 million—
were approved in 2002. The projects aim at developing the
East-West Corridor, developing roads in Madhya Pradesh,
reforming the state power sector, improving railways, and
modernizing government and fiscal reform in Kerala. The
private sector loan of $20 million equivalent in local
currency was made to a medical services network, which is
expected to create an integrated private sector system in
India. Twenty-six technical assistance totaling $13.2 million
and three grants totaling $55.3 million were approved (see
tables 1, 6, 7, 10, 24, 25, and 35 in the Statistical Annex).
ADB also approved two equity investments totaling
$25 million in an infrastructure fund to help finance private
sector infrastructure projects and a mortgage guarantee
company in India.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in

Currency devaluation and the recovery of international
fish prices led to an increase in exports in 2002 by 18.1%
over the 2001 levels, while imports declined by 2.4%. The
improved trade balance and increased disbursement of
foreign assistance led to a favorable balance-of-payments
position. The country’s foreign exchange reserves
increased, reaching $134.5 million at the end of 2002—
higher than the level before 11 September 2001—sufficient
to cover 4.1 months of imports.

Operational strategy: ADB’s strategy in the Maldives
supports poverty reduction through pro-poor growth,
social development, and good governance initiatives. To
foster pro-poor growth, ADB will help promote regional
development by providing basic infrastructure and
capacity building; create an enabling environment for
private sector development, and reform the financial
sector and the legal system; and develop an information
and communication network in the atolls. To further
social development, ADB will provide assistance for
postsecondary education and skills development. To
support good governance, ADB will improve public
access to information, build the management capacity of
key public institutions, and assist the Government in
developing the private sector.

Policy dialogue: Dialogue focused on poverty
reduction and improved public sector management. The
PPA aims at reducing poverty incidence from 43% of the
population to 25% by 2015. Extensive dialogue to improve
the public accounting system was held during project
formulation. Major
issues discussed
were the reorganization of government ministries and

Nepal

Economic performance

Nepal's economic performance weakened in FY2002
(ending 15 July 2002), registering negative growth for the
first time in the past 2 decades. GDP contracted by 0.6%,
after posting 4.6% growth in FY2001. This was attributed to
a series of domestic and external shocks, especially the
escalation of the insurgency, an irregular monsoon, and
weak external demand. Agriculture sector growth slipped
to 2.2% in FY2002 from 5.5% in FY2001, while industry

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy for Pakistan,
approved in May 2002, supports the Government's thrust in
reducing poverty through assistance in areas of shared
strategic importance. Under the strategy, ADB will support
ways to promote governance by improving access to
justice, and services delivery for the poor through
decentralization. The emphasis has shifted from supporting
economic growth to maximizing its impact on poverty
reduction through rural development and employment
generation through small- and medium-sized enterprises.
The strategy also emphasizes the need to reduce gender
disparity. ADB assistance in Pakistan has become more
decentralized, with more projects being implemented with
the provincial governments. The operational program has
also become more focused on the Government's development priorities.

Policy dialogue: In 2002, dialogue with the Government centered mainly on governance-related reforms,
including legal and judicial reform, decentralization,
corporate governance, and public resource management.
This was supported by programs such as the Decentralization Support Program, approved in November 2002, which
aims to promote effective and efficient local government
structures and continuing reforms under the Access to
Justice Program. In the financial sector, the Financial
(Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program, approved in
December 2002, will support governance reform; and the
Rural Finance Sector Development Program will develop
rural finance institutions. The proposed Punjab Resource

The ceasefire agreement, reopening of A-9 highway to

foster stability and promote economic recovery in Sri Lanka
in 2002, but continued weakness among its global trading

Sri Lanka and postconflict rehabilitation, see the Special

to a 1.4% decline in output in 2001. Agriculture, industry,

T GDP growth performance for the Southeast Asia
DMCs—Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines—generally
improved in 2002, but the pace of growth varied among
the countries. Malaysia, which was hit hard by the global
trade downfall in 2001, achieved a larger increase in
growth, while Indonesia and the Philippines grew at a
more modest pace. The improved growth performance was
driven by sound domestic demand in Indonesia, and
Philippines. Recovered exports, together with strong
domestic consumption, raised the growth in Malaysia. The
region benefited from increased exports to the People’s
Republic of China, but exports to major industrial markets
continued to fall in 2002. Variations in debt continued with
significant reductions in Indonesia’s total public debt and a
rise in the Philippines’ external debt.

As for policies, the efforts to contain the respective
fiscal deficits have been positive. Indonesia and Malaysia
were able to achieve smaller budget deficits, but the
budget shortfall in the Philippines grew larger than
expected. On the monetary front, authorities in the
region have kept their monetary policy position
accommodative to help keep inflation at bay and interest
rates low. This created more favorable conditions for
corporate and banking sector reforms and made debt
servicing easier; this was seen in Indonesia. The
exchange rate policy has been supportive. The strengthened Indonesian rupiah helped further reduce the
country’s public debt burden. The weakening of the
Philippine peso partly reflected the pressure of the
growing fiscal deficit and the difficult peace and order
situation. But this helped maintain the competitiveness
of Philippine exports.

reducing the fiscal deficit.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy supports the
Government’s development priorities envisaged in the
Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2001-2004.
The strategy aims to reduce poverty, encourage equity,
improve social services delivery, protect the environment,
and promote good governance. The proposed program for
2003-2005 supports these areas, and focuses on basic
education and health services, urban development, power,
roads, environmental management, and financial

market development.

Policy dialogue: Dialogue focused on supporting
reforms under ongoing program loans, including improving
the environment of the Pasig River, and the air quality in
Metro Manila.

reform. ADB workedclosely with the Government and the World Bank in
preparing a joint review of public expenditure, procurement, and financial management.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: One loan
of $40 million was approved in 2002 for the Electricity
Market and Transmission Development. ADB also provided
a partial credit guarantee for a public bond issue of
$500 million to assist power sector reform. Twelve
technical assistance totaling $6.6 million and two grants
totaling $4.6 million were approved (see tables 1, 6, 24, 25,
and 35 in the Statistical Annex).

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, the Philippines has received 186 loans totaling
$8,034.3 million, of which 46 were active at the end of
the year. Contract awards totaled $198.2 million,
bringing the cumulative figure to $5,143.5 million. The
contract awards ratio for 2002 was 17.1%—lower than
ADB's average of 22.6%. Disbursements in 2002 totaled
$230.0 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to
$5,468.6 million. The disbursement ratio was 17.0%—
lower than the ADB-wide average of 22.2% (see tables
14-23 in the Statistical Annex).

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 113

S$1YOd3dY AYLNNODIn 2002, ADB examined how its institutional knowledge is
generated, captured, and disseminated. All departments and offices
at ADB contribute to the quality of the knowledge products and
services. The reorganization was designed to enhance these

contributions. A newly created department will oversee quality
and ensure technical excellence across the organization.he Asian Development Bank (ADB) strives to

meet the highest standards of excellence in its

fight to reduce poverty in the Asia and Pacific

region. In the process of delivering assistance to

its developing member countries (DMCs), ADB

generates and accumulates a wealth of
knowledge. Databases, web sites, publications, and training
programs ensure knowledge transfers to, from, and within
ADB. ADB strives for the widest dissemination possible.

During the reorganization, ADB examined how its

institutional knowledge is generated, captured, and
disseminated; and how the organization could be
restructured to enhance the process. Steps were taken to
improve ADB's capacity to acquire, share, and apply
knowledge, by creating the Regional and Sustainable
Development Department (RSDD) to advance ADB's
knowledge agenda; encouraging better coordination among
the Economics and Research Department (ERD), Regional
Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU), and ADB Institute; and
rationalizing knowledge products and streamlining the
process of their dissemination.

Regional and Sustainable
Development Department

RSDD was created to maintain quality and technical
excellence across ADB. It has five divisions: an environment and social safeguard division, responsible for
compliance with ADB’s safeguard policies; two divisions
responsible for ADB's thematic agenda—a poverty
reduction and social development division, and a
governance and regional cooperation division; and two
divisions responsible for the technical and sector agenda—
a finance and infrastructure division and an agriculture,
natural resources, and social sectors division. RSDD also
runs a unit, the Nongovernment Organization (NGO)
Center, to strengthen cooperation with civil society and
respond to their concerns.

As the center of thematic and sector expertise, RSDD
supports all other departments in ADB. It is mandated to
ensure ADB-wide consistency by developing and monitoring policies and guidelines for all thematic and sector areas
and serving as the center for compliance oversight,
particularly for the safeguard policies—environment,
resettlement, and indigenous peoples.

RSDD’s responsibility for ADB's regional cooperation
strategy, and assistance to the five regional departments
strengthens ADB's regional focus and operations, which in
turn, strengthens ADB’s role in linking the region to the
global network and partnerships for development.

The reorganization defined RSDD’s role and
responsibilities, and put into place the staffing and
business processes necessary for RSDD to begin work on
achieving its objectives. The work program and 2002
outputs of the thematic and sector committees and
networks are covered in the Operational Priorities and
Performance chapter.

 

RSDD and Knowledge Management

An ADB-wide Knowledge Management Committee, chaired
by the President, and including senior representatives from
ADB Institute, ERD, RSDD, REMU, the Strategy and Policy
Department (SPD), and the Office of External Relations
(OER) was constituted to oversee ADB's program and
progress in delivering knowledge products. Its mandate is
to ensure ADB-wide synergy and coordination in knowledge creation and dissemination.

As secretariat to the Committee, RSDD helps
coordinate the development of a knowledge management
framework, reviews the interregional knowledge products
and services, and monitors and compiles the annual
outputs and outcomes based on the reports of the thematic
and sector committees (see pages 37 and 52). As anchor to
the thematic and sector committees, RSDD integrates their
knowledge and best practices.

All departments and offices at ADB contribute to the
quality of ADB's services, and several are responsible for
maintaining the direct and indirect knowledge generated
and captured in ADB’s work: the Operations Evaluation
Department maintains the database of lessons learned and,
like RSDD, documents best practices (see the Operations
chapter and http://Awww.adb.org/evaluation/); the Office of
External Relations manages external and internal
information dissemination. Others, such as the external
offices and regional departments, capture and transfer
operations-related knowledge. Storage, retrieval, and
sharing of information are aided by the Office of Administrative Services and the Office of Information Systems and
Technology. RSDD helps maintain the high standards in
which these departments and offices function.

Economics and Research Department

The objective of the Economics and Research Department
(ERD) is to advance the state of knowledge on economic
development of the Asia and Pacific region in a global
context. ERD’s role is to conduct economic research on key
development issues facing the region to support the policy
agenda of ADB's developing member countries (DMCs) in
enhancing growth and reducing poverty, and to disseminate ERD’s research findings to ADB stakeholders.

Together with the Office of the Chief Economist, the
newly reorganized divisions of ERD (Macroeconomics and
Finance Research Division, Economic Analysis and
Operations Support Division, and Development Indicators
and Policy Research Division) work jointly or independently to

¢ undertake research to develop and apply models
to assess macroeconomic management and make
forecasts, and to improve the understanding of the
determinants of long-term growth in the region;

¢ conduct applied microeconomic research and distill
good practices to ensure sound stewardship in ADB’s loan
operations by promoting quality at entry and improving the
methodology of economic analysis of projects and programs;

SHILIAILDV LYOddNS GNV 3DG31MON™Training initiatives strengthen the content and
management of national training programs. ADB
was a partner in several such initiatives in 2002.

Asian Institute of Technology and

Asian Institute of Management

To help boost its capacity to acquire, share, and
apply knowledge, ADB formed network alliances
with the Bangkok-based Asian Institute of Technology and the Manila-based Asian Institute of
Management. The knowledge, expertise, and
experience of these institutions will supplement
ADB's internal knowledge of socioeconomic and
development issues, and improve ADB's ability to
offer training and capacity building to its developing member countries (DMCs).

Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation

The objective of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Financial Regulators Training
Initiative, established in 1998, is to develop and
provide broad-based training for junior and
midlevel financial sector regulators and supervisors. Funded by, and housed in ADB, the Initiative
is overseen by an APEC Advisory Group representing bank supervisory and securities regulatory
agencies in ADB's DMCs.

In Phase 1 of the Initiative, completed in 2000,
training needs were identified and core curricula
for financial regulators in the region were developed. Phase 2, which ended in October 2002,
focused on training, both at the regional and
national levels, and on developing and distributing training products to member economies. At
the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting in September
2002, the Initiative was extended for another year.

In 2002, the Initiative organized three regional
and four national training seminars on investigation, enforcement, and prosecution, as well as on
market supervision and corporate governance for
securities regulators. Course materials were posted
on the Initiative’s web site maintained by ADB
(http://www.adb.org/projects/APEC/). A self-study
training course on securities regulation was developed by the Secretariat and disseminated through
the web site. For banking supervisors, three regional
and three national training seminars were held on
foundation bank analysis and examination, credit
tisk, risk management and internal controls, and
market risk.

116 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

In 2002, ERD continued to focus its work programs on
policy and operational issues in relation to ADB's
Poverty Reduction Strategy and on data requirements for
operationalizing the Strategy.

ERD conducted studies on a range of issues—
macroeconomics; growth and poverty reduction; regional
integration and trade; competitiveness of Asian
economies; local bond markets; good practice studies
related to policy-based operations, investment climate
and productivity, jointly with World Bank; and information and communication technology (ICT). Research
outcomes were disseminated to stakeholders through
various forums such as the Fourth Asia Development
Forum jointly conducted with the World Bank (see http://
www.adb.org/media/); the Eighth International Forum on
Asian Perspectives with the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD); the Workshop on
ICT Strategies and the Seminar on International Finance,
both with the ADB Institute; and the High-Level Forum
on Statistical Capacity Building to ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Countries.

Also in 2002, ADB's existing statistical database
system was enhanced significantly and a web-enabled
version was developed to meet the statistical information
needs of all ADB departments, offices, and resident/regional
missions in a timely manner. Likewise, the content was
improved and expanded to include new social, economic,
and environmental indicators toward achieving the MDGs.
A flagship publication, Key Indicators 2002: Population and
Human Resource Trends and Challenges, was improved by
including a theme chapter and introducing environmental
indicators. A poverty database was launched and a webbased protocol was developed to facilitate international
access (see http://www.adb.org/statistics/).

ERD produced the annual Asian Development Outlook
(ADO) 2002 and ADO Update, and several other books,
handbooks, special studies, and a new paper series in the
form of policy briefs, technical notes, and working papers.
The Economics and Statistics web page was improved and
regular Internet dissemination of ERD publications
continued (see http://www.adb.org/Economics/).

ERD organized and participated in several workshops,
seminars, and capacity-building exercises, including
conducting the in-house Staff Learning Program on
Economic Analysis of Policy-Based Operations, and the
Twelfth Tax Conference with the ADB Institute.

ERD continued to manage several technical assistance
projects aimed at improving the national statistical
systems, national accounts, and poverty statistics in ADB's
DMCs. These activities enabled the DMCs’ national
statistical offices to produce more timely and relevant
statistics (see Box at right).

Regional Economic Monitoring Unit

ADB supports regional monetary and financial cooperation
initiatives through its Regional Economic Monitoring Unit
(REMU). REMU prepares high-frequency monitoring reports
and provides capacity-building support for economicThe Indonesia Central Statistical Agency will be able
to produce timely trend data related to planning
social protection for the poor through an ADB
technical assistance. Information about poverty
used to only be available annually with a 1-year
lag. ADB's technical assistance successfully
produced a series of real wage data that can be
compiled more frequently and accurately than
other standard employment statistics. The data,
which are good indicators of the poor’s welfare,
are used in reports to the Indonesian President’s
Cabinet, and by university research institutions,
think tanks, funding agencies, and media. Because
of the success of this technical assistance, ADB
increased its support for the project to enable the
Agency to produce more detailed analyses of the
wage data and thus increase its analytical utility.

monitoring and for establishing regional early warning
systems. REMU also maintains the Asia Recovery
Information Center web site (see http://wvww.aric.adb.org), a
regional portal of information and analysis on Asia’s
growth and recovery from the 1997 financial crisis.

ADB has approved 13 regional technical assistance
projects totaling $6.3 million, which support regional
monetary and financial cooperation initiatives by building
and strengthening the capacity of DMCs in the ASEAN! and
ASEAN+3? groups to conduct economic monitoring.
Activities under these projects include training secondees
from ASEAN central banks and finance ministries at ADB;
supporting activities of the ASEAN Surveillance Coordination Unit located in the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta;
supporting the establishment of national surveillance units
in the ministries of finance of ASEAN countries;* providing
monitoring inputs to high-level meetings of the ASEAN,
ASEAN+3, Manila Framework Group, Asia-Europe Finance
Ministers Group, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC); supporting regional initiatives in monitoring shortterm capital flows and establishing early warning systems;
conducting special studies on topics related to regional
monetary and financial cooperation; and developing and
maintaining a web-based clearinghouse of information on
East Asia's recovery and growth.

In 2002, ADB completed a Study on Monetary and
Financial Cooperation in East Asia, which aimed at
developing a road map of policy options for carrying
forward the ongoing monetary and financial cooperation
efforts by the ASEAN+3 countries. The results of the study
were presented at the Asia-Europe Finance Ministers
meeting in July 2002 in Copenhagen. The regional

ASEAN comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 ASEAN countries; and People's Republic of
China, Japan, and Republic of Korea.

National surveillance units have been established in Cambodia, Indonesia,
Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

 

technical assistance for an ASEAN+3 Framework for the
Development of Early Warning Systems will help prepare a
regional early warning system prototype. In December
2002, central bank and finance ministry officials from

the 13 member countries of the ASEAN+3 group discussed
the prototype at a workshop jointly organized by ADB,

the People’s Bank of China, and the ASEAN Secretariat

in Beijing.

ADB Institute

The ADB Institute (the Institute) in Tokyo is both a
provider of knowledge for development and a high-level
training center.

The flagship activity of the Institute in creating and
disseminating knowledge has been the Asian Policy Forum
(APF). In 2002, there were two APF cycles, both focusing
on policy issues in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
The highlights from both cycles and other research on the
PRC were presented at the Institute's fifth anniversary
conference in December 2002. To widen dissemination, the
policy recommendations were translated into Chinese.

In addition to its APF activities, the Institute joined
other organizations and institutes, including the InterAmerican Development Bank, Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, and the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences to expand and disseminate collective
expertise through seminars.

Twenty original research papers were produced in
2002, on topics such as banking sector reform and the
impact of financial reforms on patterns of corporate
financing in India; and equity market development and
bank lending and corporate financing in the PRC.

In the area of poverty reduction, the Institute’s
research and published papers examined the causes of the
East Asian miracle and its consequences for poverty
reduction; the financial crisis in Indonesia and its impact
on poverty; and the effectiveness of policy interventions to
achieve antipoverty objectives. Other studies relate to
pension reform, the degree of exchange rate co-movements
and business cycle synchronization, and export competitiveness. For more on the Institute's knowledge products,
see http://www.adbi.org/publications/.

The Institute completed 16 capacity-building and
training activities in 2002, including social protection for
the poor, public expenditure management, financial
intermediaries for the poor, and ICT strategies for
developing Asia. A pilot project for interactive on-line and
CD-ROM E-learning modules progressed.

The Institute is represented on ADB’s Knowledge
Management Committee. The new Dean appointed in
September 2002, and the Institute’s Advisory Council will
set the direction of future work (see Appendix 6).

Office of External Relations

The Office of External Relations (OER) disseminates
information about ADB’s operations to both external and
internal audiences. It promotes awareness of ADB's work

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 117

SHILIAILDV LYOddNS GNV 3DG31MON™through its activities in media relations, publications and
web site, newsletters and magazines, briefings and
speechwriting, photographic and video work, and exhibits
and displays.
ADB approved the release of 60 new books in 2002
(see http://www.adb.org/Publications/) and continued to
disseminate ADB documents covered under the Policy on
Confidentiality and Disclosure of Information to 162
depository libraries and several NGO centers worldwide.
ADB's web site, http://www.adb.org, remained an
important vehicle for disseminating information. ADB's online impact was greatly increased with the launch of the
On-line Media Center, which has enabled the timely release
of more news items and background features, and has
provided journalists worldwide with easy access to
information about ADB (see http://www.adb.org/media/).
The Partnership Newsletter, an e-bulletin produced by
OER and ADB's NGO Center and distributed by e-mail,
helped strengthen cooperation between ADB and NGOs.
ADB's capability to undertake effective external
relations was enhanced by media training for senior staff.
Coordination with the resident and regional missions and
representative offices also strengthened external relations,
and improved knowledge dissemination.

External offices

ADB maintains a network of offices worldwide,
consisting of resident missions, a country office, liaison
offices, extended missions, a regional mission, and
representative offices.

With the formation of regional management teams
under the reorganization, the resident and regional
missions and country office have become more closely
integrated with headquarters. The missions’ primary tasks
are to promote external relations with the government and
stakeholders, including NGOs and civil society. The
missions raise ADB's visibility among clients, beneficiaries,
and stakeholders; and help enhance ADB's client service.
They also assist headquarters in carrying out economic,
thematic, and sector work; preparing country strategies and
programs; and managing DMC portfolios.

Resident mission

A resident mission is an office located in a DMC involved
in government, civil society, and private sector relations;
policy dialogue and support; country reporting; aid
coordination; and external relations and information
dissemination, and certain specific functions as delegated
by ADB headquarters.

In 2002, ADB maintained resident missions in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, PRC, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam.

Also in 2002, ADB celebrated the 20-year anniversary
of the Bangladesh Resident Mission—the first resident
mission established by ADB (see http://vww.adb.org/BRM/,

118 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

and opened its new office building in New Delhi—the first
office building owned by ADB outside its headquarters in
Manila (see http://vww.adb.org/INRM/).

In a 2002 review of the Resident Mission Policy, ADB
identified a need for more clearly defining the division of
labor between the resident missions and the regional
departments in headquarters, and increasing the interaction
among the missions themselves (see the Board of Directors’
Budget Review Committee report on pages 7 and 8).

Country office

A country office has the same functions as a resident
mission but is located in the country hosting the
ADB headquarters. ADB maintains the Philippines
Country Office.

Special office/special liaison office

A special office is a temporary office to provide urgent
development assistance to a DMC whose work program
has yet to be formalized. In 2002, ADB maintained a
special office in Timor-Leste. A special liaison office is also
temporary but less formal. In 2002, ADB maintained a
special liaison office in Afghanistan. This has since been
approved as a resident mission.

Extended mission

An office created in a DMC where a resident mission
already exists, the extended mission addresses the specific
needs of a country. Headquarters-based staff temporarily
reside in the DMC to undertake specific assignments. In
2002, ADB had an extended mission in Gujarat, India and
Papua New Guinea, and an extended mission arrangement
from March to December in Tajikistan. The status of the
extended missions in Papua New Guinea and Tajikistan
changed to resident missions in 2002.

Regional mission

A regional mission is an office that is responsible for a
group of geographically contiguous countries, with
functions similar to that of a resident mission—loan and
technical assistance administration, aid coordination,
government liaison, information dissemination, and
nongovernment organization coordination. In 2002, ADB
maintained the South Pacific Regional Mission in Port Vila,
Vanuatu—covering Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu (see
http://www.adb.org/SPRM/).

Representative office

A representative office is an office of ADB in a nonborrowing member country that is involved in resource mobilization, and liaises with other multilateral and bilateral
development agencies and other international organizations, both intergovernment and nongovernment.

ADB has representative offices in Europe, Japan, and
North America.

A joint consultation meeting in 2002 between ADB's
Strategy and Policy Department and the representativeoffices sought ways to strengthen the role of the offices in
external relations, resource mobilization, and interagency
coordination with multilateral and bilateral development
institutions and donors. Proactive information gathering
and dissemination among stakeholders are being
encouraged in several areas: ADB's ongoing and planned
program of operations; strategies, policies, and procurement procedures; development issues and constraints faced
by DMCs and ways ADB addresses these; and ADB’s
resource requirements.

For ADB contact addresses, see the list of offices on
pages 281-282 and http://www.adb.org/About/field.asp.

Information management

The new business processes seek to strengthen
information sharing and management through more
effective use of ICT. The processes also established
procedures for more efficient storage and dissemination
of knowledge.

In 2002, ADB installed 1,370 new computers and
265 new printers as part of the 3-year replacement plan,

Several initiatives under the Information Systems
and Technology Strategy were completed in 2002
(see http://Awww.adb.org/Documents/Policies/ICT/
ict610.asp).

* — The Integrated Human Resource Management/Payroll and core Financial Management and
Treasury/Banking systems became operational in
June 2002. An enterprise server was acquired to
host these applications.

+ New treasury risk management software
and hardware were procured and are being implemented.

+ Infrastructure upgrades—aimed at
increased availability, higher reliability, and better
performance—were implemented with enhanced
network security tools.

+ All security-related hardware and
software, such as firewalls and proxy servers, were
replaced or upgraded.

+ An integrated backup system was
procured to provide better network and server management capabilities and antivirus features.

+ The upgrade of the secure password
generator and telecommunications infrastructure
vulnerability was completed.

+ Development of a digitized archival and
storage system for multimedia materials and the
upgrade of the in-house television studio improved
ADB's ability to produce media-related materials.

* The introduction of a web-based information portal will provide easier access to information at headquarters and from remote locations
through a single user interface.

and provided all computers with new software. All
departments and offices now have access to multimedia
workstations equipped with business card readers,
scanners, file compressors, and compact disc-writers.

The activities of the service desk were reviewed and
enhanced. Support was given to ADB's reorganization by
providing services to nearly 1,000 staff members relocated
within the building.

Videoconferencing facilities are now available at
14 ADB remote sites and over 450 meetings were
conducted via videoconferencing from ADB headquarters in
Manila in 2002. Satellite equipment was activated at seven
resident missions. Integrated voice, data, and videoconferencing facilities were implemented over a single network,
providing more capability at current cost. An interim
satellite link was established in Afghanistan to strengthen
ADB's activities in the country, and support was given for
the relocation of the India Resident Mission. Disaster
recovery procedure tests were performed at an off-site
location, including backup and recovery of new payroll
and financial systems.

ADB's information technology (IT) strategy was
supported in 2002 with seminars and a review of design
requirements for a center for learning, information,
communication, and knowledge. The IT Strategy Working
Group, comprising representatives from each department
and office, began work on an IT strategy for 2003-2007.
The group assessed the existing IT environment and
examined future IT business needs. The newly established
IT Committee reviewed and prioritized these requirements
and provided guidance on the overall investment needed.

Successful pilot testing for the London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan software was completed.

A knowledge-based application was developed to
track and coordinate responses to NGOs across all
departments and offices in ADB. Support to the sector
and thematic networks included producing a webenabled application to capture information from various
internal systems.

ADB's Library, with its collection of over 200,000
volumes, continued as a knowledge resource center for

INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

9
4n 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)

undertook a comprehensive review of its organiza
tional structure and operational business processes

as part of its response to the challenges of reducing

poverty in the Asia and Pacific region. In 2002, ADB

implemented the recommendations of that review,
reorganizing itself with the aim of supporting the
development agenda of its developing member countries
(DMCs) more effectively than ever.

Reorganization

The major objectives of the reorganization include
balanced country and sector considerations, improved
quality and expertise, enhanced safeguard compliance,
clearer accountability, and greater emphasis on regional
cooperation and knowledge management (see the
Knowledge and Support Activities chapter).

New organizational structure

At the heart of the new organizational structure are five
regional departments aimed at formulating and implementing more country-focused programs and enhancing
subregional cooperation. These are the East and Central
Asia Department, Mekong Department, Pacific Department,
South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia Department
(see the Country Reports chapter). The reorganization aims
to help ADB respond more quickly and effectively to the
needs of DMCs, because a single department is responsible
for making decisions for operations. Staff members can
acquire better understanding and knowledge of a particular
country because they work on fewer countries. The
reorganization is expected to result in better delivery of
services to DMCs.

Another new department—the Regional and Sustainable Development Department—was established as a center
for technical excellence, quality and compliance, and
information exchange. Other departments’ responsibilities
were realigned and clarified.

Along with the new organizational structure, ADB
introduced new operational business processes for its key
operations—programming; economic, thematic, and sector
work; and project processing and implementation (see
Appendix 7A-7B and http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/
Reorganization_2002).

New business processes

The new business processes are designed to implement the
Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2001-2015—which
sets ADB's mission, development objectives, and corporate
agenda; the Medium-Term Strategy 2001-2005; and the
reorganization. As envisioned in the LTSF, the new business
processes emphasize the centrality of the country strategy
and program (CSP) in ADB operations and enhance the focus
on strategic subregional cooperation objectives. Stakeholder
participation has been expanded by building this into key
stages of the programming and operational cycles.

The new business processes are designed to be more
streamlined and flexible; to enable greater responsiveness

 

to clients; and to delegate more authority. Accountability
for the delivery of products and services has been more
clearly established. Operational vice-presidents supervise
and oversee the work of the regional departments. The
director general of each regional department is
accountable for the effective and timely delivery of
quality loan and nonlending products and services. The
new business processes emphasize the importance of
teamwork. Each regional department has a regional
management team. Each country has a country team,
headed by senior staff at ADB headquarters or in the
respective resident missions. The country team includes
staff from within the regional department, and from
other ADB departments as needed. Project teams are
established for all loan projects.

Under the new business processes, better identification and conceptualization of projects at the initial stage of
the project cycle are emphasized to ensure quality at entry.
More inputs during the early stages of the processing cycle
allow staff to assess the direction and scope of the
proposed project in greater depth, identify areas of
analysis, and prepare a detailed implementation plan for
project processing. Provisions for compliance with
safeguard policies have been strengthened with the
appointment of a Chief Compliance Officer (see Safeguard
Policy Compliance on page 43).

In addition, there is greater delegation of administrative and project administration matters. ADB’s revised
project administration instructions, launched on
1 January 2002, aim to improve project readiness and
simplify major delegation and procedures in project
administration. Efforts have been made to simplify key
documents to avoid repetition, ensure clearer presentation, and enable the reader to focus on the key aspects
of the product.

The new business processes also aim to enhance
quality, operational relevance, and development
effectiveness of knowledge products and services; and
disseminate results more widely. A Knowledge Management Committee, chaired by the President, oversees the
ADB-wide knowledge products and services process.

SYALIVI TVNOILALILSNIImplementation and review

To coordinate implementation of the new organizational
structure and business processes, ADB President Tadao
Chino approved in February 2002 the establishment of a
coordination group comprising nine department heads. The
group met regularly in 2002.

Overall, the major structural changes were accomplished according to the plan and schedule; however, as
with any structural change of this scale, there was a period
of adjustment. For some staff members, this transition
period was more challenging because they were adapting
to new roles as members of country teams, project teams,
or thematic/sector committees.

The reorganization design included provisions for
an internal staff progress review in 2003, which will assess
the progress made on achieving the key objectives of the
reorganization, and identify issues that emerged during
implementation. An independent assessment of the
effectiveness of the organizational changes in meeting the
objective of better serving the DMCs will be conducted
2 years after the reorganization.

Changes in accounting

Major changes in loan accounting and servicing requirements were needed when the new London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan (LBL) product was
introduced on 1 July 2001. A project office was set up in
the Controller's Department in early 2002 to oversee the
procurement, development, and implementation of the new
system, referred to as the Comprehensive Loan Administration and Servicing System (CLASS). During the year, interim
solutions for processing LBLs were implemented, including
enhancing the existing loan accounting system and
developing spreadsheet models. Bidders’ technical and
financial proposals were evaluated. The CLASS will cover
all required features of the LBL, including interest rate
conversions, currency conversions, interest rate caps and
collars, and rebates and surcharges. It will also cover other
ADB loan and guarantee products, as well as equity
investments.

Human resource management,
training, and development

Human resource programs and activities in 2002 focused
on attracting, retaining, and motivating staff members in
support of ADB's poverty reduction agenda.

Skills in regional cooperation, social protection,
performance-based allocation, and the LIBOR-based
lending modality were targeted. Recruitment processes
were improved by including telephone interviews and
assessing candidates’ motivation level through questionnaires prior to their interviews in Manila. The questionnaires assist user departments in their interviews of
candidates.

Also in 2002, the review of the Gender Action
Program—a program that was begun in 1998 to address

122 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

ADB staff members had many opportunities in
2002 to upgrade their skills. In the area of external relations, training workshops on working with
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) helped staff
members in the Mekong and South Asia resident
missions and those at headquarters improve their
capacity to tap the strengths of NGOs in development work. The workshops, organized through
ADB's NGO Center, will impact on the quality and
delivery of ADB projects.

gender disparity (see http://www.adb.org/gender/)—was
completed. The representation of women professional staff
continued to rise in 2002 in absolute and percentage terms,
and the number of women in levels 5 and 6 increased, but
the number of senior women professional staff remains
low. A second Gender Action Program was considered by
Management for implementation in 2003. This program is
expected to focus on strategies to increase the number of
senior women professional staff, and the number of
women in the operational areas, as well as improve their
overall representation.

Other activities centered on enhancing the Human
Resource Management Information System under the
Integrated Financial Management and Human Resource
Management Information System (INTEGRA) project (see
the Operational Priorities and Performance chapter), which
was implemented in June 2002. Employee assistance
programs—such as spouse liaison assistance, legal
assistance, and external counseling—continued to be
available to staff. Programs that recognize service and
exemplary performance were reviewed.

The 2002 training and development activities in
headquarters and the external offices focused on building
staff members’ technical skills in the sector and thematic
areas; and on familiarizing staff members with the new
business processes. A management reorganization retreat
for senior staff members, a country team leaders’ program,
and department planning retreats were held to support the
reorganization. The team approach and related topics on
negotiation, mediation, and facilitation were introduced in
seminars and workshops, particularly in the mission
leadership programs.

Training also provided staff members with the
information and communication technology (ICT) skills
needed to manage the INTEGRA. ADB continued to send
staff members to external learning events to improve
technical skills and to benefit from leadership and
management seminars! not available in-house. Several
staff members, who attended the in-house Ateneo?-ADB
Masters in Business Administration program, graduated
in 2002.

! Fourteen senior staff members (Directors and above) attended the
Columbia Program in Tokyo and New York.

2 Ateneo de Manila University Graduate School of Business is one of the

program.ADB continued to provide government officials, staff
from other international organizations, graduate students,
and academes with the opportunity to learn more about
ADB through the Orientation Program for DMC Officials;
and the secondment, internship, and fellowship programs.

At the end of 2002, ADB had 2,220 staff members
coming from 49 of its 61 members. The total comprised
794 professional staff members* and 1,426 support staff
members,’ of which 321 staff members? or about 14.5% are
located in the external offices. During the year, there were
93 appointments and 62 departures of professional staff
members, while 93 support staff members joined ADB
and 67 left. The number of women professional staff
members increased from 198 or 26.1% of total professional
staff members at the end of 2001, to 217 or 27.3% at
the end of 2002.

Compensation

Consistent with ADB’s market-driven compensation system,
a 3.3% increase in the professional staff salary structure
was approved in 2002 (effective 1 January 2003). For local
staff at headquarters, the salary survey for 2002 resulted in
a 9.6% increase effective 1 January 2002. Annual salary
increases for local staff in the external offices were
likewise implemented.

Administrative services

To further focus on client and service orientation, the
Office of Administrative Services (OAS) initiated a series of
outreach activities in 2002, including seminars and
workshops on administrative services, an OAS newsletter,
and a revamped OAS web site.

ADB undertook a comprehensive review of its safety
and security policies and procedures, including physical
security and safety, technical security, access control, staff
awareness program, emergency management system, and
liaison with other security-related organizations.

A comprehensive program for restoring facilities in the
10-year-old headquarters building was initiated.

The fixed assets, inventory, and procurement modules
of INTEGRA became functional in June 2002. The fixed
assets module provides up-to-date accounting and location
information on fixed assets located at headquarters. When
fully implemented, the procurement module is expected to
improve the turnaround time for procurement processing,
ensure information accuracy, and facilitate ADB payments.
The module will also help improve procurement management.

Internal administrative budget

Actual internal administrative expenses (IAEs) for 2002
amounted to $234.3 million, a savings of $5.7 million

Includes Management—i.e., the President and Vice-Presidents—and
Directors’ Advisors, and staff on secondment, on special leave without
pay, and on loan to the ADB Institute.

Includes staff on special leave without pay.

Includes 64 professional staff and 257 support staff.

 

against the original budget of $240.0 million (see

Appendix 10). The savings came mainly from incurring
lower-than-expected expenses related to the 35" Annual
Meeting, depreciation of the Philippine currency, and not
using the 1% general contingency. Under the budget
category of operational expenses, additional resources were
required during the midyear review due to activities not
planned when the 2002 budget was formulated, particularly
ADB operations in Afghanistan. As a result of reprioritizing
the work program and effective budget monitoring, actual
use of the operational expenses budget was kept within
the initial allocation.

The IAE budget for 2003 amounts to $258.7 million,
including a general contingency of 1% (summarized in
Appendix 10). The budget growth is 7.9% over the 2002
revised estimate, largely due to an increased contribution
to the staff retirement plan and growing depreciation
charges. Excluding these two items, the budget growth
would have been 5.2%, lower than in the past 2 years.

Budgetary resources in 2003 will fund the
following major initiatives: promote demand-driven
expansion of ordinary capital resources lending and private
sector operations; continue support and expansion of the
resident/regional missions and representative offices;
improve product quality through safeguards and compliance; and promote regional and subregional cooperation.

In addition to the IAEs, the 2003 budget also
includes an annual capital budget of $4.3 million, mainly
to fund regular capital expenditures for headquarters
facilities and ICT equipment and to meet requirements of
the external offices.

Audit and anticorruption

The Office of the General Auditor (OGA) conducts periodic,
independent, and objective appraisals of ADB activities to
ensure adequate and effective internal controls and to
improve economy and efficiency in the use of resources in
carrying out ADB's mission. OGA is also the focal point in
ADB's drive against corruption, addressing alleged incidents
of corruption or fraud in its projects or by its staff. OGA
reports directly to the President. The Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors reviews OGA’s activities.

OGA completed 27 internal audits in 2002 that led
to recommendations to ensure that appropriate
procedures are implemented in facilitating portfolio,
country, and project risks management in private sector
operations, and providing timely information; recording
accurately and completely ADB’s assets to ensure
adequate insurance coverage and maintenance of control
over the assets; and enhancing monitoring of investment
of ADB's staff retirement fund. Other recommendations
were aimed at liquidating promptly advances to suppliers
and all accrued and deferred charges relating to
procurement of materials for the maintenance of building
and office facilities; and identifying and providing
training to meet the needs of individuals, departments,
sectors, and the organization, and determining the
results of such training on staff.

PARTNERSHIP POINT

 

OGA actively participated in the data conversion and
user acceptance testing of the INTEGRA project; monitoring
the implementation process, including the user acceptance
testing of the Treasury Risk Management System, which is
anticipated to be activated in 2003; fallback tests for the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) and mainframe facilities; and various administrative procurements, providing comments and observations to ensure compliance with procurement guidelines.

OGA provided integrated assistance to ADB's external
auditors in their audit of ADB's annual financial statements
and their review of interim financial statements for ADB’s
bond offerings.

ADB's Anticorruption Unit is the contact point for
reporting allegations of fraud and corruption in ADBfinanced projects or among its staff members. The

124 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

Anticorruption Unit in 2002 opened 81 cases to review
allegations of fraud and corruption—a total of 272 cases
since ADB adopted the Anticorruption Policy in 1998. In
2002, ADB reprimanded 4 firms and 1 individual, and
declared 11 firms and 7 individuals ineligible to participate
in any ADB-financed activities. A cumulative total of

28 firms and 40 individuals were declared ineligible by

the end of 2002.

In 2002, the Anticorruption Unit increased awareness
of the Anticorruption Policy and the Anticorruption Unit
through presentations, workshops, and publications. OGA
jointly investigated allegations with the World Bank, and
cooperated with several multilateral development banks
(MDBs) and the United Nations in connection with
investigations and the harmonization of investigation
procedures. See http://www.adb.org/anticorruption for
information on ADB’s anticorruption efforts, including how to
report fraud and corruption; ADB's procedures for dealing
with allegations; and ADB's sanction and appeal processes.

OGA played an active role in upgrading the audit
capability of supreme audit institutions (SAIs) in DMCs. In
2002, OGA was involved in training programs for the Asian
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, the South
Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions, and
government auditors in three Central Asian countries. OGA
also continued to exchange information regarding anticorruption issues, capacity building, and auditing with SAls and
other MDBs through meetings, international conferences,
and the annual meeting of the heads of audit of MDBs.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION ~

PeOverview

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is an international
development finance institution whose vision is to make
the Asian and Pacific region free of poverty. ADB was
established in 1966 through the “Agreement Establishing
the Asian Development Bank” (the Charter), ratified by

31 countries to promote the social and economic
development of the region. ADB has 61 members (as of
31 December 2002), of which 44 are in the region. ADB is
rated triple-A by Moody's and Standard & Poors.

In pursuing its objectives, ADB provides different
forms of financial assistance to its developing member
countries (DMCs). The main instruments are loans,
technical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity
investments, which are met through various funding
resources. Such funding resources are ADB's ordinary
capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources to
fund operations solely under ADB’s administration; and
trust funds, which are externally funded and administered
by ADB on behalf of donors. The Charter requires that each
funding resource be kept separate from the other.

Ordinary capital resources

The OCR come from three distinct sources: private
placements and capital markets in the form of borrowings;
paid-in capital provided by shareholders; and accumulated
retained income (reserves), which provide a buffer for

risk arising from operations (see http://www.adb.org/about/
Jnncemst.asp).

Financial policies

ADB adheres to prudent and conservative financial policies.
The most important financial risk facing ADB as a
multilateral development bank (MDB) is country credit risk.
ADB's income and reserves policy, and its liquidity policy,
serve as the operational framework for addressing such
country credit risk.

The review of the income and reserves policy,
undertaken by the Board of Directors in 1997, identified
ADB's decisive income indicators—the interest coverage
ratio (ICR) and the reserve to loan ratio (RLR). The ICR is
the ratio of net income to financial expenses plus a factor
of one. It measures the extent to which net income can fall
without jeopardizing ADB's ability to service its financial
expenses from current income. The review concluded that
the minimum level for the ICR should be 1.31. The RLR is
the ratio of total reserves to the sum of outstanding loans,
equity investments, and guarantees. The RLR measures the
adequacy of ADB's earning base relative to its loan assets.
The policy maintains an RLR of 25%. At the end of 2002,
ADB's ICR was 1.65 and the RLR was 30.83.

Due to the need to increase ADB's risk-bearing
capacity resulting from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, ADB
reviewed its OCR loan charges in 1999. A change in the
structure of these charges was recommended and approved
by the Board of Directors, and became effective on
1 January 2000. ADB's lending spread for pool-based loans

 

was raised from 40 to 60 basis points. A front-end fee of
1% was introduced for new loans, and a commitment fee
of 0.75% was adopted for new program loans.

In 2002, the Board of Directors approved a new
liquidity policy, which is aimed at maintaining investor
confidence by ensuring that ADB has the capacity to meet
its cash requirements in the event of a major disruption in
its cash flows. The old policy maintained a prudential
minimum level of liquid assets at no less than 40% of yearend undisbursed loan balance. The new policy has more
dynamic cash flow-driven liquidity requirements:

¢ the prudential minimum level of liquidity to be
held at all times during a calendar year is 40% of the next
3 years’ proxy net cash requirements, which is the sum of
net disbursement and debt redemption;

¢ — the discretionary liquidity will have a ceiling of
50% of the size of prudential minimum liquidity and will be
funded by debt without prior authorization of the Board of
Directors; and

¢ — the core liquidity portfolio, which will be broadly
equivalent to the prudential minimum liquidity, can be
funded by equity capital and debt.

The three major elements that determine the
effectiveness and efficiency of ADB’s financial intermediation consist of its stand-alone financial strength, appropriateness of its financial loan products, and the strength of
shareholder support.

The annual review of ADB’s income outlook and
allocation of the previous year's net income provides the
instrument for reviewing ADB's medium-term prospects
and the adequacy of its equity capital, net income, and
reserves. These are measures of ADB's risk-bearing
capacity, which play an important role in ensuring ADB’s
financial soundness. Based on the annual review, the
Board of Directors makes a recommendation to the Board
of Governors on the amount of ADB's OCR net income
that should be allocated to the ordinary reserve and how
much to surplus.

In May 2000, ADB's Board of Governors adopted
Resolution No. 270, requesting that the Board of Directors
study ADB's future resource requirements to finance its
ordinary operations, and to report its findings and
recommendations to the Board of Governors. However,
ADB's financial framework had to be reviewed before the
Board of Directors could assess the implications of the OCR
lending operations projected in the 3-year rolling work
program on its resource requirements over the medium
term. Thus, there was a need to address issues related to
the statutory controls and policies related to lending and
borrowing limitations.

The Board of Directors considered in October 2002! a
working paper reviewing ADB's lending and borrowing
limitations in light of different interpretations taken by
other MDBs on lending limitations, and in response to
questions of interpretation raised by several ADB Directors
about ADB's lending and borrowing limitation policies, as
provided for by ADB’s Charter. The review concluded that

' This set of policies was adopted by the Board in February 2003.

41 January 2001.

Basis of financial reporting

Statutory reporting: ADB prepares its financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
applied in the United States (US). Effective 1 January 2001,
ADB adopted the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” along with its related amendments under FAS
138. These two standards are collectively termed “FAS 133.”

As defined and required by FAS 133, ADB has marked
all derivative instruments to fair value and reported in the
balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized in
current net income.

Under FAS 133, two options exist in accounting for
derivative instruments: hedge or non-hedge accounting. In
hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of certain hedgeinstruments have to be reflected in current income, while
others have to be reflected in other comprehensive income
as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedge item. In
non-hedge accounting, all changes in the fair value of hedge
instruments need to be recognized as current income. A
preliminary assessment using the FAS 133 hedge accounting
criteria indicates that most of ADB’s derivative transactions
are highly effective in hedging underlying transactions and
are appropriate for its operations in achieving lower funding
costs. At the same time, however, ADB has also found that
applying the FAS 133 hedge criteria does not entirely reflect
ADB's risk management strategies. Compliance with the
hedge criteria would impose undue constraints on ADB's
future borrowing, loan, and hedge programs, and likely
detract from its focus of minimizing the cost of borrowings.
Therefore, ADB believes it is more important to continue
pursuing the objective of minimizing the cost of borrowings
rather than follow the accounting definition of a qualifying
hedge. The application of the FAS 133 qualifying hedge
criteria would not make the economic risks inherent in
ADB's financial assets and liabilities fully evident.
Accordingly, ADB chooses to adopt non-hedge accounting
and recognizes changes in fair value of derivative
instruments in the period as part of the net income.

Supplemental reporting: ADB manages its balance
sheet by selectively using derivatives to minimize the interest
rate and currency risks associated with its financial assets and
liabilities. It uses derivative instruments to enhance asset/
liability management of individual positions and portfolios,
and to reduce borrowing costs. As certain financial
instruments (including all derivatives and certain investments)
are recognized at their fair value, while others are still at cost
(loans and borrowings), FAS 133 does not fully reflect the
overall economic value of ADB's financial instruments.

ADB also prepares two supplemental financial
statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis:
current value basis and pre-FAS 133 basis. ADB believes
that the financial statements under current value basis
present the economic value of all its financial instruments.
On the other hand, the pre-FAS 133 basis presents the
financial information that is comparable to that in prior
years for management information and decision making.

Discussion and analysis of current value

The Condensed Current Value Balance Sheets (see page 130)
present ADB's estimates of the economic value of its
financial assets and liabilities, taking into consideration
changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and credit risks.
Current value reflects the exit price for financial instruments
with liquid markets and accordingly is similar in most
respects to fair value. For financial instruments with no
market, current value reflects the expected cash flow streams
discounted with the appropriate interest and exchange rates.
The reversal of the FAS 133 effects removes the impact
related to the adoption of FAS 133, as these effects are
already accounted for in the current value adjustment. For
details, see the Condensed Current Value Income Statement
and a summary of the effects on net income of the current
value adjustments in the balance sheet on page 131.

 

Current value balance sheets

Loan portfolio: The majority of ADB’s loans are made to
or guaranteed by ADB members. ADB does not sell its
loans, believing that there is no comparable market for
them. The current value of loans incorporates Management’s best estimate of the probable expected cash flows,
including interest, to ADB. Estimated cash flows from
principal repayments, interest, and other loan charges are
discounted by the applicable market yield curves for ADB's
funding cost, plus ADB's lending spread.

The current value also includes ADB's appropriate
credit risk assessment. To recognize the risk inherent in
these and other potential overdue payments, ADB has
adjusted the value of the loans through its loan loss
provisioning for private sector operations. For public sector
loans, ADB has never suffered a loss, except opportunity
losses resulting from the difference between the present
value of expected payments for interest and charges,
according to the loan’s contractual terms, and actual
timing of cash flows. Accordingly, no loan loss provision is
provided against public sector loans.

The positive adjustment of $2.4 billion, equivalent to
8.3% of ADB's loan balance—from the FAS 133 reported
basis of $29.5 billion to the current value basis of
$31.9 billion—indicates that the loans in the portfolio, on
average, carry a higher interest rate than ADB would be
able to originate such loans at current rates.

Investments and related swaps: Under both the
reported and current value basis, the investments held by
ADB are carried and reported at fair values. Fair value is
based on market quotations. In the case of instruments for
which market quotations are not readily available, the
current value is calculated using market-based valuation
models. During 2002, ADB entered into two asset swap
transactions as a result of the new liquidity policy.

Equity investments: Equity investments with readily
determinable fair values (i.e, market value) are reported at
fair value. Unlisted equity investments without market
value are reported at cost less allowance for losses,
which represent a fair approximation of the current value.

Receivables from members: Receivables from
members consist of unrestricted and may be restricted
promissory notes. The current value of receivables from
members is based on the cash flow of the projected
encashment of the promissory notes, discounted using
appropriate interest and exchange rates.

Borrowings after swaps: The current value of these
liabilities includes the value of the debt securities and the
financial derivative instruments associated with the
borrowings portfolio. The current value of these liabilities is
calculated using market-based valuation models.

The increase in the valuation of these liabilities of
$2.4 billion—equivalent to 9.3% in the value of the
borrowings portfolio after swaps, from the FAS 133
reported basis of $26.0 billion to the current value basis of
$28.4 billion—represents the difference between the
average cost of ADB's borrowing portfolio and its current
value based on relevant market yield curves.

The total current value adjustment of $429.0 million for the
year ended 31 December 2002 (unfavorable adjustment of
$243.2 million in 2001) represents the change in the current
value of all ADB's financial instruments during the year.
The current value adjustment reflects changes in both interest
rates and currency exchange rates. For 2001, the current
value adjustment included a transition loss of $81.7 million,
which was the cumulative effect of the adoption of the
current value basis of accounting on | January 2001.

For the year 2002, current value net income was
$1.2 billion, compared with the pre-FAS 133 net income of
$753.9 million and the statutory reported net income of
$978.7 million (see table on page 131). The $429 million
increase from the pre-FAS 133 basis to current value basis
(i.e., current value adjustment) comprises net effect of
$130.9 million from the valuation of all outstanding
financial instruments; $89.7 million of unrealized
investment holding gains; and $208.4 million of
accumulated translation adjustments for the year ended
31 December 2002 (see table on page 131).

The net increase of $130.9 million in the current value
adjustments on the balance sheet during 2002 was a result
of an increase in the mark-to-current value on loans of
$792.8 million and on receivable from members of
$12.9 million, offset by an increase in the mark-to-current
value on borrowings of $665.7 million and an investment
swap payable of $9.1 million.

transition adjustment, was due primarily to changes in
exchange rates. Translation adjustments, reflected as
part of “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income”
under the reported basis, are presented as current value
adjustments. Specifically, a significant portion of ADB’s
loans, investments, and borrowings was denominated in
Japanese yen. While the Japanese yen depreciated
sharply in 2001 and appreciated sharply in 2002 against
the US dollar, this exchange rate volatility resulted in a
significant positive change of translation adjustments of
$208.4 million.

nequity investments to its DMCs to help them meet their

Loans: Until 30 June 2001, ADB's three lending
windows for loans from OCR were the pool-based
multicurrency loan (PMCL) window, pool-based singlecurrency loan (PSCL) window in US dollars, and marketbased loan (MBL) window. With the introduction of the
London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan (LBL)
products on 1 July 2001, the PMCL and MBL were no
longer offered; on 1 July 2002, the PSCL in US dollars was
retired. For ADB to evolve into a full-fledged LIBOR-based
lender, the Board of Directors also approved the retirement
of all existing loan products, and the program of offering
borrowers the option to transform the undisbursed
balances of their PSCLs in US dollars and MBLs into LBLs
provided that the undisbursed PSCL balance was not less
than 40% of the loan amount as of 30 June 2001. By
15 December 2002, total undisbursed balances of
$6.7 billion under 97 PSCLs to 11 borrowing countries were
transformed to LBL terms as scheduled. For details, see the
table below and http://www.adb.org/finance/. As of
31 December 2002, the transformation program had been
completed. The LBL is a timely response to borrower
demand for new ADB financial loan products that suit
project needs and external debt risk management strategies.
The LBL products give borrowers a high degree of flexibility
in managing interest rate and exchange rate risks and at the
same time provide low intermediation risk to ADB.

OCR loan approvals, disbursements, repayments,
and prepayments: In 2002, 36 OCR loans totaling
$4.0 billion were approved, compared with 30 OCR loans
totaling $4.0 billion approved in 2001. Of the total OCR
2002 amount, 87.9% of the loans went to India, People’s
Republic of China, Pakistan, and Indonesia (in order of
magnitude). Disbursements in 2002 totaled $3.1 billion, an
increase of 7.6% from $2.8 billion in 2001. Principal
repayments for the year were $3.3 billion, of which

$2.0 billion represented prepayments on loans. In 2002,

18 loans were fully prepaid and 1 loan was partially prepaid.
On 31 December 2002, cumulative loans outstanding after
allowance for losses amounted to $29.1 billion.

Status of loans: Three public sector OCR loans (two to
Myanmar and one to Nauru), and 13 private sector loans
were in nonaccrual status at the end of 2002. The total
outstanding balances of these public and private sector loans
were $3.2 million ($3.1 million in 2001) and $83.9 million
($75.4 million in 2001), respectively. The increase in private
sector loans in nonaccrual status was mainly due to
defaulted loans. One loan came out of nonaccrual status
during 2002. The combined total of $87.1 million represented
0.3% of the total OCR loans outstanding.

Lending rates: The lending rates for the PMCL and
PSCL US dollar loan windows are based on the previous
semester's average cost of borrowings. The interest from
the MBL window is on either fixed or floating rate terms.
The lending rates for MBLs are determined on the basis of
the 6-month LIBOR with reset dates of either 15 March and
15 September or 15 June and 15 December. ADB’s poolbased variable lending rates for multicurrency loans and for
US dollar loans are shown on page 133. For the second half
of 2002, the lending rate for multicurrency loans decreased
to 3.91% per annum, and the rate for US dollar loans
decreased to 6.34% per annum.

In addition to lending rates, lending spread is charged
to all borrowers. As of 1 January 2000, this was between
40 and 60 basis points. For private enterprises, the lending
spread is determined on a case-by-case basis to cover
ADB's risk exposure to particular borrowers and projects.

Twenty-seven LBLs became effective in 2002, of which
23 are in US dollars and 4 in Japanese yen. In addition,
undisbursed balances of $6.7 billion under 97 PSCL US
dollar loans were transformed to LBL terms. The lending
rates are based on the 6-month LIBOR by reference to each
loan service payment date, plus a lending spread.

@ Lending rates are set on 1 January and 1 July every year and are valid for 6-month
periods.

For public sector LBLs, rebates and surcharges are
standard features, which can have two components:
adjustment of ADB's basic lending spread; and adjustment
of the cost base. To maintain the principle of cost passthrough pricing, ADB returns the actual sub-LIBOR funding
cost margin to its LBL public sector borrowers through
rebates. A surcharge could arise if ADB’s funding cost is
above 6-month LIBOR, which is remote unless ADB
experiences serious credit deterioration. Rebate/surcharge
rates are set on | January and 1 July every year and are
based on the actual average funding cost margin for the
preceding 6-month period. In 2002, ADB returned the actual
sub-LIBOR funding cost margin of $2.4 million to its LBL
public sector borrowers based on the rebate rates.

Technical assistance: ADB considers technical
assistance (see http://www.adb.org/TA/) programs as an
important part of ADB's overall operations in helping DMCs
meet their development objectives. From 1967 to 1991,
technical assistance expenses were charged to the OCR
and to other technical assistance funding resources—
Technical Assistance Special Fund, Japan Special Fund, and
trust/grant funds. From 1992 to 2000, no technical
assistance expenses were charged to the OCR. In 2001, the
Board of Directors approved the financing of high-priority
technical assistance programs out of OCR current income
within a rolling 4-year financing framework. The amount of
financing required varies between years and is subject to
the approval of the Board of Directors.

Guarantees: ADB provides guarantees as credit
enhancements for eligible projects to cover risks that the
private sector cannot easily absorb or manage on its own.
Reducing these risks can make a significant difference in
mobilizing debt funding for projects. ADB has used its
guarantee instruments successfully for infrastructure
projects, financial institutions, capital markets, and trade
finance. The guarantee instruments are recognized as offbalance sheet financial instruments in ADB's annual
financial statements. ADB’s total exposure toward signed and
effective loan guarantees is disclosed in Note E of the OCR
Financial Statements.

ADB offers two guarantee products—political risk
guarantees (PRG) and partial credit guarantees (PCG)—both
designed to mitigate risk exposure of commercial lenders
and capital market investors. These guarantees are not
issued on a stand-alone basis but are provided for projects
in which ADB has direct participation. ADB can cooperate
with other multilateral, official, and private sector lenders
and insurers in providing its guarantee products.

 

1 January 2002 0.41 0.17

1 July 2002 0.36 0.16

Political risk guarantees: ADB's PRG program is
designed to facilitate cofinancing by providing lenders/
capital market investors of an ADB-assisted project with
cover against specifically defined political risks. Coverage is
available against any combination of the risks of expropriation, currency inconvertibility or nontransferability, political
violence, and breach of contract, and is available for loans
and other forms of debt instruments. Equity instruments
are ineligible for PRG coverage. Tenors are based on the
merits of the underlying project. All or part of the
outstanding debt service obligations to a lender may be
covered. The cover may be for principal and/or interest
payment obligations. For private sector projects, ADB can
issue a PRG without a counterguarantee from the host
government. However, PRG exposure to a private sector
project without a counterguarantee from the host
government is subject to a maximum of $150 million or
50% of the project cost, whichever is lower. Fees are
market-based and comprise guarantee fees, front-end fees,
and standby fees. ADB's PRG is callable when a guaranteed
event has occurred and such an event has resulted in debt
service default to the guaranteed lender.

In 2002, ADB approved four PRG transactions: One
supporting a $25 million commercial loan to develop a
power project in Viet Nam has become effective. This PRG
was provided under ADB's Co-Guarantee Program whereby
ADB acted as the guarantor-of-record, and laid off all risks
associated with the PRG to a private sector political risk
insurer. The three remaining approved PRGs, with total
support of $235 million, were not effective as of
31 December 2002.

Partial credit guarantees: The PCG provides
comprehensive cover (of both commercial and political
risks) for a specific portion of the debt service profile
provided by cofinanciers. PCG cover is particularly useful
for projects in DMCs with restricted access to financial
markets, but which ADB considers creditworthy and
financially sound. Since the 1997 Asian financial crisis,
borrowers, project sponsors, cofinanciers, and host
governments have aimed to hedge currency mismatch risks
by using the revenue currency as the borrowing currency.
ADB's PCGs can cover local currency debt, including
domestic bond issues or long-term loans from local
financial institutions. For private sector transactions not
supported by a counterguarantee from the host government, the exposure limit stands at $75 million or 25% of
the project cost, whichever is less. Guarantee fees for
private sector transactions are market-based. Fees for
transactions backed by the host government guarantee

borrower or the lender. One PCG project ($500 million
equivalent in Japanese yen) in the public sector was
approved and effective in 2002 to support the Power Sector
Restructuring Project in the Philippines.

ADB is committed to further develop the capital
markets in the region by using its guarantee products
and complementary financing scheme (CFS). ADB’s
guarantee instruments and CFS are reliable instruments in
catalyzing capital flows to its DMCs by providing necessary
credit enhancements.

Private sector equity investments and loans: ADB's
Charter allows ADB to use the OCR to make total equity
investments in private enterprises up to 10% of its
unimpaired paid-in capital, together with reserves and
surplus, exclusive of special reserve. As of 31 December
2002, there were 57 companies in which ADB held equity
only, 24 for loans only, and 17 companies in which it
provided both equity and loans. The total equity portfolio for
the OCR for both outstanding and undisbursed approved
facilities net of allowance for probable losses amounted to
$409.2 million at 31 December 2002. This represented about
33% of the ceiling defined by the Charter.

As of 31 December 2002, the overall private sector
portfolio (equity investments and loans) was about
$1.2 billion, which was within the operational limit of
$1.5 billion set by the Board of Directors. As an interim
arrangement, pending the implementation of a more
objective capital allocation methodology, approvals of
private sector operations in excess of $1.5 billion are
allowed, beginning September 2001. It is also ADB's policy
to limit a single project exposure (aggregate equity
investment and loan) to the lesser of $75 million or 25% of
total project cost. In 2002, ADB approved equity investments amounting to $35.5 million in four projects.

Equity

Total shareholders’ equity on reported basis grew from
$10.9 billion as of 31 December 2001 to $12.4 billion as of
31 December 2002. This was primarily due to the 2002 net
income of $978.7 million, favorable translation adjustments
of $200.7 million, net effect of change in special drawing
rights (SDR) value on capital and reserves of $189.7 million,
unrealized investment holding gains of $89.7 million, and
capital subscriptions received of $10.5 million.

In addition to subscribed and paid-in capital, capital
backing in the form of callable capital can be called only if
required to meet ADB's obligations incurred on borrowings
or guarantees under the OCR. As of 31 December 2002, the
callable capital subscribed amounted to $43.9 billion.

Borrowings

In 2002, ADB completed 80 borrowing transactions in US
dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese yen, euro, and Hong
Kong dollars, raising $5.9 billion in long-term funds (see
table on page 135). The average maturity of such long-term

134 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

borrowings was 7.2 years, compared with 6.2 years in
2001. After swaps, $3.3 billion or 57% of 2002 borrowings
was in US dollars and the remaining $2.6 billion in
Japanese yen. ADB's swap guidelines require that the swap
counterparties have a credit rating of double A or higher.
ADB does not anticipate that any of its counterparties will
fail to perform their obligations under such agreements.

ADB's overriding borrowing objective has always been
to ensure that funds are available to meet its net cash
requirements at the lowest possible cost. Subject to this
objective, ADB seeks to diversify its funding sources across
markets, instruments, and maturities. One of ADB's core
funding strategies is to maintain a strong presence in key
currency bond markets through regular issuance of
benchmark global bonds. Consequently, ADB continues to
enhance the execution of its global bond issues, focusing
on offering investors fairly priced bonds through a price
discovery process, achieving a broad-based distribution
both geographically as well as by investor type, and
ensuring secondary market liquidity. Importantly, ADB also
issues bonds on an opportunistic basis to generate funds at
the lowest cost possible. In this regard, ADB can execute
opportunistic and private placement transactions on short
notice and in the size, structure, and maturity that meet
investors’ requirements. As part of its development
mandate, ADB continues to contribute to the development
of the regional bond markets through local currency bond
issuance. Finally, ADB makes use of the euro-commercial
paper (ECP) program to bridge-finance cash flow
deficiencies when market conditions are not favorable for
issuing long-term debt.

Of the total 2002 borrowings, $3 billion was raised
through three public offerings. In January 2002, ADB
launched a 5-year $2.0 billion benchmark global bond
issue, marking its return to the global US dollar market for
the first time since May 2000. In addition, ADB launched in
August and October 2002 two opportunistic US dollar bond
issues in the principal amount of $500 million each and
with maturities of 10 and 7 years, respectively.

To minimize costs, ADB further enhanced its private
placement funding strategy in 2002. As a result, private
placement borrowing volume increased significantly in
2002, providing ADB with $2.9 billion or almost 50% of the
year's total borrowing. Of the total 2002 private placement

borrowing, $0.6 billion was raised through 50 callable
foreign exchange-linked notes targeted at institutional
investors in Japan. These notes typically have principal
amounts in Japanese yen and coupon rates linked to
exchange rates between two currencies, such as the
Japanese yen and the US dollar. Aside from the issuance of
these structured notes, ADB also raised $1.7 billion through
eight bond issues placed with the Japanese retail market.
With issue size ranging from $40 million to $800 million,
such issues allow ADB to raise cost-efficient funds in
volume. Most of these borrowings have longer maturities,
which are attractive for smoothening ADB's redemption
profile. Finally, ADB executed 19 transactions totaling
$0.6 billion in the form of foreign exchange- and interest
rate-linked notes targeted at large institutional investors in
Asia. All private placement borrowings were swapped on a
fully hedged basis into “plain vanilla” floating liabilities in
Japanese yen and US dollars.

In addition to these long-term borrowings, ADB executed
a total of 36 ECP transactions in 2002, raising $2.8 billion in
short-term funds. All ECPs in 2002 were issued in US dollars
and subsequently swapped into Japanese yen. As of
31 December 2002, only $200 million ECPs were outstanding.

Liquidity portfolio management

The liquidity portfolio helps ensure the uninterrupted
availability of funds to meet loan disbursements, debt
servicing, and other cash requirements. It also contributes
to ADB’s earning base.

The Investment Authority, which is approved by the
Board of Directors, governs liquid asset investments. Its
primary objective is to ensure the security and liquidity of
funds invested. To meet this objective, ADB seeks to
maximize returns on its liquidity portfolio investments.

ADB's investments are made in the same currencies as
received. In compliance with its Charter, ADB does not

 

convert currencies for investment.
At present, liquid investments are
held in 18 currencies.

ADB's liquid assets are held
in obligations of governments and
1,692.6 4,815.9 other official entities, time

5G 45 deposits, and other unconditional

73 6.2 obligations of banks and financial
institutions, and, to a limited

3 7 extent, in corporate bonds,
mortgage-backed securities, and

: asset-backed securities of high
credit quality.

1 4 different risk profiles and

performance benchmarks. The
year-end balance of the liquidity
portfolios in 2002 and 2001,
excluding securities transferred
under securities lending arrangement and pending sales
and purchases, is presented below.

The core portfolio is invested to ensure that the
primary objective of a liquidity buffer is met. Cash inflows
and outflows are minimized to achieve the core portfolio's
objective of maximizing the total return relative to a
defined risk tolerance level. The core portfolio is funded
largely by equity. For this part, the performance is
measured against external benchmarks with an average
duration of about 2 years. The remaining part of the core
portfolio is funded by debt and is invested to maximize the
spread earned by ADB between borrowing cost and
investment income.

The operational cash portfolio is designed to meet net
cash requirements over a 1-month period. It is funded by

Risk management

ADB seeks to ensure that appropriate and robust tools for
risk management of treasury operations are in place. In
2002, ADB substantially completed the installation of an
advanced treasury risk management system. Prior to “live”
operation in 2003, the system will be tested and undergo a
period of parallel operation with other systems.

The treasury risk management system will link the
front, middle, and back office treasury functions into a
seamless, “straight-through-processing” environment. This
will enable more accurate, effective, and efficient risk
management of treasury operations. In addition, it will
permit the introduction of new tools for measuring and
monitoring market and credit risks, such as various valueat-risk measures, and facilitate stress-testing and riskadjusted performance and attribution analysis.

In 2002, significant progress was also made in
strengthening other aspects of the risk management infrastructure. Risk guidelines and procedures were consolidated
and updated. New methodologies for valuing highly
structured transactions were adopted. Investment benchmarks were reviewed; and further improvements, designed
to increase operational efficiencies, were introduced. In
addition, risk-adjusted performance measurement was
strengthened, particularly in connection with the operation
of the externally managed OCR investment portfolio.

In country credit risk management, an internal
quantitative credit risk model was completed in October
2002. The model is intended to be the basis for ADB to
integrate a systematic approach to credit risk management
by having estimates of expected and unexpected loss
linked to the equity capital adequacy, loan loss allowance,
minimum net income requirement, and pricing of OCR
loans. The outputs given by the credit risk model will be
used as inputs for determining ADB's minimum net income
requirements.

In ADB's private sector operations, the Risk Management Unit has two main functions: special assets management to give special attention to the more vulnerable private
sector projects; and credit review to evaluate and give an
independent credit assessment, separate from the operating
division's judgment on each project.

Summary of financial performance and
allocation of net income

Income and expenses: Gross income decreased by 8.0%
from $2.2 billion in 2001 to $2.1 billion in 2002 because of
a decrease in loan, investment, and other income. Of the
total gross income, $1.7 billion was generated by the loan
portfolio, $330.4 million by the investment portfolio, and
$19.7 million from other sources.

136 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

 

Total operating expenses were $1.3 billion in 2002,
down by $216.8 million, or 14.2% from the previous year of
$1.5 billion. The reduction in expenses was because of a
$278.9 million decrease in interest and other financial
expenses and a $5.4 million decrease in provision, offset by
a $31.5 million increase in administrative expenses, and
increase in technical assistance financing of $36.0 million
for 2002. The decrease in interest and other financial
expenses was mainly due to lower interest rates for
variable rate borrowings. The increase in administrative
expenses resulted primarily from the deferral of direct loan
origination expenses of $34.8 million in 2001, compared
with $19.4 million in 2002 and increases in severance pay
and postretirement benefits that are accounted for
based on projected benefits. Total operating expenses
accounted for 63.4% of the gross income, compared with
68.0% in 2001.

For the year ended 31 December 2002, reported net
income was $978.7 million, compared with $863.3 million
of 2001. The increase of $115.4 million (representing a
13.4% increase) in net income is predominantly attributable
to the following.

¢ — Increase in income of $77.3 million reflected the
year-to-date change in fair value of ADB's derivative
instruments, net of amortization of transition adjustment
due to FAS 133. The FAS 133 adjustment is limited to the
change in value of derivative instruments as opposed to all
financial instruments.

e — The remaining increase in income of $38.1 million
was primarily due to the reduction in interest and other
financial expenses outweighing the increase in administrative expenses and technical assistance financing and the
decrease in loan and investment income for the year.

FAS 133 adjustments: The $224.8 million FAS 133
adjustment for the year ended 31 December 2002
represented a rise of $242.1 million in the values of the
derivatives net of the $17.3 million amortization of the FAS
133 transition adjustments during the year. The $242.1 million gain on derivatives arose predominantly because ADB
has several US dollar interest rate swaps with fixed interest
receivable and floating interest payable. The net decrease
in US dollar interest rates in 2002 meant that these
derivatives gained in value.

Allocation of net income: In accordance with the
income and reserves policy approved in 1997, ADB
reviewed in 2002 its income outlook and allocation of 2001
net income. Based on the review, the Board of Governors
approved that, of the 2001 net income after appropriation
to special reserve of $862.0 million, $714.5 million be
allocated to ordinary reserve and $147.5 million to a
separate category of reserves, “Cumulative Revaluation
Adjustments Account.” This represents cumulative FAS 133
adjustments. For 2002, the Board of Directors approved
that there should be no change in OCR loan charges.

Staff retirement plan and postretirement medical
benefits: Retirement benefits are provided through a
contributory defined benefit plan (Pension Plan) where staff
employed by ADB are expected to contribute 9 1/3% of
their salary and are allowed to make additional voluntarycontributions. The Pension Plan is administered by ADB as
a separate fund, which is required to be kept separate from
ADB's resources.
In addition, the postretirement medical benefits plan
is provided to retirees who have elected to enroll in the
Postretirement Plan. ADB covers 75% of the medical
insurance premium.
For the two benefit plans, the recognition of ADB's
obligations is based on the projected benefits obligation, net
of the fair value of the projected plans assets under certain
actuarial assumptions. As of 31 December 2002, the Pension
Plan and the Postretirement Plan showed an unfunded status
of $185.5 million and $124.0 million, respectively. To the
extent allowed, certain costs, gains/losses, and obligations
are deferred and recognized in relevant accounting periods
as permitted by the accounting standards. Consequently, the
unfunded amounts are not recognized as liabilities but the
periodic retirement pension and postretirement costs based
on actuarial valuation have been recognized in the OCR
accounts. Recognition of future costs will depend on the
outcome of future events. In that respect, the fund status
and the periodic costs are reviewed annually with the assistance of actuaries. Such a review may lead to a revision in
the funding rate to the Pension Plan and Postretirement Plan.

 

Special Funds

ADB is authorized by its Charter to establish and administer Special Funds. Special Funds being administered as of
31 December 2002 were the Asian Development Fund
(ADF); the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF); the
Japan Special Fund (JSF), including the Asian Currency
Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF); and the ADB Institute
Special Fund. Financial statements for each fund are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, except for the ADF, which are special purpose
financial statements prepared in accordance with ADF
regulations (see http://www.adb.org/finance/ADF/).

Asian Development Fund

The ADF is ADB's concessional lending window from which
loans are provided to DMCs with low per capita gross
national product and limited debt repayment capacity. The
governments of 28 donor members (regional and
nonregional) have contributed to the totality of the ADF,
which is the only multilateral source of concessional
assistance dedicated exclusively to the needs of Asia and
the Pacific. The ADF supports activities that promote
poverty reduction and improve the quality of life of ADB’s
poorer DMCs (see http://www.adb.org/finance/ADF/).

ADF VIII: The current ADF replenishment (known as
ADF VIII), authorized in December 2000 by Resolution
No. 276 of the Board of Governors, is intended to finance
ADB's concessional lending operations for 2001-2004. The
total replenishment was $2.79 billion based on the
exchange rates specified in the Resolution. By the end of
2002, 23 donors had submitted their Instruments of
Contribution to ADF VIII for a total of $2.27 billion.
Twenty-one donors deposited unqualified Instruments of

 

Contribution. Canada and Taipei,China deposited Instruments of Contribution containing a qualification, as
permitted by the Resolution, that all installment payments
except the first were subject to budgetary appropriations.
Two donors—Italy and the United States—had not
submitted their Instruments of Contribution by year-end.

By the end of the year, all donors that had submitted
their Instruments of Contribution had paid both their first
and second installments. For details of amounts released for
operational commitment in 2002, see the column labeled
“Addition” in Table 31 in the Statistical Annex.

Shortly after it became a member of ADB in April 2002,
Portugal deposited Instruments of Contribution to both ADF
Vil and ADF VIII for €34.2 million and €16.9 million,
respectively. The contribution to the ADF VII formed part of
the ADF resources that funded loan approvals in 2002.

In addition, Spain indicated that it would make an
additional contribution of $100 million (€113.4 million
equivalent) to the ADF VIII, emphasizing the humanitarian
obligation for all donors to respond to the needs of
Afghanistan and its neighboring countries. In August 2002,
the Board of Directors approved the acceptance of this
contribution subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Resolution. Spain provided its first installment in cash.

Of the 25 donors to the ADF VIII, 17 opted to follow
the accelerated encashment schedule specified in the
Resolution, which has an encashment profile of 7 years. Six
other donors—Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland,
Thailand, and United Kingdom—applied the regular
encashment profile, which extends over 10 years. Belgium
applied the International Development Association 12
5-year encashment profile, while Australia modified the
standard profile to accommodate its budgetary requirements, but its notes will be encashed within 7 years.

SISATVNY GNVY NOISSNDSIC S,LNIWADVNVWADF VII: In May 2002, the US deposited promissory
notes for a further $98.0 million of its ADF VII contribution,
consisting of $28.2 million for the balance of its third
installment, and $69.8 million as partial payment (69.8%) of
its fourth installment. Accordingly, four donors—Austria,
France, Germany, and Malaysia—which had previously
exercised their pro rata rights and not made their fourth
installments available for operational commitment, released
69.8% of such installments. The total amount released was
$48.4 million. These resources became part of the ADF VIII
commitment authority in 2002. As of 31 December 2002,
the US’ arrears under ADF VII were $30.2 million and the
amount withheld by other donors totaled $20.9 million.

ADF VI: The US cleared its ADF VI arrears by
depositing a promissory note in the amount of $17,050 in
May 2002.

ADF loan approvals, disbursements, and
repayments: In 2002, 53 ADF loans totaling $1.6 billion
were approved, compared with 46 ADF loans totaling
$1.4 billion approved in 2001. Of the 2002 amount, about
47.7% went to Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Viet Nam (in
order of magnitude). Disbursements during 2002 totaled
$1,135.5 million, an increase of 10.9% from $1,024.3 million in 2001. At the end of the year, cumulative
disbursements from ADF resources were $18.7 billion.
Loan repayments during the year amounted to
$262.3 million, and cumulative repayments were
$1.9 billion. As of 31 December 2002, ADF loans
outstanding amounted to $17.2 billion.

Status of loans: At the end of 2002, 28 public sector
loans to Myanmar, and 14 public sector loans to Solomon
Islands were in nonaccrual status. Total outstanding ADF
loans to Myanmar amounted to $452.1 million, and to
Solomon Islands $46.0 million, together comprising about
2.9% of the total ADF loans outstanding.

Investment portfolio position: The ADF investment
portfolio amounted to $3.3 billion at 31 December 2002,
compared with $2.6 billion at 31 December 2001. About
22% of the portfolio was invested in bank deposits, and
78% in floating and fixed income securities. The financial
rate of return on ADF investments in 2002 was 4.7%,
compared with 5.4% in 2001.

The portfolio was denominated in 10 currencies. Euro,
pound sterling, Australian dollars, and Canadian dollars
accounted for 78% of the portfolio.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Review of activities: During 2002, People’s Republic of
China (its 2°4), Pakistan (its 25"), and India (its 18"") made
direct voluntary contributions to the TASF, amounting to
$1,000,000, $70,000, and $46,545, respectively. These were
made on a wholly untied basis.

At the end of 2002, total TASF resources amounted to
$919.6 million. Of this, $851.3 million had been committed,
leaving an uncommitted balance of $68.3 million. For
details, see Table 32 in the Statistical Annex.

year. In 2002, $3.9 million ($5.5 million in 2001), representing completed and canceled technical assistance projects,
was written back as a reduction in technical assistance for
the year and the corresponding undisbursed commitment
was eliminated. Revenue from investments dropped from
$10.9 million in 2001 to $4.8 million in 2002, because of a
decrease in the size of the investment portfolio and general
lower yield prevailing globally. As a result, the uncommitted balance available for future commitments decreased
from $81.3 million in 2001 to $68.3 million in 2002. The
TASF contributed 26% of funding for total technical
assistance approved in 2002.

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at
$155 million, down 16% from 2001. Other assets—
comprising due from banks, advances to consultants, and
others—totaled $10.1 million. Accounts payable to the OCR
and others amounted to $130,000.

Japan Special Fund

Review of activities: The technical assistance grants
funded by the Japan Special Fund (JSF) continued to
support ADB operations aimed at reducing poverty. In
March 2002, Japan contributed 2.9 billion yen ($22.5 million
equivalent) as a regular contribution to the JSF. As of

31 December 2002, Japan's cumulative contribution to the
JSF, since its inception in 1988, amounted to 97.3 billion
yen (about $836.0 million equivalent), comprising regular
contributions of 79.2 billion yen and supplementary
contributions of 18.1 billion yen. In 2002, ADB approved
65 technical assistance grants for the JSF totaling

$36.4 million inclusive of those that were approved but not
yet effective (see table on page 139). The uncommitted
balance after taking into account approved technical
assistance grants not yet effective as of 31 December 2002
was $135.4 million. For details, see tables 33 and 34 in the
Statistical Annex.

Sectoral activities: In 2002, the JSF financed 20% of
the total amount of technical assistance approved by ADB,
including 54% of the total amount of project preparatory
technical assistance approved during the year. The

Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility

Review of activities: The Asian Currency Crisis Support
Facility (ACCSF) was established in March 1999 for a 3-year
period as an independent component of the JSF. The
ACCSF was terminated on 23 March 2002. Pending the
completion of related administrative matters, the remaining

funds will be retained in the ACCSF.

At the end of 2002, Japan's cumulative contributions
for interest payment assistance (IPA) and technical
assistance components of the ACCSF amounted to
27.5 billion yen ($241.0 million equivalent). In 2002,

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) is
assisting ADB's developing member
countriesin their fight against poverty, and ishelping ADB address its
poverty reduction objective.

With poverty continuing to be
the major obstacle to Bangladesh's
economic growth, the need to provide facilities and services for the
poor remains significant. A JSFtechnical assistance grant of $500,000
is addressing this need by helping
rural women in Bangladesh increase
their household incomes through
livestock production, including
improving breed and animal health,
research, livestock and poultry
husbandry, fodder development,
livestock processing, and environmental management. The agreement wassigned in September 2002
(see http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/BAN/R162_01.pdf).

ADB Institute Special Fund, which is administered by ADB
in accordance with the Statute of ADB Institute. Japan
made its seventh contribution in the amount of 1.3 billion
yen (equivalent to $9.8 million) in May 2002.

As of 31 December 2002, cumulative commitments
amounted to 8.7 billion yen (equivalent to about $71.3 million), excluding translation adjustments. Of the total
contributions received, $62.0 million had been used as of
31 December 2002, mainly for research and capacity-building
activities, including organizing symposiums, forums, and
training; preparing research reports, publications, and web
sites; and associated administrative expenses.

As of 31 December 2002, the balance of net current
assets excluding property, furniture, and equipment
available for future projects and programs of ADB Institute
was about $9.3 million. For more on the ADB Institute, see
http:/Avww.adbi.org/.

Trust funds managed by ADB

In addition to the OCR and Special Funds resources, ADB
also manages and administers the Japan Scholarship
Program (JSP), Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR),
Japan Fund for Information and Communication Technology UFICT), and channel financing of grants provided by
bilateral donors to support technical assistance and soft
components of loans. These funds do not form part of
ADB's own resources.

Japan Scholarship Program

The JSP was established in 1988 to provide an opportunity
for qualified citizens of DMCs to undertake postgraduate
studies in economics, management, science and technology, and other development-related fields at selected
educational institutions in Asia and the Pacific. The JSP is
funded by Japan and administered by ADB. Currently,
18 institutions in 10 countries participate in the JSP.
Between 1988 and 2002, Japan contributed about
$53 million to the JSP. A total of 1,479 scholarships have
been awarded to recipients from 34 members. Of the total,
1,142 have already completed their courses. Women have
received 426 scholarships. The number of new scholarships

They share a vision of an Asia and Pacific region
without poverty. They share the belief that
individuals can make a difference. They have something else in common as well. The Regional
Program Officer of Habitat for Humanity International (East/Southeast Asia Region) and the
National Project Coordinator, Technical Education
and Skills Development Authority (TESDA),
Philippines, were both recipients of the ADB-Japan
Scholarship Program (JSP).

During a 2002 gathering of scholars from the
Philippine-based Asian Institute of Management
(AIM) and the International Rice Research Institute,
the two alumni of AIM’s Masters in Development
Management Program attributed their personal
growth to education, and thanked the ADB-JSP for
making that education possible.

Both have applied their educations to working in fields where they can help others experience
the real possibility of change. Habitat for Humanity International—a nonstock, nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating poverty housing and
homelessness—helps people build homes. Based
on the premise that housing sets the stage for
making development possible, the program helps
home partners believe in themselves again. The
TESDA-United Nations Development Programme
Project empowerswomen by facilitating their access
to entrepreneurial support services. Providing
economic opportunities that help women improve
their incomes is critical for poverty reduction.

Channel financing arrangements

Official grant cofinancing plays a vital role in ADB
operations, particularly in view of the continuing constraints on TASF and ADF resources. These grant funds
support ADB's technical assistance program and finance
mostly soft components of its loan projects.

A majority of such grants are provided by bilateral
donors under channel financing arrangements (CFAs). ADB
acts as administrator of the funds and applies its own
guidelines and procedures in consultant recruitment,
procurement, disbursement, and project supervision.

Under a CFA, the donor enters into a comprehensive
agreement with ADB whereby the donor provides an untied
grant fund to be administered by ADB (but the fund does
not become part of ADB's own resources); the donor
indicates its preferred sectors and recipient countries in the
use of the fund; ADB regularly provides the donor with a
list and description of proposed technical assistance
projects that satisfy the donor's preferences; and the donor
and ADB agree on the specific activities to be financed
under the fund. Funds provided under a CFA are transferred to an interest-bearing account and may also bez

Immediate humanitarian and reconstruction assistance is needed in
Afghanistan. Roads, shelter, and
employment for the refugees and
displaced persons, and support to
all regions of the country are
needed, as is a smooth transition
from humanitarian to recovery and
reconstruction assistance.

In 2002, ADB approved three
grant projects financed by the
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction
(JFPR) as part of the assistance
pledged by the Japanese Government in January 2002 at the
International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan.
For more on Afghanistan, see the
Special Theme chapter.

Road project: In addition to
helping meet the immediate need of
rehabilitating a busy transport route,
the $15 million grant will provide
jobs for 10,000 returning refugees

and internally displaced persons.
Over 200,000 refugees have returned
to Afghanistan from the southern
route. They need jobs. And, to avoid
further overcrowding of Kabul, the
refugees need to be temporarily
sheltered in the areas north and west
of Kandahar. The road project will
provide training in road construction, income-generating activities,
microcredit services, and nutrition
and childcare support. Basic health
education and services and medicines will be provided by 400 community health workers.

Education project: The education project will address
Afghanistan’s nonformal education
needs—to provide literacy and
vocational skills to street children,
former child combatants, and exsoldiers. It will stress communitybased, gender-sensitive education.
About 37,000 pupils will benefit

from the project, including over
7,000 girls who will receive education stipends.

Health project: On 23
December 2002, ADB also approved JFPR assistance for
$3 million to improve the health
and nutrition sector, including
the reproductive health of the
rural poor in Afghanistan. The
project will explore ways for the
Ministry of Health to contract
nongovernment organizationsto
help develop community-based
primary health care and thereby
reduce rural poverty. The project
aims to cut child mortality rates
by 30% over 3 years and reduce
common infectious diseases,
child malnutrition, and maternal mortality rates. The project
will also generate jobs in the
construction and community
health subsectors.

 

invested by ADB pending disbursement. Donors are
provided with regular financial statements and progress
reports on the use of the funds. ADB is responsible for
project preparation, processing, and administration.
CFAs may be replenished with additional funds at the
donor's discretion.

The primary advantage of CFAs is that funding for
several individual technical assistance projects may be
provided under a single agreement. Accordingly, they
minimize the need for detailed negotiations on a case-bycase basis and foster administrative efficiency. The first
CFA was negotiated in 1980. Since then, ADB has entered
into CFAs with several bilateral donors: Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
United Kingdom.

In addition to the traditional type of CFA (which may
be used for several sectors), the processing of thematic
CFAs with bilateral agencies has risen sharply in the last
couple of years in such areas as renewable energy, climate
change, poverty reduction, governance, and water. Several
thematic CFAs are now being packaged as umbrella
facilities to allow more than one donor to contribute.

In 2002, a new thematic poverty-focused multidonor
CFA was established with the first contribution made by
the United Kingdom for an amount equivalent to $60 million. Norway made a contribution to the Governance
Cooperation Fund for $2 million; and Switzerland
replenished its contribution to its CFA with ADB for an

 

additional $600,000; and the Netherlands made an
additional contribution of $4 million to its existing
Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector.

Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction

The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) was
established in May 2000. The JFPR is a trust fund to
support poverty reduction and social development activities
that can add substantive value to ADB-financed projects
(see Box above). Since 2000, Japan has contributed

$244 million in total and $81 million for 29 projects have
been approved for implementation (see http:/Avww.adb.org/
JFPR/ and Table 35 in the Statistical Annex).

Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology

The Japan Fund for Information and Communication
Technology (JFICT) was established in July 2001. The JFICT
is a trust fund to assist DMCs in bridging the digital divide
to help reduce poverty. The JFICT had an initial contribution of 1.3 billion yen (approximately $10.7 million) for a
3-year period.

In 2002, two projects were approved: E-Health
Membership Insurance Cards in Viet Nam for $0.5 million,
and the Development of a Business Plan for a Center for
Learning, Information, Communication, and Knowledge for
Asia and the Pacific (CLICK) for $0.2 million (see http://
www.adb.org/Documents/others/CLICK/R21_03.pdf and Table
36 in the Statistical Annex).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of income and expenses,
cash flows, and changes in capital and reserves present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of
United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—Ordinary Capital Resources
at 31 December 2002 and 2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements
taken as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of loans and of borrowings as at 31 December
2002 and 2001, and of statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as at 31 December
2002 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS, GUARANTEES,
AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), a multilateral development finance institution, was established in 1966 with its
headquarters in Manila, Philippines. ADB and its operations
are governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian
Development Bank (the Charter). Its purpose is to foster
economic development and co-operation in the Asian and
Pacific region and to contribute to the acceleration of the
process of economic development of the developing member countries (DMCs) in the region, collectively and individually. With the adoption of its poverty reduction strategy
at the end of 1999, ADB made reducing poverty in the region
its main goal. ADB provides financial and technical assistance (TA) for projects and programs which will contribute
to achieving this purpose.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is
an integral part of ADB’s operational activities. In addition,
ADB, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of donors, including
members, their agencies and other development institutions,
funds restricted for specific uses which include TA grants as
well as regional programs.

ADB’s ordinary operations comprise loans, equity
investments, and guarantees. Commencing 2001, limited
technical assistance to member countries to support high
priority TA programs is included. ADB finances its ordinary
operations through borrowings, paid-in capital, and retained
earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees, and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the total
amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and guarantees made by ADB shall not exceed the total of ADB's
unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus, exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 2002, the total of
such loans, equity investments, and guarantees aggregated
approximately 78.4% (83.9% — 2001) of the total subscribed
capital, reserves, and surplus as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired paid-in
capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of the
special reserve. At 31 December 2002, such equity investments
represented approximately 3.3% (3.5% — 2001) of the paid-in
capital, reserves, and surplus, as defined.

156 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter “in terms of United States dollars
of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the
1966 dollar) and the value of each share is defined as 10,000
1966 dollars. The capital stock had historically been translated into the current United States dollar (ADB's unit of
account) on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect,
currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966
dollar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes of
these financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing
Right (SDR) at the value in current United States dollars as
computed by the IMF, with each share valued at SDR10,000.
As of 31 December 2002, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.35458 ($1.25562 - 2001)
giving a value for each share of ADB's capital equivalent to
$13,545.80 ($12,556.20 — 2001). However, ADB could decide to
fix the value of each share at $12,063.50 based on the 31 March
1978 par value of the United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments other than those relating to
maintenance of SDR capital values (see Notes I and J), are
charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments”
and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES" as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.”Derivative Financial Instruments

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 was further amended by
SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB
Statement No. 133” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities,
an amendment of Statement 133." The standards are herein
collectively referred to as FAS 133. FAS 133, is effective for
ADB on 1 January 2001. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument be recorded in the Balance Sheet as either an
asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in net income or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative
is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the
type of hedge transaction.

ADB uses derivative instruments for asset/liability
management of individual positions and portfolios, as well as
for the reduction of transaction costs. In applying FAS 133 for
purposes of financial statement reporting, ADB has elected
not to define any qualifying hedging relationships. Rather, all
derivative instruments, as defined by FAS 133, have been
marked to fair value and all changes in the fair value have
been recognized in net income. ADB has elected not to define
any qualifying hedging relationships, not because economic
hedges do not exist, but rather because the application of FAS
133 hedging criteria does not make evident the impact of
economic risks inherent in ADB’s financial assets and liabilities.

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
includes the difference between the carrying value and the
fair value of the derivative instruments in the borrowings
portfolio on 31 December 2000 as well as loans that met
hedge criteria, offset by any gains or losses on those borrowings
and loans for which a fair value exposure was being hedged.
The net effect gave rise to a transition loss of $81,657,000 in
2001, out of which, a loss of $116,313,000 is reported in other
comprehensive income and a gain of $34,656,000 is reported
in net income. The allocation between net income and other
comprehensive income was based upon the hedging
relationships that existed before the initial application of this
statement.

Since ADB has not defined any qualifying hedging
relationships under this standard, the amount recorded in
other comprehensive income as part of the transition is being
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in
which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of
deposits held by ADB other than derivative instruments are
considered by Management to be “Available for Sale” and
are reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES" as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” All derivative instruments are marked
to market. Estimated fair value generally represents market
value. Time deposits are classified as “Held-to-Maturity” and
are reported at cost. Realized gains and losses are included
in income from investments and are measured by the difference between amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.
With respect to futures, realized gain or loss is reported
based on daily settlement of the net cash margin.

Securities Transferred Under Securities
Lending Arrangement

ADB accounts for transfers of financial assets in accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities—a
replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfers are accounted
for as sales under FAS 140 when ADB has relinquished
control over the transferred assets. Transfers that are not
accounted for as sales are accounted for as repurchase agreements and collateralized financing arrangements.

Loans

ADB's loans are made to or guaranteed by members, with the
exception of loans to the private sector, and have maturities
ranging between 3 and 30 years. ADB requires its borrowers
to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the
value of the currencies which it has disbursed. Loan interest
income and loan commitment fees are recognized on accrual
basis. With the introduction of Libor-based loans in 2001, in
line with ADB's principle of cost pass through pricing, any
variation in the actual cost of borrowings is passed to Liborbased borrowers as surcharge or rebate.

It is the policy of ADB to place loans in nonaccrual status
for which principal, interest, or other charges are overdue by
six months. Interest and other charges on nonaccruing loans
are included in income only to the extent that payments have
been received by ADB. ADB follows a policy of not taking part
in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector
loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB may agree to
debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action have
been exhausted.

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 157

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIAASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in arrears
for one year for public sector loans (unless there is clear and
convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration
of such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.
If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than the carrying
value of the loan, a valuation allowance is established with a
corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.

ADB's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans, and adverse
situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay.

ADB levies front-end fees on all new loans. These fees are
deferred and amortized over the life of the loans after offsetting
deferred direct loan origination costs.

Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are reported at cost less probable losses
inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable.

The reserve against losses for equity investments is
established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of
potential losses for such investments. Equity investments with
readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income
and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.” ADB applies the
equity method of accounting to one investment where it has
the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and,
except for land, depreciated over estimated useful lives on
a straight-line basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor
betterments are charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the end of the year and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The
actual results could differ from those estimates.

158 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Accounting and Reporting Developments

In November 2002, FASB issued FASB interpretation (FIN)
No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness
of Others” - an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57,
and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34. This
interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of all of
the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee,
including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform
over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified
triggering events or conditions occur. This provision applies
to guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.
FIN No. 45 also clarifies requirements about disclosures on
guarantees. Full disclosures on all outstanding financial
guarantees have been made in Notes E and N to the financial
statements.

In January 2003, FASB issued FIN No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities - an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements.”
FIN No. 46 requires a variable interest entity be consolidated
and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements if ADB
is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable
interest entity’s activities or entitled to receive a majority of
the entity's residual returns or both. Variable interest entity in
ADB relates to an equity investment that is presently accounted
for under the equity method. This interpretation is effective
31 January 2003 for entities created after that date or in the
first fiscal year beginning after 15 June 2003 for the existing
entities. Adoption of this standard will not have a significant
impact on ADB's financial statements.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, ADB considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have
been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

NOTE C—RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF CURRENCIES
AND DEMAND OBLIGATIONS OF
MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i) of the Charter,
the use by ADB or by any recipient from ADB of certaincurrencies may be restricted by members to payments for
goods or services produced and intended for use in their
territories. With respect to the currencies of 40 DMCs for
2002 (39 - 2001), cash in banks (due from banks) and
demand obligations totaling $51,660,000 ($51,919,000 - 2001)
and $229,518,000 ($217,926,000 — 2001), respectively, may
be, but are not currently so restricted.

In accordance with Article 24, paragraphs 2(i) and (ii) of
the Charter, one member (two - 2001) has restricted the use
by ADB or by any recipient from ADB of its currency to
payments for goods or services produced in its territory. As
such, cash in banks (due from banks) and investments totaling
$86,000 ($36,000 - 2001) and $2,662,000 ($4,783,000 - 2001),
respectively, have been restricted. None of the demand
obligations held by ADB in 2002 was restricted ($2,778,000 —
2001).

NOTE D—INVESTMENTS AND SWAP TRANSACTIONS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations.

ADB entered into two asset swap transactions as a new
investment vehicle with total notional amount of $40,053,000.

Included in other securities as of 31 December 2002 were
corporate bonds and other obligations of banks amounting to
$2,309,323,000 ($1,529,545,000 - 2001) and asset/mortgagebacked securities of $662,054,000 ($534,331,000 - 2001).

Exposure to interest rate risk may be adjusted within
defined bands to reflect changing market circumstances. These
adjustments are made through the purchase and sale of
securities, financial futures and options. To increase returns,
ADB may invest in securities denominated in currencies other
than the originating functional currencies and then enter into
covered forward foreign exchange agreements in order to
maintain its original mix of functional currency holdings.
Accordingly, the financial futures, options, and covered forwards
are held for risk management rather than for trading purposes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

Asset/Mortgage-backed Securities: Asset/Mortgagebacked securities are instruments whose cash flow is based
on the cash flows of a pool of underlying assets or mortgage
loans managed by a trust.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments in which the seller
agrees to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified
instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial margin
requirements are met with cash or securities, and changes in
the market prices are settled daily. ADB generally closes out
open positions prior to maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or
payments are limited to the change in market value of the
futures. At 31 December 2002, the nominal amount of
outstanding purchase and sales contracts were $161,700,000
and $121,100,000, respectively ($294,500,000 and $187,300,000
- 2001).

NOTE E—LOANS AND GUARANTEES
Loans

ADB does not currently sell its loans, nor does it believe
there is a comparable market for its loans. The estimated fair
value of all loans is based on the estimated cash flows from
principal repayments, interest and other charges discounted
at the applicable market yield curves for ADB's borrowing
cost plus lending spread. The estimated fair value of public
sector loans is not affected by credit risks based on ADB’s
experience with its borrowers. Allowance for loan losses is
made against private sector loans.

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of loans
outstanding at 31 December 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of ADB was based on
a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which loans
carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the
entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, ADB adopted a
multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In
addition, in July 1992, ADB introduced a United States dollar
pool-based variable lending rate system, and in November
1994, a market-based variable lending rate system was made
available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and
to the private sector borrowers. For loans to the private sector
borrowers, approximately 72% (69% - 2001) of the loans were
based on variable lending rates.

Since 1988, ADB has charged front-end fees for private
sector loans. Effective 1 January 2000, ADB levies front-end
fee of 1% for public sector loans for which the loan negotiations
are completed after that date. In addition, the lending spread
applied to all outstanding pool-based OCR public sector loans
and new public sector market-based loans has been increased
from 0.4% to 0.6%. Also effective the same date, a flat
commitment fee of 0.75% is charged for new program loans,

160 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

while the progressive commitment fee of 0.75% is maintained
for project loans.

The front-end fees earned for the year ended 31 December
2002 were $37,057,000 ($34,793,000 - 2001) for loans and
$6,092,000 (nil- 2001) for guarantees. Administrative expenses
relating to direct loan origination of $19,440,000 for the year
ended 31 December 2002 ($34,793,000 - 2001) were deferred
and offset against front-end fees earned.

Commencing 1 July 2001, ADB offered LIBOR-based loans
(LBLs) in any of the following currencies—Euro, Japanese
yen, or United States dollar. The new LBL lending facility
offers borrowers the flexibility of (i) choice of currency and
interest rate basis; (ii) options to link repayment schedules
to actual disbursements for financial intermediary borrowers;
(iii) change the original loan terms (currency and interest
rate basis) at any time during the life of the loan; and (iv)
options to cap or collar the floating lending rate at any time
during the life of the loan. LBL terms are available for all new
loans for which the invitation to negotiate is issued on or
after 1 July 2001.When ADB introduced the LBL, it also offered its borrowers
the option to transform undisbursed balances of their eligible
pool-based single currency loans in United States dollar to
LBL terms. Ninety seven of such loans with a total undisbursed
balance of $6.8 billion were transformed to LBL terms as of
31 December 2002. ADB's loan product available to borrowers
is only LBL starting 1 July 2002.

In 2002, ADB received 19 full and partial prepayments
amounting to $1,977,139,000 ($52,497,000 - 2001) from four
borrowers and collected premiums of $62,521,000 ($2,841,000
— 2001) on the prepayments which have been included in
“Other income from loans.”

Loans in Nonaccrual Status

Two public sector loans to Myanmar and one public sector
loan to Nauru were in nonaccrual status as of 31 December
2002 (two to Myanmar and one to Nauru - 2001). The principal outstanding for these three loans as of 31 December
2002 was $3,199,000 ($3,095,000 - 2001) of which $1,129,000
($795,000 - 2001) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status
resulted in $231,000 ($307,000 — 2001) not being recognized
as income from public sector loans for the year ended
31 December 2002. The accumulated interest and other
charges on these loans that were not recognized as income
as of 31 December 2002 would have totaled $745,000
($514,000 - 2001).

Thirteen private sector loans were in nonaccrual status as
of 31 December 2002 (twelve - 2001). The principal outstanding
at that date was $83,874,000 ($75,449,000 - 2001) of which
$69,891,000 ($52,141,000 - 2001) was overdue. Loans in
nonacctrual status resulted in $7,930,000 ($7,676,000 - 2001)
not being recognized in income from private sector loans for
the year ended 31 December 2002. The accumulated interest
and other charges on these loans that were not recognized as
of 31 December 2002 would have totaled $30,131,000
($29,380,000 - 2001).

Loan Loss Provision

ADB has not suffered any losses of principal on public sector
loans. No loan loss provisions have been made against outstanding public sector loans, but loan loss provisions have
been made against private sector loans during the year (see
Note K).

ADB extends guarantees to public sector and private sector
borrowers which are not reflected in the financial statements. Such guarantees include (i) partial credit guarantees
where only certain principal and/or interest payments are
covered; and (ii) political risk guarantees, which provide
coverage against well-defined sovereign risks. While ADB's

government's counterguarantees, all ADB's outstanding
guarantees as of 31 December 2002 were counterguaranteed
by its concerned government. A counterguarantee takes the
form of amember government agreement to indemnify ADB
for any payments it makes under the guarantee. Guaranteed
payments under partial credit guarantees are generally due
10 or more years from the loan inception date. ADB's political risk guarantee is callable when a guaranteed event has
occurred and such an event has resulted in debt service
default to the guaranteed lender. The present value of the
contingent future payment obligations of all outstanding
partial credit guarantees and the nominal value of political
risk guaranteed obligation at 31 December 2002 and 2001
are used to calculate ADB’s lending limitation. None of these
amounts were subject to call as of that date (nil- 31 December 2001). ADB estimates that the present value of guarantees outstanding at 31 December 2002 approximates their
fair value.

NOTE F—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB's investments in equity securities issued by private
enterprises located in DMCs include a $13,620,000
($13,874,000 - 2001) investment in the Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC) which is accounted for
on the equity method. The holding represents 30.3% of the
investee’s issued ordinary share capital and net assets. ADB
also holds 100% of AFIC issued convertible noncumulative
preference shares in the amount of $25,000,000 ($25,000,000
— 2001). In October 2002, ADB together with other financiers,
renewed the revolving credit facility up to a maximum
aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of
$36,000,000 ($45,000,000 - 2001). ADB’s obligations amount
to $16,000,000, of which, at 31 December 2002, the outstanding loan is $4,444,000 ($4,444,000 - 2001). This amount
has been included in “LOANS OUTSTANDING’ (see Note E).

Unrealized gains on equity investments reported at market
value were $4,335,000 at 31 December 2002 ($2,269,000 2001) and were reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES" as part
of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Approved equity investment facility that has not been

mises which had been provided by the Government. In
accordance with the agreement as supplemented by a memorandum of understanding, ADB was compensated $22,657,000
for the return of these premises. The compensation is in lieu
of being provided premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and amortized over the estimated life
of the new headquarters building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The amortization for the year ended
31 December 2002 amounted to $511,000 ($567,000 - 2001)
reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters
building from $4,492,000 ($4,414,000 - 2001) to $3,981,000
($3,847,000 - 2001). At 31 December 2002, the unamortized
deferred compensation balance (included in “ACCOUNTS
PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES - Miscellaneous”) was
$9,653,000 ($10,225,000 - 2001). At 31 December 2002,
accumulated depreciation for property, furniture, and equipment was $91,195,000 ($82,614,000 - 2001).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAP TRANSACTIONS

ADB uses derivative financial instruments in connection
with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding sources
across public and private debt markets, currencies and
instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a currency
borrowed under advantageous terms into one of ADB's major
operational currencies, taking advantage of the opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such currency
swaps enable ADB to raise operationally needed currencies
in a cost-efficient way and to maintain its borrowing presence in the major capital markets. Interest rate swaps are
used generally to reduce balance sheet interest rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

ADB issues structured debt which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 163

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIAASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

its cost of borrowing. However, ADB enters into simultaneous
currency and/or interest rate swaps to hedge fully against the
effects of such embedded derivatives.

ADB has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce such credit
risk, ADB only enters into long-term swap transactions with
counterparties eligible under ADB's swap guidelines which
include a requirement that the counterparties have a credit
rating of double A or higher.

The fair value of outstanding currency swap agreements,
interest rate swap agreements, and borrowings is determined
at the estimated amount that ADB would receive or pay to
terminate the agreements using a market-based valuation
model. The basis of valuation is the present value of expected
cash flows based on appropriate market data.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by ADB, one party agrees to make periodic
payments based on a notional principal amount and an interest
rate that is fixed at the outset of the agreement. The counterparty
agrees to make floating rate payments based on the same
notional principal amount. The terms of ADB's interest rate
swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular
borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap
agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments in
one currency while the counterparty agrees to make periodic
payments in another currency. The payments may be fixed at
the outset of the agreement or vary based on interest rates. A
receivable is created for the currency swapped out, and a
payable is created for the currency swapped in. The terms of
ADB's currency swap agreements specifically match the terms
of particular borrowings.

NOTE I—CAPITAL STOCK, CAPITAL TRANSFERRED TO
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND,
MAINTENANCE OF VALUE OF CURRENCY
HOLDINGS, AND MEMBERSHIP

Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB as of the end of 2002
and 2001 consists of 3,490,994 shares, of which 3,487,017
shares (3,474,627 - 2001) have been subscribed by members.
Of the subscribed shares, 3,241,762 (3,230,244 - 2001) are
“callable” and 245,255 (244,383 - 2001) are “paid-in.” The
“callable” share capital is subject to call by ADB only as and
when required to meet ADB's obligations incurred on
borrowings of funds for inclusion in its ordinary capital

164 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

resources or on guarantees chargeable to such resources.
The “paid-in” share capital has been paid or is payable in
installments, partly in convertible currencies and partly in
the currency of the subscribing member which may be
convertible. In accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the
Charter, ADB accepts nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing
demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in
the currency of the member, provided such currency is not
required by ADB for the conduct of its operations. The settlement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly,
it is not practicable to determine a fair value for these
receivables.

As of 31 December 2002, all matured installments
amounting to $3,311,328,000 ($3,049,555,000 - 2001) were
received except for $2,815,000 ($4,353,000 — 2001) from one
country (two - 2001). Installments not due aggregating
$10,848,000 ($18,967,000 — 2001) are receivable as follows:

For the Year ending 31 December:

2003 $5,038,000 2004 $2,905,000 2005 $2,905,000

Payments in respect of capital subscription installments in
advance of due dates are shown in the Balance Sheet (under
“ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES”) as “Advance
payments on subscriptions” pending the determination of the
full value of such payments based on the rate of exchange to
be used by ADB as of the date on which such payments are
actually due.

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (i) of the
Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the setting
aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the Charter
and of the convertible currency portion paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of
28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the Special Funds of
ADB. The resources so set aside amounting to $64,491,000
as of 31 December 2002 ($59,780,000 — 2001) expressed in
terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.35458 ($1.25562 - 2001)
per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of $1.20635 per 1966 dollar—
see Note B), were allocated and transferred to the Asian
Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second Amendment to the IMF Articles, ADB implemented maintenance ofvalue (MOV) in respect of holdings of member currencies in
terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the
Board of Directors. Since then, settlement of MOV has been
put in abeyance.

Inasmuch as the valuation of ADB’s capital stock and the
basis of determining possible MOV obligations are still under
consideration, notional amounts have been calculated
provisionally as receivable from or payable to members in
order to maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of
the SDR. In view thereof, the notional MOV amounts of
receivables and payables are offset against one another and
shown as net notional amounts to maintain value of currency
holdings in the “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” portion of the
Balance Sheet. The timing of the establishment and settlement
of such amounts is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not
practicable to determine a fair value for such receivables and
payables.

One country made an arrangement with ADB that has the
effect of continuing the settlement of their MOV obligation.
The “Amounts required to maintain value of currency holdings”
under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS’ represents the amount
receivable from changes in exchange rates of the member's
currency in relation to the United States dollar.

The net notional amounts as of 31 December 2002
consisted of (a) the increase of $334,457,000 ($148,847,000
—2001) in amounts required to maintain the value of currency
holdings to the extent of matured and paid capital
subscriptions due to the increase in the value of the SDR in
relation to the United States dollar during the period from
1 April 1978 to 31 December 2002 and (b) the net decrease
of $153,999,000 ($313,609,000 - 2001) in the value of such
currency holdings in relation to the United States dollar
during the same period. In terms of receivable from and
payable to members, they are as follows:

2002 2001

Notional MOV Receivables $718,212,000  $657,940,000
Notional MOV Payables 229,756,000 195,484,000

Total $488,456,000  $462,456,000
Membership

As of 31 December 2002, ADB is owned by 61 member
countries, 44 countries from the region and 17 countries
from outside the region (see OCR-7). During 2002, Portugal
and Timor-Leste have subscribed 12,040 and 350 shares of
ADB's capital stock respectively, and remitted the required
paid-in portion of their subscriptions.

NOTE J—RESERVES
Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the Board
of Governors shall determine annually what part of the net
income shall be allocated, after making provision for
reserves, to surplus and what part, if any, shall be distributed
to the members. During 2002, $714,464,000 of the net
income for the year ended 31 December 2001 was allocated
to the Ordinary Reserve ($625,716,000 — 2001).

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note B) resulted in a net charge of $56,808,000
to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended 31 December
2002 (credit of $20,236,000 - 2001). That charge is the increase
in the value of the matured and paid capital subscriptions
caused by the change during the year in the value of the SDR
in relation to the United States dollar not allocated to members
as notional maintenance of value adjustments in accordance
with resolutions of the Board of Directors.

Cumulative Revaluation Adjustments Account

In May 2002, the Board of Governors approved the allocation
of $147,501,000 of the 31 December 2001 net income to a
separate category of Reserves - “Cumulative Revaluation
Adjustments Account.” This represents the cumulative FAS
133 adjustment.

Special Reserve

The Special Reserve includes commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article
17 of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist of term
deposits and government and government-guaranteed obligations and are included under the heading “INVESTMENTS.”
For the year ended 31 December 2002, guarantee fees amounting to $861,000 ($1,295,000 - 2001) were appropriated to
Special Reserve.

Surplus
Surplus represents funds for future use to be determined by

the Board of Governors. No amounts were allocated by the
Board of Governors out of Surplus during 2002 and 2001.

comprehensive income includes such items as the effects of
the implementation of FAS 133, unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities and listed equity investments,
and currency translation adjustments.

NOTE K—INCOME AND EXPENSES

Total income from loans for the year ended 31 December
2002 was $1,709,943,000 ($1,813,640,000 - 2001). The average yield on the loan portfolio during the year was 5.93%

2002 amounted to $62,521,000 ($2,841,000 - 2001).

Total income from investments for the year ended
31 December 2002 was $330,448,000 ($403,436,000 - 2001).
The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses,
was 4.26% (5.91% - 2001). If unrealized gains and losses were
included, the annualized rate of return would have been 5.34%
(6.18% - 2001).

Income from other sources primarily includes dividends
received for the year ended 31 December 2002 amounted to
$8,603,000 ($13,229,000 - 2001), gain on sale of equity
investments of $7,078,000 (loss of $345,000 — 2001), net of the
share in the net losses of an equity investment of $363,000
(share in net profit of $1,478,000 - 2001) accounted for on the
equity method.

Total interest expense incurred for the year ended
31 December 2002 amounted to $1,138,660,000 ($1,416,830,000

ordinary capital resources and the Asian Development Fund
according to the number of loans and equity investments
approved during the year. Of the total administrative expenses
of $254,372,000 ($223,313,000 - 2001), $144,379,000
($129,481,000 - 2001) was accordingly charged to the Asian

NOTE M—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

ADB has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan

(the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan, shall,
as a condition of service, become a participant from the firstday of service, provided that at such a date, the employee
has not reached the normal retirement age of 60. The Plan
applies also to members of the Board of Directors who elect
to join the Plan. Retirement benefits are based on length of
service and highest average remuneration during two years
of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated and are
not included in the accompanying Balance Sheet. The costs
of administering the Plan are absorbed by ADB, except for
fees paid to the investment managers and related charges,
including custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make additional voluntary
contributions. ADB's contribution is determined at a rate
sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered
by the participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

In 1993, ADB adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees’ medical insurance premiums. Under the plan, ADB is obligated to
pay 75% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums for
retirees, including retired members of the Board of Directors, and their eligible dependents who elected to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.

The following table sets forth the pension and
postretirement medical benefits at 31 December 2002 and
2001:

168 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKAdditional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced
in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amount.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using a market-based
valuation model. The basis of valuation is the expected cash
flows discounted at the applicable market yield curves or
appropriate market data.

NOTE O—OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

ADB is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments on
guarantees. Guarantees involve elements of credit risk which
are not reflected on the balance sheet. Credit risk represents
the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms
of the contract. The amount of credit risks on guarantees as
at 31 December 2002 was $1,117,810,000 ($355,173,000 —
31 December 2001).

NOTE P—SPECIAL AND TRUST FUNDS

ADB's operations include special operations, which are
financed from special fund resources, consisting of the Asian
Development Fund, the Technical Assistance Special Fund,
Japan Special Fund, and the Asian Development Bank Institute Special Fund.

In addition, ADB, alone or jointly with donors, administers
on behalf of the donors, including members of ADB, their
agencies and other development institutions, projects/
programs supplementing ADB's operations. Such projects/
programs are funded with external funds administered by
ADB and with external funds not under ADB's administration.
The funds are restricted for specific uses including technical
assistance to borrowers and technical assistance for regional
programs. The responsibilities of ADB under these
arrangements range from project processing to project
implementation including the facilitation of procurement of
goods and services.

Special funds and funds administered by ADB on behalf of
the donors are not included in the assets of ordinary capital
resources. The breakdown of the total of such funds together
with the funds of the special operations as of 31 December
2002 and 2001 is as follows:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

We have audited the accompanying special purpose statement of assets, liabilities and fund balances
of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund as of 31 December 2002 and 2001 and the
related special purpose statements of revenues and expenses, cash flows and changes in fund
balances for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosure in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Notes B and D, the Board of Directors approved in May 2001 the adoption of special
purpose financial statements for the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund in 2001.
With the adoption of the special purpose financial statements, loan loss provisioning has been
eliminated. The accompanying financial statements are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances of Asian Development Bank—Asian Development
Fund at 31 December 2002 and 2001, and the revenues and expenses and cash flows for the years then
ended, on the basis of accounting explained in Notes B and D.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the special purpose financial
statements taken as a whole. The accompanying special purpose statements of loans as at 31 December
2002 and 2001, and of resources as at 31 December 2002 are presented for purposes of additional
analyses and are not required parts of the special purpose financial statements. Such information has
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the special purpose financial
statements and in our opinion is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the special purpose
financial statements taken as a whole.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, Board of
Directors, management and members of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund.
However, under the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Fund, this report is included in
the Annual Report of the Asian Development Bank and is therefore a matter of public record and its
distribution is not limited.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEM ENTS

31 December 2002 and 2001

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established on
28 June 1974 to more effectively carry out the special operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by providing
resources on concessional terms which are made available
almost exclusively to the least developed borrowing countries.

The resources of ADF have been subsequently augmented
by seven replenishments, the most recent of which became
effective in June 2001 in a total amount equivalent to
$2,791,483,000 to cover the operational requirements for the
four-year period from January 2001. The last allocation from
the surplus account of ADB's ordinary capital resources to
ADF in the amount of $230,000,000 was in 1997.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved the adoption
of the special purpose financial statements for ADF. With the
adoption of the special purpose financial statements, loan
loss provisioning has been eliminated.

Due to the nature and organization of ADF, these financial
statements have been prepared for the specific purpose of
reflecting the sources and applications of member subscriptions
and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. These special purpose
financial statements have been prepared to comply with Article
IV, Section 4.01 of the Regulations of ADF.

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing member countries are
functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United
States dollar, and the special purpose financial statements
are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency, generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for
each semimonthly period, generally at the applicable rates of
exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside
resources (see Note G) are recorded as notional amounts
receivable from or payable to ordinary capital resources. Other

translation adjustments are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and reported in “FUND
BALANCES" as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive
income.” Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
among functional currencies are included in revenue.

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of
deposits held by ADF are considered by Management to be
“Available for Sale” and are reported at estimated fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and
reported in “FUND BALANCES" as part of “Accumulated other
comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost. Realized gains
and losses are included in revenue from investments and
are measured by the difference between amortized cost and
the net proceeds of sales.

Securities Transferred Under Securities Lending Arrangement

ADB accounts for transfers of financial assets in accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities—a
replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfers are accounted
for as sales under FAS 140 when ADB has relinquished
control over the transferred assets. Transfers that are not
accounted for as sales are accounted for as repurchase agreements and collateralized financing arrangements.

Loans

It is the policy of ADF to place in nonaccrual status loans
made to eligible borrowing member countries if the principal or interest with respect to any such loans is overdue by
six months. Interest on nonaccruing loans is included in
revenue only to the extent that payments have actually been
received by ADF. ADB follows a policy of not taking part in
debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector
loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB may agree to
debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action
have been exhausted. When ADB decides that a particular
loan is no longer collectible, the entire amount will be
expensed during the period.

Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 179

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIAASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND
NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEM ENTS

31 December 2002 and 2001

Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related
formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the currency
of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of special purpose financial statements
requires Management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
at the end of the year and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the year. The actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Special Purpose Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the special purpose statement of cash
flows, ADF considers that its cash and cash equivalents are
limited to “DUE FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification and Restatement

Certain 2001 amounts have been restated to conform with
the 2002 presentation.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are
governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board
of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment
Authority to invest in investment instruments which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily government or
government-guaranteed obligations and corporate obligations.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2002 and 2001 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

Currency 2002 2001
Australian dollar $ 582,983,000 $ 355,074,000
Canadian dollar 320,404,000 240,118,000

Gross gains 8,824,000 1,019,000
Gross losses 56,000 4,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses,
was 4.50% (4.84% - 2001). If unrealized gains and losses were
included, the annualized rate of return would have been 4.65%
(5.35% — 2001).

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS PROVISION
Loans

Prior to 1 January 1999, loans of ADF were extended to
eligible borrowing member countries, which bore a service
charge of 1% and required repayment over periods ranging
from 35 to 40 years. On 14 December 1998, the Board of
Directors approved an amendment to ADF loan terms, as
follows: (i) for loans to finance specific projects, the maturity
was shortened to 32 years including an 8-year grace period;
(ii) for program loans to support sector development, thematurity was shortened to 24 years including an 8-year
grace period; and (iii) all new loans bear a 1% interest charge
during the grace period, and 1.5% during the amortization
period, with equal amortization. The new ADF lending terms
took effect on 1 January 1999 and apply only to new loans for
which formal loan negotiations were completed on or after
1 January 1999. ADF requires borrowers to absorb exchange
risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed.

ADB believes that there is no comparable market, nor
ADB intends to sell its loans. The use of market data to arrive
at the loan at fair value will give meaningless results. As such,
the fair value of loans is determined using an entry value
method. Under this method, fair value is determined based on
the terms at which a similar loan would currently be made by
ADB to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair value
approximates the carrying amount. The estimated fair value
of loans is not affected by credit risks because the amount of
any such adjustment is not considered to have a material
effect based on ADB’s experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans
by country as of 31 December 2002 are shown in ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans in
nonaccrual status as of 31 December 2002 was $498,137,000
($442,146,000 - 2001) of which $80,420,000 ($69,994,000 —
2001) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in
$5,009,000 ($4,712,000 - 2001) not being recognized as income
from loans for the year ended 31 December 2002. The
accumulated interest on these loans that was not recognized
as income as of 31 December 2002 would have totaled
$24,361,000 ($22,882,000 - 2001). The loans in nonaccrual
status as of 31 December 2002 were 28 loans made to Myanmar
and 14 loans to Solomon Islands. (Four loans to Afghanistan
and 28 loans to Myanmar - 2001).

No private sector loan was in nonaccrual status as of
31 December 2002 (one for $5,234,000 - 2001).

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 2002
were $5,502,000 ($8,836,000 - 2001), and there were no
undisbursed loan commitments (nil - 2001).

NOTE E—NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing
and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable
Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by ADB at par
upon demand.

ADB currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 2002 will be encashed in varying amounts over
a nine-year period ending 31 December 2011.

ADF-7

CONTINUED

The fair value of notes of contributors is determined using
an entry value method, whereby fair value is determined
based on the terms at which notes are currently being accepted
from contributors. On this basis, the fair value of outstanding
notes of contributors approximates their carrying amount.

NOTE F—ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses for 2002 included an administration charge from ordinary capital resources amounting to
$144,379,000 ($129,481,000 - 2001). The charge represents
an apportionment of all administrative expenses of ADB
(other than those pertaining directly to ordinary operations
and special operations), based on the number of loans and
equity investments approved during the year.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (i) of the
Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development
Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has authorized
the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital
paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6, paragraph
2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible currency portion
paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6, paragraph
2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be used as a part
of the Special Funds of ADB. The capital so set aside was
allocated and transferred from the ordinary capital resources
to ADF as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4, paragraph
1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966
dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit of
account), on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the
Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer had par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB's
selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the
Set-Aside Resources have been valued for purposes of the
accompanying financial statements in terms of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United States
dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 2002, the
value of the SDR in terms of the current United States dollar
was $1.35458 ($1.25562 - 2001). On this basis, Set-Aside
Resources amounted to $64,491,000 ($59,780,000 — 2001). If
the capital stock of ADB as of 31 December 2002 had been

31 December 2002 and 2001

valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources
would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE H—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME

Comprehensive income has two major components: net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include such items as unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities and currency translation adjustments.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current

182 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies
and assumptions which necessarily require the use of
subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction, or whether they are actually exchangeable is
not determinable.

The carrying amounts of ADF's assets, liabilities, and fund
balances are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E for
discussions relating to investments, loans, and notes of
contributors.PRICEWATERHOUSE(COPERS

management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements
taken as a whole. The accompanying statement of resources as at 31 December 2002 and summary
statement of technical assistance approved and effective for the year ended 31 December 2002 are
presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of
the basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation
to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to
developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) and for regional technical assistance. TASF
resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by
members, allocations from the net income of ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

TASF reports contributed cash and other assets as restricted
support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit
the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction expires,
that is, when a stipulated time or purpose restriction is
accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified
to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of
Activities and Changes in Net Assets as net assets released
from restrictions. There were no restricted net assets at
31 December 2002 and 2001.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial
statements from the date contribution agreements become
effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted by
them to technical assistance (TA) projects/programs with
specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily
restricted contributions. Those without any stipulations as to
specific use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions.

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes

effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in technical
assistance for the period and the corresponding undisbursed
commitment is eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands of current United States dollars. As a matter of convenience, the United States dollar is the functional and reporting
currency and is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies
other than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the year are recognized at applicable exchange rates as of
the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense
amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are
translated for each semimonthly period generally at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are
accounted for as exchange gains or losses and are charged
or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the
year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB

seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 189

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIATASF-6

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2002 and 2001 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

 

Currency 2002 2001
Australian dollar $ 6,027,000 $ 5,147,000
Canadian dollar 124,352,000 132,725,000
Euro 12,354,000 10,078,000
Swiss franc = 33,918,000
Others 12,232,000 3,085,000

Total

$154,965,000 $184,953,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month was 2.86% (5.26% - 2001).

NOTE D—FUNDING

Since inception in 1967, direct contributions have been made
by 29 member countries. In 1986 and 1992, the Board of
Governors, in authorizing a replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate amount
equivalent to $72,000,000 and $140,000,000, respectively, to
be used for technical assistance to ADF borrowing developing member countries and for regional technical assistance.

In addition, an aggregate amount equivalent to $501,000,000
had been allocated to TASF out of OCR net income in 1992 to
1995 and in 1998 to 2000.

Some of the direct contributions received were subject to
restricted procurement sources, while some were given on
condition that the technical assistance be made on a reim
190 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

bursable basis. The total contributions received for the years
ended 31 December 2002 and 2001 were without restrictions.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA
projects/programs which are not yet disbursed as of the end
of the year. During 2002, an amount of $3,870,000 ($5,471,000
— 2001) representing completed and canceled TA projects
has been written back as a reduction in technical assistance
of the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value of undisbursed
commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed
because ADB expects that grants will be made for all projects/
programs covered by the commitments. When TA provided
as a project preparatory grant leads to an ADB loan, the
amount of the grant exceeding $250,000 will be refunded by
the borrower through the loan proceeds under the terms of
that ADB loan. Refinanced amount of $2,625,000 ($346,000
— 2001) was charged to such loans and credited to revenue
from other sources of the TASF during the year ended
31 December 2002.

NOTE F—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amount.

The carrying amounts of TASF’s assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B
and E for discussions with respect to investments and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.PRICEWATERHOUSE(COPERS @

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of financial position and the related statements of
activities and changes in net assets and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of
United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—Japan Special Fund at
31 December 2002 and 2001, and the results of its activities and changes in net assets and its cash
flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the
Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) entered
into a financial arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make
an initial contribution and ADB became the administrator.
The purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries
(DMCs) of ADB restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs of ADB. While JSF
resources are used mainly to finance technical assistance
(TA) operations, these resources may also be used for equity
investment operations in ADB’s DMCs. Under the agreement
between ADB and Japan, ADB may invest the proceeds of
JSF pending disbursement.

In March 1999, the Board approved the acceptance and
administration by ADB of a new facility, the Asian Currency
Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF) to assist Asian currency crisisaffected member countries (CAMCs). Funded by Japan, ACCSF
was established within JSF to assist in the economic recovery
of CAMCs through interest payment assistance (IPA) grants,
TA grants, and guarantees. With the general fulfillment of the
purpose of the facility, Jagan and ADB agreed to terminate the
ACCSF on 22 March 2002. An amount of $90 million in the
ACCSF account, upon request of Japan, was transferred to the
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). JFPR, established by
Japan in May 2000 supporting innovative poverty reduction
and related social development activities, is one of the trust
funds managed by ADB. The ACCSF account is to be kept open
until the completion of all TA and IPA disbursements and the
settlement of all administrative expenses.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of JSF are presented on the basis of
unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. ACCSF
funds are separately reported in the financial statements.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations
that limit the use of the donated assets. When the donor
restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose
restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets
are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the
Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets as “NET
ASSETS RELEASED FROM RESTRICTIONS.”

Investments

All investment securities held by JSF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements from the date indicated by Japan that funds are
expected to be made available. Contributions which are
restricted by the donor for specific TA projects/programs or
for IPA grants are classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those without any stipulation as to specific use are
accounted for as unrestricted contributions and reported as
such.

Technical Assistance and Interest Payment Assistance

Technical assistance and interest payment assistance are
recognized in the financial statements when the related
project or assistance is approved and becomes effective.
Upon completion of the TA project or cancellation of a grant,
any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in TA
or IPA for the year and the corresponding undisbursed
commitment is eliminated, accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen, while the
reporting currency is the United States dollar. The financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United
States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at the
applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the year are translated at the applicable exchange rates as
of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and
expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated for each
semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at
the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on
exchange differences between the date a project/program is

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 195

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIAASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

committed and the timing of disbursements. Exchange gains
or losses are charged or credited to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are
reported at fair value. The reserve against losses is established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of
potential losses on investments without readily determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the
year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2002 and 2001 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

 

 

2002 2001
JSF JSF
Regular and Regular and
Currency ACCSF Supplementary Total ACCSF Supplementary Total
Japanese yen = § = $ -  $181,477,000 $ - $181,477,000

Total $60,669,000  $242,871,000 — $303,540,000 — $181,477,000 $27,761,000  — $459,238,000

 

 

 

The annualized rates of return on the average investments
held under ACCSF and JSF funds during the year, based on the
portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month were
1.54% and 2.15%, respectively (0.12% and 4.76%, respectively
- 2001).

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB used JSF resources to make an equity investment in
India in 1990. Commencing May 2001, due to the unavailability of a reliable market for the investment, ADB reported
the investment at its written down value of $106,000 ($105,000
- 2001).

NOTE E—OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Included in other assets and liabilities are interfund

balances between JSF and ACCSF. As at 31 December 2002,

196 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

an amount of $2,089,000 ($431,000 - 2001) was receivable
from ACCSF. The said amount is reflected as other assets
under JSF and other liabilities under ACCSF.

NOTE F—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent TA projects/programs and IPA grants
which have become effective but not yet disbursed. During
2002, an amount of $3,010,000 ($2,960,000 - 2001) and
$33,251,000 (nil - 2001), representing completed and partially canceled TA projects and IPA grants, respectively,
have been written back as a reduction in TA and IPA for the
year, and the corresponding undisbursed commitments have
been eliminated. The fair value of undisbursed commitments
approximates the amounts outstanding because ADB
expects that disbursements will substantially be made for all
the projects/programs covered by the commitments.NOTE G—UNCOMMITTED BALANCES

Uncommitted balances comprised of amounts which have
not been committed by ADB as at 31 December 2002. These

NOTE H—CONTRIBUTIONS AND TEMPORARILY
RESTRICTED NET ASSETS

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 2002 and
2001 were received during the respective years. Some of the
contributions received were with restriction that were to be
utilized for specific TA projects/programs. Such contributions were classified as temporarily restricted support.

Effective 31 December 2002, all remaining temporarily
restricted net assets under JSF were transferred and integrated
into the regular net assets, as concurred by Japan, in order to
optimize the use of JSF. Temporarily restricted uncommitted
balances are available for the following purposes as of
31 December 2002 and 2001:

2002 2001

Total $26,211,000

$157,160,000

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated
administrative expenses for 31 December 2001 was categorized
as temporarily restricted net assets. Under the terms of the
agreement between ADB and Japan, accumulated investment
income may only be used for defraying of the JSF’s
administrative expenses. Effective 31 December 2002, Japan
agreed to use the investment income amounting to $106,405,000
for JSF as additional resources for funding future ADB's TA
operations, as well as for defraying administrative expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments
for technical assistance and interest payment assistance
satisfying the conditions specified by the donor and, in the
case of accumulated investment income, to defray the
administrative expenses of the Fund.

NOTE I-GUARANTEES

To assist in the economic recovery of CAMCs, a guarantee
facility is provided under ACCSF. In the absence of any
concluded guarantee, the noninterest-bearing, nonnegotiable
note of ¥360 billion made available to support the guarantee
facility under ACCSF was returned to Japan on 25 March
2002.

NOTE J—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations

198 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

are not readily available are valued using methodologies and
assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective
judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The carrying amounts of JSF's assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C,
D, and F for discussions relating to investments, equity
investments, and undisbursed commitments.PRICEWATERHOUSE(COPERS @

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of financial position and the related statements of
activities and changes in net assets, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects in terms of
United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the
establishment of the Asian Development Bank Institute (the
Institute) in Tokyo, Japan as a subsidiary body of ADB. The
Institute commenced its operations upon the receipt of the
first funds from Japan on 24 March 1997, and it was inaugurated on 10 December 1997. The Institute’s funds may
consist of voluntary contributions, donations, and grants
from ADB member countries, nongovernment organizations,
and foundations. The objectives of the Institute, as defined
under its Statute, are the identification of effective development strategies and capacity improvement for sound development management in developing member countries.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented on
the basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports donor's contributions of cash and
other assets as unrestricted support as these are made available
to the Institute without conditions other than for the purposes
of pursuing the objectives of the Institute.

Investments

Allinvestment securities held by the Institute are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial statements from the date committed.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of the Institute is the Japanese yen.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar and the

financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at the
applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions included in the financial statements during
the period are translated at the applicable exchange rates as
of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and
expense amounts in currency other than the United States
dollar are translated for each semimonthly period at the
applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end
of the year and the reported amounts of income and
expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Institute
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications of the financial statements and
related footnote amounts in the year ended 31 December
2001 have been made to conform to the presentation in the
year ended 31 December 2002.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of investments denominated in Japanese yen. As of 31 December
2002 and 2001, the estimated fair value of the investments
approximated cost or amortized cost. All such investments
are due within one year.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month was 0.01% (0.07% — 2001).

ANNUAL REPORT 2002 203

SLINIWALVLS TVIDNVNIAASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2002 and 2001

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. The Investment
Authority allows investment in higher-yielding investment
instruments, such as high-quality corporate bonds,
mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. The
main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
administers the Institute’s investment and seeks the highest
possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

The Institute's statement of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments.

NOTE E—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Institute participates in the contributory defined benefit
Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of ADB. Every member of

204 ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

the professional staff, as defined under the Plan, shall, as a
condition of service, become a participant from the first day
of service, provided that at such a date, the staff has not
reached the normal retirement age of 60. Retirement
benefits are based on length of service and highest average
remuneration during two years of eligible service. The Plan
assets are segregated and are not included in the statement
of financial position. The costs of administering the Plan are
absorbed by ADB, except for fees paid to the investment
managers and related charges, including custodian fees,
which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions.
The Institute’s contribution is determined at a rate sufficient
to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the
participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

The Institute participates in the cost-sharing plan of ADB for
retirees medical insurance premiums of ADB. Under the
plan, the Institute is obligated to pay 75% of the Group
Medical Insurance Plan premiums for retirees and their eligible dependents who elect to participate. The cost-sharing
plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.ADBISF-4

Net refers to effective loan amounts less cancellations.
© The US dollar equivalent is in accordance with the exchange rate prevailing in ADB on 31 December 2002. The cumulative contracts awarded exceed the
net effective loan amounts due to the following reasons:
(i) for countries without active loans, the base contract amount of loans that were closed prior to computerization does not reflect the adjustment with
regard to procurement data, e.g., Afghanistan; and
(ii) for countries with active loans, the contract amount inputted is basically the percentage of ADB-financed portion and each contract amount was
adjusted upon completion of disbursement.

Estimated to be low income ($755 or less).

Refers to GDP growth at factor cost.

Refers to fiscal year.

Per capita GNI refers to 2000 figure.

GNI (Atlas Method) figures in current US dollar were used as weights to derive the averages. Respective GNI figures were used as weights for 2000-2001.
For 2002, GNI for 2001 was used as the weight. For 1992-1999 annual average, the weights used were the average of GNI for 1995 and 1996. Myanmar
was excluded in the calculation of the weighted average.

(.) Negative.

< Less than.

2 Positive figures indicate deforestation rates while negative figures indicate reforestation rates.

> Refers to all protected areas at least 1,000 hectares listed in categories I-V of the World Conservation Union (IUCN).

© Refers to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing.

5 Two years ago, data for GDP per unit of Energy Use were expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) $ per kg of oil equivalent (kgoe). Since there maybe

problems associated with PPP, the major of which is that there is no price data collection since 1993, the indicator expressed in constant 1995 $ per

kgoe is deemed more appropriate.

The number 0.0 means the magnitude is zero or is less than half of the unit employed and not known more precisely.

For Hong Kong, China figure for total forest refers to 1995, average rate of deforestation refers to 1990-1995, national protected areas refers to 1997

and population using improved drinking water sources refers to 1999.

9 Refers to percentage of population served by tap water.

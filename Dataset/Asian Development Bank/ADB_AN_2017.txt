FOR FUTURE NEEDS

12%

Population without access

to electricity*

Millions of people gain access to electricity in Asia
and the Pacific each year, yet there remain pockets,
even in countries where overall rates of access are
relatively high, that have not yet been served. These
areas are often home to the poorest of the poor.

* In Developing Asia and the Pacific.

19.3 KM

Amount of sealed roads
per 10,000 people*

f ft é ff

Just one-third of roads in the region are paved. The
issue is acute in rural areas. Safe, paved roads allow
more people to reach markets and services, such as
medical care. Climate change means roads should be
built and upgraded to address natural hazards.

iglaal

1.5 BILLION

Number of people who lack
access to safe sanitation*

re?

Clean water access is improving in the region, but
scarce sanitation facilities remain a problem, with
significant impacts on health and social development.
In 2015, 78.3% of people in urban areas and only
49.3% in rural areas used safe sanitation services.

 

88%

Population without access
to broadband internet*

Information and communication technology improves
livelihoods, health, education, transport, and financial
inclusion. While people now have access to the

internet, few can access a fast internet.
Broadband infrastructure is lacking.

 

The infrastructure we build today will shape the future of Asia and the Pacific.

ADB supports sustainable infrastructure that is designed, built, and operated

to be durable, socially equitable, and economically and environmentally viable.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA

Reducing greenhouse
gas and air pollutant
emissions is a priority
in the PRC. In Shaanxi
province—a fossil
fuel-dependent
region—ADB has
established a financing platform to fund clean energy
and emission reduction investments. Among the first
investments, the Fengxi Geothermal Heating
Project will use an innovative technology to extract
geothermal heat from underground and provide
space heating to homes.

 

FIVE ADB PROJECTS THAT SET THE STANDARD IN SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

INDIA

Poor coastal
communities and
many rapidly
growing urban
areas in India are

: vulnerable to
coastal erosion. ADB’s Sustainable Coastal
Protection and Management Investment
Program is helping to protect coastal erosion in
the state of Karnataka by introducing new
technologies that protect the coastline and
enhance income-generating opportunities for
communities in affected areas.

 

FEDERATED STATES
OF MICRONESIA

an ADB is helping
Pacific island
countries to

— increase renewable

» energy and
improve power
generation

efficiency to improve access to electricity and
reduce dependency on imported diesel. The Yap
Renewable Energy Development Project, in
FSM, supported the construction of a wind farm,
which is capable of withstanding typhoons.

 

MYANMAR

An ADB loan toa
private company
will roll out a
nationwide
greenfield
network that

will provide more than 90% of the population
with telecom access. The Nationwide
Telecommunications Project will provide
reliable, affordable broadband that vastly
improves opportunities for business and trade,
strengthens public health and education, and
helps reduce urban-rural disparities.

PAKISTAN

A booming
population has
caused Peshawar’s
B roads and air
quality to choke.
ADB’s Sustainable
Bus Rapid Transit Corridor Project will improve
the quality of life of the city’s residents by offering
safe, efficient, and affordable public transport.
The modern technology used in the project

will also cut emissions, make commuting easier
and safer for women, and attract businesses

and investors.

ANNUAL
REPORT

SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FUTURE NEEDS jPRESIDENT’S MESSAGE

 

2 ADB AR 2017

e are pleased to
present the Asian
Development
Bank (ADB)
Annual Report
2017. This is a clear,
comprehensive, and detailed record of
our operations, activities, and financial
results over the past year. We produce
this report to help our stakeholders
and those who are interested in ADB
gain a deeper understanding of our
organization and its operations.

This year, we began a new chapter in
meeting development needs across
Asia and the Pacific. With the merger
of the bank’s concessional Asian
Development Fund lending operations
with the ordinary capital resources
balance sheet from the start of the year,
ADB has a solid capital base to support
our operations going forward.

The merger has already helped
ADB deliver another record year of
Operations in 2017.

ADB’s new performance measure,
commitments—loans, grants, and
investments signed by finance recipient
countries and entities—reached

$20.1 billion. This is a significant increase
from $13.3 billion in 2016 and $16.2 billion
in 2015. Of the $20.1 billion committed

in 2017, nonsovereign (primarily private
sector investments) accounted for

$2.3 billion, a 31% increase on 2016.

 

Technical assistance, meanwhile,
increased by 11% to $201 million.

We approved $19.1 billion in new
financing from the bank’s own resources
in 2017, well on the way to our 2020
target of $20 billion. Disbursements and
cofinancing, however, fell short of our
targets. Disbursements are essential to
make a difference on the ground, while
mobilizing cofinancing is critical to
realizing the Sustainable Development
Goals. We will come up with concrete
measures to increase disbursements and
cofinancing, building on the new ADB
procurement policy approved in April
2017 and ongoing efforts to leverage the
bank’s resources.

Although ADB's record level of
investment is helping to improve the lives
of millions, the need for development
finance in Asia and the Pacific continues
to escalate. More than 1.24 billion
people live on less than $3.20 a day,

over 400 million have no access to
electricity, 300 million do not have safe
drinking water, and 1.5 billion lack basic
sanitation. ADB has estimated that Asia
and the Pacific must spend $1.7 trillion a
year on infrastructure through to 2030
to maintain its growth momentum,
eradicate poverty, and respond to rising
inequality and climate change.

We continue to combine finance with
innovative solutions to respond better
to the region’s diverse and specific

“The merger of ADB’s concessional Asian Development
Fund lending operations with the ordinary capital resources

balance sheet has helped ADB deliver another record year

of operations in 2017.”challenges and needs, such as rapid
urbanization, climate change, and
growing demand for water and energy.

In 2017, we helped introduce satellite
data and remote sensing to improve
irrigation in Indonesia and Pakistan,
pilot test climate-smart agriculture
practices in Bangladesh, introduce
contingent financing in the Pacific
small island states to address disaster
resilience, and implement social
welfare reforms to promote human
development in Mongolia. We also
intensified efforts to meet the growing
demand for nonsovereign loans in
local currencies.

On the funding side, ADB introduced
innovative finance products such as
health and gender bonds.

In addition to our history book, Banking
on the Future of Asia and the Pacific:
50 Years of the Asian Development Bank,

published at the soth annual meeting
in Yokohama during May, we delivered
two high-impact knowledge works

in 2017. The first was Meeting Asia’s
Infrastructure Needs, which has been
widely quoted by media, academics,
and other international institutions.
The second was A Region at Risk: The

Human Dimensions of Climate Change
in Asia and the Pacific. We also hosted
such important events as the Asia
Clean Energy Forum and Regional
Cooperation and Integration Week.

 
 

 

MANAGEMENT TEAM

 

President Nakao opens a knowledge-sharing series at ADB headquarters in Manila in January. He discussed
ADB's 5 decades of history, the future of the organization, and economic development in Asia and the Pacific.

Internally, we continued reforms to
make the most of the bank’s human
resources. A new Mobility Framework
provides more opportunities to staff
for career development. Work from
Home guidelines were updated to
allow more flexible and productive
work arrangements. The Respectful
Workplace initiative is now in place,
and the special unit set up for this
purpose is operational. We are

also making progress in improving
gender balance within ADB. The
representation of women among
international staff increased to a new

 

 

high of 35% in 2017. Through persistent
action we will achieve our target of 40%
by the end of 2022.

All of this sets a platform to help Asia
and the Pacific tackle increasingly
diverse development challenges.

he Board of Directors
provides strategic direction
to ADB and ensures that
shareholder guidance is
implemented. The bank’s
67 members are

represented on the Board through

12 constituencies, each with a director

and an alternate director. In 2017,

the Board held 43 formal meetings

and 44 informal sessions. It approved

106 loans, grants, financing facilities,

equity investments, and guarantees.

It also endorsed new country

partnership strategies for Afghanistan,

India, Kazakhstan, the Lao People’s

Democratic Republic, Mongolia,

Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Turkmenistan.

MAJOR INITIATIVES

The merger of the lending operations

of the Asian Development Fund with

ADB's ordinary capital resources on
1 January 2017 roughly tripled the bank’s

4 ADB AR 2017

risk-bearing capacity and enabled

a significant increase in lending. To
ensure that the bank continues to hold
sufficient capital to manage all material
risks, including increased credit risk

rom expanded operations following the
merger, the Board approved in February
2017 a revised capital adequacy
ramework with a new minimum equityjoan ratio for financial planning, together
with close monitoring of ADB’s capital
utilization. Given the planned increase
in the bank’s nonsovereign operations,
the Board also revised its exposure

imits for these operations and endorsed
the introduction of an economic capital
planning framework.

The Board supported a new framework
to streamline the bank’s procurement
policy. The framework emphasizes
quality and value for money in
procurement decisions, in addition to
efficiency, fairness, and transparency.

t will allow more flexibility in meeting

 

client needs, while ensuring that the
bank’s fiduciary, governance, and
anticorruption requirements are satisfied.

The Board also approved reforms
designed to reduce financial risks
associated with the staff retirement
plan and improve the plan’s long-term
sustainability. These reforms included
introducing a defined contribution
scheme, a higher retirement age for staff
who joined ADB after October 2017,
more balanced risk-sharing strategies
between the bank and its staff, and
stronger governance aligned with
international best practice.

During its informal sessions, the Board
provided guidance on strategy and policy
issues, including the preparation of anew
corporate strategy, ADB’s engagement
with middle-income countries, a review
of the bank’s Public Communications
Policy, and a new climate change
operational framework. It also providedguidance on the development of
significant and innovative investment
proposals, such as a disaster resilience
program and a renewable energy
investment facility for the Pacific, as
well as reforms to promote sustainable
energy in Pakistan.

In addition, the Board held discussions
with staff on ADB’s programs and
projects in energy and transport.
Board members also discussed the
bank’s efforts to maintain a respectful
workplace and ADB’s framework for
independent evaluation.

COMMITTEES

Board members serve on committees
that are organized to oversee

aspects of ADB’s operations

and governance. Six committees
supported the Board in 2017: Audit,
Budget Review, Compliance Review,
Development Effectiveness, Ethics, and
Human Resources.

The Audit Committee oversaw

the annual internal audit work plan

and the operations of the Office of
Anticorruption and Integrity. The
committee also reviewed and discussed
initiatives on information technology,
cybersecurity, and organizational
resiliency, including the establishment
of an active disaster recovery site in
Geneva, Switzerland.

The Budget Review Committee
assessed the shift to monitoring
ADB’s performance based on
commitments (signed loan
agreements) rather than approvals,
and reviewed proposals for inclusion
in the 2018 administrative budget.

It also considered budgetary priorities
for operational areas and measures to
optimize capital expenditures.

The Compliance Review Committee
reviewed actions on complaints raised
under the bank’s Accountability
Mechanism.

The Development Effectiveness
Committee oversaw the work program
of the Independent Evaluation
Department and reviewed significant
evaluations such as those covering
strategic directions for Strategy 2030,
support for gender equality, resultsbased lending, the bank’s operations
in India, and the role of its creditenhancement products.

The Human Resources Committee
considered important reforms to

staff retirement, recruitment, and
performance management. It also
discussed new policies for maintaining
a respectful workplace, flexible work
practices, and staff satisfaction and
engagement.

PARTNERSHIPS

The Board values exchanging ideas

and opinions with ministers and senior
government officials and representatives
of bilateral and multilateral development
partners. In April, the Board held a
colloquium with Sri Mulyani Indrawati,
ADB Governor and Finance Minister of
Indonesia, who discussed Indonesia’s
development priorities.

To gain first-hand knowledge of
development needs across Asia and the
Pacific, small groups of Board members
visit selected member countries each

year. These visits allow Board members
to observe ADB operations and

engage in dialogue with a wide range

of stakeholders.

In March, Board members visited Samoa
and the Cook Islands, where they met
with the prime ministers and finance
ministers of both countries; senior
ministry officials; and representatives
of development partners, civil society
organizations, and the private sector.
ADB is highly regarded in both
countries as a reliable partner in
supporting renewable energy, transport
infrastructure, internet connectivity,
agribusiness, and social assistance
programs.

 

In June, Board members visited
Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. They met
with the President of Tajikistan and

the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan,
senior officials and other stakeholders,
including civil society and private sector
groups and project beneficiaries.

In October, Board members visited
India and Thailand. In India, they met
with the ADB Governor and Minister
of Finance of India, and other federal
and state officials. The group visited
ADB-supported projects in transport,
urban infrastructure, and energy, and
met with project stakeholders and
civil society organizations. In Thailand,
Board members met with the Prime
Minister and the ADB Governor and
Minister of Finance. The group also
visited ADB-supported projects

in renewable energy and public
transport.

 

During a visit to Kazakhstan in June, ADB directors

met with Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev and the
Minister of National Economy and ADB Governor Timur
Suleimenov. The delegation discussed ADB’s support

for regional cooperation in trade, transport, and energy,
particularly through the Central Asia Regional Economic

Cooperation Program.

link in the Greater Mekong Subregion Northern Economic Corridor.

he Asia and Pacific region
has witnessed significant
development progress,
and is now the world’s
fastest-growing region.

In 2017, gross domestic
product across developing Asia
expanded by 6.1%, contributing about
60% to total global gross domestic
product growth. Growth across
developing Asia was supported
by a rebound in global trade—

a welcome development given the
sluggish pace of world trade since
the global financial crisis of 2008—
and robust private consumption.
Healthy expansion in many of the
region’s largest economies bolstered
the composite growth figure, while
a gentle upturn in global food and
fuel prices has provided relief to
commodity producers, without
derailing growth for commodity
importers. Developing Asia is

10 ADB AR 2017

well positioned to face any global
headwinds and sustain its growth
momentum.

The region, however, remains home
to over 1.24 billion of the world’s poor,
who live on less than $3.20 a day, with
326 million of those people living on
less than $1.90 a day and classified as
extremely poor.

New and more complex challenges
brought by rising inequality, rapidly
changing technologies, urbanization,
and demographic transitions have
emerged across Asia and the

Pacific. Environmental pressures
have intensified and threaten the
sustainability of development efforts.
Infrastructure, while improving,
remains inadequate to service basic
human needs in many parts of the
region, and the investment required
to address infrastructure shortfalls
remains substantial.

    
 

THE IMPORTANCE
OF SUSTAINABLE
INFRASTRUCTURE

Infrastructure investment in Asia and
the Pacific has not kept pace with the
needs of the region’s growing population
and the demands brought by rapid
economic growth: over 400 million
Asians are still without connections to
electricity; roughly 300 million have no
access to safe drinking water; 1.5 billion
people lack basic sanitation. The
quality of infrastructure also remains a
problem. Many countries face regular
power outages, waterborne diseases,
underdeveloped road and rail networks,
and severe traffic congestion in cities.

In February 2017, ADB published
research that estimated the
infrastructure investment required

in Asia and the Pacific over 2016 to
2030 at $26 trillion. This equates to an
infrastructure spend of $1.7 trillion every
year to maintain the region’s growth
momentum, eradicate poverty, and
respond to climate change (see box

on page 13).

Decisions on infrastructure
development—including types of
infrastructure and technologies
used—have significant implications

for advancing commitments made
under the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement
on Climate Change. Cleaner and

more disaster-resilient technologies
are needed to design and build
infrastructure that reduces greenhouse
gas emissions and enhances resilience to
the adverse impacts of climate change.

To support this, ADB is seeking to
deliver more sustainable infrastructure:
that which is designed, built, and
operated to be durable, socially
equitable, and economically and
environmentally viable.IMPACT OF MERGER ON
ADF LENDING OPERATIONS
AND OCR BALANCE SHEET

Effective 1 January 2017, ADB’s total
equity increased almost threefold to
$48 billion following the transfer of Asian
Development Fund lending operations
and other assets to its ordinary capital
resources balance sheet (refer to ADB
Annual Report 2016, Special Appendix).
With its significantly strengthened
financial capacity, ADB is poised to do
more to meet its developing member
countries’ (DMCs) needs, including
addressing infrastructure deficits.

In 2017, ADB committed $17.8 billion

in sovereign operations, $2.3 billion

in nonsovereign operations, and

$201 million in technical assistance.
Commitments in regular ordinary capital
resources amounted to $17.2 billion, and
concessional loans, grants, and special
fund resources amounted to $2.9 billion.
Together with cofinancing, the bank’s

commitments reached $32.2 billion in 2017.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

Under its long-term strategic agenda,
ADB works to ensure that growth in
each of its DMCs is more inclusive and
environmentally sustainable, while also
maintaining an emphasis on regional
cooperation and integration.

Just as the pace of economic growth in
Asia and the Pacific must be sustained
and increased, more attention must

be paid to the quality and patterns of
growth. There must be increased effort to
promote inclusive growth that creates
and expands economic opportunities,
and provides adequate social safety nets,
for those currently missing out on the
benefits of development. In Afghanistan,
ADB committed $330 million to construct
a national highway and provide basic
infrastructure facilities such as small-scale

 

SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
IN ASIA AND THE PACIFIC

Infrastructure plays a critical role in generating inclusive
economic growth and reducing poverty across Asia and the
Pacific. Support for sustainable infrastructure—that which is
designed, built, and operated to be durable, socially equitable,
and economically and environmentally viable—remains central
to ADB operations. Infrastructure accounts for about 70% of
the bank’s investments, with an emphasis on the Sustainable
Development Goals and the global climate change agenda.

ADB looks to develop inclusive infrastructure to ensure

that safe, reliable, and affordable energy, transport, water supply
and sanitation, and other urban services reach the poor,
vulnerable, and disadvantaged. ADB complements these
investments with assistance in education, health, agriculture,
and finance. Cross-border infrastructure such as roads, railways,
and electricity transmission lines are also priorities in expanding
economic opportunities through regional cooperation and
integration.

ADB’s infrastructure operations aim to contribute to
environmentally sustainable and low-carbon development, and
to increase resilience to climate change and natural hazards.
These objectives are pursued through investments in renewable
energy, energy efficiency, urban mass transport and other lowcarbon modes of travel, climate change and disaster resilience,
and adherence to environmental and social safeguards.

ADB also ensures that operational sustainability is embedded in
infrastructure project designs. The bank provides assistance to
enhance public financial management to improve cost recovery,
improve revenue generation to ensure sufficient resources

for ongoing operations, and implement performance-based
contracts for asset maintenance.

To add value in infrastructure investments, ADB promotes

the use of high-level technology and innovative solutions.

It emphasizes quality in procurement, strengthens capacity
and expertise within developing member countries, forges
partnerships with centers of excellence, and mobilizes support
for groundbreaking pilot projects.

Because public resources are limited, ADB works to develop
sustainable infrastructure projects attractive to the private sector.
It promotes public-private partnerships by helping developing
member countries create suitable investment climates, sound
market regulations, and stronger government institutions. The
bank offers transaction advisory services to public and private
sector clients in developing, structuring, and completing projects
under public-private partnerships. To reduce risks and draw
financing from a broader investment base, ADB also provides
innovative financing products such as green bonds, guarantees,
infrastructure funds, and other credit-enhancement facilities.

irrigation schemes, schools, and clinics.
In Nepal, ADB committed $154.9
million for a power project to supply
cleaner and more reliable electricity
for 400,000 people in the Kathmandu
Valley, reducing dependence on diesel
generators and improving air quality,
public health, and living conditions.
To address youth unemployment

in the Philippines, ADB committed
$300 million to help youth transition
from school to work.

ADB contributed to environmentally
sustainable growth by supporting
investments in sustainable
infrastructure, conservation and
restoration of natural capital, and
strengthening environmental
governance and climate change
mitigation and adaptation. Several
innovative projects were committed
in 2017, including loans and grants for
urban environmental improvement,
urban public transport, railways, air
quality improvement, and green
finance. For instance, ADB signed the
second tranche of $66 million for a
coastal protection investment program
designed to check coastal erosion

on the western coast in Karnataka,
India. The investment program will
address coastal protection needs
using environmentally and socially
appropriate solutions, with a focus on

green and nature-based options such as
artificial reefs, beach nourishment, and
dune management. The bank finalized
an institutional framework that provides
direction and guidance for enhancing
climate resilience and strengthening
climate actions in ADB operations and
business processes over 2017-2030
(see box on page 17). Across 2017, ADB
invested $4.5 billion in climate change
funding in 2017 from its own resources
for 74 approved projects and 45 technical
assistance projects, while mobilizing an
additional $696 million from external
financing, bringing total climate finance
to $5.2 billion.

ADB invested $6.2 billion in 2017 to
support regional cooperation and
integration. The second tranche

of the Greater Mekong Subregion

project in Viet Nam, which will increase
the competitiveness of the regional
economies along the Greater Mekong
Subregion Southern Economic Corridor,
was also signed. ADB provided a loan to
support Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region of the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) to develop modern
technical and vocational education

and training (TVET), facilitating crossborder movement of skilled labor

with Association of Southeast Asian
Nations countries. The bank signed a

$21.8 million loan agreement with
Nepal to help modernize its trade
processes and harmonize them with
international customs standards.

ADB also signed a loan to help a global
agribusiness company to scale up and
introduce climate-controlled greenhouse
technology for flower and vegetable
production in Viet Nam, the PRC,

and Indonesia, enabling smallholder
farmers to participate in global and
regional value chains.

SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT GOALS

ADB is committed to the SDGs, which
were adopted by 191 governments in
September 2015. The SDGs represent a
framework for the development efforts of
all countries, linking people, planet, and
prosperity. In 2017, ADB delivered the
first outputs of its renewed partnership
with the United Nations Development
Programme and the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific. These included

a joint report on promoting prosperity
and eradicating poverty in Asia and

the Pacific. The report considered new
opportunities to manage the region’s
transition from being largely rural to
largely urban, and for building more
sustainable infrastructure. ADB alsohelped develop a web-based platform
to monitor progress across Asia and the
Pacific in achieving the SDGs.

PRIORITY SECTORS

ADB committed $6.3 billion to
investments in the energy sector in 2017,
comprising 31% of total commitments.
In line with its climate finance target

of investing $3 billion by 2020 through
clean energy investments, ADB
approved $2.04 billion for renewable
energy and energy efficiency projects

in 2017. Through these investments

in 25 projects, ADB will help generate
1,557 megawatts of additional capacity
from renewable energy sources, save
738 gigawatt-hours of electricity each
year, and avoid 11.8 million metric tons
CO2-equivalent per year. To improve
air quality in the PRC, ADB approved
the application of advanced low-carbon

contributions to the Paris Agreement
and keep ADB on track to meet its
climate finance targets.

In 2017, ADB committed $5.39 billion
in loans and grants for 36 transport
projects, including multisector projects
with transport components. These
investments represent 26.8% of

ADB’s total commitments for 2017.
The bank maintained a focus on
promoting affordable, accessible, safe,
and environment-friendly modes of
transport across Asia and the Pacific.
In Azerbaijan, it approved $400 million
for a railway sector development
program, including a policy-based

loan to support railway sector reforms,

ANALYZING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF ASIA AND THE PACIFIC

 

Developing Asia, comprising 45 ADB member economies, needs to invest $26 trillion from
2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion a year, to meet its infrastructure requirements (taking into
account the costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation).

Of the $26 trillion, $14.7 trillion will be required for energy, $8.4 trillion for transport,

$2.3 trillion for telecommunications, and $800 billion for water supply and sanitation.
Without climate change mitigation and adaptation costs, baseline infrastructure investment
needs for 2016-2030 will be $3.6 trillion lower, but still almost $1.5 trillion a year.

Climate mitigation costs are estimated at $200 billion annually, primarily for investments in

renewable energy, smart grids, and energy efficiency. Transport is also important in climate mitigation, mainly by
encouraging shifts to modes of transport (public transit and railways) that reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions.

The infrastructure investment gap over 2016-2020 is estimated at $460 billion annually. To bridge this gap,
fiscal reforms could generate additional revenues, but additional financing will be required from the private sector
and other sources. ADB will support regulatory and institutional reforms in its developing member countries to
make infrastructure more attractive to private investors. The bank will also help governments be more proactive
in promoting public-private partnerships, and assist in deepening capital markets to help channel the region’s
substantial savings into productive infrastructure investment.

a social welfare support program

in Mongolia. Building on the policy
reforms achieved in its first phase,
the program aims to develop and
implement policy actions to ensure
that the poor and vulnerable primarily
benefit from the country’s social
welfare programs. It will also promote
fiscal sustainability, especially in light
of the country’s economic slowdown
since 2015. ADB also committed close
to $15 million in technical assistance

THEMATIC HIGHLIGHTS

In 2017, 51% of ADB’s newly committed
projects had components to help
empower women and girls. This already
exceeds the bank’s target to have 50%
of its projects support gender equity
and equality by 2020. In Pakistan, a
project supporting Peshawar’s first

bus rapid transit corridor includes
measures to reduce the risk of sexual
harassment for women passengers.
These measures include bright

lighting, closed-circuit television
cameras, seating areas exclusively for
women, and staff trained to deal with
harassment incidents. The measures
were recommended in response to
findings during project preparation that
90% of women reported feeling unsafe
using existing bus services. In 2017,

73% of all completed ADB projects
delivered their intended gender
equality results, already exceeding

the target of 70% set for 2020. These
results included women gaining access
to jobs and other income opportunities,
participating in skills training, and
becoming more involved in community
and/or domestic decision-making.
Through community-based cultural
and ecotourism support for a regional
project covering the Lao People’s

Democratic Republic and Viet Nam,
ADB provided skills training to 37,000

women, the majority of whom were
from minority groups, while also
helping 150,000 women gain access
to jobs and economic opportunities,
improving transportation services, andincreasing participation by women in
local tourism planning.

Throughout 2017, ADB supported

its DMCs to enhance policies and
processes related to domestic resource
mobilization, public expenditure and
financial management, procurement,
reforming state-owned enterprises,
and improving decentralization and
subnational governance. Improving
governance protocols was reflected

in 14 committed public sector
management projects representing
6% of total 2017 commitments,
including disaster resilience programs
in Tonga and Samoa, a public sector
enterprise reform program in Pakistan,
a development finance program in
India, and a macroeconomic resilience
program in Tonga. ADB helped establish
the Domestic Resource Mobilization
Trust Fund, with an initial contribution
of $2 million from the Government

of Japan, as a concrete response to
request from DMCs to help improve
domestic resource mobilization. The
bank approved technical assistance

to strengthen government institutions
and help DMCs support subnational

partnerships and links with the Asia
Foundation; the National College of
Public Administration and Governance
(University of the Philippines); the
Korea Development Institute; and the
Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,
National University of Singapore.

ADB’s 2017 program had a focus on
sustainable and resilient infrastructure
development as well as investments in
natural capital as part of its efforts to
address climate change In Sri Lanka,
the bank will help develop the country’s
first 10o-megawatt wind park and
contribute to future wind power
development through public-private
partnerships. In the PRC, ADB will
help Guizhou province reduce rocky
desertification areas and improve the
livelihoods of local communities by
conserving water resources, restoring
ecology and land productivity, and
increasing resilience to climate change.
ADB invested in the construction

and upgrading of coastal erosion

and instability mitigation structures,
and capacity building for integrated

shoreline planning and development in
India to address coastal erosion caused
by increased sea-level rise. In April,
with support from the Government of
Germany, ADB established the AsiaPacific Climate Finance Fund to help
assess, develop, and deliver financial
risk management products that can
help unlock financing for climate
investments. In May, ADB and partners
hosted the International Forum on
Sustainable Infrastructure, held in

Ha Noi, Viet Nam, where delegates
developed principles for planning

and designing ecologically sensitive
and climate-resilient transport
infrastructure. In August,

the bank signed an accreditation
master agreement with the Green
Climate Fund (GCF), allowing it to
access and administer GCF funds.

In October, the GCF approved a

$27 million grant for climate adaptation
and mitigation investments for new
port facilities in Nauru, the third ADB
project approved by the GCF.

 

ADB continued to expand its
engagement in disaster risk
management in 2017, and the

COORDINATING ACTION TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE

     
      

In July 2017, ADB adopted its Climate Change Operational Framework 2017-2030
(CCOF2030). The framework strengthens ADB’s support to developing member countries
(DMCs) in meeting their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable
Development Goals, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Financing—including
nationally determined contributions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Through the
CCOF2030, ADB will help DMCs implement ambitious climate actions that contribute to
national sustainable development. The framework outlines how ADB will scale up climate
investment in DMCs (in line with the bank’s target to deliver $6 billion in climate finance from

sem __ its own sources by 2020) and respond to increasing demand from DMCs for a growing range
of climate-related assistance. The CCOF2030 will help ADB underscore climate actions in the
bank’s strategies, operations, and business processes. It will also promote DMC access to climate technology, support
knowledge solutions and capacity development, and strengthen partnerships and networks throughout Asia and the
Pacific. Under the CCOF2030, ADB has further committed to reducing its portfolio-level greenhouse gas emissions
in line with efforts to limit global warming to 2°C.

increasing importance of these

issues was reflected in the bank’s
country partnership strategies and the
earmarking of concessional assistance
for disaster risk reduction under

the 11th replenishment of the Asian
Development Fund. ADB approved
funding for 20 new projects, 12 new
technical assistance projects, and 10
supplementary technical assistance
projects that directly reduced disaster
risk, integrated disaster resilience
measures, or supported disaster
response. It expanded its online tool
for project climate risk screening to
incorporate disaster risk in the present
day (including geophysical risk) and
developed related guidance materials.
ADB continued to promote financial
preparedness for disasters in its DMCs.
It approved $15 million in grants and
loans for the Pacific Disaster Resilience
Program, which will quickly disburse
contingent financing to Samoa, Tonga,
and Tuvalu in the event of a disaster.
The bank also approved $2 million

in regional technical assistance

to strengthen underlying disaster
resilience in the three countries.
During 2017, ADB provided immediate
humanitarian assistance grants from the
Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund to
Sri Lanka and Vanuatu. In September,
it initiated a review of its 2004 Disaster
and Emergency Assistance Policy to
identify further ways of strengthening
its support for both disaster risk
reduction and disaster response.

 

18 ADB AR 2017

Asian Development Outlook 2017: ADB released its flagship
economic publication in April 2017, with the regular half-yearly
update provided in September 2017. The April report assessed
developing Asia’s transition from a largely low-income region to
middle-income status. It identified innovation and productivity
as the key drivers in the region’s next step to high-income status.
The September update revised economic growth figures slightly
upward for developing Asia, mainly due to a rebound in global
trade. It also explored how the region’s growth momentum can be
maintained through public-private partnerships to deliver public

infrastructure and services.

LEVERAGING RESOURCES

In 2017, ADB mobilized $11.92 billion

in external funds from bilateral

and multilateral agencies, and

other financing partners, including
$5.95 billion in commercial cofinancing
to maximize the development impact
of its own operations. ADB established
five new trust funds that will unlock
capital for climate investments.
through innovative financial products,
increase private sector participation

in climate change mitigation and
adaptation projects, help cities prepare
high-priority urban infrastructure
investments, increase mobilization

of domestic resources, and integrate
high-level technology into infrastructure
project designs.

ADB and other multilateral
development banks are partnering with
commercial banks, project developers,
and other financiers to attract private
financing. In 2017, ADB’s private sector
operations mobilized about $5.95 billion
of external cofinancing, extending
ADB's nonsovereign investments of
$2.29 billion by a factor of 2.6. B loans
(where commercial banks lend

under ADB’s umbrella) and parallel
cofinancing contributed $2.13 billion to
total cofinancing, while ADB’s Trade
Finance Program generated $2.81 billion
and continued to help close financing
gaps and stimulate regional trade. ADB
also contributed to the first annual

 

joint report, released in April 2017, on
the mobilization of private finance by
multilateral development banks.

ADB continues to support publicprivate partnerships across Asia and the
Pacific, aiming to improve the efficiency
of public infrastructure by attracting
private investment in such projects.

The bank works to build the capacity

of key public sector agencies in DMCs,
strengthen institutional frameworks, and
support project preparation activities. It
also finances public-private partnerships
from its own resources. To help develop
bankable projects, ADB secured seven
new transaction advisory mandates in
2017, to advise on infrastructure projects
totaling approximately $1.26 billion.

It continues to draw on donor trust
funds, such as the Asia Pacific Project
Preparation Facility.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING

Knowledge work is an integral part of
ADB’s business. This has seen the bank
establish partnerships with think tanks,
universities, and research organizations,
helping extend ADB’s knowledge base
to ensure cutting-edge solutions to
development issues. For instance,

ADB collaborated with the Korea
Energy Agency to consider the latest
approaches to promoting demand-side
energy efficiency in South Asia. It also
partnered with the European Space
Agency to utilize information fromsatellites to assess the state of different
transport infrastructure in the region.
ADB generated 417 country-specific and
regional knowledge products to help
better design projects and programs

for its DMCs.

ADB launched three high-impact
publications in 2017. Meeting Asia’s
Infrastructure Needs estimated Asia

and the Pacific’s annual infrastructure
needs at $1.7 trillion per year until 2030.
A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions
of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific

put forward scenarios of the devastating
effects of climate change. The ADB
history book, Banking on the Future of
Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian
Development Bank, provided insights
and lessons on the region’s economic
development, the evolution of the
international development agenda, and
ADB’s operations over 50 years. Other
publications released in 2017 covered
financial interconnectedness, trade

in services, digital technology, trade
facilitation, and transport corridors.

Among other activities, ADB supported
the Legal Literacy for Women Project,
provided assistance to DMCs to meet
international anti-money laundering and
tax integrity standards, held a forum on

how to manage the investment of foreign

exchange reserves, and conducted
seminars on risk management for small
and medium-sized enterprise lending.

ADB also continued to expand its
knowledge-sharing activities and
to engage with regional and global

cooperation programs and policy forums.

At a conference marking 20 years since
the Asian financial crisis, ADB brought
together the region’s policy makers
and other stakeholders to discuss

lessons from the crisis and challenges
for regional financial integration and
policy cooperation. In November, ADB
organized a roundtable conference on
economic corridors, a forum on emerging
initiatives for regional cooperation

and integration, and a presentation

of the bank’s first corporate report on
regional cooperation and integration.
In June, the Asia Clean Energy Forum
drew more than 1,000 participants, and
in September, the Digital Strategies

for Development Summit attracted
280 participants.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS

ADB is preparing a new corporate
strategy, Strategy 2030, based on
extensive stakeholder consultations,
which started in late 2015. The strategy

will outline the key directions for
ADB's engagement with its DMCs and
describe how the bank should align
with the SDGs and the new global
climate agreement. In 2017, ADB invited
development experts, academics,

and representatives of civil society
organizations to a series of roundtable
discussions—held in Manila (in March),
Washington, DC (in April), Tokyo

(in May), and London (in July)—to
exchange views on the framework of
Strategy 2030. The bank also sought
views and opinions on the evolving
directions of the forthcoming strategy
during its annual meeting in Yokohama
in May, at the Board and Management
retreat in August, and at an informal
Board seminar in November. ADB will
conduct further consultations before
finalizing the strategy in 2018. Ml

Since gaining their independence in the
early 1990s, the countries of Central

and West Asia have made significant
economic progress. The region has been
able to exploit its substantial energy

and mineral resources, notably oil and
natural gas, while its location at the
crossroads of Europe and Asia has made
it an important node for international
trade flows. Evidence suggests, however,
that inequality has also risen throughout
Central and West Asia. Outdated
agriculture production systems, persistent
inflation, limited access to finance,
inadequate education, and poor health
all create obstacles to sustainable and
inclusive growth for the region’s people.

In 2017, the economies of Central and
West Asia benefited from an economic
recovery of their main trading partners,
increasing remittances, and broadly stable
oil prices. However, inflation accelerated
in most countries of the region.

After oil and natural gas prices recovered

(CAREC) Program. In 2017, the program

introduced its new long-term strategy,
CAREC 2030, which was endorsed

at the 16th Ministerial Conference in
Dushanbe in October. CAREC 2030
is anchored on a broader mission

to connect people, policies, and
projects for shared and sustainable
development, serving as the premier
economic and social cooperation
platform for Central and West Asia.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING

In 2017, ADB had one of its most
productive years in sharing vital
knowledge across Central and
West Asia.

The countries of the region are exposed
to significant climate-change risks,

and their carbon-intensive economies
require reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions. In March, ADB published
Economics of Climate Change Mitigation
in Central and West Asia. The report
assessed costs, benefits, and investment
opportunities for greenhouse gas
abatement in the energy and transport
sectors of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
Uzbekistan. It also noted the indirect
benefits to human health and energy
security arising from efforts to address
climate change.

In the Kyrgyz Republic, ADB published
a milestone report and held a regional

forum on postsecondary education. The
report discussed the challenges facing
postsecondary education in ADB’s
developing member countries, including

the need to increase access and equity,
and improve quality and relevance. At
the forum, delegates shared policies,
strategies, and operational models for
reforming postsecondary education

to meet the changing needs of labor
markets and support inclusive growth.

The spectacular economic performance
of the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
has propelled the country to upper
middle-income status and improved the
well-being and quality of life of its people.
However, accelerated growth has also led
to economic, social, environmental, and

Mongolia, meanwhile, has faced
long-standing development challenges,
including underdeveloped infrastructure,
lack of export diversification,
underemployment, desertification,

and air pollution. Alarmingly, the
country’s poverty rate rose from 21.6%

In 2017, however, both the PRC and
Mongolia posted steady economic
growth, driven by improved external
conditions and underpinned by efforts
to pursue sound macroeconomic
management.

The PRC’s economic growth averaged

ENVIRONMENTALLY
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

As part of its program on environmental
protection in the PRC, ADB strengthened
the sustainable development and
ecological protection of the Yangtze
River Economic Belt and improved
ecological security monitoring and
management.

In Qinghai province, a $150 million ADB
loan is financing a 50-megawatt solar
thermal power plant that will generate
217 gigawatt-hours of clean energy
annually, avoiding 194,849 metric tons of
CO2-equivalent. Under its coordinated
clean energy strategy, ADB has also
helped develop heat from biomass,
capitalizing on the PRC’s potential to
provide 830 million metric tons of waste
for biomass heating annually. In October,
the bank approved $5.5 million from the
Carbon Capture and Storage Fund to

demonstrate clean technology.

Under its program to improve air quality
in the Beijing—-Tianjin-Hebei region, ADB
approved a loan of $499.6 million that
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and pollution, avoiding at least 5 million
metric tons of CO2-equivalent per year,
20,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, 3,000 tons
of nitrogen oxide, and 3,000 tons of
PM2.5 emissions every year.

In Mongolia, degradation of the country’s
almost 27,000 square kilometers of
peatlands has led to substantial increases
in greenhouse gas emissions. Through

a $400,000 grant from the Japan Fund
for Poverty Reduction JFPR), ADB

has addressed this degradation and
improved water stability in the Hangai
mountains. In Khuvsgul Lake National
Park, ADB supported an ecotourism
project, with $3 million from the JFPR,
to protect the pristine lake and generate
local employment.

REGIONAL COOPERATION
AND INTEGRATION

ADB supports the PRC’s and Mongolia’s
participation in the Central Asia Regional

Economic Cooperation Program, the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and

other subregional platforms. ADB also
engaged in the Belt and Road Initiative
through work implemented under

the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation and GMS programs.

In the PRC, ADB began implementing
the first phase of a regional cooperation
and integration program, supporting
joint efforts by the PRC and Viet Nam to
develop cross-border economic zones
along the GMS North-South Economic
Corridor.

The bank also approved $180 million
to provide modern safety technologies
for the 386 km E’Mei-Miyi section of
the Chengdu-Kunming railway in the
PRC, a key part of a regional corridor
extending to countries in the GMS and
an important element of the Silk Road

In East Asia, developing sustainable infrastructure
focuses on creating clean, efficient, and smart
green cities and regions. Since 2010, ADBsupported infrastructure projects in East Asia
have provided clean drinking water for more than
2 million families, connected nearly 515,000
households to electricity, and constructed or
upgraded almost 17,000 kilometers of road. In
the People’s Republic of China (PRC), ADB’s
overarching objective is to reduce emissions

of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. In
Mongolia, the bank’s focus is to help tap the
great potential for renewable energy, address the
challenges of rapid urbanization, and support
economic diversification away from mining.

ADB’s energy investments in the PRC include

conservation, advanced technologies for emissions
capture and storage, and smart urban energy
systems. ADB’s flagship operations include deepwell geothermal heating in Shaanxi and concentrated
solar thermal power in Qinghai. In Mongolia, ADB is
supporting the development of renewable energy

in the western region, including the mobilization of
financing from the Climate Investment Funds.

ADB is also helping Mongolia exploit its vast
potential to export renewable energy under the
Asian Super Grid initiative.

In transport, in both the PRC and Mongolia, ADB is
focused on lowering emissions and energy consumption
via cleaner vehicles and fuels, more efficient public
transport systems, policies to encourage change

in travel mode and demand, and more efficient
multimodal logistics. ADB flagship operations include
urban transport projects in Guizhou, Shandong,
Ulaanbaatar, and Xinjiang; multimodal logistics

and rail facilities in Sichuan and Yunnan; and
crossborder freight facilities in Guangxi and

Zamyn Ud.

In urban development in the PRC, ADB is promoting
low-carbon cities, low-impact development, efficient
construction methods and technologies, improvements
in water supply, and cleaner waste and wastewater
treatment. ADB’s flagship operations include urban
development projects in Gansu and Wuzhou provinces,
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the PRC.
In Mongolia, ADB is supporting Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan,
and provincial capitals to improve standards of living,
especially through investments in heating, water,
sanitation, and pollution reduction.

 

In 2012, Mongolia was named on the Financial Action Task Force’s list of high-risk
jurisdictions, ane mostly to deficiencies in the country’s regime for anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.

With the prospect of harsh sanctions looming, addressing these deficiencies
became one of Mongolia’s most pressing developmental issues.

ADB quickly developed and successfully implemented an innovative $720,000
technical assistance package, with financing from Australia, Japan, and the United

States, to train authorities responsible for investigating and prosecuting offenses relating to money laundering and the

ao?

financing of terrorism. Utilizing a prominent team of specialists, ADB’s assistance improved the knowledge and skills
of 40 prosecutors, law enforcement agents, and judges in investigation techniques, criminal trends and typologies,

case preparation, and legal and evidentiary issues.

While Mongolia was able to exit the list of high-risk jurisdictions in 2014, ADB’s technical assistance continued
until 2017 and the bank intends to build on successful partnerships to further strengthen Mongolia’s anti-money

laundering and combating the financing of terrorism regime.

KEY MOMENTS

 

 

    

ADB's developing member countries
(DMCs) in the Pacific are generally
small, remote, and economically
fragile. They face many development
challenges that inhibit sustainable

and inclusive growth. Their small size
and geographic isolation increase the
costs of providing services and doing
business, while their high exposure to
climate change and natural disasters,
along with their generally narrow
economic foundations, make them
extremely vulnerable to external shocks.

Despite these difficulties, average
economic growth across the 14 Pacific
DMCs remained broadly stable at 2.2%
in 2017. This mainly reflects a slight
pickup in economic activity in Papua
New Guinea (PNG), the region’s largest
economy. Although serious fiscal
challenges remain in PNG, recoveries
in agricultural output and mining
production, following weather-related
disturbances to these industries,
propelled growth higher.

 

 

Fiji’s strong rebound from the impacts
of Cyclone Winston also contributed

to the steady pace of regional economic
expansion. Fiscal stimulus, including
from post-disaster reconstruction work,

growth in Vanuatu, which continues

to recover from the destruction

caused by Cyclone Pam in 2015. The
Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,
the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu

each recorded higher growth on the
back of ongoing construction of vital
infrastructure.

However, half of the Pacific DMCs
experienced weaker economic
performance. A continuing decline

in visitor arrivals resulted in a small
contraction of Palau’s economy. Weaker
fiscal stimulus held back economic
activity in Nauru, Solomon Islands, and
Timor-Leste. Although growth retreated
from previous highs in the Cook Islands
and Samoa, and likewise slowed in
Tonga, the performance of each of
these economies in 2017 remained
above long-term averages.

people of the Pacific.

ADB is working to improve health
outcomes in PNG, which ranked 154th
out of 188 countries in the United
Nations Development Programme's
2016 Human Development Index. In
2017, ADB continued its major project
to improve the delivery of primary
health-care services in rural PNG,

also approving additional cofinancing
from the Government of Australia.
The project delivered a total of eight
community health posts: three in Milne
Bay, three in Western Highlands, one in
Eastern Highlands, and one in Enga—
adding to the first two posts completed
in 2016. The availability of these new
health facilities cuts travel time for
prenatal care and delivery for expectant
mothers, helping to address PNG’s high
maternal and neonatal mortality rates.

grant of $1.5 million from the Clean
Energy Fund, to construct additional
classrooms, an information and
communication technology studio,
science laboratories, and a solarpowered system that will provide 75%
of the campus’ energy needs.

Across the Pacific, ADB continued

to finance roads, bridges, ports, and
airports to more climate-friendly and
disaster-resilient standards. The bank
helped Nauru access a $26.9 million
grant from the Green Climate Fund to
ensure that a new port—a critical lifeline
of the country—will withstand the
impacts of climate change. ADB also

 

signed its first project-level agreement
with the Green Climate Fund for a

financing for the timely funding of
disaster response, early recovery, and
reconstruction activities. The bank
also helped provide a climate finance

South Asia is one of the fastest-growing
regions in the world, and its rising
population of young people is expected
to provide a demographic dividend

in the coming decade. The challenge
for the region is not only to sustain
economic growth, but to ensure that
the benefits of growth are shared by
everyone. South Asia has an estimated
800 million people living on less than
$3.20 a day. To lift them out of poverty,
it is imperative for the region to create
more jobs, raise productivity, boost
growth in lagging areas, and address
economic vulnerabilities.

momentum in 2017 as the region’s gross
domestic product expanded by 6.6%.

India’s economy grew by 6.5% in fiscal
year 2017—slightly slower than the
prior year’s growth of 7.1%. Growth was
subdued for a variety of reasons. The
abrupt withdrawal from circulation of
high-value rupee notes late in 2016
caused cash shortages in the first

half of 2017. There was also transitory
disruption as businesses adjusted to the

ENVIRONMENTALLY
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

South Asia is predicted to lose nearly
2% of its gross domestic product by
2050 if no action is taken to mitigate
the impacts of climate change.
Pursuing growth that is environmentally
sustainable is a regional as well as global
priority.

In April, ADB committed $175 million
for a solar energy transmission project
in India, helping the country diversify its
power mix and provide energy security
for 311 million people. The project is

expected to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by about 7 million tons each
year. ADB approval of $120 million for
the third tranche of an ongoing railway
development program is similarly
expected to reduce 1.5 million metric
tons of CO2-equivalent per year.

In November, ADB signed a $200 million
loan to develop Sri Lanka’s first
100-megawatt wind park on Mannar
Island in Northern Province to increase
the share of renewable energy sources
in the country’s energy mix. As the
share of thermal power still accounts
for two-thirds of power generation

in 2016, there is an urgent need to
develop clean energy sources, reduce
losses in the system, and boost energy
efficiency. Diversification to renewable
energy sources will not only improve
the country’s energy security and the
environment but also expand access
to electricity.

REGIONAL COOPERATION
AND INTEGRATION

Regional cooperation in South Asia
made significant strides in 2017.

In April, finance ministers from SASEC

strategy for sustained and inclusive
growth across South Asia. As SASEC
Secretariat, ADB updated the program’s
Operational Plan, 2016-2025 to help
identify priority projects and mobilize
financing for SASEC Vision initiatives.

Throughout the year, ADB signed
seven SASEC projects worth a
combined $1.33 billion, ramping up
the program’s cumulative portfolio to
49 loan and grant projects since 2001,
with a total value of $10.72 billion and
ADB funding of about $6.2 billion.

In October, the bank helped establish
a SASEC working group that will

serve as the platform for negotiating
arrangements for cross-border trade of
power throughout South Asia.

 

ADB also supported economic corridors
n Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka, and
these are expected to facilitate trade
and investment across South Asia, and
integrate South Asian industries with
global production networks operating in
East Asia and Southeast Asia.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING

In 2017, ADB supported comprehensive
development plans for Tamil Nadu
and Odisha, and master planning for
Andhra Pradesh along the East Coast
Economic Corridor in India. Through
this knowledge work, ADB helped
identify priority projects in transport,
energy, and urban infrastructure. In
India, these projects are now linked

to lending operations in line with the
bank’s commitment to provide up to
$5 billion over the next 5 years to help
develop the East Coast Economic
Corridor. Similar support was provided
to economic corridors in Bangladesh
and Sri Lanka.

 

In October, ADB published a report
titled The Sri Lankan Economy: ChartingWomen engage in skills training to establish small businesses in India. ADB
has helped establish 4,200 self-help groups, with some women increasing
their monthly incomes sixfold.

SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE
IN SOUTH ASIA

In South Asia, ADB emphasizes infrastructure
sustainability by involving local communities,
minimizing environmental impacts, and
encouraging public-private partnerships to secure
ongoing operations.

Since 2010, ADB has helped build more than
2,000 kilometers of roads across the region; create
an international airport to handle 36.6 million
passengers and over 694,000 tons of cargo;

 

 

provide maternal and child care to 5.6 million people
(80% of them women) in poor communities; and
restore vital agricultural infrastructure and services
for about 1.1 million people affected by conflict.

In Bangladesh, ADB is helping streamline an
international trade corridor through the South
Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Dhaka-—
Northwest Corridor Road Project. The project will
improve connectivity and provide safer travel for
women, who regularly commute on foot or

by rickshaw and are vulnerable to road accidents.
In Sri Lanka, ADB prepared a comprehensive plan
for the Colombo-Trincomalee Economic Corridor,
which ensures sustainability by integrating industry,
infrastructure, logistics, and urbanization.

ADB is focused on providing uninterrupted
electricity to all South Asians, while promoting
low-carbon technologies, energy efficiency, and
off-grid power generation using renewable resources.
The bank is helping India deliver more clean energy
by linking mega solar parks to interstate grids.

To improve urban life, ADB is working to expand the
coverage, quality, and continuity of water supply and
other basic services across South Asia. In Nepal, the
Regional Urban Development Project aims to create
more livable and sustainable urban areas in the
country’s south.

Philippines prepare a strategic program
for climate resilience under the Climate
Investment Funds. For ADB, this
program identified flood control in

the Mindanao River Basin as a priority
investment.

In June, ADB and the World Bank
assisted the Government of Cambodia in
preparing an investment plan to address
the underlying causes of deforestation
and forest degradation. The plan
includes projects aimed at holistically
addressing illegal logging, forest law
enforcement, and rural poverty.

The bank also helped develop a water
accounting framework for Cambodia’s
five river basins, with specific

recommendations for water savings
and water management to be taken
forward in irrigation investments under
preparation.

ADB continued to support the
strengthening of environmental
safeguards and monitoring in Myanmar.
The bank helped develop national
environmental quality standards, as
well as technical energy information
administration guidelines for the
country’s mining sector.

REGIONAL COOPERATION
AND INTEGRATION

In 2017, ADB provided $902 million

in loans and grants for regional
cooperation and integration in
Southeast Asia. This was backed by
approved technical assistance projects
including cofinancing worth $6.2 million,
with $4.7 million from ADB.

The bank supported the development of
regional transport corridors, intercountry

solutions and low-carbon development. These
include metro rail systems in Viet Nam’s two
largest cities—Ha Noi and Ho Chi Minh City—

and bus rapid transit in Vientiane, the capital

of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

ADB is preparing new projects for cities in Thailand
and the Philippines, while exploring sustainable
urban transport in Cambodia and Myanmar.

The bank has recently supported rural
electrification across Southeast Asia, including
assistance to Indonesia that will expand energy
access in the country’s east, delivering new

25 years of cooperation, ADB helped
implement a midterm review of the
GMS Strategic Framework, 2012-2022
and formulate an action plan for

the medium-term directions of the
program. The bank also helped create
new strategies on GMS regional
tourism, agriculture value chains, and
food safety.

ADB continued to support dialogue
for a GMS agreement on cross-border
transport. GMS ministers agreed, as

a first step toward implementing the
agreement, to pilot road transport
permits that would allow approved
vehicles to travel freely across GMS
country borders. The ministers further

BOOSTING PRIVATE
PARTICIPATION IN
KEY PROJECTS

ADB continues to promote PPPs as
a means of bridging infrastructure
investment gaps, including through
the provision of transaction advisory
services under seven new mandates
secured in 2017 across Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Myanmar, Papua New
Guinea (PNG), the Philippines,

and Viet Nam.

In Bangladesh, the bank is advising the
PPP Authority on the upgrading of the
Dhaka Bypass Joydevpur-Bhulta-—
Madanpur). ADB also approved a

first tranche of $260 million to help
boost private sector participation in
Bangladesh’s infrastructure projects,

With public funding increasingly scarce, private enterprises are
stepping up their contributions to sustainable infrastructure to help
fill the substantial investment gap. This is especially so in the areas of

ADB’s support for private sector clean energy started with providing
conventional and concessional loans, but its financing modalities

are evolving. With its guarantee, ADB facilitated a corporate bond
issuance by Energy Absolute in Thailand, mobilizing local institutional
investors to renewable energy. ADB also assisted capital raising for
green investment by Gulf Energy and B.Grimm Power in Thailand by
acting as an anchor investor in initial public offerings.

ADB has also been proactive in promoting hybrid annuity contracts
for sustainable infrastructure. Under such contracts, a private
enterprise need only finance a small portion of construction costs,
but secures extended contracts for asset operation and maintenance.
This approach provides the private sector with greater long-term
certainty on investments, while encouraging some private financing of
infrastructure construction.

As new technologies and business models have proved viable, ADB
has invested more in projects that demonstrate innovations can work
at scale, and has rolled them out in countries with more challenging
business environments. While clean energy makes up the bulk of
ADB’s private sector activities in infrastructure, the bank also works
in many other sectors, notably transport, finance, and water and

particularly for renewable energy and
energy efficiency facilities.

In response to environmental degradation in the People’s Republic of China, ADB started
focusing its business development efforts in the country on environmental infrastructure.
After consultation with a range of stakeholders on how to support this goal, ADB began
helping state-owned enterprises access international capital markets to fund environmental
infrastructure.

One of the earliest projects in this area was a municipal waste-to-energy project with China

Everbright International. In 2009, the majority state-owned enterprise had limited access to international finance.
Following the successful implementation of a $100 million direct loan with $100 million in B loan syndication, ADB
supported China Everbright International to venture into waste-to-energy solutions using agricultural waste in 2012.

In 2017, ADB invested $10 million in equity to support China Everbright Group Limited (CEGL), the green energy
division of China Everbright International. As a cornerstone investor of the initial public offering, ADB helped build
investor confidence and demand.

With proceeds from the initial public offering of $385.6 billion, CEGL increased its agricultural waste treated to
6.6 million tons a year and its household waste treated to 1 million tons a year. CEGL now generates 5.9 terawatt
hours of electricity, reducing 300,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent per year.

In December, ADB approved a loan of $100 million to China Everbright International to build and operate wasteto-energy plants in Viet Nam. The project will help the Government of Viet Nam promote the use of environmentally
sustainable infrastructure, address the country’s growing waste management problems, and encourage private sector
investments in municipal infrastructure.

42 ADB AR 2017The Asia Pacific Project Preparation

Facility (AP3F), supported by Australia,
Canada, and Japan, and managed by

ADB, provides technical assistance for
project preparation and structuring,
capacity development and policy
reform, and project monitoring and
restructuring support. In 2017, AP3F
approved 11 applications for technical
assistance. In the Philippines, AP3F
will help conduct a prefeasibility study
for a solid waste management project.
In Samoa, it will help define project
parameters for outsourcing of certain
activities of the country’s power utility.
AP3F has also recently expanded the
scope of its assistance by introducing
the Infrastructure Referee Program.
The program aims to provide impartial
opinions to help public and private
parties resolve project-related
disagreements that may arise over the
life of a PPP project.

 

 

In 2017, ADB launched the first edition
of the PPP Monitor, which tracks the
development of the PPP business
environment as well as the challenges
of undertaking PPPs across Asia

and the Pacific. The PPP Monitor
aims to increase the level and quality
of private sector participation in
infrastructure projects by serving

as an active platform for dialogue
between the public sector and private
enterprises.

FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO
PROMOTE INCLUSIVENESS

Of ADB’s private sector approvals
totaling $3.2 billion in 2017, over

$1.1 billion was dedicated to supporting
climate-friendly investments and
$1.1 billion was for projects that

will enhance regional cooperation
and integration. ADB made 10
investments in the private sectors of
low-income or lower middle-income
countries and 5 investments to
develop inclusive business.

 

ADB supports the development of a vibrant private sector, covering a wide range of operations from
cutting-edge infrastructure to helping local businesses gain access to credit.

SUPPORTING AGRICULTURE

In May, ADB signed a loan of $58 million
with Jiangsu Lihua Animal Husbandry
Stock Company to promote inclusive and
sustainable livestock farming in the PRC.
The loan will help the company develop
new contract farming arrangements

with 1,100 farmers, who will have the
opportunity to double their annual
income.

In August, the bank approved a

loan of $50 million and an equity
investment of $30 million with Kingfarm
Agricultural Services Co., Ltd. to support
environmentally sustainable agriculture
in the PRC. The investment will establish
300 crop production centers to help

3 million smallholder farmers optimize
fertilizer use to reduce costs and promote
climate-smart farming practices.

In October, ADB approved a loan of
$100 million to Olam International
Limited to help integrate 80,000
smallholder farmers in Indonesia,

PNG, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam

into global supply chains. The project
includes technical assistance to help
20,000 coffee farmers meet international
certification standards. ADB mobilized a
parallel loan of $75 million from the Japan
International Cooperation Agency for
this project.

 

In December, the bank signed a loan

of $20 million to Agripacific Holdings

Through its Trade Finance Program,
ADB helps close market gaps for trade

finance—estimated in 2017 to be

$1.5 trillion globally—by providing banks
with guarantees and loans in support

of cross-border trade finance. In 2017,

 

 

the program facilitated about 3,500
transactions valued at $4.5 billion, with
over $2.8 billion cofinanced by banks,
private insurers, and official agencies. Of
the total transactions, 2,822 supported
SMEs and 853 supported trade between
DMCs. Among the 22 countries covered
by the Trade Finance Program, the

most active were Bangladesh, Pakistan,
Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam.

In 2017, ADB continued to implement
its Supply Chain Finance Program.

The program complements the Trade
Finance Program by assuming corporate
risk and supporting both domestic and
cross-border trade. In 2017, the program
supported 372 transactions valued at
over $236 million, with 50% cofinanced
by partner financial institutions. In 2017,
out of 372 transactions, 286 supported
SMEs.

institutions across DMCs. It expands
access to finance for businesses and
people at the bottom of the commercial
pyramid. The program partners with
local and international banks to share
the risk of loan defaults. Since 2010, it
has supported more than $638 million
in loans to more than 3.5 million

poor borrowers (more than 90% of
whom are women), with cofinancing
of over $336 million. In 2017, the
program started focusing on smaller
microfinance institutions, providing
technical assistance to strengthen
their operations and improve their
responsible financing practices.

In December, ADB approved a

$100 million expansion of this program,
which also accredited Maybank as a
new regional partner in 2017.

SUPPORTING SUSTAINABLE
GROWTH

In 2017, the Government of Canada
and ADB established the Canadian
Climate Fund for the Private Sector

in Asia Il (CFPS II, capitalized with
$151 million. CFPS II will provide
cofinancing for ADB private sector
projects focused on climate change
mitigation and adaptation. It will also
target climate projects that promote
the empowerment of women and girls.

 

With an equity investment of

$58 million, aided by a $20 million loan
from CFPS under the Clean Energy
Financing Partnership Facility, ADB
anchored the initial public offering

of B.Grimm Power Public Company
Limited, which raised $336 million.
The bank also approved a $235 millioninfrastructure investment gaps.

loan to the company. Through both
investments, ADB is supporting

the construction and operation of
distributed and utility-scale solar, wind,
hydro, and other renewable energy
projects in Cambodia, Indonesia, the

Lao People’s Democratic Republic,

Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand,
and Viet Nam.

In Bangladesh, ADB approved a

$583 million investment in liquefied
natural gas and power to alleviate

the chronic scarcity of electricity in

the country. The project finances the
construction of a 745-megawatt (MW)
combined-cycle gas-fired power plant
and a liquefied natural gas terminal to
supply gas to the power plant. The use
of highly efficient natural gas technology
will help reduce 1 million metric tons of
COz2-equivalent per year in Bangladesh.

In Thailand, ADB invested $66 million,
and mobilized $22 million in equity from
Leading Asia’s Private Infrastructure
Fund, to support the initial public
offering of a leading private power
producer Gulf Energy Development
Public Company Limited, which raised

 

 

$730 million. ADB also approved a
loan of $33.6 million to Chana Green
Company Limited, which will help
finance the construction of a 25 MW
biomass waste-to-energy plant.

In Viet Nam, ADB approved its first
private sector renewable energy
project, sponsored by China Everbright
International. The project will cover

a portfolio of waste-to-energy plants
in cities across the Mekong Delta

and northern Viet Nam. These plants
will collectively treat 7,500 tons of
municipal solid waste daily.

In the PRC, where poor air quality

is estimated to contribute to about
imillion deaths each year, ADB
approved a $400 million loan, including
a $200 million complementary loan,
to help improve air quality in urban
areas across the country. The project
will finance the purchase or leasing of
green buses and other green vehicles,
including batteries, as well as the
installation of charging stations. In the
infrastructure sector, ADB approved
a $100 million loan to China Water
Affairs Group Limited and Gold Tact

Environmental Investment (Shenzen)
Limited. Both companies will help
expand access to clean water and better
manage wastewater in the country’s
second- and third-tier cities. ADB also
approved a loan of $50 million to Arctic
Green Energy Corporation and a loan of
$200 million to Sinopec Green Energy
Geothermal Development Company
Limited, both of which will support the
development of geothermal district
heating in 20 municipalities. This is
ADB’s first private sector geothermal
district energy project. Similar to the
waste-to-energy project in Viet Nam,
the water management project and the
district heating project in the PRC use

a “portfolio approach” by bundling a
series of projects in multiple cities which
are too small and time-consuming to
finance on a stand-alone basis.

In Samoa, ADB approved a loan of

$3 million, including a concessional

$1 million loan from the CFPS, to Jarcon
Proprietary Limited and Sun Pacific
Energy Limited to expand the country’s
existing 2.2 MW of solar capacity to
4MW.

 

In Sri Lanka, ADB approved a loan

of $4 million to Walkers Colombo
Shipyard (Private) Limited to improve
the local marine industry by providing
resources to maintain and repair small
to medium-sized fishing vessels and
small merchant ships.

In Armenia, ADB approved a loan of
$80 million to Electric Networks of
Armenia to strengthen the country’s
energy grid by reducing transmission
and distribution losses, as well as
establish additional residential and
commercial power connections. The
project will reduce almost 11,500 metric

sheet roughly tripled
the bank’s risk-bearing capacity and
enabled a significant increase in its
lending capacity. To support this new
position, ADB approved a revised
capital adequacy framework
in March 2017 to establish both
institutional risk appetite and the capital
requirements for the larger balance
sheet and expanded operations, which
includes concessional lending. The
new framework specifies the capital
requirement for credit risk, since ADB’s
largest risk exposure is to its loan
portfolio, as well as for risk associated
with equity investments, operations,
interest rates, counterparties, currencies,
and pensions. The framework will enable
ADB to retain its AAA credit rating and
increase its lending operations during
crises without relying on callable capital.
It will also enable the bank to deploy
capital more efficiently, in line with the
Group of Twenty (G20) initiative on
balance sheet optimization. To adapt
to changes in circumstances, ADB will
review the capital adequacy framework
every 3 years.

ADB approved a new procurement
policy in April 2017. The policy marks
a transition from a “one size fits al

approach to a “fit for purpose” approach.

It will help achieve value for money by
improving the quality of procurement
decisions, reducing overall procurement
time, permitting the use of customized
procurement methods, and supporting
high-level technologies. Greater ability
to apply the procurement arrangements
of lead development partners will
facilitate cofinancing opportunities,
resulting in lower transaction costs for
developing member countries (DMCs).

46 ADB AR 2017

Building on earlier reforms, ADB began
implementing measures to enhance
the speed, quality, and relevance of

its technical assistance in March 2017.
Through these changes, ADB expects
to streamline its overall number of
technical assistance projects, respond
more quickly to client needs, make
technical assistance more relevant to
country operations, tailor assistance

to broader development programs and
strategies, and provide faster approvals.
The bank will also be able to design
knowledge products and services

that better reflect DMC demand,

and apply past learnings to build
knowledge partnerships that maximize
development outcomes.

The review of ADB’s Public
Communications Policy continued
in 2017. ADB’s Public Communications
Policy guides the bank’s efforts to

be transparent and accountable in

its operations. The policy governs

the disclosure of information to, and
communications with, all stakeholders.
It aims to build public trust and
expand the ability of the public to
engage with ADB. It also establishes
ADB’s disclosure requirements and

its strategy for communicating its
work. The review is assessing how the
bank’s communications can be further
improved and aligned with global best
practice. ADB has held discussions on
anew policy with government officials,
civil society organizations, private sector
groups, and donors in 16 countries and
the European region. The ADB Board
of Directors is expected to consider a
revised policy in late 2018.

ENSURING ADB’S
EFFECTIVENESS

Managing for Results

ADB uses a corporate results
framework with an annual performance
scorecard to measure and manage its
performance. The framework tracks

development progress across Asia

and the Pacific, ADB’s contributions

to country outcomes, and the

bank’s operational and institutional
effectiveness. Every year, ADB publishes
the scorecard in its annual Development

Effectiveness Review (DEfR).

ADB is using a transitional results
framework for 2017-2020, while awaiting
the completion of the bank’s new long
term strategy, Strategy 2030.

The 2017 DEfR showed that ADB’s
operational refinements are working,
but further efforts are required to reach
the ambitious 2020 targets. While
gender equality targets were surpassed,
the success rates of completed ADB
operations were below 2014-2016
levels. The procurement readiness of
operations increased, exceeding the
020 target of 40%. Likewise, the support
for climate change mitigation and/or
adaptation was above the 2020 targets
with record climate change financing.
However, performance on some other
strategic alignment indicators, such as
health and education financing and
support for social protection, was below
levels required to achieve the 2020
targets. The 2017 DEfR also identified
challenges relating to longer project and
procurement processing times. ADB is
working to address these issues.

Partnering for Development

ADB recognizes that partnerships are
vital for scaling up project financing, and
for sharing development knowledge and
expertise. ADB’s Office of Cofinancing
Operations works to enhance the
development impact of the bank and

its multilateral partners by strategically
combining financial resources. During
the year, the bank established five

new trust funds: (i) the Asia Pacific
Climate Finance Fund to support the
development and implementation of
financial risk management products,

(ii) the Canadian Climate Fund for the
Private Sector in Asia II to increaseprivate sector participation in climate
change mitigation and adaptation
projects, (iii) the Cities Development
Initiative in Asia to help prepare highpriority urban infrastructure projects
and link these to financing, (iv) the
Domestic Resource Mobilization
Fund to help meet the Sustainable
Development Goals in Asia and the
Pacific by mobilizing greater domestic
resources, and (v) the High-Level
Technology Fund to scale up highlevel technology and innovative
solutions in ADB project design and
implementation.

ADB also extended framework
arrangements for German development
cooperation through KfW and the
Islamic Development Bank to expand
existing cofinancing operations and
continue promoting coordinated
development in Asia and the Pacific.

ADB signed an accreditation master
agreement with the Green Climate
Fund to create greater investment
value for climate change mitigation and
adaptation projects.

ADB refined its information systems
in 2017 to deliver more complete and
relevant information to development
partners, resulting in better alignment
on development strategies and project
management.

Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial
Management

The Operations Services and Financial
Management Department (OSFMD)
provided advice and direction on ADB’s
new procurement policy, aimed at
achieving value for money and greater
flexibility in responding to the needs of
DMCs. Under the decentralized system
recommended, more procurement
specialists were outposted to resident
missions or regional departments to
help improve procurement quality

and efficiency. Implementation of the
procurement policy is making progress,
with 265 bank staff accredited for

OSFMD helped enhance portfolio
analytics and reports to support project
implementation. It produced fiduciary
reviews to help strengthen project
design and financial sustainability. It also
provided support to strengthen country
financial management systems in nine
DMCs. OSFMD also oversaw training
of 461 bank and executing agency

staff for better procurement, financial
management, project implementation,
and performance management.

ADB’s Safeguards Implementation

In 2017, in accordance with its Safeguard
Policy Statement, ADB assessed all
projects for environment and social
impacts, and incorporated appropriate
mitigation measures as required.
Training on safeguards was delivered

to strengthen capacity and safeguards
staff were deployed to resident

missions to enhance the supervision of
safeguards implementation. Additional
measures were undertaken to improve in
safeguards planning and implementation,
such as enhanced due diligence and
reporting. ADB continued its efforts to
strengthen country safeguards systems,
including institutional capacity and

laws, regulations, rules, and procedures
for safeguarding the environment and
affected peoples.

The bank approved a technical
assistance project to support DMCs that
aspire to use country safeguard systems
instead of following ADB requirements.

The governments of India, Indonesia,
and Sri Lanka formally requested to use
country safeguard systems, and ADB
initiated necessary assessments and
consultations to assess these requests.

 

Issue Resolution
The ADB Accountability Mechanism

is an independent forum for people
adversely affected by ADB-assisted
projects to voice complaints and seek
solutions to their problems. The Office
of the Special Project Facilitator handles
problem solving, and the Compliance
Review Panel (CRP) handles operational
policy compliance. The mechanism

is designed to contribute to ADB’s
development effectiveness and improve
project quality.

During 2017, the Accountability

Mechanism received 12 complaints:

seven from South Asia and five from
Central and West Asia. The details
and status of each complaint are
available on ADB’s website. The

CRP monitored remedial actions for
complaints in Armenia, Cambodia,
India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.
It also prepared completion reports
for complaints relating to projects in
Georgia and Samoa. The CRP held
workshops in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh,
Georgia, and the Philippines to develop
guidebooks on compliance review.

 

 

Disclosure and Transparency

In 2017, 5,471 documents and reports—
including project, institutional, and
evaluation documents—were uploaded
to ADB’s website. The bank received

staff, and improved its disclosure
management system, to ensure that
the communications policy is properly
followed.

Human Resources Management

In 2017, ADB posted 554 job

vacancies, which generated about
43,692 applications from nationals

of 64 of ADB’s 67 member countries,
highlighting the strong demand to work
at ADB. ADB’s secondment program
hosted 39 secondees, and the internship
hosted 34 graduate students. Through
enhanced and streamlined recruitment
processes, ADB employed 313 new staff
in 2017, one of its highest annual intakes.
ADB shifted from strict headcount
management to flexible position
management and headcount ceilings,
enabling advance recruitment and filling
of positions.

ADB continued to implement actions
and aim for targets to improve gender
balance and inclusion in the workplace,
with an emphasis on recruiting women
and retaining women already on staff.
The Experts Pool program continued
to acquire up-to-date expertise in
specialized priority areas.

ADB introduced the policy framework
for rotations and short-term
assignments to broaden employees’
skills and help them further their
careers. The bank also strengthened the
performance review process through the
introduction of 360-degree employee
feedback for managers and a more
proactive approach to managing poor
performance. ADB also increased

the retirement age for new staff, and
introduced a new Defined Contribution
Plan for the Staff Retirement Plan.

Learning and Development

ADB’s learning and development
programs focus on personal awareness
and adaptability as well as necessary
professional and technical skills.

ADB has an active leadership program.
In 2017, 109 team leaders attended

a flagship program to develop the
leadership and management skills to
encourage high performance from

their teams. Over 500 managers and
staff participated in unconscious bias
awareness training, which aims to

raise awareness about unconscious

bias at work and provide practical

tools to mitigate it and support
objective decision-making. In addition,
ADB delivered over 92 learning and
development programs, which benefited
1,965 staff (1,541 from ADB headquarters
in Manila and 424 from field offices), and
representatives from DMCs.

Through collaboration between various
ADB offices and departments, the
bank offered 23 e-learning courses in
2017, with about 3,500 participants
coming from academia, governments,
nongovernment organizations, the
private sector, and international
organizations.

Recognizing the need to familiarize
all operations staff (sovereign and
nonsovereign) with principles

and concepts for public-private

partnerships, and their application in
project design, ADB delivered courses

on using private sector finance for
infrastructure projects in water supply

and transport.

Administrative Expenses

Net internal administrative expenses
totaled $586.2 million in 2017, a 91%
utilization rate against the $647 million
budget. The $60.8 million budget savings
largely resulted from the impact of staff
vacancies on salaries, benefits, and

work programs. In addition, favorable
foreign exchange movements, better
contract negotiations, continuous

efficiency efforts, and extended
implementation timelines in some large
capital expenditure projects lowered
administrative expenses.

The net internal administrative
expenses budget for 2018 is

$672.3 million, a 3.9% increase on the
2017 budget. The 2018 budget will
support ADB’s commitment to meet
the strong demand from its developing
member countries, and ongoing
investments in information technology
(IT) reforms and organizational
resilience. The 2018 budget will also
enhance financial sustainability of the
staff retirement plan. The 2018 annual
capital budget of $10.8 million will
fund recurring capital expenditures for
headquarters and field office facilities,
and technology and automation
systems. The Board also approved
special capital budgets of $10 million
for improving and expanding office
facilities of the resident missions, and
$12.4 million for security, and upgrades
of emergency and fire management
systems for ADB headquarters.

Information Technology

ADB continued to deliver on its IT
reforms. The rollout of Microsoft’s
Office 365—a cloud-based software
that allows the use of office applications
across different operating systems—is
helping drive greater collaboration,
productivity, and efficiency across the
organization. ADB conducted over 300
IT training sessions in 2017 to reskill
and retool staff, who are now equipped
with mobile communications tools that
allow them to work from anywhere

at anytime. The bank also adopted
cloud-based procurement and human
resources systems in 2017, and these
have streamlined internal business
processes, and delivered operational
transparency. ADB created an active
disaster recovery site in Geneva,
Switzerland, to increase the resilience of
its critical financial systems.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE

 

 

The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) is the think tank of ADB, providing intellectual insights and
support for policymakers in the bank’s developing member countries (DMCs). It does so by conducting
research on medium- to long-term development issues and providing capacity building and training (CBT)
to help improve agencies and organizations engaged in development work within DMCs.

In 2017, ADBI’s administration strengthened the institute’s finances by securing contributions from the
People’s Republic of China for the first time, while attracting significantly increased contributions from the
Republic of Korea. The institute also received a commitment from Indonesia’s Minister of Finance for new

financing.

Through its research unit, ADBI released 8 books and about 170 working papers in 2017. These covered
infrastructure financing, finance and innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises, trade issues,
financial literacy, and food insecurity in Asia, and ways for DMCs to avoid the middle-income challenge.

ADBI delivered a record 51 CBT events in 2017, with increased emphasis on DMCs in Central Asia and
the Pacific. Priority themes included poverty reduction, infrastructure financing, and regional cooperation.
ADBI also began CBT on sanitation (supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) and transport
infrastructure (supported by Japan’s Institute of Transportation Economics). In May, ADBI hosted the

 

successful Global Think Tank Summit 2017 in Yokohama, Japan.

 

departments and offices to monitor,
mitigate, and manage specific risks
associated with their operations.

In 2017, ADB paid particular attention to
implementing the merger of the lending
operations of the Asian Development

Fund with the bank's ordinary

capital resources. While this merger
has enabled ADB to direct greater

resources to borrowing countries,

it has the potential to increase the
bank’s exposure to risk. Accordingly,
during the year, ADB completed a
comprehensive review of the prudential
risk management policies that anchor its
AAA credit rating.

ADB continued to devote substantial
resources to managing its credit, market,
and operational risks. It also provided
technical assistance to regional financial
institutions to expand their knowledge
and capabilities in risk management.

Treasury

The Treasury Department mobilizes
and manages ADB’s financial resources

and ensures the timely settlement of
payments with its stakeholders.

In 2017, ADB raised a record $28.5 billion
in medium- and long-term borrowings
at cost-efficient levels and ina
diversified manner. Funding was sourced
in 15 different currencies; maturities
ranged from 1 year to 20 years; and
issue sizes were from $3 million to

$4 billion. The bank issued thematic
bonds, including health and gender
bonds, in response to demand for
socially responsible investments. ADB
also issued Rp1.0 trillion ($74 million)
in offshore Indonesian rupiah-linked
bonds. This was the first issuance by a
multilateral development bank where
Indonesia is a shareholder and the first
issuance by a multilateral development
bank in Indonesian rupiah to support
local currency lending. ADB issued

its first local-currency green bond by
issuing Rss.0 billion ($78 million) in
offshore Indian rupee-linked bonds.
The bank also completed its first
onshore cross-currency swaps in the

People’s Republic of China and its first

central bank cross-currency repurchase
facility in Kazakhstan.

Audit

Through independent and objective
audit and advisory services, the Office
of the Auditor General (OAG) provides
assurance that the internal controls for
managing risks and achieving ADB’s
development objectives are operating
effectively.

In 2017, OAG issued 16 audit reports,
covering sovereign and nonsovereign
operations, risk management, treasury,
IT, finance, and administration. It also
completed seven advisory engagements
on financial and operational controls of
business units.

In April, OAG embraced social media
to introduce AuditWithoutWalls!,

Youth Summit and a strategic planning
session for the Philippine Association

of Government Internal Auditors Board
of Trustees, with both events held in

Manila, Philippines.
Legal Services

The Office of the General Counsel
(OGC) provides advice and assistance
on legal matters relating to the
organization, administration, finance,
policies, and operations of ADB.

Under ADB’s Law and Policy Reform
program, OGC designs and implements
technical assistance projects for DMCs
in areas relating to legal and judicial
reforms and capacity building for
judiciaries and regulatory agencies. At
the end of 2017, OGC had a portfolio of
16 active technical assistance projects,
totaling $14.1 million.

The Law and Policy Reform program
covers environmental issues and climate
change, capital markets and finance,
corporate governance, and reforms

that stimulate investment and promote
gender equality.

In 2017, OGC helped several Pacific
island countries adopt international

50 ADB AR 2017

arbitration as a means of commercial
dispute resolution, assisted Pakistan

in establishing the first court in Asia to
specialize on gender-based violence,
and provided specialized training
programs for more than 350 judges and
300 legal professionals in areas of law
relating to the environment, climate
change, arbitration, and gender equality.

Integrity and Anticorruption
Activities

ADB's Office of Anticorruption and
Integrity (OAI) helps ensure that

all ADB funds are utilized for their
intended purposes. It conducts
investigations; integrity due diligence;
project procurement-related reviews;
and outreach activities such as training,
workshops, e-bulletins, and online
courses.

In 2017, 52 entities were debarred for
violating ADB’s Anticorruption Policy.
Enforcement of the policy acts asa
deterrent to others.

OAI completed five reviews
related to project procurement,
which strengthened controls and
enhanced transparency in project
implementation.

ADB strengthened its internal controls
on employment by issuing Integrity Due
Diligence Guidelines for Employment

Screenings. These guidelines ensure

 

that adequate and systematic controls
are in place to identify and address
potential integrity, money laundering,
and reputational risk in recruiting
prospective ADB staff.

OAI also conducted 119 seminars and
workshops for over 3,900 participants,
as ADB continued to increase the
anticorruption knowledge and
awareness of its stakeholders.

OA\| also fosters a respectful working
environment within ADB. The
Respectful Workplace Unit began
operations in 2017, with a mandate to
ensure a workplace free of inappropriate
behavior, misconduct, harassment, and
bullying. The unit provided training

and awareness programs on ADB’s
revised Code of Conduct. The bank also
aunched a mandatory e-learning course
on anticorruption, integrity, and respect
for staff.

Administrative Services

n March, ADB implemented the
Program Management Plan to achieve
organizational resilience by optimizing
its key resources: people, workplace,

T, key business processes, and supply
chain. Projects under the Program
Management Plan execute the action
plans as part of ADB’s organizational
resilience framework and strengthen
ADB’s capability to respond to
disruptive events or changes. The bank
also moved to strengthen its crisis
management and emergency-response
capabilities, as well as continuing its
efforts to bolster disaster preparedness.

 

For resident missions, ADB increased

its administrative support to provide
appropriate premises and amenities.
Eight resident missions have been
approved to either relocate, expand, or
improve their office facilities in response
to expanding roles in their respective
DMCs.

In July, ADB launched its institutional
procurement system (e-procurement),
which streamlined and automated

the organization’s entire procure-to-pay process. This is expected to
generate annual savings of $900,000
from improved procurement planning,
reduced transactional costs, and
enhanced supplier communications.

In November, to achieve carbon
neutrality, ADB offset unavoidable
carbon emissions (12,000 metric tons of
CO2-equivalent) from its headquarters
in Manila by purchasing carbon credits.
ADB plans to include its field offices

in its efforts to conserve resources and
reduce the bank’s carbon footprint.

Enhancing Mutual Understanding

The Office of the Ombudsperson is a
neutral, independent, and confidential
resource available to all staff to resolve
workplace concerns in an informal way.
It offers confidential consultations

and coaching to resolve a broad range
of workplace issues. It mediates staff
disputes and facilitates group meetings,
difficult conversations, and strategic
discussions.

The ombudsperson helped to educate
on issues of workplace bullying and
harassment, and raise awareness of
the resources available to ADB staff
to address any related concerns.

The ombudsperson also facilitated
several group meetings, both at ADB
headquarters in Manila and in field
offices across Asia and the Pacific, to
enhance mutual understanding within
the bank’s teams.

 

INDEPENDENT EVALUATION

The Independent Evaluation Department (IED) helps strengthen
ADB by assessing the effectiveness of the bank’s policies, strategies,
and operations.

In 2017, IED resumed its work to boost the knowledge of the ADB
Board of Directors, Management, and operational staff on what works
and what does not in the projects and initiatives financed by the
bank. It did this through sector evaluations, strengthening the quality
assurance of project and country evaluations and validations, and
through a new series of syntheses and working papers.

IED completed the country program evaluation for India

and validations of country partnership strategy final reviews

for Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Philippines, and
Turkmenistan to inform country partnership strategies and
operational plans. Taking on board lessons learned from country
partnership strategies, the department also provided inputs and
directions on the role and effectiveness of ADB’s country programs.

 

Using knowledge garnered from its evaluations, IED helped guide
the formulation of the bank’s forthcoming long-term strategy,
Strategy 2030. IED stressed the need to focus on the quality of
growth to improve lives and generate more desirable outcomes
through a continued and intensified focus on social and geographical
inclusion, environmental sustainability, and regional cooperation
and integration.

At the corporate level, IED contributed to the strategic and
operational directions of ADB with evaluations on results-based
lending and the role of credit-enhancement products. IED also
conducted an evaluation on gender and development, providing
evidence for ADB to continue its efforts toward bridging gender gaps
across Asia and the Pacific.

In June, IED hosted an international event in Bangkok, Thailand,
presenting innovative solutions to rapid urbanization in middleincome countries of Asia and the Pacific. In September, together with
the Asia Pacific Finance and Development Institute, IED hosted the
2017 Asian Evaluation Week in the People’s Republic of China. The
event helped inform country officials and development practitioners
on the role of evaluation in policy-making processes.

 

In 2017, IED changed the department’s structure to strengthen the
role of evaluation knowledge in ADB, and better align the department
to the changing needs of its clients. As a result, IED is now organized
into a thematic and country division, and a sector and project
division. Two support groups were created: for communications and
outreach, and for knowledge and evaluation capacity development.

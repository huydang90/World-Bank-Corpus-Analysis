ANNUAL REPORTThe Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank, an international partnership of 47 member countries, is
engaged in promoting the economic and social progress of its developing member countries
in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by the governments of 32 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 15 countries from Europe and North America.

In 19 years of operations, the Bank has become a major catalyst in promoting the development of the most populous and fastest growing region in the worid today. The Bank’s principal
functions are (i} to make loans and equity investments for the economic and social advancement of developing member countries; (ii) to provide technical assistance for the preparation
and execution of development projects and programs and advisory services; (iil) to promote
investment of public and private capital for development purposes; and (iv) to respond to requests for assistance in coordinating development policies and plans of member countries.
In its operations, the Bank is also required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller
or less developed countries and give priority to regional, subregional and national projects and
programs which will contribute to the harmonious economic growth of the region as a whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary capital resources, comprising
subscribed capital, reserves and funds raised through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising contributions made by member countries and amounts previously set aside from the
paid-in capital. Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account, for 68 per cent of Bank
lending, are generally made to member countries which have attained a somewhat higher level
of economic development. Loans from the Asian Development Fund are made on highly concessional terms and almost exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries,

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations from the capital markets of Europe,
Japan, the Middle East and the United States. The Bank’s callab!e capital, which at the end
of 1985 accounted for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed capital, backs its borrowings in the
capital markets.

The Bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of economic development, with particular
emphasis on agriculture, rural development, energy and social infrastructure. Most Bank financing is designed to support specific projects. In certain cases, the Bank also provides program,
sector and multiproject loans.

The Bank actively pursues co-financing activities with official as well as commercial and
export credit sources. The Bank has also entered into equity investment operations.

The Bank’s highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors which meets annually.
The direction of the Bank’s general operations is the responsibility of the Board of Directors
— composed of 12 Directors {each with an Alternate) — eight representing regional countries
and four representing non-regional countries. The Board of Governors conducts an election
for the Board of Directors every two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of Governors for a term of five years,
after which he may be re-elected. The President fs Chairman of the Board of Directors and under
its direction he conducts the business of the Bank. In this he is assisted by the Vice-Presidents,
who are appointed by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the President.

The Bank has 21 departments and offices — including a Resident Office in Dhaka,
Bangladesh, and a South Pacific Regional Office in Port Vila, Vanuatu — dealing with various
operational, financial, administrative and general support functions.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Office of the President
20 March 1986

Dear Mr. Chairman:

In accordance with Article 39 of the
Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank and Section 13 of its By-Laws, |
submit to the Board of Governors the enclosed Annual Report of the Bank for 1985, including a separate report on the activities of
the Special Funds of the Bank, which has
been prepared under the direction of the
Board of Directors. The Annual Report aiso
includes the financial statements prescribed
in Section 15 of the By-Laws.

Sincerely yours,

faem dpe

MASAO FUJIOKA
President and
Chairman of the
Board of Directors

Chairman of the
Board of Governors
Asian Development BankTHE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS

 

THE Board of Governors, in which ail the powers of the Bank
are vested, has delegated these powers to the Board of Directors except for those which are specifically reserved to itself
under the Bank’s Charter. Responsibility for direction of the
Bank’s general operations thus rests with the Board of Direotors which performs its duties on a full-time basis at the
Bank's Headquarters. The Board meets in formal session
under the chairmanship of the President of the Bank about
once a week on average and meets informaily as often as
necessary.

The Board of Governors elected a new Board of Directors
at the Bank’s Annual Meeting in Bangkok, it took office for
two years on j July 1985. A list of the twelve Directors and
their Alternates foliows this Chapter, while Appendix 4 to this
Annual! Report provides more details on Board membership
and voting groups.

in February 1985, the Board of Governors approved the admission of Spain to membership in the Bank. At Spain’s request, the Board of Directors extended the deadline for completing the necessary membership formalities. Membership
became effective in February 1986.

In November 1985, a formal membership application was
received from the People’s Republic of China. A report and
draft resolution on the matter was submitted to the Board
of Governors, which approved in February 1986 the admission of the People’s Republic of China to membership in the
Bank. Membership became effective in March 1986.

The Bank's policies are established by the Board of Directors within the general framework of the Bank’s Charter.
Periodic review by the Board ensures that the poticies remain
responsive to the needs of the Bank’s developing member

countries (DMCs) and appropriate to a changing international.

scene. Accordingly, the Board agreed in 1985 to change the
system for setting the lending rate on the Bank’s ordinary
capital loans. Such loans have so far carried interest rates
fixed at the time of commitment for their entire life. Under
the new system, which comes into effect in July 1986, the
lending rate on new ordinary capital joans will be adjusted
every six months and will be determined by adding a spread
to the average cost of a pooi of Bank borrowings. The decision to move to anew system, which is similar to that already
adopted by the World Bank (IBRD), is an important step in
adapting the Bank’s financial structure to uncertain conditions in international financial markets and in ensuring the

Bank's effectiveness as a development institution in the
years ahead. Sesides protecting the Bank’s net income
against fluctuations in interest rates, the new system will
provide a high degree of borrowing flexibility that coufd result
in fower overall borrowing costs and, consequently, lower
lending rates over time.

Also in 1985, the Board undertook a thorough review of the
Bank’s assistance to the private sector. In order to promote
the efficient use of resources in the Bank’s developing
member countries and to accelerate their economic development, it decided that the Bank should Increase and broaden
its assistance to the private sector in Its DMCs. The Bank’s
support will encompass private enterprises, public enterprises which may be privatized, as well as the key financiai
institutions necessary to sustain an active and expanding
private sector. It is expected that the Bank’s future assistance
wilt rely mainly on the fuller application of existing policies.
However, the Board also decided that the Bank should begin
a modest program of lending to private enterprises without
requiring guarantees from the respective DMC governments,
More information about these developments is contained in
a special chapter in this Annual Report which is presented
in view of the increased attention which the rofe of private
enterprise has been receiving in the region.

The. Board decided that the Bank should provide
assistance to its DMCs in support of their efforts to integrate
women more effectively in the development process. It
recognizes that the social and cuttural factors which influence the role and needs of women vary substantially
among countries. Consequently, the scope and thrust of the
Bank’s activities will be designed to suit individual DMCs
and their development objectives and priorities. The Bank
will incorporate consideration of the role and needs of
women into its norma! jending and technical assistance
operations.

The existing policy framework on sector lending was examined against the experience of recent years and it was
found to be generally sound and sufficiently flexibie.
However, the Board concluded that the effectiveness of sector Jending would be enhanced by such means as more intensive policy dialogue and greater emphasis on institution
building through technicat assistance.

In reviewing the Bank’s technical assistance operations,
the Board considered that technical assistance had playedan important role in assisting the DMCs enhance their
development capability and in facilitating the transfer and
effective use of Bank and other financial resources.
Nonetheless, the Board believed that certain adjustments
should be made to the Bank's technical assistance operations in fight of the DMCs’ future requiraments and that ways
should be explored to achieve greater predictability and
reguiarity of funding technical assistance grants.

The Board approved 164 proposals for loans, technical
assistance grants and equity operations in 1985. In line with
past practice, it examined each proposed loan on the basis
of a Project Appraisal Report and other documentation
prepared by Bank staff. It paid particular attention to such
aspects as the economic and financial viability of the projact, its suitability in terms of the Bank’s operational strategy
in the DMC concerned, project benefits and justification,
lessons learned from past and ongoing projects, environmental considerations, projéct risks and measures to overcome
them including specific assurances from the borrower. The
proposed financing arrangements, including in certain cases
co-financing by other multilateral and bilateral donors, were
also considered.

The Board approved borrowings totalling the equivalent
of $792 million in 1985, including the Bank's offering of yendenominated bonds in New York, which marked the first
public bond Issue denominated In a foreign national currency
in that market. In view of the reduction In the cost of the
Bank's borrowings, it was decided to lower the fixed lending
rate on new ordinary capital loans to 9.65 per cent from 10.25
per cent per annum, effective i July 1985. This rate Is expected to apply until the new variable lending rate system
comes tnto operation on 1 July 1986.

The Board considered further a number of requests from
individual member countries for special increases in their
capital subscriptions. it agreed on certain arrangements for

processing these requests and to recommend to the Board ,

of Governors the approval of speclal increases in the capital
subscriptions of flve non-regional member countries, namely,
Fintand, France, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland,

The Board monitored the amount of resources available
for new loan commitments under the Asian Development
Fund (ADF). This reflected some concern early in the year
about the adverse impact of exchange rate movements,
coupled with arrears in ADF payments by the United States
and the consequent reduced release of resources by some
other donor countries. These negative factors were partly offset by the voluntary release by ten donor countries of the
full amounis of the third tranches of their ADF IV contributions. With ADF IV intended to finance the Bank's concessional lending program until the end of 1986, the Board began
to examine the need for a further ADF replenishment. It took
careful note that, at the two subsequent meetings of ADF
donor couniries about a fourth ADF Repienishment {ADF V),
several policy matters were discussed. These related mainly to the financing of technical assistance, the importance
of maintaining high project quality and of developing suitable
strategies for Bank lending to its DMCs, the Bank's
assistance to the private sector and the terms of ADF lending.

in other activities, the Board received regular reports on
project administration and technical assistance implementation, and decided that greater attention should be paid to
these critical aspects of the Bank’s operations. Changes in
the Bank's investment portfolio were monitored, The Board

also considered various administrative matters, including
staff salaries and benefits. lt reviewed developments in the
construction of a new Headquarters building for the Bank
in Manila.

Meeting informaily, the Board exchanged views on a range
of policy and other issues — for example, requests from
member countries for special increases in their capital
subscriptions, and the Bank's lending rate methodology —
prior to their formal consideration. Other informal meetings
covered such matters as the Bank’s personnel policies and
the work of the Bank’s Economics Office.

Short visits were again made by small groups of Directors
to some of the Bank’s DMCs. These visits enable Directors
to get a first hand impression of the Bank's operations and
to hold policy discussions with Ministers, senior officials and
private business people. Visits were made to the Republic
of Korea and the Philippines, as weil as to Fiji, Vanuatu {including the Bank’s South Pacific Regional Office} and
Western Samoa.

Membership of the Board’s three standing committees
changed during the year, with the President of the Bank appointing five Directors/Atternates to serve on each of the committees for the two-year Ilfe of the new Board. Membersh!p
of the committees Is contained In Appendix 5 to this Annual
Report.

The Audit Committee examined the Bank’s financial
statements and the scope of the outside audit, considered
various internai audit matters, and reviewed the work of the
Post-Evaluation Office, Including 14 Project Performance
Audit Reports. As to the latter, the Committee made a number
of suggestions for follow-up by staff and stressed that
lessons learned in previous projects should be fully taken
Into account in designing new projects. In accordance with
its terms of reference, the Committee also advised the Board
on the appointment of Outside Auditors for 1986 and its
recommendation was adopted by the Board,

The Budget Review Committee examined in detail the expenditure proposals for the 1986 Administrative Budget. The
review was made in the context of Bank activities planned
for 1986 as presented in a memorandum submitted by the
President and it took into account the mid-year review of the
1885 Administrative Budget. The Committee also considered
several studies and reports requested by the previous Committee on issues related to the efficiency of Bank operations
and expenditure savings. The Committee submitted its
Report and findings to the Board which approved them
together with the 1986 Administrative Budget.

The Committee on Administrative Matters Retating to
Members of the Board undertook a broad range of activities
in 4885, including a consolidation of the various provisions
for travel expenses of Directors and Alternates and an examination of ways and means of improving communications
between Board members and their capitals. The Committee
also kept under review aspects of the Headquarters Agreement as It affected Board administrative matters.

Last, but by no means least, the Board wishes to place
on record its deep appreciation for the invaluable contribution to the Bank made by Mr. A.T. Bambawale. He retired in
October 1985 after some 7% years as Vice-President (Operations), having previously served as Alternate Executive Director for India for about 5 years ending October 1976. On the
tecommendation of the President, the Board appointed
Mr. M. Narasimham of India to succeed Mr, Bambawale,THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Spain and the People's Republic of China joined the Bank in February and March 1886, raspectlvely, bringing the number of member countries to 47.THE BANK
IN 1985

 

DURING 1985, the Bank's lending commitments amounted
to $1,908 million, which was 14.6 per cent below the 1984
figure of $2,234 million.

This decline reflected generally slower world economic
growth as weil as domestic resource constraints and
measures taken in many of the Bank’s developing member
countries (DMCs) in response to external economic
developments.

With the notable exception of Pakistan, the level of new
Bank loan commitments was lower in all traditional major
borrowers. No new Bank joans were approved for the
Philippines,

The decline in loan commitments was more marked in ordinary capital resources (OCR} where the total of
$1,271 million represented a drop of 18 percent from
$1,551 million in 1984. Loans from the Asian Development
Fund {ADF} fell 6.8 per cent to $637 million from $684 million
a year eartier.

In its third year of equity operations, the Bank approved
three lines of equity totalling $3.25 miltion to financial institutions in Fiji, Indonesia and Thailand, and an equity investment of $0.4 million in an industrial enterprise in Indonesia.

Technical assistance grants approved during 1985

amounted to the equivalent of $792 million. The Bank made
an offering of yen-denominated bonds in New York, marking the first public bond issue denominated in @ foreign na- tional currency in that market. It aiso undertook its first
floating-rate borrowings in two of its issues in the Swiss
capital market.

financing from commercial sources fell to $305 million from
$432 million in 1984, while their share of the total rose to 48
per cent from 37 per cent.

Although tending to agriculture and agro-Industry declined
in 1985 both in volume (to $569 million from $758 million a
year earller} and as a percentage of overall Bank lending {to
28 per cent from 34 per cent), this sector remalns the most
important to the Bank and Its DMCs In view of the pivotal
role that agriculture plays In economic and social
development.

Lending for social Infrastructure — water supply and
sanitation, urban development and housing, education, and
health and population — rose sharply to $544 million in 1985
from $240 million a year earlier and accounted for 28 per cent
of overall lending compared with 11 per cent in 1984. This
increase was due to the approval in 1985 of some relatively
args projects which could not be processed fully in 1984.

Bank assistance to the energy sector declined very steeply,
amounting to $245 million (13 per cent of total approvals)
compared with $767 million (34 per cent of total approvals)
in 1984. This was due to a siackening in economic growth
and a need to resolve certain policy issues with some 9xecuting agencies. During the year, the Bank initiated a review
of investment needs in the power subsector over the period
1986-90.

In other sectors, Bank fendlng for transport and communications was stightly lower at $310 million (16 per cent
of the total) compared with $381 million {17 per cent) a year
earlier, while lending for Industry and non-fuel minerals,
despite a decline in direct tending for Industry, increased to
$243 million (13 per cent) in 1985 from $54 million (2 per cent)
in 1984, This was due to higher lending to development
finance institutions (DFis) which remain the Bank's main
‘channel of assistance to the private sector. Two credit line
projects approved in 1985 were structured along the lines of
“umbrella” credits which were successfully introduced In
1983, The Bank also established operational relationships
with two commercial banks during the year.

Technical assistance (grant and loan financed) for the

preparation of projects, for advisory and project implementation activities and for reglonal activities, increased to $181
ralliion for 142 projects during 1985 from $145 million for 143
projects in 1984. By end 1985, project preparatory technical
assistance amounting to $218 million had so far resulted in
296 Bank loan projects amounting to nearly $8 billion and
involving an estimated total Investment cost of about $20
billlon.

Loan disbursements slightly exceeded $1 billion for the
second consecutive year. Disbursements under ADF loans
increased 31 per cent to $390 mitlion, mainly due to higher

? Includes regional actidisbursements to Bangladesh, Burma and Nepal and to a
continued high. level of disbursements to Pakistan.
Disbursements under ordinary ioans, however, fell about 12
per cent to $620 million, reflecting a slowdown in contracts
awarded and new procedural requirements in some DMCs,
the economic situation in the Philippines and a gradual
deceleration of project activities in the Republic of Korea and
Malaysia.

During 1985, the net transfer of resources by the Bank to
its DMCs (i.e., loan disbursements less repayments of principal, interest and other charges) amounted to $421.3 miltion
compared with $502.8 million in 1984.

Project implementation in 1986 was held back in many
countries by acute shortages of local counterpart funds as
well as several other problems inciuding delays in procurement of goods and consultants’ services, changes in scope
and components of projects and difficulties in recruiting
qualified project staff. During the year, however, the Bank
took steps to improve further its project administration practices and procedures by establishing project administration
units within two Projects Departments on an experimental
basis, revising its project administration reporting system,
utilizing microcomputer-based project monitoring tools and
fielding missions for discussions with borrowers and executing agencies. Moreover, several publications designed
to assist executing agencies were also being prepared.

In order to promote wider interest in international competitive bidding for Bank-financed projects, symposia on
business opportunities generated by these projects were held
in several countries.

During the year, 36 projects were completed, bringing the
total number of projects completed to 302 out of 704
approved by the end of the year.

On the resources side, the Bank’s authorized capital stock
amounted to about $46.2 billion (SDR14.8 billion) on
31 December 1985. As of the same date, a total of 737,877
shares, representing about 98 per cent of the total share en

The Bank made ten public bond Issues in 1985 amounting
to the equivalent of $792 million in the capital markets of
Japan, Federal Republic of Germany, Netherlands,
Switzerland and United States. The average maturity,
weighted by amount, was 12.72 years and the average fife
of outstanding borrowings at the end of the year was virtually
unchanged at 8.32 years. The average cosi, weighted by
amount and average life of each borrowing, was 7.36 per cent
per annum.

The period over which the third Asian Development Fund
replenishment {ADF IV}is intended to finance the Bank’s concessional lending program ends in 1986. Accordingly, the
Bank commenced discussions in 1985 with ADF donor countries on a fourth ADF replenishment (ADF V) to finance the
concessional lending program over the four-year period
1987-90. At meetings in Rome and Tokyo, donors seaffirmed
their strong support for ADF as a vehicle for concessional
lending to the Bank's poorer member countries. They exchanged views:on various policy matters, the possible
amount of ADF V, burden-sharing and other replenishment
issues. They also decided that a further donors’ meeting be
held in Vancouver, Canada, in February 1986.

OUTLOOK

The world economy grew only moderately in 1985 and in
several countries, including some in Asia, there was Ilttle or
no growth. The slowdown in world economic growth, In turn,
had its impact on the level of international trade. This was
teflected in the weakening of export markets and downward
pressure on prices of export commodities of developing
countries. in the industrialized countries subdued economic
activity and continuing high levels of unemployment aggravated protectionist pressures. International currency
movemenis continued to be volatile and the cost of internatlonal borrowings on commercial terms remained high in real
terms,

The Bank’s DMCs have been adversely affected by these
global trends. The weakening of the external accounts of
those countries dependent on traditional product exports as
well as the newly industrializing countries has affected the
course of their domestic economies. The decline in commodity prices has resulted in a deterioration of the fiscal situation of several countries in the region. This has forced them
to take measures to restrain the growth in budgetary expenditure, including some cutbacks in real terms in investment,
as well as to adopt restrictive monetary policies in order to

curb inflationary pressures. In many DMCs there has consequenily been a reduction in the growth of national output
and some have experienced negative growth. The fiscal difficulties have aiso complicated the local funding of projects,
even where foreign exchange costs have been met by externai capital. Consequently, absorptive capacity has become
a constraint on lending by multilateral institutions. The lower
lending level of the Bank in 1985 reflected these
developments.

The outlook for 1986 for the global economy suggests, in
broad terms, a continuation of the trends in 1985. If the expected modest improvement in the world economy is to have
@ beneficial impact on the Bank’s DMCs, it would need to
be translated into an expansion of international! trading opportunities. The recent decline in oil prices will ease the
pressure on the balance of payments of oil importing DMCs,
but constrain investment and growth in oil exporting DMCs.

Even for the former, the favorable impact of lower oil prices_

could be offset by lower exports and invisible receipts, such
as workers’ remittances, if the international purchasing
power of oil surplus countries were to deteriorate further.

At the same time, the adjustment efforts in the fiscal and
monetary spheres which are already being made by the
DMCs, the deceleration of inflation and the willingness to
adopt measures of policy reform in the direction of greater

flexibility in the pricing of goods and services can be expected to improve the climate for investment and growth.
This should lead to an expansion of Bank lending commitments and increased disbursements of funds from ongoing loans. Bank lending will also be directed towards ensuring fuller and more efficient use by the OMCs of existing productive capacity. In this regard, the Bank’s lending policies,
procedures and modalities will be kept under close review
to ensure the most economic and efficient use of its
resources. :

In addition to a resumption of growth in its lending commitments, the Bank’s operational program for 986 will continue to emphasize improved project administration, and the
provision of advice and assistance to DMCs to help accelerate the structural and other economic changes needed to support more rapid development. Policy dialogue with
BMCs will thus lay emphasis on the importance of economic
efficiency through the adoption of appropriate pricing
policies and the encouragement of greater competition both
within the economy and in respect of the externa! sector.

While an improvement in the global economy is essential,
ihe resumption of investment and growth by the DMCs wil!
depend no less on the efforts of the countries themselves
to undertake structural adjustment in the context of growth.
For its part, the Bank stands ready to assist in these efforts.; oe be " i eee

DEVELOPMENTS

 

DURING 1985, mest of the Bank’s developing member countries (DMCs) faced economic difficulties. They experienced
a Gecline in economic growth rates, deterioration in their
terms of trade, rising debt-service ratios, large trade deficits,
and a stagnation in external resource inflows. However, the

- Majority of DMCs achieved moderate growth in per capita
income, relative stabitity in domestic prices and further
liberalization of trade. The DMCs made efforts to improve
efficiency and productivity by continuing deregulation and
privatization of economic activities.

The international Setting

The economic: performance of developing countries in
1985, including that of the DMCs, was adversely affected by
sluggish economic growth in industrial countries, depressed
prices of commodity exports and a sharp decline in the
growth of world trade. The value of world trade declined in
1986 compared with a 6 per cent increase in 1984. On the
brighter side, the inflation rate further decreased, interest
tates continued to fall and world output of cereals incteased.

The aggregate gross national product (GNP) of the
industrial countries grew by 2.8 per cent in 1985 compared
with 4.9 per cent in 1984. The average increase in consumer
prices declined to 4.2 per cent from 4.7 per cent in 1984 white
the aggregate current account deficit rose to $52 billion from
$35 billion in 1984. Unemployment continued to be a major
concem in most industrial countries. The protectionist
measures in many of these countries were maintained or
reinforced during the year.

The combined gross domestic product (GDP) of oilexporting countries! increased by 0.3 per cent in 1985 compared with 1.8 per cent in 1984, reflecting a decline in the
volume and the prices of their oil exports. The average rate
of inflation in these countries rose to 10.7 per cent from 10.1
per cent in 1984. Their combined current account deficit rose
to $5.7 billion in 1985 from $3.5 billion in 1984.

The average GDP growth rate of non-oil developing countries declined to 4.5 per cent in 1985 from 5.3 per cent in 1984.
inflation continued to be a major problem. The average in

Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

crease in consumer prices of this group rose to 50 per cent
from 47 per cent in 1984. This was mainly due to the high
inflation rates experienced by several developing countries
in Latin America. Low demand for the exports of non-oil
developing countries and a deterioration in their terms of
trade put continued strain on their external payments. Their
current account deficit rose to $44 billion, from $39 billion
in 1984.

Economic Developments in DMCs

The average GDP growth rate of 16 DMCs in 1985 declined
to 3.6 per cent from 6.6 per cent in 1984, and the average of
6 per cent achieved during the preceding decade.’ A sharp
deceleration in the GDP growth rates of the newly industrializing countries (NICs}* and the resource-rich middle-income
Southeast Asian DMCs largely accounted for the lower
growth in 1985.

" The DMCs generally faced unfavorable developments in
their external trade during 1985, characterized by lower
growth in exports, weak external demand, a decline in their
terms of trade and large trade deficits. Many DMCs tried to
maintain supplies of essential imports, even though it meant

drawing down limited foreign exchange reserves. Some |

DMCs had to curtail their imports to the detriment of their
economic development goals.

Lower prices of oil and other commodities, including
foodgrains, and higher levels of food production hetped to
restrain inflationary pressures. Most DMCs were able to
reduce or contain their inflation rates at the moderate levels
of 1983-1984. The average inflation rate remained at a single
digit level for the third consecutive year.

GDP Growth

in GDP growth rates in 1985. After two consecutive years of

high rates of economic growth, the GDP growth rates of the
NiGs fell sharply. The growth rate in Hong Kong fell to 0.8
per cent from 9.3 per cant, in the Republic of Korea to 5.2
per cent from 7.9 per cent, in Singapore to-1.8 per cent from
8.2 per cent, and In Taipei, China to 4.1 per cent from 9.8 per
cent. A steep reduction in the growth of exports to industrial
countries was the principat cause of the jower growth rates
in these countries.

in 1985, the Southeast Asian DMCs also generally experienced declines in their GDP growth rates. Indonesia’s
GDP growth rate fell to 2.9 per cent from 5.8 per cent in 1984.
Lower export receipts from oil, reduced growth of non-oil exports and the tower growth of agricultural output accounted
for the slowdown. Malaysia’s GDP growth rate declined to
2.8 per cent from 7.6 per cent in 1984 mainly due to a lower
level of domestic investment, weaker external demand for
its commodity exports, and a cutback in crude-ol! production. The GDP of the Philippines declined for the second consecutive year, although the fall of 3.7 per cent in 1985 was
below the 4.5 per cent decrease in the preceding year.
Agricultural output increased by 1.3 per cent but manufacturing production fell by 8 per cent. Thailand’s GOP growth
rate in 1985 was 4 per cent compared with 6.2 per cent in
1984. The slowdown was largely due to a slump in commodity
prices and government austerity measures.

In South Asia, india and Pakistan Improved their GDP
growth rates In 1985 to 4.5 per cent from 3.7 per cant in 1984
and to 8.2 per cent from 4.3 per cent, respectively. Continued
good harvests and industrial revival resulting from liberaliza
tion measures introduced by the Government contributed to
India's improved economic performance. in Pakistan, the improvement was mainly due to the impressive recovery in
agricultural production. The GDP growth rates in Burma and
Sri Lanka in 1985 were at about their 1984 levels of 6.6 per
cent and 5 per cent, respectively. The economic performance
of Sri Lanka was adversely affected by declining prices of
tea and other primary exports. The GDP growth rates of
Bangladesh and Nepat in 1985 declined to 3.1 per cent from
4.3 per cent in 1984 and to 2.8 per cent from 7.4 per cent,
respectively. The economic slowdown in Bangladesh was
due fo damage to crops caused by cyclones and extensive
flooding. The {ower growth rate in Nepal reflected marginal
improvement of rice output over the very high production
achieved in 1984.

The economic performance of the South Pacific DMCs in
1985 was generally adversely affected by low and declining
world prices of their export commodities. The GDP growth
rate of Papua New Guinea was 3 per cent in 1985 compared
with 2.2 per cent in 1984, Fiji was hit by cyciones in early
1985 which damaged sugar crops and infrastructure. Its GDP
declined by 1.7 per cent In 1985 compared with a 9.4 per cenit
increase In 1984.

Sectoral Performance

Agricultural performance in the DMCs in 1985 was generally satisfactory. For the third consecutive year, the productlon of foodgrains grew steadily, which helped meet the rising demand in the producing countries. The foodgrain export

ing DMCs, however, faced low prices. The production of cash
crops such as rubber, sugarcane, copra, jute and tea was
generaily higher, but this was more than offset by a substantial fail in their prices,

The production of foodgrains — rice, wheat and maize —
increased by 0.5 per cent to a record level of 320 million tons
in 1985.1 However, the rate of increase was significantly
lower than the rate of 9.3 per cent in 1984. Rice production
in the DMCs rose by 0.5 per cent to 233 million tons. Bumper
harvests were reported in Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. Rice
production declined in Bangladesh, India, Republic of Korea
and Taipei, China because of unfavorable weather conditions. The production of wheat, the second major foodgrain
in the DMGs, declined by 1.4 per cent to 60,5 million tons,
mainly as a result of a decrease in production in india which
more than offset the increases in Bangladesh, Nepal and
Pakistan. The production of maize increased by 5.8 per cent
to 26.3 million tons. Among the large producers, output rose
in India, Philippines and Thailand but fell in indonesia.

In 1985, despite the fact that DMCs remained net importers
of foodgrains, their net imports declined due to high domestic
production. Thailand registered a substantial increase in
foodgrain exports, while indonesia and Bangladesh recorded large reductions in foodgrain imports and India did not
import any foodgrains. In India and Indonesia, the rising
stocks of foodgrains led to serious storage problems.

Among the major commercial crops of the region, the

overall Output of coconut, palm oil, jute and tea increased’

significantly while that of rubber and cotton remained at
about the level of 1984, The 8 per cent increase in coconut
output was largely due to the recovery in the Philippines,
where output grew by 30 per cent. The 7.8 per cent growth

 

1 Output estimates for individual crops in this chapter are for the calendar year,
while GDP estimaies are for the fiscal year, which differs from the calendar
year in Several DMCs {see footnote to Table 1).

in palm oil output was shared by all the producers. Rubber
production increased in India, Indonesia, Thailand and most
other DMC producers, but this was largely. offset by the
decline in Malaysia, the largest producer. Sugar production
was higher in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Viet Nam, but
this was more than offset by the decfine in Bangladesh, Fiji
and Philippines, leading to a 1 per cent fall in overalt output.

Growth of industrial production was adversely affected in
many DMCs by a variety of factors.

“Among the NICs, Singapore experienced a fail in manufacturing output. Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and Taipei,
China had sharp declines in the growth rate of manufacturing output. Weak domestic demand and growing protectionism in principai export markets accounted for the adverse
developments.

in Indonesia, manufacturing and construction activities
continued to be constrained by tow demand and faced considerable excess capacity. In Malaysia, the growth of
manufacturing output slowed down to 6.5 per cent because
of weak external demand. tn the Philippines, manufacturing
production declined by 8 per cent because of domestic and
external financial restraints and sharp cutbacks in government and private investment. In Thailand, industrial production slowed down due to austerity measures, credit restraints
and flagging domestic and external demand.

The South Asian DMCs are relatively less export-oriented
and thus their manufacturing activities were less affected
by the slowing world economy. Manufacturing output in
Bangladesh grew by 3.8 per cent, the same rate as in 1984.
in Burma, manufacturing production increased by 14.2 per
cent because of sustained domestic demand and the more
liberal import of raw materials and other inputs. In India,
manufacturing output increased by 5.2 per cent mainly due
to the greater availability of power, transport and raw
materials, and new incentives for the private sector, The
manufacturing sector in Pakistan recorded an 8.1 per cent
increase as a result of a sharp recovery in agricultural pro
1314

duction and domestic demand. In Sri Lanka, indusirial output grew by 7 per cent compared with 15.6 per cent in 1984,
due to lower growth in the availability of raw materials and
inputs.

in the energy sector in the DMCs, electricity generation
has increased steadily to meet the expanding power requirements of agricultural and industrial production and the
increasing demand of households resulting from higher incomes and growing urbanization. However, because of low
growth In Industrial activity in many countries, electricity
generation in 1985 increased by only 4 per cent compared
with 10.3 per cent in 1984. The growth rate was particularly
slow in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and some South Pacific
DMCs. Electricity generation declined in the Philippines.

The total output of crude oii in DMCs increased to 123.2
million tons in 1986 from 118.7 million tons in 1984 (see
Table 2). Burma, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand experienced an Increase in output which was partly offset by
a decline in Malaysia, Philippines and Taipei, China. Natural
gas production was, however, higher in practically ali DMCs
which are endowed with this natural resource,

Preliminary data suggest that the aggregate vaiue of Imports of oll (crude oif and petroleum products} by DMCs
declined io $32.6 billion in 1985 from $36.1 billion in 1984.
The dectine in 1985 of 9.9 per cent, compared with the decline
of 6.4 per cent in 1984, was due to the softening of world
prices of oll and the slower pace of economic activity experienced by many countrles. Apart from Indonesia and
Malaysta, which are net oll exporters, crude oll and petroleum
products account for substantial portions of the imports of
most DMCs. In the case of Singapore, a major though declinIng part of its off imports was for re-export after refining. The
burden of oll Imports was heaviest for those DMCs which
have a relatively narrow export base whilie their dependence
on energy imports remains high. The cost of petroleum !mports during 1985 ranged from 30 per cent to 58 per cent of
export earnings in a number of DMCs including Bangladesh,
Fijl, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

Price Trends

The weighted average rate of inflation in DMCs fell to 6.2
per cent in 1985 from 7.6 per cent in 1984 (see Table 3). The
major factors which contributed to this decline included
lower prices of foodgrains, raw materials and imported oil,
stable prices of manufactured imports, and stabilization
measures adopted by the DMCs.

The inflation rate among the NiCs ranged from-0, 2% percent
in Taipei, China to 3.2 per cent in Hong Kong. Among
Southeast Asian DMCs, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand
had inflation rates of 4.4 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 2.4 per
cent, respectively. In the Philippines, the consumer price Index increased by 20.7 per cent which was far befow the Inflation’ rate of 49 per cent experienced in 1984. The stabilization policy in the Philippines reduced the consumer price increase to a single digit level by the end of 1988.

The South Asian DMCs also mostly recorded single digit

inflation rates, Sri Lanka was able to reduce its inflation rate”

to 1.5 per cent in 1985 from 18.6 per cent in 1984. Apart from
Bangladesh, whose inflation rate was 11.8 per cent compared
with 9.9 per cent in 1984, changes in the consumer price Index in the other South Asian DMCs ranged between 4 per
cent and 7.1 per cent.

In most of the South Pacific DMCs, inflation rates in 1985
were below the level in 1984. In Fiji, Papua New Guinea and
Vanuatu, consumer prices increased by 4.4 per cent, 2.8 per

External Sector Developments

The aggregate trade deficit of the DMCs increased to
$4.9 billion in 1985 from $4 billion in 1984 (see Table 4). Apart
from Indonesia, Malaysia and Taipei, China, which had large
trade suspiuses, the trade deficit of the DMCs decreased ito
$20.7 billion in 1985 from $22 billion in 1984.

Among the NICs, the trade deficit of Republic of Korea and
Singapore narrowed while Hong Kong had a trade surplus.
Taipei, China further Increased its high trade surplus. Of the
Southeast Asian DMCs, both Indonesia and Malaysia had
lower trade surpluses, while both the Philippines and
Thailand reduced their trade deficits. Most DMCs in South
Asia had larger trade deficits than in 1984, as did most South
Pacific DMCs.

The aggregate value of exports of the DMCs decreased to
$175 billion in 1985 from $180 bitiion In 1984. This represented
a decline of 2.8 per cent In 1985 compared to an Increase
of 15.3 per cent in 1984. This reflected a decline in both the
growth in volume and prices of the major export commodities. Manufactured exports also registered slower
growth in 1985 than in 1984, mainly due to lower economic
growth rates and trade barriers in industrial countries, which
remain the principal importers of manufactured goods from
DMCs.The decline in commodity prices was. sharpest at.42 per
cent for copra and 41 per cent for tea. Palm oil prices declined
by 28 per cent, sugar by 27 per cent, cotton by 23 per cent,
and maize by 7 per cent. Prices in 1985 were a fraction of
their peak levels in 1880-1981. The producers of these crops
suffered large income losses. in general, the growth in export volumes faited to compensate for the decline in prices,
while in some cases both price and volume were reduced,
leading to a worsening of the trade balance of DMCs which
: depend targely on the export of primary commodities.

Most of the DMCs are heavily dependent on imports of
machinery and equipment, minerals (inciuding oil) and raw
materials, and intermediate products for the maintenance
of their production capacities and implementation of their
development programs. Their imports were constrained during 1985 by lower growth in export earnings, increasing debt
service obligations and stagnant inflow of externat resources.
The shortage of essential tmports affected the economic
development of many DMCs.

The aggregate imports of the DMCs decreased by 2.3 per
cent to $180 billion in 1985 compared with $184 billion in 1984.
The decline was mainly accounted for by lower imports by
Singapore and Taipei, China among NICs and by Malaysia,
Philippines and Thailand among the Southeast Asian coun
tries. The reduced imports of these countries were partly due

toa slackening in industrial production and partly due to efforts by governments to curtail imports to keep external debt
within manageabie levels.

changes. The share of the DMCs and oil-exporting countries
in the total export of DMCs decreased, while that of industrial
countries and East European countries increased. in the case
ot imports of DMCs, the significant changes were a drop in
the share of oil-exporting countries and a rise in the share
of non-oil developing countries.

Within the industrial countries, the relative share of Japan
in both exports and imports of DMCs remained unchanged
at about 17 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. The share
of the United States in the imports of DMCs remained unchanged at 15 per cent, while that in the exports of DMCs
rose to 25 per cent in 1984 from 23 per cent in 1983. A significant change was the rise in the share of Canada in the exports of DMCs to 4.5 per cent in 1984 from 1.4 per cent in 1983.

A major factor contributing to the generally increased trade
deficits or reduced trade surpluses of DMCs in 1985 was a
deterioration in their terms of trade. While the export unit
value indices of DMCs generally fell, the import unit value
indices generally increased. The terms of trade indices in
4985 were, therefore, below those in 1984 in the case of six
of the nine DMCs for which data are available. The declines
were from the already depressed levels of 1984 in the case
of Burma, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand which are major
exporters of primary commodities. For Sri Lanka and Taipei,
China, the terms of trade declined from the favorabie levels
of 1984. The terms of trade improved substantially in the case
of Bangladesh and Hong Kong and remained steady in the
case of the Republic of Korea.

1516

The total international! reserves of DMCs increased to $65.9
billion in 1985 trom $56.5 billion in 1984 (see Table 5). This
was largely due to a substantial addition to reserves made
by India; Indonesia; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; Philippines;
Singapore; Taipei, China; and Thailand. A number of countries, however, experienced declines in their reserves. This
was particularly true of Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka. The aggregate level of reserves at the end of
1985 equalled 5.3 months of imports compared with 4.4
months of imports in 1984. Apart from Kiribati and Taipei,
China, which had exceptionally high levels of reserves
equivalent to 62.5 months and 13.6 months of Imports,
tespectively, the level of reserves for the other DMCs ranged from one month of imports for Burma to 6.5 months of
imports for Solomon tslands,

Domestic Savings, Investment
and Resource Gap

Data on domestic savings, investment and the resource
gap of DMCs for the period 1982-1984 show some significant
developments (see Table 6). In 1984, the resource gap of
OMCs {Le., the difference between gross domestic savings
and gross capital formation} measured as a percentage of
GDP declined in all 14 DMGs for which data are avaitable,
except Burma, India and Singapore. In Burma and India, the
gap remained at about the level of 1983, whereas In Singapore
the resource gap widened. This reduction tn the resource gap
was associated with significant Improvements !n domestic
savings in all the DMCs, except in the Phiilppines where savings fell but much less than the fall In investment. ln Hong
Kong, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Taipei,
China, domestic saving exceeded investment during 1984.
tn Hong Kong, Malaysia and Talpsi, China, the improvement
resulted from both an increased rate of domestic savings and
a reduced rate of investment, In the Republic of Korea, both
saving and investment ratios were higher than those in 1983,
but the domestic saving to GDP ratlo increased more than
the Investment to GDP ratio. The other DMCs which sharply
reduced their resource gap in 1984 were Papua New Guinea,
Sri Lanka and Thaliand,

The net flow of external resources to DMCs rose to $17
biltion in 1984 from $16.3 dilfion in 1983, the latest year for
which data are avaitabie (see Table 7), Concessional flows
decreased to $6.9 billion in 1984 from $7 billion in 1983, while
non-concessional flows rose to $10.1 billion from $8.3 billion.

The external public debt of DMCs! increased to
$130 billion in 1984 from $122 billion in 1983 (see Table 8),
or by 6.6 per cent, substantially less than the increase of 13
per cent in the previous year. India, Indonesia, Republic of
Korea, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand accounted for 85
per cent of the aggregate debt increase during the year. The
DMCs which reduced their external public debt during the
year were Fifi and Taipei, China.

The debi-service payments of DMCs rose to $16.7 billion
in 1984 from $14.3 bilfion in 1983 and $12.3 billion in 1982.
The overall debt-service ratio increased to 8 per cent in 1984
from 7.7 per cent in 1983. The debt-service ratios of individual
DMCs varied widely ranging from 36.9 per cent for Burma to
0.2 per cent for Hong Kong. !n most cases, the ratios were
at moderate levels. However, these ratios cover official external debt only and, therefore, do not adequately refiect the
debt-service burden of some DMCs such as Indonesia,

Domestic Efforts and Policies

Economic developments in 1985 imposed severe strains
on several DMCs. Many DMCs took steps to adjust their
policies in response to changes in the domestic and external economic environment. The policy initiatives were aimed
at both short-term stabilization and long-term development
goals. The former included the maintenance of high teveis
of capacity utilization, price stability and external payments
eguilibrium. The latter included increasing capital stock, promoting greater self-reliance and fostering balanced economic
growth. Some of the policy measures adopted by DMCs during 1985 are described below.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

The decline in the growth of GDP and foreign trade In 1985
had an adverse impact on government budgetary resources
in many DMCs. A variety of measures were adopted by countries to cope with this situation. Several DMCs took steps
to raise higher revenues through more vigorous implementation of taxes on domestic income and property and by plugging toopholes for tax evasion. A number of DMCs including
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand

 

i
ialso made substantial cutbacks in their budgetary expenditures. Many public sector development projects were
postponed or scaled down due to domestic resource constraints. Bangladesh, Bhutan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan,
Philippines and Western Samoa took significant steps to promote privatization during the year. New development plans
of some of these countries launched during the year assigned
expanded roles to the private sector. India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Singapore provided new fiscal incentives to
attract domestic and foreign investors.

Monetary policies in DMCs were generally pursued to
achieve the goals of economic growth and price stability.
Bangladesh used restrictive monetary policies and food imports to combat inflationary pressures. While providing
rehabilitation assistance to its cyclone-ravaged economy. Fiji
maintained control on wages and domestic liquidity to ensure price stability. The Philippines and Sri Lanka succeeded in sharply bringing down inflation rates through restrictive monetary policies. At the same time, several DMCs (Hong
Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Taipei, China) took
steps to reduce nominal interest rates to encourage domestic
investment. However, the decline in the inflation rate to levels
considerably below the interest rates paid to depositors made
the real returns to savers substantially positive in many
BMCs, thus enhancing the inducement to save.

Bank-assisted project is expected te increase the country’s coal
production by about 240,000 tons per annum.

 

External Trade Policies

The widening current account deficits and the consequent
draw-down of external reserves of DMCs exerted pressures
on their exchange rates. Nepal devalued its official exchange
rate in December 1985. Other DMCs whose exchange rates
depreciated vis-a-vis the US dollar during 1985 were
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka, The depreciation in relation to other major currencies
was more pronounced in view of the’fall in the value of US
dollar in relation to those currencies. The exchange rate adjustments in most instances exceeded the inflation differential and led to some effective real depreciation of the currencies relative to those of their major trading partners, thus
enhancing the competitiveness of exports.

individual DMCs took a variety of measures to promote exports, encourage the inflow of external resources and make
efficient use of their limited foreign exchange resources to
meet their urgent and growing import requirements. Some
of ihe policy measures were aimed at attracting foreign investment and reducing the distortions in effective exchange
rates.

Pakistan extended its system of subsidies to exporters and
overseas Pakistani workers were provided added concessions to attract remittances. indonesia undertook customs
reforms to simplify its importing procedures and encourage
foreign investors and liberalized export credit policies to promote non-oil exports. India’s new trade policy offered
businesses in India easier access to imports, further incentives to export and !ess administrative controls. in view of
the exceptionally low domestic prices, Bangladesh provided support prices to jute farmers and Thailand to its rice
farmers in order to maintain production incentives. Malaysia
aliowed up to 80 per cent foreign ownership in export-oriented
firms. Sri Lanka undertook import tariff reforms to reduce
the levels and variance of protection given to domestic
industries.

Energy Programs and Policies

Despite the decline in the real and nominal prices of oil
in the world market during the past few years, the DMCs pursued their goals of achieving greater self-reliance in energy
resources through development of alternative sources of
energy. Exploitation of hydroelectricity potential, natural gas
and coal reserves remained the major thrust of energy
programs.

During 1985, Nepal sought foreign collaboration for oil ex
‘ ploration and prepared plans for a major step-up in

hydropower. In India, investment in coal-based power
increased substantially and the national oil company raised
a large loan in the private capital market to improve its oil
production and exploration activities. Bangladesh, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka undertook large investmenis in energy related
projects during the year, Conservation of energy resources
continued to be stressed. Some countries increased the
domestic prices of oil and oi] products to encourage the more
efficient use of energy resources.

Regional Cooperation

The Economic Ministers of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN), at their seventeenth meeting in Kuala
Lumpur in February, decided on an across-the-board 25 per

on Tourism approved a marketing plan aimed at promoting
the ASEAN region as a tourist destination. The ASEAN
Ministers responsible for energy considered a draft study on
ASEAN petroleum security.

To further promote intra-ASEAN trade, the Committee on
Trade and Tourism developed an ASEAN Trade Quota
Scheme whereby the members would be able to negotiate
bilaterally on a product-by-product basis for a minimum of
25 per cent margin of preference. This proposal was being
considered by the Economic Ministers. Several leaders in the
private sector also called for further economic integration
among the six countries.

The Heads of State or Government of seven South Asian
countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maidives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Srl Lanka) met in Dhaka in December 1985 and
signed a charter formally launching the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Areas identified for
future cooperation Include agriculture and tural development,
telecommunications, meteorology, health and population,
transport, postal services, science and technology, sports,
arts and culture, and campaigns against narcotic trafficking and terrorism In the region.

At the South Pacific Forum meeting held in August, the
island member nations were able to negotiate further trade
concessions from Australia. Australia announced that under
the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) the Forum members wouid have
duty-free access to the Australian market for ail commodities

other than clothing, footwear, steel, sugar and cars. !n the
meeting, New Zealand also agreed to extend its Pacific
(slands Industrial Development Scheme, which sponsors
joint ventures among the Forum members.

International Cooperation

On the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of the Bandung
Conference, representatives of the Non-Aligned Movement
met in Bandung, Indonesia, in April 1985. Their final declaration called for: (i) an end to protectionism, especially in the
industrial countries; {ii) long-term measures to alleviate the
external debt problems of a number of developing countries;
and (iii) an increase in concessional assistance, especially
for the least-developed countries.

At the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting held
in Nassau, Bahamas, in October a four-point-action program
was proposed to improve the external economic environment
for the developing countries. This included higher growth in
the industrialized countries, lower interest rates, a significant Increase In external aid, and larger foreign investment.

Some of the above issues were considered in the Bonn
Summit held in May 1986. The Heads of State or Government
of the seven major industrial countries noted that important
progress had been achieved In bringing about global
economic recovery and expressed their determination to work
for an open multilateral trade and effective monetary system.
They also noted that the problem of external debt was farfrom resolved and welcomed long-term restructuring
agreements between debtors and commercial banks. The participants also recognized that sustained economic recovery
in the industrial countries was important for the economic
growth of the developing countries and agreed to ensure that
international institutions had adequate resources to promote
economic development of the developing countries. The
group, however, failed to set a date for a new round of trade
liberaiization talks and act on the proposal for a summit on
monetary reforms.

The Finance Ministers of the Group of Five, at their
September Meeting in Washington, agreed on a coordinated
program designed to bring down the value of the US doilar
against other currencies. The initiative taken by the US Administration aimed at stemming protectionist sentiments at
home and trade frictions abroad, met with considerable success. By the end of 1985 the US dollar had fallen considerably
in relation to other major currencies.

At the Annual Meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade held in November, agreement was reached to initiate a new round of trade discussions in September 1986.
Unlike the earlier discussions which sought to reduce tariffs,
the proposed discussions would emphasize non-tariff barriers to trade which constituted the “new protectionism”. In
December, President Reagan vetoed the US Trade and Tariff
Act 1985, known as the Jenkins Bill, which had been passed
by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

The European Economic Commission agreed to extend its
Export-Earning Stabilization Scheme (STABEX) to all 36 leastdeveloped countries in the UN list. Five DMCs — Bangladesh,
Nepal, Matdives, Bhutan and Lao People’s Democratic
Republic — will benefit from this extension.

On 24 October 1985, the international Tin Council
announced that it had run out of funds to support tin prices.
Trading in tin at the London Metal Exchange was suspended. This was foliowed by the closure of the major world tin
markets. Attempts to renegotiate a new agreement on natural
rubber failed in May, and the existing Internationai Natural
Rubber Agreement was renewed for another two years. An
international Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) was launched
in April. The main functions of {TTA are reforestation and
forest management, expansion of processing activities in the
developing countries, and research and development.

THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Background

IN 1985. the Bank undertook an extensive review of its
assistance to the private sector in its developing member
countries (DMCs). This enabled the Bank to clarify its objectives in assisting the private sector and to formulate a comprehensive approach to guide its future operations in this
field. Given the growing importance of private sector development in the DMCs and in light of the reorientation of the
Bank's own approach, the Board of Directors felt that it would
be appropriate to highlight in a special theme chapter in this
Annuai Report the salient features of the Bank’s assistance
to the private sector including the new initiatives taken during the year.

The increased: emphasis in Bank operations on assistance
to the private sector reflects a growing interest in its DMCs
in stimulating private enterprise. The economies of the region
are becoming more market-oriented and are placing greater
emphasis on the private sector.

Indeed, DMCs as diverse as Bangladesh, India, Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand have
each undertaken measures designed to foster private initiative. These measures have included deregulation of
economic activities and greater reliance on market forces,
promotion of private, domestic and foreign investment, tax
and trade policy reforms, and, in a few cases, privatization
of state-owned firms.

The motivation for these policy reforms is found in four
factors: (i) the demonstration effect of the economic success
of those DMCs which have promoted market-oriented policies
and private enterprise; (ii) the growing recognition of the
costs of ineffective public enterprises both in terms of
budgetary expenditure and forgone economic development;
Gil) the reduced level of domestic and external resources for
public sector expenditure; and (iv) the need to tap the productive and managerial capacity of the private sector for
development.

Past Bank Assistance
to the Private Sector

The Bank has channelled a total of about $2 billion to its
DMCs for private sector projects in industry (including agroindustry), energy, transportation, finance and other services.

 

In addition, much of the Bank’s assistance to agriculture has
been inthe form of direct support for private farmers, the
single largest group of entrepreneurs in the Bank’s DMCs,
The largest component of Bank support for the private sector outside agriculture has been credit lines to development
finance institutions (DFls) for on-lending to small and
medium-scale enterprises, As of the end of 1985, the Bank
had extended 86 credit lines amounting to $1.9 billion to 30
DFIs in 19 DMCs. Most of this (79 per cent) was financed from
the Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and the balance
from its Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. Through
these credit lines, the Bank has succeeded in promoting new
enterprises, expanding operations of existing ones and helping them to modernize and acquire balancing equipment to
utilize fully their capacities. Of the total of $1.9 biltion, nearly
$1.4 billion has been committed by DFls in on-lending to
nearly 11,200 smail and medium-scale private sector enter:
prises and $1.3 billion has been disbursed to most of these
enterprises. A large share has been used to finance projects
and create employment opportunities in manufacturing,
followed by transport, utilities and services, agriculture,
mining and quarrying. The Bank believes that through the
application of rigorous project analysis the associated DFis
have helped foster a more efficient productive structure in
these DMCs based on sound financial, technical and
economic viability criteria.

The Bank has also lent about $100 million for relatively
large private industrial projects. These loans have been provided either directly to the private enterprises or channelled.
through the DMC governments or DFIs.

In 1983, the Bank's strategy for supporting the private sector was expanded through the introduction of an equity investment facility permitting direct investment in industrial
enterprises and direct investment or lines of equity to DFis
or similar institutions, By the end of 1985, the Bank had approved equity investments totalling $7.03 million. Of this
total, $1.78 million represented direct equity investments in
three enterprises in the private sector. These included a venture capital company in the Republic of Korea, a leasing corporation in Pakistan and a joint-venture industrial undertaking in Indonesia. The remaining $5.25 million was channelled
through four lines of equity to three DFis {in Fiji, Indonesia
and Pakistan) and to one private commercial bank in
Thatfland.

2122

The Bank has used its technical assistance resources in
a variety of ways to support the private sector. By the end
of 1985, the Bank had made 36 technical assistance grants
totalling $6.5 million to establish new DFIs or to strengthen
the managerial, project analysis and accounting capacities
of existing ones on a national or regional basis. The Bank
has also studied private sector development issues, including
privatization of public sector firms, capital market development, the leasing industry and venture capital firms.
Moreover, under its Development Round Table series, the
Bank has sponsored discussions among Its DMCs on the role
of the private sector in their national economies.

In its efforts to promote the most efficient use of resources
in its DMCs, the Bank has also indirectly assisted the private
sector during the project processing cycle by evaluating the
opportunity costs of proposed projects in the public sector.
In recent years, the alternative “private sector approach” has
been Increasingly considered at the time of project appraisal
in the public sector.

In 1985, the Bank approved four credit line projects in the
total amount of $227 million to DF Is in Fiji, Republic of Korea,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. A $20 million credit line from the
Bank's ADF resources to Sri Lanka for the Development
Financing Project will be utilized by two DFls {the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon and the National
Development Bank of Sri Lanka} to support the Government's
policy of fostering development of the private industrial sector. The project is also expected to reinforce government efforts to establish an open economy based on comparative
advantage and promotion of export-oriented private sector
development.

The Bank’s Second Development Financing loan in
Pakistan will open a credit tine of $100 million ($50 million
from OCR and $50 million from ADF) to four development
banks (Bankers Equity Ltd., Industrial Development Bank of
Pakistan, National Development Finance Carporation, and
Pakistan industrial Credit and Investment Corporation) and,
for the first time, a commercial bank (Habib Bank Ltd,). Bank
funds are intended to encourage government efforts in the
structural transformation of the Industrial sector, to contribute to the development of the financial system through
policy dialogue between the Bank and the Government on
a range of issues relating to the efficiency of the financial
system and the capital market and to assist in institutional
strengthening of the participating DFls and the commercial
bank.

The two other credit lines extended to Fiji Development
Bank ($7 million) and Korea Long Term Credit Bank
{$100 miltion} wilf be ontent to smali and medium-sized enterprises In the private sector.

in its equity Investment operations, the Bank achieved
several “firsts” in 1985: a direct equity investment in anindustrial enterprise in the private sector (P.T. Kratama Belindo
internasionai in indonesia for $400,000); an equity tine to a
OF in a South Pacific DMC (Fiji Development Bank for
$260,000); and an equity line to a private commercial bank
{Siam Commercial Bank in Thailand for $2 million). During
the year, the Bank also approved an equity line for $1 million
to Bank Pembangunan indonesia in Indonesia. The Bank expects to encourage additional domestic resource mobilization in the capital markets of its DMCs through its equity support to these enterprises.

The Bank continued its program of providing technical
assistance on a regional basis for strengthening the management and project analysis capacities of DFis in its DMCs;
two such grants were approved in 1985. impraving the performance of these DFis will help the Bank be more effective
in reaching small and medium-scale industries in its DMCs.
The Bank also used its regional technical assistance facility
for two studies — on equipment leasing and on veniure
capital financing in selected DMCs — and to sponsor a symposium on capital market development in the Asia-Pacific
region (held in Manila in January 1986). These were intended
to identify measures which the Bank could consider in its
efforts to deepen and diversify the range of financial services
available to private enterprises in its DMCs. On a national
basis, fhe Bank extended a technical assistance grant to
Thailand to explore the possibility of establishing a credit
guarantee facility to encourage institutional lending to smal}
private enterprises and to Pakistan to study the means for
developing small-scale private industry there,Future Directions

The operational approach following the review of the
Bank's strategy for assistance to the private sector is broader
in scope and more intensive in implementation than past
Bank efforts. Its principai elements are as follows:

(i) increased financial and technical assistance to
private enterprises from Bank resources and through
catalyzing the flow of resources from other external
sources;

(iil) policy dialogue with DMCs on private sector
development;

(iii) strengthening financial institutions and capital

markets in DMCs; and

(iv) assistance for DMCs which decide to privatize public

sector enterprises if this is financially feasible and
technically and economically sound.

The Bank intends to be pragmatic and flexible in
implementing this approach. !t will take account of the
respective roles of the public and private sectors of the
DMCs, their attitudes and policies toward the private sector, and the relative capabilities, initiative and dynamism of
the private sector itself. However, in general, the Bank's concern is that the DMCs' commercial enterprises, both public
and private, should become more market-oriented, rather than
remain protected by high import tariffs or saddied with
avoidable social costs as a result of government regulation
and intervention.

In future, Bank assistance to the private sector will rely
mainly on a more intensive application of its traditional financial and technical assistance instruments. However, in 1985,
the Board of Directors decided to introduce several new
policies and operational approaches (see following sections)
which will be more responsive to the requirements of private
enterprise in DMCs as well as more supportive of DMC efforts to enhance the role of private enterprise in their
economies.

Lending Without Government Guarantee

Hitherto, the Bank has required the relevant DMC government to be either the borrower or guarantor for its loans. This
policy has restricted the Bank’s efforts to assist the private
sector, particularly in those DMCs where the government
does not guarantee loans to private entities. Therefore, the
Board of Directors decided in late 1985 that the Bank should
provide loans without government guaraniee. Initially, the
amounts of such loans will be modest: up to a total of
$75 million from OCR and $25 million from ADF resources
during the first two years of operations, with individual loans
generally ranging from $5 million to $30 million. Project setection will be based upon the same rigorous analysis that is
applied to all Bank loans. The terms of loans under this
facility will be near to those for loans from commercial
sources and are intended to finance only a portion of the total
project costs (total Bank assistance up to a maximum of 25
per cent is envisaged). The loans will be suitably secured to

reduce the risk involved and to protect the Bank’s investment.
Under this facility the Bank will be directly involved with
private enterprises, as long as the respective government

* does not object. This new policy should broaden the appeal

of the Bank’s existing equity financing facility, enabling the
Bank to package equity participation with term-lending, diversify its channels of lending to the private sector, and broaden
its efforts to serve as a financial catalyst.

Institutional Development of
the Financial System

Most DMCs need to devote greater attention to the
development of their financial systems if the requirements
of an expanded private sector are to be met in future years.
The Bank will support the DMCs’ efforts by {i) making financial resources available to sultable institutions through its

* tine of credit and equity investment facilities, supported by

technical assistance for institution building; (ii) providing
technical assistance to securities market institutions, as wel!
as to the government reguiatory and promotional agencies,
for institution building and policy studies; and (ii) engaging
DMC governments in policy dialogue aimed at promoting
financial and capital market development.

Assistance for Privatization

The Bank is prepared. to assist DMCs in their efforts to
privatize enterprises, including financial institutions, which
are at present owned or controlled by the public sector.
However, the Bank must necessarliy be selective in offering
financial assistance for such activities because of high
associated risks. The Bank is also prepared to provide policy
advice and technical assistance, if required, to support the
privatization of public enterprises.

In its support for privatization, the Bank will not (i) simply
turn a public monopoly into a private one; (ii) give undue
benefits to specific enterprises which might tend to inhibit
competition; or (iii} give an advantage to any particular group
of entrepreneurs. Privatization of DMCs’ industries requires
political initiative, full government support and availability
of local entrepreneurs and capital, as well as concerted efforis from both the DMC governments and the private sector.

Bank institutional Arrangements

The Bank decided to establish a Private Sector Division
within its Industry and Development Banks Department in
early 1986 in order to carry out its new private sector strategy.
This Division.will be the focal point for the Bank’s private
sector activities in the DMCs. Its principal functions include
the promotion of private sector development in those countries, the identification of areas and opportunities for Bank
involvement in this sector and the overall coordination of
Bank assistance to private enterprises. In carrying out its
functions, the new Division will draw on the specialized sectoral expertise in other departments and offices withia the
Bank.

Loan and Equity Operations

THE Bank’s iending in 1985 was lower than originally
envisaged and the actual level in 1984. Loan approvals
totalied $1,908 million compared with $2,234 million in 1984.
Loans from ordinary capital resources (OCR} amounted to
$1,271 million, a nominal decrease of 18 per cent over the
corresponding figure of $1,551 million in 1884, Loans from
the Asian Development Fund (ADF), amounting to $637
million, decreased by 6.8 per cent in nominal terms from the
1984 figure of $684 miftion.

The dip in lending levels may be generally attributed to
adjustments in the Bank’s developing member countries
{DMCs) to mitigate the effects of external debt burdens,
domestic resource constraints and economic slowdown. This
has meant that a number of countries have refrained from

others is encumbered by such factors as economic restructuring, economic constraints and/or delays in resolving
policy-related issues.

In 1985, its third year of equity operations, the Bank
approved three lines of equity totalling $3.25 million — Fiji
Development Bank ($0.25 million), Bank Pembangunan
indonesia ($1 million) and Siam Commercial Bank, Thailand
($2 million) to facilitate the Bank’s equity investments in
relatively smaller private enterprises. One equity investment
of $0.4 million was made in P:T. Kratama Betindo Internasional in Indonesia.

Forty-eight loans were approved during the year for 46 projects in 13 OMCs, compared with the 1984 total of 49 foans
tor 47 projects in 18 DMCs. “Blended” loans financed from
both OCR and ADF were provided to two of the 1985 projects

The average size of loans also decreased in 1985 to $39.8
million from $45.6 million in 1984, reflecting, in part, the
postponement of some large-sized projects in the energy
sector. The average size of OCR loans decreased to $50.8
million in 1985 from $53.6 million in 1984, while the average
size of ADF loans decreased to $27.7 million from $29.7
miltion in the previous year.

Five DMCs recelved loans exciusively from OCR: Indonesia
($500.7 million), Thailand ($168.3 million), Republic of Korea
{$467 million), Malaysia ($132.4 million} and Fiji ($7 million).
Two DMCs received loans from both OCR and ADF: Pakistan
with $571.8 million ($278.8 miilion from OCR and $292.8
million from ADF) and Papua New Guinea with $24.9 million
($16.4 million from OCR and $8.5 million from ADF). Loans
wera provided exclusively from ADF to six DMCs: Bangladesh
($212.3 million), Nepal ($58 million), Sri Lanka ($54.4 million),
Bhutan ($3.5 milllon), Vanuatu ($3 million) and Western
Samoa ($4.4 million}.

Concomitant with the dip in overail lending was a decrease
In the amount of co-financing by official and commercial
sources in Bank-assisted projects to $640 mililon In 1985 from
$1,163 million in 1984. In addition to the lower level of

borrowing by member countries, the need to seek co

financlers’ resources was affected by the smalter size of
projects.

The total estimated cost of projects approved during the
year — including loans for credit lines, program and sector
loans — was $4.4 billion, of which 43 per cent was accounted
for by Bank financing, 42.6 per cent was to be provided by
borrowing DMCs and 14.4 per cent was to be provided by
co-financiers.

In 1985, local cost financing amounted to $299.9 miition
for 23 projects in nine DMCs. Of this, $79.9 million was from
OCR and $220 million from ADF, representing 6.3 per cent
and 34.5 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF toans approved during the year.

Technical Assistance By Sector: 1985?

By the end of 1985, the Bank's cumulative lending had
reached $17,5 billion for 704 projects in 27 DMCs, of which
loans amounting to $11.9 billion were from OGR and $5.5
billion were from ADF. Of this total, about $1.3 billion was
provided for local cost financing.

Technical Assistance

The Role of Technical Assistance
and Its Funding

Technical assistance is an important area of Bank activiiy. Technical assistance operations play a vital rote in the
transfer of resources and technology to DMCs by assisting
them to design, formulate, implement and operate development projects as weil as ensuring the efficiency and success
of their implementation and performance. Technical
assistance is also used to enhance the capabilities of DMCs
to formulate economic development policies, strategies, programs and plans to improve the allocation of scarce domestic
and external resources. The Bank has also provided technical
assistance to enable DMCs to address sectoral! and projectrelated policy issues.

The Bank finances Its technical assistance activities
through grants and loans and through combinations of both.
The sources of funds available for grant-financed technical
assistance activities comprise: {)) voluntary contributions to
the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) from both
developed and developing member countries; (ii) grant funds
provided by other multilateral and bilateral sources under
co-financing and exclusive financing arrangements; and
{iii} income from the Bank’s ordinary capital resources (OCR).
Loan-financed technical assistance has been funded from
the Bank’s OCR and ADF resources and from other multilateral and bilateral sources under co-financing and exciusive
financing arrangements.

Total Volume of Technical Assistance

As of 31 December 1985, the Bank had provided technical
assistance for 1,202 projects in 27 DMCs, totailing $1.4 billion.
About 78 per cent of that assistance was financed by Bank
joans, 7 per cent by Bank grants, and the remaining 15 per
cent from other sources.

The Bank acts as executing agency for most technical
assistance projects financed from other sources. In 1985,
these included the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the Internationa! Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD), and the Governments of Finland and Switzerland. For
the preparation of agricultural projects, the Bank also
cooperates with the Food and Agriculture Organization/investment Centre (FAO/IC} (see table on this page).

At end 1985, Group A (low-income) DMCs had received 39
per cent of the cumulative amount of technical assistance,
Group B (middle-income) 52 per cent and Group C (higherincome) 9 per cent. Of the grant-financed technical assistance, Group A DMGs received 63 per cent, Group B 30 per
cent and Group C 7 per cent. Of the loan-financed technical
assistance, Group A DMCs received 36 per cent, Group B 55
per cent and Group C9 per cent. Among Group A DMCs, the
seven leasi-developed (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Lao PDR, Maldives, Nepal and Western Samoa) received 22
per cent of the total amount of technical assistance provided.
Group A DMCs in the South Pacific (Cook Islands, Kiribati,
Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu) received one per cent
of the total. The share of Group A DMCs has increased from
about 19 per cent during 1967-71 to about 40 per cent during
1981-85. The share of Group B DMCs has remained constant
at about 50 per cent, whife the share of Group C DMCs has
declined to about 10 per cent during 1981-85 from 29 per cent
during 1967-71.

Of the total amount of technical assistance provided
during 1967-85, 40 per cent went to the agriculture and agroindustry sector, 18 per cent to the energy sector, 20 per cent

Grant-Financed Technical Assistance

In 1985, the Bank approved technical assistance grants
{funded by the Bank and other sources) amounting to $34
million for 112 projects, including regional activities, compared with $22 million for 109 projects In 1984. This brought
the cumulative total to $203 million. The increase in 1985 was
due to higher utilization of external resources in the fundIng of relatively large technica! assistance projects for
Institution building and project implementation. Of the 1885
total, 31 per cent was provided for project preparation, 53
per cent for advisory and operational purposes and 16 per
cent for regional activites.

During 1985, 70 per cent of the total amount of technical
assistance grants to DMCs went to countries fully etigible
for ADF loans — Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and
Western Samoa — which received a total of $19.6 million.
The rest went to Fiji, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Thailand, which together
received $8.5 milion.

The agriculture and agro-industry sector retained the
largest share of the total amount of grant-financed technical
assistance: 63 per cent in 1985 compared with 46 per cent
the previous year. The social infrastructure sector accounted
for 11 per cent of the total amount, fotlowed by the transport
and communications sector with 10 per cent, energy with 8
per cent, and industry and non-fuel minerals with 4 per cent.

included in the total technical assistance amount were
technical assistance grant components amounting to $11.7
million approved In conjunction with 17 Bank loan projects,
of which $2.2 million was for the preparation of projects and
$9.5 milllon for advisory and project Implementation
pusposes.

By the end of 1985, 296 Bank loan projects amounting to
$7.8 dilllon had resulted from earlier project preparatory
technical assistance grants totalling $45 million (the total
amount of project preparatory technical assistance approved
was $218 milllon}. This hightighis the importance of technical
assistance to the Bank’s overall lending program. tn 1985
alone, 31 Bank loan projects totalling $1,156 million resulted
from previous Bank technical assistance, of which $645
millon came from OCR and $511 million from ADF, representing 51 per cent and 80 per cent, respectively, of the year's
total loan approvals from these sources.

Regional technical assistance grants totalling $5.5 million
were provided for 32 projects compared with $3.6 million for
25 projects in 1984, During the year, 36 per cent of the total
amount for regional activities was provided for regiona!
studies and workshops, 29 per cent for conferences and
seminars, 18 per cent for training and 17 per cent for research
and other activities.

During 1985, 102 grant-financed technical assistance projects were completed bringing the total number of such projects completed to 644,

Loan-Financed Technical Assistance

At end 1886, loan-financed technical assistance amounting to $1.2 billlon had been provided for 563 projects. Of this
total 59 per cent was funded from OOR, representing 6 per
cent of cumulative OCR lending, 31 per cent from ADF,
representing 7 per cent of cumulative ADF lending, and the

balance from other sources. Of the total amount of loanfinanced technical assistance about $128 million was provided as separate technical assistance loans for project
preparation activities. Some $46 million was provided from
project loan financing during project implementation for
advisory activities such as institutional strengthening and
training. About $1.1 billion, or 86 per cent of the total, was
provided from project loan funds for project implementation
activities, mainly consultant services to assist in the
implementation, operation and management of a project.
Such services included evaluation of bids, construction
supervision, training of local personnel and the improvement
of the implementation capability of project entities.

In 1985, the Bank approved two technical assistance loans
for project preparation activities: one for the Central Java
Groundwater Irrigation Development Project in Indonesia for
$12.2 million and the other for the Sarawak Agricultural
Development Study in Malaysia for $1.78 million. As of the
end of 1985, the Bank had approved a total of 54 technical
assistance joans totailing $128 million for 12 DMGs.
Indonesia has been the largest recipient of such technical
assistance loans accounting for 58 per cent of approvals.

in 1985, about $133 million was provided from project loans
for project implementation and advisory technical assistance
activities. This represents an increase of 58 per cent over loan
tunds provided during 1984 for the same activities, due largely
to an increase in the amount of advisory and project implementation technical assistance undertaken in project
loans provided to the sociat infrastructure sector.

During 1985, Group A DMCs received about 38 per cent
of the total amount of loan-financed technical assistance
compared with 45 per cent during 1984. Group B DMGs received 57 per cent of the total loan-financed technical
assistance compared with 52 per cent in 1984 and Group G
DMCs received 5 per cent in 1985, compared with 3 per cent
in 1984.

During 1985, 36 per cent of the total amount of leanfinanced technical assistance was provided to the social
infrastructure sector, compared with 9 per cent in 1984. The
agriculture sector accounted for 34 per cent of the total
amount, followed by transport and communications with 20
per cent, energy with 9 per cent and the industry and nonfue} minerals sector and the multisector with less than 7 per
cent each.

Training Activities

Reflecting the Bank's recognition of the crucial role that
efficient manpower and institutions play in project implementation, nearly half of ait the projects for which the Bank
approved loans in 1985 incorporated some form of educational or training activity. In addition, Bank training activities
included institution building under advisory or operational
technical assistance grants, general training under regional
technical assistance grants, and on-the-job training for DMC
officials seconded to the Bank.

On @ sectoral basis, all nine irrigation and rural development projects supported by Bank loans in 1985 Included provision for training. In Malaysia, for example, an important part
of the Bank-financed Kalaka-Saribas Integrated Agricultural
Development Project was the provision of institutional support to the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority. Similarly, in Nepal, a key component of the Seti
Zone Rural Development Project was a program to strengthenagricultural support services in four hill districts. Bank lending for these nine projects amounted to $345 million, of which
about $11 million was for training,

Six of the Bank's eight projects for agricultural development also contained training componenis. In Indonesia, a
program to bolster the institutional capabilities of government agencies in the collection, collation and interchange
of information on jand use was a crucial part of the Land
Resource Evaluation and Planning Project. In Bangladesh,
an important part of the Bank-financed Livestock Project was
the strengthening of field services, including village-level
support services, training programs and the institutional
capabilities of the Directorate of Livestock Services. Bank
lending for these six projects amounted to $128 million, of
which about $30 million was for training.

Four out of ten Bank-supported social infrastructure projects in 1985 contained training inputs, including a $37.9
million loan to upgrade the University of Sriwijaya in
Indonesia and a $28.8 million loan to Pakistan to improve
the quality of the country’s science education. Two healthteiated projects also included training provisions. In
Indonesia, training programs were provided in a Health and
Population Project and health worker training and education
was an important part of the Second Rural Health Services
Project in Papua New Guinea. Bank ending for these four
projects amounted to $122 million, of which about $85 million
was for training. In addition, a multiproject loan approved
to Western Samoa in 1985 included a subproject to
strengthen the extension service of the Department of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

The Bank approved technical assistance amounting to
$275,000 for institution building in two DMCs. In Sri Lanka,
technical assistance was approved in conjunction with a loan
for the Trunk Roads Improvement Project to strengthen the
sapability of the Ministry of Highways, with particular
teference to maintenance planning. In Bhutan, Bank
technical assistance for a Road Construction and Training
Project included a provision to train personnel in mechanized
road construction and equipment management.

On a regional basis, the Bank continued to extend
technical assistance to develop the skills of DFI personnel.
At management level, the Bank organized a Regional Program on Management Development for DFls in Asia which
was held in Baguio, Philippines, in November. Earlier in the
year, the Bank formalized a program to strengthen in-house
training for four selected DFIs from Pakistan, Solomon
Islands, Sri Lanka and Western Samoa.

In 1985, the Bank also provided on-the-job training under
its secondment program to five officials from its DMCs. Four
other DMC officials received short-term familiarization with
ihe Bank’s activities through its attachment program.

Sectoral Review

There was a marked change in the sectoral composition
of Bank fending in 1985. Whereas energy together with
agriculture and agro-industry were the leading sectors in 1284
— together accounting for 68 per cent of loan approvals at
34.3 per cent and 33.9 per cent, respectively — the energy

Bank is supporting with a $71.4 million loan, will enable Songkhla and Phuket ports to handle increasing traffic volume and foster greater
economic and social development in the southern region of the country.30

sector accounted for only 12.8 per cent of total loan approvals
in 1985, and agriculture and agro-industry, while retaining
the lead share, dectined to 29.3 per cent. Social infrastruc
ture, on the other hand, rose to 28.5 per cent of total loan 
approvais in 1985, the second largest share, from 10.7 per
cent in 1984.

Lending to agriculture and agro-industry (which covers
irrlgatlon and rural development, fisheries, livestock,
agricultural credit and support services, forestry, fertilizer and
agro-processing) declined to $559 mililon in 1985 from a
record $758 million in 1984. This was due to several factors
influencing the Bank’s overall level of lending and does not
reflect a lowering in priority or emphasis to the sector.

With the decrease in the price of rice, a major crop in Asia,
coupled with the attainment of the self sufficiency threshold
in several DMCs, greater attention is being paid by the Bank
and the DMCs to appropriate strategies for effective Irrigation management and crop diversification.

To tackle the important technical and policy questions
relating to the implemeniation of Irrigation investment programs for diversifled agricultural production, major studies
are being conducted on food demand/supply and irrigation
management In the Philippines and indonesia in cooperation with the International irrigation Management institute
(IIM}) and the International Food Policy Research institute
(IFPRI). Three regional technica! assistance grants were
approved for other new areas of study: irrigation service fees,
rainfed agriculture and rural ampioyment. Other studies
aimed at more effective dialogue and resolution of constraints on development in the agriculture and agro-industry
sector included completion of a fisheries sector review for
Thaltand, agricuiture sector studies for Western Samoa and
Fiji and an Irrigation planning study for Shutan.

A special feature of the Bank's operations in 1985 in this
sector was the involvement of commercial banks in channeiling agricultural credits in Bangladesh and Indonesia.

In recent years, many DMCs have undertaken major investments in reforestation and the development of community forestry where resources are owned or managed by small

farmers and the benefits accrue to the community. This
reflects a growing concern with environmental considerations as weil as continued awareness of the importance of
ensuring sufficient supplies of timber and fuelwood in the
long term. Two forestry projects were approved in 1985, one
in Indonesia for the first time, and another in Nepal.

The second iargest share of Bank lending in 1985 went to
the social infrastructure sector. tts share of total Bank lending increased substantially to $544 million in 1985 from $240
milion In 1984.

This increase was due to the approval! in 1985 of some
relatively large projects which could not bs processed fully
in 1984. A total of $215.4 million was lent for three projects
in the urban development and housing subsector in
Indonesia, Malaysia and Thalland. These projects were aimed
at upgrading infrastructure and providing facilities for lowcost housing. Increasingly, this assistance Is being provided not only in main urban centers but also in secondary cities
including small towns and regiona! development areas.

Of special note was the loan of $132.4 million for the
Second Bandung Urban Development Project in Indonesia.
The Project will compiement and extend coverage of water
supply, drainage, sewerage and solid waste systems
developed under earlier Bank assistance. Of the technical
assistance approvals, the Urban Development Policy and Program Study in Malaysia was significant because it will not
only heip the Government to establish a comprehensive
urban development policy, but also to formulate an appropriate medium and long-term investment program.

In water supply and sanitation, the emphasis is increasingly on the rehabilitation of existing facilities to reduce‘

, Water losses and on the introduction of low-cost sanitation
faclities. During 1985, the Bank approved loans to Indonesta,
Republic of Korea and Thailand for water supply and sanitatlon projects. .

in education, the shift in some DMCs continued from more
narrowly defined vocationai courses to include involvement
in science education as a broader basis for development. in
this context, the Science Education for Secondary Schools

with a growing emphasis on couniry studies geared to the .

manpower requirements of individua! DMCs, one of the
technical assistance projects approved in education was for
preparing a master plan for accounting and audit education
in Sri Lanka.

in 1985, the Bank also continued to provide assistance to
improve health facilities and moderate population growth in
its OMCs, and approved projects in this subsector for
Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Technical assistance activities included the approval of a regional seminar on the
use of rural health services and preparation of a Health Seryices Development Project in Malaysia. Increasingly, the emphasis of Bank lending in this sector is on measures to improve the delivery of health care and family planning services
that have been established. Improving the financing of health
services is an important aspect of this.

Lending to the transport and communications sector
declined to $310 million in 1985 from $381 million in 1984,
Focusing increasingly on provincial and rural roads systems
now that the major trunk road systems have been largely
completed in most DMCs, the Bank in 1985 approved loans
for the improvement of rurai/feeder roads in Bangladesh,
Indonesia and Pakistan as well as for trunk roads in Sri
Lanka. In view of the importance of inter-island communications between the South Pacific DMCs, the Bank assisted
the development of port facilities in Papua New Guinea and
Vanuatu. Financial assistance was also approved to support
telecommunications facilities in Pakistan. Technical
assistance continued to emphasize assistance to infrastructure maintenance. in this connection, a seminar on
railway track maintenance and monitoring techniques was
held.

There was a substantial decline in assistance to the energy
sector during 1985, Loans amounted to $245 million compared with $767 million in 1984, This reflected lower-thananticipated load growth in the power subsector due to
reduced GDP growth rates in certain DMCs and unresolved

Loan Approvals By Sector: 1968—1985

policy issues with some executing agencies. The reduction
in power sector investment was particularly pronounced in
the middle-income DMCs which receive Bank assistance
from ordinary capital resources. Many of them have revised
downwards their energy sector investment needs. Recognizing this, the Bank initiated a review of investment needs of
the power subsector over the period 1986-90. This will provide the Bank with an assessment of the emerging changes
in power sector priorities and plans, and assist in the planning of an assistance program for the next few years which
will seek to strengthen and improve the operations of existing
facilities as well as the creation of additional capacity to
meet forecast demand, taking into account the recent decline
in ofl prices.

Within the industry and development banks sector, weaker
economic growth ied to a decline in direct lending, although
indirect lending through development finance institutions
({DF!s) increased. Total lending to this sector amounted to
$243 million compared with $54 million in 1984. Gredit tines
to DFts remained the primary mode of the Bank’s support
to the private sector (for further information, see pages 21-23).
While they will continue to play an important role in this area,
the Bank is also seeking to diversify its institutional channels
and toe devote increased attention to the development and
diversification of the financial sector and capital markets in
its DMCs through appropriate policy reform and institution
building. Despite the decline in direct lending, the Bank con
tinued to contribute to industrial development programs in |

its DMCs by providing assistance for the development of industrial institutions which would result in improved
technology, increased productivity and-in the promotion and
development of viable industries. Assistance to the development of basic industries, including institutional strengihening, is likely to continue, with particular attention being
given to institutions involved in small and medium-scale
industries, mineral resources development and industrial

Co-Financing

The Bank's co-financing decreased in 1985. A total of 23
projects were co-financed, wlth co-flnanclers contributing
$640 miltion and the Bank $1,024 milllon to these projects.
This compared with $1,163 million provided by co-financiers
and $1,460 million provided by the Bank for 23 projects in
1984. As of the end of 1985, 197 Bank projects had involved
co-financing, with co-financiers providing about $5.3 billion
and the Bank $7 billion.

The Bank’s co-financing performance relates directly to
its overall lending performance. By its very nature, cofinancing is intended to mobilize additional resources, both
from official and private sources, to supplement as well as
complement the Bank's resources in its lending operations.
In this regard, 1985 was a difficult year for co-financing
operations.

The slower economic growth experienced by most borrowing member countries, combined with domestic resource
constraints and heavier debt-service burdens contributed to
lower demand for external resources for project financing,
including those of the Bank, and, consequently, for cofinancing to undertake development activities. This was particularly true in the case of co-financing with private sources
where measures undertaken to mitigate the effects of external debts in many of the traditiona! middle-income borrowing countries considerably reduced the demand for such
co-financing.

Another factor, partly attributable to lower economic activity, was the sectoral shift in the Bank’s lending program.
In previous years, the energy sector provided the most opportunities for mobilization of additional resources, both from
private as well as official sources. In 1985, however, the
Bank’s lending to this sector fell considerably in line with
the current dectine in energy costs as well as reduced energy
demand in most countries, in 1985, the Bank approved five
projects in the energy sector with Bank loans totalling $245
miilion. Of these, only two projects involved co-financing,

 

Sty geen AT eae eng
Sa ee ewan

 

with co-financlers contributing $82 million and Bank loans
totalling $160 million. By contrast, the Bank approved $767
million for ten projects in the energy sector in 1984, and cofinancing was arranged for eight projects totalling $456
million whlle Bank loans totalled $649 million for these cofinanced projects.

in view of these developments, the Bank in 1985 laid more
emphasis on the promotion of official sources to complement Its lending program. These resources generally
introduced additlonal concessionality to the co-financed projects which, in turn, mitigated the debt service burden on
these projects. In some cases, this permitted expansion of
the project scope: for example, the Science Education for
Secondary Schools sector in Pakistan and the Multiprojects
in Bhutan and Vanuatu.

Another important aspect of co-financing activity in 1985
was the arrangement of a number of technical assistance
grants. Of the 112 technica! assistance projects totalling
$33.6 million approved in 1985, $44.2 million for 15 such projects was financed by external sources. The United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) financed nine projects
totalling $11.6 million in Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Pakistan
and Western Samoa, compared with seven projects for $2.9
million in 1984. tn addition, the International Fund for
Agricultural Development QFAD) and the Governmenis of
Finland and Switzerland financed $2.6 million for six
technical assistance projects.

Despite the quantitative decrease in co-financing last year,
the quality of co-financed resources generally improved due
to the mobilization of highly concessional resources from
a wider range of co-financiers, Co-financing continued to be
arranged with muttitateral agencies like the World Bank
Group, UNDP, OPEC Fund for International Development and
IFAD. These agenctes contributed $136 million for 12 projects, compared with $383 million in 1984 for nine projects.
in 1986, ten bilateral sources —. Canada, Denmark, Federal
Republic of Germany, Finland, France, Italy, dapan,
Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland — provided $198"
million for ten projects. In 1984, eight bilateral sources pro-vided $348 million for 13 projects.

Co-financing with commercial/export credit sources
decreased to $305 million for five projects in 1985 from $432
million for seven projects in 1984. Combined with the
cautious attitude of a number of traditional middle-income
borrowers like Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand in respect
of commercial borrowings, the reduction in the Bank’s lending to self-liquidating projects, such as those in the energy
sector or credit lines to DFls, placed limitations on opportunities for co-financing from this source. Export credits were
arranged for power and gas projects in Pakistan, blended with
official development assistance. The Bank. also arranged its
third complementary loan with commercial banks for retroactive financing of a component in a hydropower project in
Pakistan approved in 1984.

Development Resource Center Activities

The Bank has been mandated by lis Charter to contribute
to the process of economic development in its developing
member countries. The primary instrument for this purpose
was to be the channelling of capital resources and technical
assistance mainly for development projects in the DMCs.

However, the full development impact of such activities
and the ability to utilize more assistance effectively depends
on an appropriate institutional and policy framework in the
DMCs concerned, Consequently, the Bank has been
strengthening its role as a development institution rather
than operating purely as a development finance institution.
Thus, in addition to providing capital and technica!
assistance, it has become a “Development Resource Center”
whose task is to provide information and advice on the varied
problems of development, to disseminate information on
economic conditions in the region and to assist in
strengthening institutions and policies in the DMCs.

With a view to understanding better the development problems and potential in the DMCs and to improving the effectiveness of Bank operations, policy dialogue between the

Asian Development Fund Loan Approvais By Sector: 1985

   

EAS

Bank and the DMCs continued during 1985. Bank personnel
had wide-ranging and frank discussions with DMC
policymakers. As required, these discussions covered the entire economy or were confined to particular sectors or
projects.

The experience with policy dialogue has been rewarding.
It has provided an opportunity for the DMCs to communicate
their needs, aspirations and probiems to the Bank, It has also
enabled the Bank to increase its knowledge and awareness
of development problems and prospects in the DMCs and
thereby to enhance the effectiveness of its own operations.

in addition to the knowledge and experience that has been
continuously built up through project-financing activities, the
Bank has been strengthening its research activities in areas
of importance to development in particular DMCs and to the
region. A number of sectoral studies were undertaken during the year. For example, as part of the ongoing education
sector policy study, the country study on Nepal was completed while the country study on Pakistan was initiated.

Agriculture and irrigation are major areas of Bank operations’ Because of the relatively long time fags in such proj
* ects and the complex problems that such projects raise, the

Bank undertook a number of sectoral studies to delineate
more clearly problems and to identify more effective policy
responses. They included an Irrigation Sector Review, the
Regional Study on Irrigation Service Fees and the Regional
Seminar on Rural Development. The proceedings of the
Regional Workshop on Livestock Production Management
were published as also was the study on “Agriculture in Asia,
its Performance and Prospects: The Role of ADB in its
Development”.

in other sectors, Bank studies covered Leasing in Selected
DMCs, Venture Capital Financing in Selected DMCs,
Regional Electricity Demand Analysis and improving the Efficiency of Power System Operation in DMCs.

At the national level, the Bank approved technical
assistance for the Sarawak Agricultural Development Study,
the Study of Irrigation Management in Indonesia, agriculture
sector studies in Nepali and Western Samoa, livestock

The Bank continued in 1985 its research and consultations
with DMGs on domestic resource mobilization problems and
possibilities.

Given the important role of appropriate capital markets In
the process of domestic resource mobilization and utilization, the Study of Capital Markets in Selected DMCs was
completed during the year and its findings were discussed
by experts from the Bank’s member countries during 4
regional symposium held in Manila in early 1986. Similarly,
the Bank hosted a conference on “Privatization: Policies,
Methods and Procedures” which was attended by experts,
senior officials from the OMCs and representatives of the
private sectors. Other seminars and training programs covered
Use of Consultants, Sail-Motor Propulsion, Strengthening InHouse Training in Selected DFls and Management Development for DFis in Asia.

Research also continued into economic conditions at the
national, regiona! and international leveis. As weil as providing data and analysis to support Bank operations, the
results of the research were disseminated to a wider audience through Bank publications such as Key indicators of
DMCs of ADB, Statistical Report Series, Economic Report
Series and Bank Staff Papers (see page 156 for a listing of
major Bank publications).

Collaborative research with national institutions was further advanced during 1985 with the initiation of the analysis
of Trade Barriers to the Exports of DMCs and the Study of
informal Credit Markets in selected DMCs.

Regular collaborative training programs and seminars were
continued during the year with the Asian Productivity
Organization/ADB Training Course in Project Feasibility Appraisa!l and Implementation, the Pacific Trade and Development (PAFTAD) Conference in its 15th session on Industrial
Policies for Pacific Economic Growth and the Asian-Pacific
Bankers Club in the Seminar on the Analysis of Country Risk.
The Bank also coliaborated with ESCAP in a Symposium on

Regional Financial Cooperation and a Regional Seminar on
Rallway Track Maintenance and Monitoring Techniques.

Since 1983, the ADB Development Round Table (DRT) has
been convened annuaily on development issues of important
and topical interest to policymakers in the DMCs. This major Development Resource Center activity of the Bank was
continued in 1985 with the convening of the DRT on the Role
of the Private Sector in Development.

Benefits to the Poor

Large income disparities and high levels of absolute poverty persist in many of the Bank’s OMCs. The benefits of
economic growth, which has been rapid in several of the
countries where farge-scale poverty remains, have not
reached large segments of the population, particularly those
living in rural areas.

The reasons for this vary from country to country but at
least four factors appear to be commonly shared. First, the
poor have very limited access both to productivity-raising
techniques and equipment as well as to the education and
training needed to make use of them. Second, physical infrastructure (for example, transportation, communications
and power) remains inadequate in many regions. Third,
population growth places continued pressure on distribution
of land, leading to progressively smaller holdings, growing
numbers of tenant farmers, and increased landlessness.
Fourth, other sectors of economic activity have not created
a sufficient number of productive employment eppeortunities
to absorb labor from the agriculture sector.

The Bank recognizes that its efforts to maximize economic
growth through the most efficient use of resources must be
supplemented by other measures designed to reach the poor
directly if progress in alleviating poverty is to be achieved.
One important prerequisite is to expand and improve its own
understanding of who the poor are, what their needs are, and
what impact Bank operations have on them. The Bank has
taken several steps in this direction tn past years, for exam-Urban Development and Housing, Education

ple, by sponsoring workshops on issues related to rural
development and rural employment and dy setting up its Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (PBME) system (see
page 62 for a review of PBME activities in 1985). The Bank
also seeks to take direct action to alleviate poverty by selecting projects or project components for financing in a broad
range of sectors which are designed to raise the productivity
and incomes of the poor and by financing projects which are
aimed at improving their quality of life by providing access
to health facilities, education and improved physical
amenities such as water supply and housing. A review of the
Bank's operations in 1986 which are intended to have a direct
impact on poverty alleviation follows.

Increased productivity and higher incomes for small
farmers and tandless peasants are among the anticipated
benefits in six Bank projects approved in 1985. The Seti Zone
Rural Development Project in Nepal and Chirang Hill Irrigation Project in Bhutan both specifically address smallholder
on-farm development. The Cotton Development Project in
Nepal and two livestock development projects, one each in
Nepal and Bangladesh, are likewise designed to benefit small
farmers. In Pakistan, the Gujranwala Agricultural Development Project includes an agricultural credit component
directed at landless peasants. These projects will assist the
poor by introducing new farming technologies, by improving the availability of productivity-improving inputs, and by
diversifying the sources of their income through new crops,
or through new activities such as livestock.

Fuelwood remains the single most important energy
source for the poor in rural and, in many cases, urban areas.
DMCs have also become increasingly aware of the importance of their forest resources for generating off-farm employment for the rural poor as weil as for industrial uses. For these
reasons, as well as to help DMCs conserve their natural

resources, the Bank in 1985 approved two new loans for 
foresiry development, one of which will also significantly increase fuelwood supplies for both urban and rural consumers
as well as stop land erosion.

Both rural and_urban poor wiil benefit from Bank loans for

health and water supply projects. The Rural Health Project
in Papua New Guinea and a large portion of the Health and
Population Project in Indonesia will help extend heatth services and improve access to medical facilities for the rural
poor in those two countries. A water supply project in
deprived areas of Bangkok in Thailand and another in small
towns in Indonesia will help increase the availability of fresh36

drinking water and reduce the incidence of water-borne
diseases among the poor.

The Bank has increasingly sought to help the small farmer
and small-scale entrepreneur with credit channelled through
development finance institutions or other suitable intermediaries. Such Bank lending is of direct assistance to
the poor since the recipients of credit through such schemes
help reduce rural and urban unemployment and underemployment. Bank credit lines for lending to rural and agro-based
industries in Bangladesh and to the fisheries sector in Indonesia are expected to generate significant employment
opportunities for low-income semi-skilled and unskilled
workers.

Bank assistance for infrastructure development in the
poorer regions of its DMCs can also provide benefits to the
poor, albeit of a more indirect kind. In 1985, for example, the
Bank approved a loan for the development of farm-to-market
roads in Pakistan, for feeder roads in Bangladesh and for
upgrading trunk roads in Sri Lanka. These projects will provide improved access to markets for agricultural produce.
In addition, rural populations wiil become more mobile, have
easleraccess to health and education facilities, and will be
better able to respond to employment opportunities through
improved transportation.

Women in Development

Recent experience suggests that development assistance
efforts could do more to provide women wlth opportunities
to develop their potential as contributors to economic and
social progress and to improve their share of the benefits
of development in terms of increased income, expanded
employment, better educational opportunities and access to
various social amenities.

Against this background, the Board of Directors in July
1985 approved a policy paper on the Role of Women in
Development. The paper was a first step in developing a
policy aimed at ensuring that specific consideration is glven
to the rote and needs of women in all relevant aspects of the
Bank’s lending and technical assistance operations. In
developing this policy, the Bank acknowledges that from an
operational point of view its effectiveness in assisting DMCs
to achieve such Important objectives as increased income
and production, alleviation of poverty, the development of
a healthier and better educated labor force, and the reduction of population growth could be limited if it does not adequately address the factors that limit the role of women in
development. In addition, the viability and soundness of projects might be affected if adequate attention is not given to
the role of women in projects where women are potential contributors or beneficiaries. It is also acknowledged that the
social and cultural factors which influence the role and needs
of women vary substantially among countries. Consequently, the scope and thrust of activities to implement the-evolving policy will be designed to suit individual DMCs and their
development objectives and priorities.

The framework of implementation is aimed at developing
capabilities of the various units of the Bank to consider the
role and needs of women in all relavant facets of its operations. Responsibility for coordinating and monitosing the implementation of the policy has been delegated to the Irrigation and Rural Development Department.

The Bank will integrate consideration of the role and needs
of women into its normal lending and technical assistance

 

operations. The experience of other organizations has
demonstrated that this approach is most effective in
facilitating the participation of women in economic development as well as in enhancing the overall economic development impact of projects. This approach is also compatible
with the need to develop systematically the Bank's
capabilities.

As of the end of 1985, designated staff in relevant departmenis/offices had completed the first phase of the implementation program. This consisted of preparing draft work programs which will be undertaken during 1986 to develop the
necessary capabilities and procedures, These covered country programming, the preparation and implementation of projects in several subsectors, the modification of social and
economic indicators and an assessment of development
finance institutions and agricultural development banks.

Environmental Activities

In the Asia-Pacific region, the demand for natural
resources — for goods and services — is expected to increase dramaticaily during the remainder of the century. This
is due to accelerating population and economic growth and
more capital and technology-intensive production. Unless the
adverse environmental Impacts anticipated with these ac-tivities are controlled, the region’s capability to maintain the
productivity of its natural resources, assimilate wastes and
combat disease will greatiy decline.

Underlying such problems are strong political, economic
and social factors which often limit opportunities to find or
implement more beneficial methods of using natural
resources. Economic pressures force many developing nations to exploit rapidly their natural wealth at the expense
of future needs. Monitoring needs exceed the regulatory
capacities of governmental and traditional institutions. And
cultural values and popular attitudes discourage, or are inhospitable to, resource management. Nonetheless, itis now
widely realized that the constraints on effective resource
management are the same as those on economic and social
progress.

The Bank sees its role as supplementing and supporting
DMCs to manage their natural resources more effectively and
help ensure sustainable development. indeed, for some time
the Bank’s assistance in environmental planning and
management has included projects such as water supply,
sewerage, reforestation and area development. However,
more recently, greater attention has been given to environmental aspects in project identification, design, preparation and evaluation procedures. The Bank has also increased
its financing of projects which address environmental improvement. Efforts are being made to enhance the environmental awareness and expertise of Bank staff.

While these activities are helpful, the Bank is now making its environmental assistance more substantive and effective. For example, few DMC government institutions are
able to implement effective environmental poticies and procedures. Environmental impact assessment studies, integrated regional development planning and environmental
management projects are important, but they alone cannot
promote the necessary environmental management capabdility. A more fundamental, direct vehicle is called for: one that
will assist developing countries improve their national
policies and strengthen their institutional and scientific
capabilities.

In this respect, the Bank intends to promote environmental awareness among executing agency staff through
regional seminars and liaison missions. It will also emphasize
developing DMC institutional capacity to plan and manage
environmental resources by providing technical assistance
for strengthening environmental jegislation, undertaking
studies and training and equipping executing agency staff.

The preparation of environmental sector reports for inciusion in country sector strategy studies will also help to promote the integration of environmental planning and management in the Bank’s economic development activities. These
reports are aimed at delineating planning and management
needs, development programs and potential projects with
which to correct critica! cases of loss or degradation of environmental and natural resources. Moreover, development
policies and procedures and legal and institutional arrangements affecting or likely to affect natural resources

management, environmental quatity and the prospects for
sustainable development are examined and evaluated. This
helps to define the Bank’s role in fostering sound environmental planning and management practices, particularly
with respect to economic development programs and projects and environmental! and natural resources projects per se.

Inter-Agency Cooperation

To ensure that its assistance is coordinated with that of
other agencies; the Bank maintains regular contact with other
institutions, both multilateral and bilateral, involved in the
socio-economic progress of the Asia-Pacific region.

The President of the Bank hosted the meeting of the heads
of multilateral financial institutions and attended the
Development Committee Meeting. Both meetings took place
in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in October.

Regular consultations are held with the World Bank Group:
thus, a one-day consultation reviewing cooperation and coordination between the two institutions was held in Bangkok
following the Bank's 1985 Annual Meeting. Bank staff also
regularly visit World Bank offices in the Bank's DMCs. Operational programs, sector issues and coordination have regularly been discussed, particularly with World Bank staff in
Bangkok, Dhaka, Islamabad, Jakarta, Kathmandu and Manila.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is an
important source of grant assistance for the Bank's program.
The Bank has traditionally been represented at UNDP's
Governing Council Meeting and Inter-Agency Consultative
Meeting. At the latter, lending programs were reviewed for
co-financing opportunities. As well, Bank staff regularly visit
resident representatives to apprise them of potential! projects and update them on the progress of UNDP-financed
operations executed by the Bank. In addition, the Bank
cooperated with the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) on two projects, the first appraising and
administering a project in Nepal and the second appraising
and subsequently co-financing a project in Pakistan. The
Bank also arranged one project in Pakistan for co-financing
with the OPEC Fund for International Development.

The Bank participates regularly in aid group meetings,
where donor institutions meet with government representatives to discuss such matters as economic and social
developments in the DMCs, external financing needs and aid
coordination. In 1985, the Bank participated in aid-group
meetings for Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka; and donors’ meetings for Kiribati and
Western Samoa, The Bank also attended the India Consortium Meeting as an observer, and participated in a conference
hosted by the World Bank to discuss the Republic of Korea’s
forthcoming Sixth Five-Year Plan (1987-1991).

Frequent discussions were held with individual bilateral

donors, and in this respect the Bank’s Bangladesh Resident.

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy for
Bangiadesh focuses on the development of selected sectors
and subsectors which are accorded high priority within the
framework and objectives of the country’s development plans
as welt as the Bank’s lending policies. The broad objectives
of the strategy are: (i} increased agricultural production and
increased agro-industria! activity; (ii) development of indigenous energy resources to reduce reliance on imported
commercial energy; (iii) selected improvement of social conditions, particularly in areas of population control, health and
education; and {iv} development/improvement of key infrastructure facilities.

In the agriculture sector, the emphasis is on increasing
foodgrain production, broadening the production base
through crop diversification and strengthening linkages between agriculture and agro-industry. Selective assistance is
also sought for non-crop projects such as fisheries and
livestock. In energy, the Bank is concentrating on the development of gas wells, selected gas transmission and distribution programs, as well as power generation, transmission and
distribution. The Bank has also encouraged adequate energy
pricing for the better utilization of energy resources and improved mobilization of domestic resources. In social development, the Bank's assistance is basically through financing
selected education projects as well as water supply and
health and family planning projects. Bank assistance in these
soclally-oriented sectors has been limited, however, due to
the limited absorptive capacity of executing agencies and
to the high local currency cost contents of these projects.
In development of infrastructure, the Bank seeks to support
the programs for rehabilitation of rural roads, inland waterways and railways, improvement of facilities and construction of road networks,

The implementation of the Bank’s operational strategy is
facilitated by the Bangladesh Resident Office (BRO) which
continues to play an important role in government liaison,
aid coordination, country programming activities, and project formulation, review and implementation. in 1885, the Resident Director attended the Bangladesh Aid Consortium
Meeting in Paris and chaired a number of donor coordination meetings in Dhaka. Staff of BRO also regularly attended jocal consultative group meeiings.

   
 

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1985, the Bank approved six loans amounting to $212.3 million for six projects
in Bangladesh from ADF, compared with four loans for $306.8
million approved in 1984. Local currency financing of $59.8
million was provided for three projects, equivalent to 28.2 per
cent of total lending to Bangladesh in 1985, Co-financing with
UNDP and ihe Government of France amounted to $10,5
million in four projects. A program loan of $39 million for provision of fertilizer was also approved. Of the six projects approved, three were in the agriculture sector and one each in
the power, transport and industry sectors.

In the agriculture sector, the Second Livestock Development Project will assist the Government in increasing food
production and improving rural incomes through the expansion of veterinary services and on-farm livestock nutrition.

the Feeder Roads Project will heip provide year-round reliable
transport through 310 km. of rural roads located in the northern part of the country.

Of the nine technica! assistance grants approved in 1985
for an amount of $7.5 million, two were advisory and operational and seven were project preparatory. Five of the
technical assistance projects were in the agriculture sector,
two in the power sector and one each in the gas and transport
sectors.

As of 31 December 1985, the Bank had approved 66 loans
to Bangladesh amounting to $1,838.6 million for 60 projects.
Of this amount, $11.4 million was from OCR and $4,827.2
million from ADF. The Bank had also provided technical
assistance amounting to $34.3 million for 79 projects, of
which 35 had resulted in Bank loans amounting to $1,169
million. The Bank had extended six program joans amounting to $163.3 million and three sector loans for $207 million
to Bangiadesh. Of total Bank lending to the country,
agricuiture and agro-industry received the largest share (49.3
per cent), followed by energy (29.3 per cent), transport and
communications (8.1 per cent}, industry including development banks {7.1 per cent), education (3.1 per cent), public
health (2.3 per cent) and water supply (0.8 per cent}.

Project Implementation: Of the 66 loans (including one
Special Assistance loan) made to Bangladesh as of
31 December 1985, 20 had been completely disbursed and
46 were under adminisiration, of which five were awaiting
loan effectivity. Disbursements totalled $145.5 million during 1985, a significant improvement over the $77.7 million
in 1984. Three loans were closed during the year. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank loans at the end of December 1985

 

amounted to $524.4 million or 32.4 per cent of the total
amount of effective loans.

Current implementation problems and issues as discussed
during the two Country Project Review meetings conducted
in Bangladesh in 1985 include inadequate provision of local
counterpart funds which was partly due to categorization of
some projects as non-core projects in the Annual Development Program, import and shipping restrictions applied to
ongoing Bank-financed projects, a general ban on procurement of vehicles, and delays in submission of progress
teports and audited financial statements. In discussions between the Country Project Review Missions and key government Officiats, the latter promised to take up these matters
with the concerned agencies and there is a strong possibility that these issues will be resolved satisfactorily.

The Government has already adopted major policy decisions and initiated a number of measures leading to greater
delegation of authority to field offices, simplification of procedures for loan approval, operation and maintenance requirements inciuding recruitment of adequate staff and their
training, and higher compensation for government personnel. These steps are expected to mitigate substantially the
previously recurrent problems of insufficient delegation, frequent changes of project staff, iengthy procedures for contract approval and lack of adequate incentives for government personnel.

Bhutan

Operational Strategy: !n Bhutan’s present stage of

port base. The Bank will aiso emphasize institution building
in order to strengthen the planning, project implementation
and monitoring capacity of the Government.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1985, the Bank provided a loan of $3.48 million from ADF for the Chirang Hil!
Irrigation Project. This compared with $7.4 million approved
in 1984. The Chirang Hill Irrigation Project, the first project
Joan to Shutan after two multiproject loans approved in 1983
and 1984, respectively, is aimed at improving agricultural output and rural incomes while reversing the current process
of watershed degradation in the project area.

During the year, the Bank also approved five technical
assistance projects totalling $1.5 million, of which two were
for project preparation (Road Construction and Training and
Highiand Livestock Development) and the other three for adyisory and operational purposes (Manpower Development
and Training, Planning and Development of integrated Rural
Service Centers, and the Food Corporation of Bhutan). The
Government of Switzerland co-financed $350,000 on a grant
basis for the Manpower Development and Training Project.
To date, Bank iending to Bhutan amounts to $15.9 million
in three loans and technical assistance amounts to $2.9
million for 13 projects.

Project Imp!ementation: implementation of the First and
Second Multiproject loans is progressing satisfactorily.
However, there have been some delays due to the unfamiliarity of government officials with Bank procedures. This is expected to be a major constraint on project implementation
in Bhutan for the near future but the Bank is addressing the
problem by providing technical assistance for project planning and implementation, and by including government officials in Bank-sponsored training programs, The Chirang Hill
Irrigation Project, approved in September 1985, is still at the
inception stage. The first disbursements to Bhutan, totalling
$1.6 million, were made in 1985.

Burma

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s lending program in
Burma supports the objectives and priorities of the country’s
Fourth Four-Year Plan (1982/83-1985/86}. The main strategy
of the Plan is to consolidate gains achieved in earlier plans
with an emphasis on agriculture, the main vehicle for
transforming the economy. The Bank endorses the Government’s strategy of increasing investment for post-harvest activities for paddy and rice as well as intensified production
and qualitative improvements in non-paddy crops. The Bank

their usefut life. Institution building is also stressed, fo ease
institutional and manpower constraints on Burma’s capacity to absorb development assistance.

Loans and Technical Assistance: No loans were
approved for Burma in 1985. Substantial preparatory activities
telated to the processing of a proposed Edible Oil Project
were, however, carried out during the year.’ In 1985, the
Bank approved a technical assistance grant to prepare a
Smali-Scale Irrigation Sector loan. in addition, technical
assistance was approved for the preparation of the Provincial and Smal! Towns Water Supply Project. This grant was
financed by UNDP, with the Bank acting as Executing
Agency.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had provided 31 loans to

Fiji

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy in
Fiji supports the Governmeni’s principal long-term objectives,
as enunciated in its recantly-released Ninth Development
Pian, of economic growth and employment generation. This
will be achieved by focusing Bank jending and technical
assistance activities on increasing productivity and diversifying the country’s economic base as well as by developing
supportive infrastructure for agriculture and manufacturing.
The strategy also emphasizes supporting the role of the
private sector in economic development. Sectoraily, Bank
assistance will be directed at improving productivity and
diversifying the agricultural base at a level compatible with
the sector’s absorptive capacity; developing/improving road
and marine transportation facilities; energy development; and
lending to the private sector directly or indirectiy through
development finance institutions.

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1985, the Bank approved a loan of $7 miilion to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
to finance development projects primarily in the private sector. The Bank loan will be utilized mainly for extending
subloans for projects in the industrial and service sectors.
The Project will be co-financed by IBRD in the amount of $6.5
million. In addition, the Bank approved an equity line of
$250,000 to supplement FDB’s equity investment fund for
financing equity investments in industrial and service sector enterprises. The Bank also approved a technicalCumulative Bank Lending to Fiji

amounting to $56.1 million for seven projects. The energy sec
tor accounted for two-thirds of cumulative Bank lending to .

the country. In addition, technical assistance totalling $1.94
million was provided for 14 projects, of which seven were for
project preparation and seven were advisory and operational
in nature.

Project implementation: Of the seven loans approved to
Fiji, three had been completely disbursed and four were under

Impiementation of Bank-financed projects has generally
been satisfactory although occasional delays have been experienced in the recruitment of consultants and acquisition
of land for project use. Improvement in coordination among
agencies involved in the implementation of projects is also
required. A temporary freeze on wages and recruitment of
new staff was in force in 1885 and unless lifted soon may
adversely affect project implementation. Another problem is
the lack of familiarity of local project staff with the Bank’s
procedures for withdrawa! of funds. However, this is being
addressed through briefings provided by Bank missions.

{n 1985, Bank staff visited India to discuss with appropriate
government agencies and officials the commencement of

be of priority tentatively include industry, power and ports.

Indonesia

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy in
Indonesia is directed at supporting priority projects in
agriculture, energy and education, Including manpower
development. Bank strategy in the agriculture sector is aimed
mainty at supporting the Government's efforts to diversify
the agricultural base and optimize resource use. In the energy
sector, the Bank's strategy supports the Government's pian
to reduce the country’s dependence on oil as a source of
energy by developing non-oll and renewable resources and
improving energy demand management and conservation.
Bank assistance to education and institutional development
In Indonesia Is of special significance in view of the severefy IImlted availability of trained and skilled manpower. On
a salective basis, Bank assistance is extended to support
physical infrastructure, such as ports and roads, and social
infrastructure projects in urban development, water supply
and health and population.

in 1985, the Bank also provided $1.4 million tn technical
assistance for six projects, compared with $1.7 million for
nine projects in 1984. Project preparatory technical
assistance totalled $1.1 million for five projects and advisory
and operational technical assistance amounted to $350,000
for one project. Four of the projects were in the agriculture
sector (two in irrigation and one each in forestry and cash
crops) and one each for transport and education projects.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had approved 112 loans
totalling $3,454 million to Indonesia for 107 projects. Of these
loans, 89, amounting to $3,291.7 million, were from OCR and

23, amounting to $162.3 million, were from ADF. The Bank
had also provided technical assistance totalling more than
$20.5 million for 105 projects, of which 61 have resulted in
Bank loans amounting to $2,206 million. Bank lending activities have generaily followed the Bank's operational
strategy in Indonesia and the country's development
priorities as embodied in successive national development
pians, with agriculture accounting for 37 per cent of
cumulative Bank lending, followed by energy development
with 19 per cent.

million during the year, compared with $160.3 million in 1984.
Seven loans were closed during the year.

Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1985
totalled $949.7 million, or 33.3 per cent of the total amount
of effective foans. The pace of implementation of Bankassisted projects has been slow. This has been a matter of
concern to the Government and the Bank, and the Government has adopted measures intended to overcome the constraints to project implementation such as (i) defining clearly
the responsibilities for approval of procurement contracts,
budget releases and letters of credit, (if) introducing greater
flexibility in the application of Government's policy regarding
use of Jocal products and services, and (iii) resolving problems relating to consultants’ billing rates and tax levies.

Korea, Republic of

Operational Strategy: +The Bank’s operational strategy for
the Republic of Korea, in conformity with the Government’s
priorities and strategies, focuses on social development,
structural adjustment in the energy sector, and industrial
development and restructuring through private sector initiatives. The Bank will aiso give due consideration to physical
infrastructure bottlenecks impeding the achievement of these
objectives. Bank assistance to social infrastructure projects
will help promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits
of economic growth. In the energy sector, Bank assistance
will emphasize energy rationalization and development of
domestic resources to help reduce the country’s high
dependence on imported energy. In the areas of industrial
restructuring, the Bank’s operational strategy continues to
envisage support to development finance institutions that
traditionally finance private sector industrial units. Small and
medium-scale industries and science and technology, including research and development and manpower development, will receive special attention in view of their importance
in the industrial restructuring process. Assistance to physical
infrastructure will contribute to balanced regional development besides supporting industrial restructuring objectives
and will focus on the development of roads and ports.

Loans and Technica! Assistance: In 1985, the Bank approved three loans totalling $167 million from OCR to the
Republic of Korea, compared with four loans amounting to
$174 million in 1984.

in the energy sector, the Southern Seoul! District Heating
Project was the first of its kind to be considered for Bank
financing. The innovative approach to the conservation and
utilization of heretofore wasted heat energy from a thermal

power plant is envisaged to have wider applications in the
country as well as in other DMCs, The Third Sewage Treatment Project was the Bank’s first social infrastructure project in which the private secior will play a major role in project financing. In the development finance institution (DFI)
sector, the sixth loan to the Korea Long Term Credit Bank
(KLB) marked a significant increase in the level of cofinancing associated with BFI lending in the Republic of
Korea, with co-financing totalling $70 million.

The Bank's technical assistance program in the Republic
of Korea in 1985 consisted of two project preparatory grants
{Third Sewage Treatment and Sewage Treatment Sector) for
a total amount of $143,000.

By the end of 1985, the Bank had approved 74 loans totalling $2,146.5 million to the Republic of Korea. Of these, 73
loans ($2,112.8 million) were from OCR and one ($3.7 miilian)
from ADF. The Bank’s first equity investment in the country, amounting to $0.96 million equivalent, was approved in
December 1983. The Bank has also provided 28 technical
assistance grants totalling $4.1 million comprising five for
advisory and operational purposes ($1.4 million) and 23 for
the preparation of projects ($2.6 million), 16 of which have
resulted to date in 21 investment Bank loans amounting to
$715.6 million.

in addition, co-financing, already induced or expected to

be induced, in an amount of $402 million has been arranged.
Of the Bank’s total lending, two-thirds has been in sectors
directly supporting the country's industrialization efforts —
industry, development banks, energy and transport, In lending through DFis, there has been a shift to a more balanced
allocation of funds for the support of small and medium-scale
industries. In recent years, the Government has also
increased investment in the soclal infrastructure sector. This
change in emphasis is reflected in the Bank's lending since
1977, during which period over one-third of its assistance has
been for social infrastructure. While this assistance has also
had an industry-supportive aspect, a major objective has
been to improve the quality of life commensurate with the
country’s rapid material development. There has also been
@ rise in Bank lending to the energy sector in response to
increased energy consumption levels and the country’s
dearth of indigenous fuels.

Project implementation: Of the 74 loans approved to the
Republic of Korea, 48 had been completely disbursed, two
weré cancelled and 24 were under-administration, including
three that were awaiting effectivity. Disbursements totalled
$124.2 million during 1985, compared with $136.5 miillon in
1984,.Seven loans were closed during the year. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1986 toialled
$1,321.1 million or 74.8 per cent of the total amount of effective loans. :

Overall, the progress of Bank-financed projects in the
Republic of Korea has been satisfactory and no serious prob
- lems were encountered in 1985. However, some difficulties

were experienced in the provision of local currency financIng, particularly in projects Implemented by local governments. Utilization of DFI credits was also slow due to lower
demand for foreign currency loans brought about by the slack
in economic activity, competition from commercial banks,
and the relaxation of government policy allowing conversion
of Won into foreign currency for the importation of materials
and equipment by the industrial sector.

During 1985, the Bank initiated discussions on measures
to improve project accounting and auditing procedures in
government agencies involved in project implementation.

Lao PDR

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy in
Lao PDR is aimed at (i} generating much-needed foreign exchange by developing the country’s export potential; and
(ii) better integrating the economy and stimulating production in rural areas by providing basic infrastructure facilities.
To achieve these objectives, support is channelled toward
developing hydropower resources and power transmission,
forestry and wood processing and road transport.

Loans and Technical Assistance: No loans or technical
assistance were approved by the Bank to Lao PDR in 1985.
Substantial work was undertaken during the year, however,
on the proposed Xeset Hydropower Construction Project with
the near compietion of the Bank's engineering loan extended for the project in 1984.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had provided 12 loans for

ADF. Technical assistance totalling $6 million had been provided for 22 projects, of which seven have resulted in Bank
loans amounting to $53.5 million. The sectoral distribution
of cumulative Bank lending reflected the emphasis given to
developing forest-based industries for export, stimulating activities in rural areas and developing energy resources for
both domestic use and export.

Project Implementation: Of the 12 loans approved to Lao
PDR, five had been completely disbursed and seven were
under administration at the end of 1985. Disbursements totalled $4.3 million during 1985, compared with $2 million in
1984. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end
of 1985 amounted to $28.8 million or 53.3 per cent of the total
amount of effective loans.

Although ongoing Bank-financed projects in Lao PDR are
generally progressing satisfactorily, manpower and institutional constraints have hamstrung the country’s capability
to implement development projects. To help atieviate this
problem, the Bank has provided a technical assistance grant
under which the Government established the Project \mplementation Advisory Services Unit (PIASU) to assist executing agencies in the implementation of Bank-financed
projects. Also, under the same technical assistance, three
Lao government officials who will manage the PIASU underwent training in the Bank for two months.

Malaysia

Operational Strategy: In Malaysia, the Bank’s operational
strategy supports the main objective of the New Economic
Policy — fostering structural change by redressing economic
and social imbalances, Two areas of prime importance are

regional development, manpower development and social infrastructure., in agricutture, the Bank is guided by the objectives of the Nationa! Agricultural Policy to improve farm productivity and diversify the income of farmers; regional
development has a focus on relatively poor areas; manpower
development is supported through rehabilitating and expanding technical and vocational education institutions; and basic
needs of the poor are provided through social infrastructure
facilities. In the energy sector, exploiting the country’s considérable natural gas reserves, developing hydroelectric
power, and broadly diversifying energy sources remain the
highest priorities of the Government and are supported by
the Bank. Another important area is the development of ports
to facilitate exports. The Bank’s future strategy wiil assist,
at the Government's initiative, plans to develop the private
sector through equity participation and/or financing of private
industries, elther directly or through development finance
institutions.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending io
Malaysia amounted to $132.4 million from OGR in 1985, compared with $159.9 million approved in 1984. A total of four
loans {including one sector loan and one technical
assistance loan for $1.8 miltlon} were approved, three in the
agriculture sector for integrated agricultural development and
one for regional development. This pattern is consistent with
the Bank's overall lending strategy in Malaysia.

Nine technical assistance grants totalting $2.1 million were
approved in 1985, compared with five grants totalling $1.1
milion In 1984, Advisory and operational technical assistance
amounted to $885,000 for three projects. Three projects were
in the agriculture sector, two for urban and regional development and one each for energy, water supply, health and environmental improvement.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had approved 59 loans
totaling $1,177 million for 57 projects, all but one of them
from ADF. In addition, technical assistance totalling $6.2

resulted in Bank foans amounting to $230.9 million. The sectoral distribution of cumulative Bank lending to Malaysia partly refiects the past emphasis on physical infrastructure
development and, partly, the more recent thrust in agriculture
and social infrastructure development. Consequently, the
portfolio of Bank-assisted projects In Malaysia is spread
relatively evenly among the different sectors.

implementation of Bank-financed projects in Malaysia has
been generally satisfactory. However, cutbacks in budgetary
ailocations in 1983 and 1984 for the Government’s public investment program caused a slowdown in developmental expenditures and this affected Bank-financed projects, The
situation improved somewhat in 1985 and altocations provided in the 1986 budget are now. considered adequate. Partly
because of budgetary constraints, and partly due to the slow
pace of contract awards and delays in submission of
withdrawal applications, the disbursement total was jess in
1985 than in 1984. This matter has been discussed with
Malaysian authorities and remedial measures are being taken
by the Government. Several important projects, including the
Batang Ai and Trengganu Hydropower projects and the two
water projects covering the states of Johore, Kelantan, Perak
and Trengganu were substantially completed in 1985.

Maldives

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s assistance program in
Maldives has focused on transport, communications and
power infrastructure to support the directly productive investments Maldives has made with other assistance. This
emphasis is expected to continue.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1985, the Bank provided a technical assistance grant of $0.2 million to review
the technical and financial operation of inter-island vessels.

The Bank has so far provided two loans, both from ADF,
to Maldives for the development of inter-island transport ($1
mitlion in 1981) and a muitiproject loan ($2.4 million in 1984)
for five subprojects supporting ports, communications and
power infrastructure. In addition, the Bank has provided.three
technical assistance grants to prepare a feasibility study for
the inter-island project, to assist the Government in identifying and planning priority development projects, and to
prepare subprojects under the multiproject loan.

Project Implementation: Disbursements totalled $0.08
million during 1985, compared with $0.03 million in 1984.
Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans at the end of 1985
amounted to $0.8 miilion or 23.9 per cent of the total amount
of effective loans.

Nepal

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational strategy in
Nepal focuses on agricuiture and is designed to enhance
agricultural productivity, increase food intake and diversify
agricuitural products. This genera! objective is pursued
through broadly-based strengthening of the agriculture sector
and crop intensification aimed at significantly increasing productivity. Particular emphasis is placed on constructing irrigation facilities, developing rural infrastructure including
electrification, providing agricultural inputs and agricultural
credit and reversing ecological deterioration, At this stage
of Nepal’s development, Bank lending to the non-agricultural

‘sectors basically supports the development of agriculture

in a way that ensures satisfactory linkage with other sectors
while assisting the long-term diversification of the economy.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to Nepal
amounted to $58 million for four laans from ADF in 1985, compared with $60.7 million approved in 7984. The loans approved
in 1985 were all in the agriculture sector and included local
cost financing of $25.9 million. The projects were designed
to increase cotton production in three Terai districts; to increase rural incomes and raise nutritional jevels through
livestock development; to provide access road and basic
agricultural support services to the remote Seti Zone; and
to develop cost-effective targe-scale forestry plantation in
order to produce fuelwood for the domestic markets.

The Bank also approved seven technical assistance projects amounting to $5.1 million in 1985. Of these, $3 million
was provided by UNDP for two projects (Cotton Development
and Second Livestock Development), $0.85 million by the
Government of Finland for the Master Plan for Forestry
Development Project and $0.1 million by IFAD for the Second
Small Farmers Development Project. in addition to these cofinanced technical assistance projects, the Bank provided
funds for the preparation of the East Rapti Irrigation and Hill
Fruit Development Projects and one advisory technical
assistance for the Third Forestry Development Project.

As of end-December 1985, the Bank had approved 48 loans
totalling $498.3 million for 40 projects in Nepal. With one exception, all ioans were from ADF. in addition, technical
assistance amounting to $26.2 mitlion for 70 projects had
been provided or administered by the Bank. Of the 37 project preparatory technical assistance projects, 23 nad resulted

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s operational strategy,
as recommended in the recently-compileted Pakistan Strategy
Study — Strategies for Economic Growth and Development The Bank's Role in Pakistan (July 1985) — envisages that the
main goals for Bank assistance in Pakistan should be
balanced growth and improved equity, to be achieved through
activities designed to promote appropriate structural change,
improve economic efficiency and strengthen development
institutions. The Bank’s primary commitments in Pakistan
should remain with agriculture, energy and industry. The further development of social and other infrastructure, however,
should aiso merit Bank attention as improvements in these
sectors are a precondition for sustained long-term overall
economic growth and structural change.

The major focus of Bank assistance in agriculture will be
toward increasing the productivity and output of the major
crops, with diversification and minor crops to be supported
as a secondary and longer-term objective. The Bank's involvement in the energy sector will focus on a program of gradualdiversification. While maintaining a continuing interest in the
power sector, with particular emphasis on acting as a
catalyst to mobilize co-financing for the sector and on improving operational efficiency, increased attention will be
given to assisting the Government in finding ways to
moderate energy usage and to increase the supply of indigenous energy resources. In the industrial sector, the
Government plans to bring about a transformation through
policies of deregulation, tariff reforms and privatization. In
this context, the Bank’s support during the transition period
will be of considerable importance. Traditional lending
through the DFls will be continued; however, the Bank should
seek new areas and develop diversified modalities such as
equity investment, leasing, direct tending to private industry
and industrial parks development. Bank assistance to the
social sectors will be increased from the past low levets, with
an emphasis on education, primary health care and improvement of the environment in major urban centers.

Loans and Technical Assistance: [n 1985, Bank lending
to Pakistan amounted to $571.6 million ($292.8 million from
ADF and $278.8 mitlion from OGR) for nine projects, compared with $347 million ($209.8 million from ADF and $137.2

OPEC Fund, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, ltaly, the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, IFAD, UNDP
and the Government of Switzerland.

Agriculture accounted for 32.2 per cent of the Bank's lending to Pakistan during 1985. The three loans in the agriculture
sector helped finance surface water development including
rehabititation of irrigation infrastructure and development of
small dams. in the energy sector, which accounted for 28 per
cent of lending to Pakistan in 1985, one project was designed
to help ease the severe power shortage situation in the country by a further expansion of hydroelectric capacity at Tarbela
Dam and one was for the development of natural gas. The
Bank also provided its first loan for the upgrading of farmto-market roads. A telecommunications project will help
finance a significant portion of the Government's telecommunications expansion plan. In education, Bank assistance
was provided to improve the quality of the country's science
education program. The Bank’s eleventh loan through OF Is
will provide foreign exchange resources to five participating
financing institutions for sublending to industrial projects
sponsored by the private sector.

The Bank approved eight technical assistance projects to
Pakistan in 1985 totalling $2.7 million {of which $1.3 miltion
was financed by UNDP} compared with $2.2 million for nine
projects in 1984. Project preparatory technical assistance
amounted to $0.7 million for four projects and advisory and
operational technical assistance amounted to nearly $2
million for four projects. There were two projects each in the
energy, agriculture and industry sectors and one each in
transport and telecommunications.

The Bank has so far provided 80 loans totalling $2,684.1

Delays in the implementation of Bank-financed projects
have been experienced particularly in the agriculture, irrigation, water supply and social Infrastructure sectors. These
delays have been due mainly to interna! government pro
« cedures for project approvals which are related to overall
planning and budgetary requirements. Since 1983, the
Government and the Bank have been hoiding semi-annual
Country Project Review meetings to discuss implementation

to PNG (of which $16.4 million was from OCR and $8.5
milfion from ADF) compared with $33.2 million approved in
1984, A loan for the Ports Development Project wilt be used
to provide adequate and efficient port facilities at four ports
in the country to help meet the requirements of domestic and
overseas trade. The Second Rural Heath Services Project
is aimed at Improving the delivery of health and health-related
services In 13 of the country’s 19 provinces not covered under
the Bank's First Rural Health Services Project approved in
1982. The 1985 technical assistance pragram to PNG totalled

Philippines

Operational Strategy: Since the emergence of the
economic crisis in 1983, Bank operations in the Philippines
have been adapted to assist the country in a period of extreme economic uncertainty and difficulty and severe
resource constraints. This situation continued during 1985.
The Bank’s operational strategy in the Philippines in the
short-term, therefore, focuses on the completion of ongoing
projects which have high rates of return; the rehabilitation/improvement of existing infrastructure facilities; and on highpriority new projects characterized by shost gestation
periods, minimum locaj currency requirements and favorabie
balance-of-payments impact. At the same time, the Bank will
continue to provide support, when circumstances permit, for
selected “conventionai” projects which have a longer-term
developmental impact and a social equity dimension built
into them,’

Loans and Technical Assistance: Due to a continuing
severe shortage of counterpart funds and consequent
stowdown in the implementation and loan disbursements for
nearly all of the Bank’s ongoing projects in the country, no
new loans were provided to the Philippines in 1985. in
response to these circumstances, the Bank established a

yisory purposes. Three projects were in fisheries and
livestock, and one each in integrated area development, rural
water supply and the energy sector.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had approved 76 loans to
the country totalling $2,111 million for 70 projects including
an agricultural inputs program loan. Of these loans, 68
amounting to $2,031.7 million were from OCR and eight
amounting to $79.3 million were from ADF. In addition,
technical assistance totalling $15.7 million had been provided
for 71 projects, of which 27 have resulted in Bank loans
amounting to $928.1 million. Bank lending to the Philippines
has emphasized the agriculture and agro-industry sector,
which accounts for 33.9 per cent of total cumulative lending
to the country, and the energy sector, which accounts for
26.8 per cent.

Project Implementation: {In the Philippines, of the 76
loans (including one Specia! Assistance loan) approved, 32
had been completely disbursed and 44 were under administration as of the end of 1985. Disbursements totalled
$112 million during 1985, compared with $172.3 million in
1984. Seven loans were closed during the year. Cumulative
disbursements of Bank foans at the end of 1985 totalled
$1,104.2 million or 55.7 per cent of the total amount of effective loans.

In 1985, Implementation of Bank-financed projects continued to suffer from insufficlent budgetary allocations. During the year, the Bank and the Government worked very closely to ensure that scarce financia} resources were directed
to foreign-assisted projects with the highest priority. Furthermore, the less essential components of some projects were
cancelled, As a result of the close cooperation between the
Government and the Bank, priority projects in the power and
road sectors were provided with sufficient funds to permit
moderate progress. Frequent meetings were held with officlals at alt levels of the Government to discuss pressing
problems and issues related to project implementation. A

Sri Lanka

Operational Strategy: The Bank’s lending strategy in Sri
Lanka Is designed to help reverse the deterioration of capital
assets and undertake structuraj adjustments needed to
redirect the thrust of agricultural and energy development.
Improving the structure of Sri Lanka’s external account and
supporting the transition to a market-oriented economy,
which lie at the core of the Government’s development
strategy, provide underlying themes to the Bank’s operational
strategy in the country.

Loans and Technical Assistance: in 1985, the Bank approved three loans totalling $54.4 miilion from ADF to Sri
Lanka, compared with two loans totalling $56 million in 1984.
Local cosi financing amounted to $7.4 million, or 13.6 per
cent of Bank lending to Sri Lanka in 1985.

Two loans approved during 1985 will assist government
efforts to rehabilitate capital assets in the power distribu:
tion and trunk roads sectors, respectively, and to assist executing agencies to manage their assets more efficiently.
The third, the Development Financing loan, will augment the
foreign exchange resources of two DFis (the National
Development Bank of Sri Lanka and the Development
Finance Corporation of Ceylon) for onlending to the private
sector. This loan has also provided a vehicle for a dialogue
with the Government, in coordination with [DA and the IMF,
on policy change in the industry and finance sectors.

in addition, the Bank provided technical assistance for the
preparation of two projects: Land Use Planning and Kirindi
Oya (Phase fi}, Two advisory and operational technical
assistance grants were also provided, one to strengthen traffic planning and regulation in the roads sector and the other
to develop an accounting and audit education master plan.
The technical assistance provided by the Bank totalled $0.72
million.

As of the end of 1985, the Bank had provided 40 loans
amounting to $466.2 million for 34 projects in the country.
Of these, six loans totalling $14.1 million were from OCR and
34 loans amounting to $452 million were from ADF. Technical
assistance totatling $6.3 million {including $1.8 million
financed by the Government of Switzerland and EEC) had
been approved for 41 projects, of which 19 had resulted in
Bank joans amounting to $293.2 million. The agriculture and
agro-industry sector had accounted for 64 per cent of
cumulative Bank iending to Sri Lanka.

Thailand

Operational Strategy: The. Bank's fending strategy in
Thailand is based on complementing the Government's
policies and programs aimed towards achieving (i) increased
efficiency in the productive sectors and supporting infrastructure; and (ii) qualitative improvements in the administrative
and financial budgetary operations of the public sector. Thus,
emphasis is accorded by the Bank towards provision of basic
infrastructure facilities, promotion of private sector activities,
and continued involvement in the energy and agriculture
sectors. In infrastructure, the Bank will continue to support
the development of the country’s transport and communicatlons network and water supply systems. in industry and
manutacturing, the Bank supports Government efforts to
stimulate.a more broadly based and greater flow of capital
to the private sector. In energy, the Bank will continue fo provide assistance to ensure increased utilization of indigenous
energy resources, particularly lignite. In agriculture, Bank
assistance will emphasize programs and projects to assist
the Government's efforts in redirecting the focus of
agriculture towards crop diversification and export-oriented,
agro-based industries.

Loans and Technical Assistance and Equity: Bank
lending to Thalland in 1985 totalled $168.9 millicn in two OCR
loans for two projects, compared with $195.2 million for twoprojects in 1984. A joan for the Third Bangkok Water Supply
Project will provide additional safe, piped water supply to
residents as well as commercial and institutional
establishments in the capital. Co-financing from Japan's
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) amounting to
$88.6 million will cover part of the cost of the water supply
project. An urban development loan for the Shelter Sector
will improve the housing conditions of low-income urban
dwellers. This project will be co-financed by the Government
of Switzerland in the amount of $0.58 million.

In addition, the Bank in 1985 provided technical assistance
to formulate a mangrove forestry development project and
to prepare projects to provide a second navigational channei for access to Bangkok Port and the next stage improvement and expansion of water supply facilities in the Bangkok
metropolitan area. Advisory and operational technical
assistances were also provided to: (i} assist the Industrial
Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) establish a small
industry credit guarantee fund to promote direct lending to
smali-scale industries; (ii) help the National Economic and
Social Development Board {NESDB) improve Its system of
monitoring and supervising the financial performance. of
state enterprises; (iii) assist the Government in developing
a systematic and effective approach to land resource evaluatlon and planning; and (iv) assist the Board of Investment to
prepare a five-year program to promote private sector
investments in the chemical and engineering industries. The
Bank is also acting as administrator for two advisory and
operational technical assistance projects prepared by the
Bank and financed by the Government of Switzerland for consultant services for the Shelter Sector loan and for the undertaking of a study on the use of mass and group media for
disseminating agricuttural information to farmers.

Bank-assisted projects in the energy, transportation, water
supply and development banks sectors have been
implemented successfully, as most of the executing
agencies involved have extensive experience in project work.
The implementation of agricultural projects, which
encountered various difficulties in 1984, showed
considerable improvement in 1985, Where major weaknesses
in project implementation capability have been found, Bank
assistance was provided by review missions which were more
frequent and more intensive in 1985.

Smaller South Pacific Developing Member
Countries'

Operational Strategy: Recognizing the unique
characteristics of the smaller South Pacific Developing
Member Countries (SPDMCs) as a group as well as individually, the Bank has adopted a flexible approach in its strategy
and operating procedures to make them compatible with
each country’s particular needs and characteristics. In this
context, the Bank has emphasized providing necessary
physical and social infrastructure facilities, frequently in the
form of muitiproject ioans covering several smail projects
in key sectors. Support has also been channelled through
credit lines to national development banks, In addition, the
Bank has focused on institution building through human
resource development.

Since its establishment In 1984, the South Pacific Regional
Office (SPRO) has gradually assumed the authority delegated
to itt this embraces a wide range of Bank operationa!
activities. In 1885, the SPRO started to assist in the formulation and implementation of the Bank’s operational strategy
tor Cook Islands, Kiribati, Solomon Isiands, Tonga and
Vanuatu, and helped to prepare country programs for these
countries. SPRO was also able to assume the administration of DFl loans for most of the smaller SPDMCs and to
administer several ongoing projects in other sectors.

Loans and Technical Assistance: In 1985, the Bank
approved one multiproject loan each to Vanuatu and Western
Samoa. The aggregate total of these two loans amounted
to $7.4 million from ADF. The loan to Vanuatu, which will be
co-financed by IDA in the amount of $2 million, will help
develop and/or upgrade road, wharf and school bullding
facilities, while that for Western Samoa, which will be cofinanced by IDA in the amount of $2.5 milton, will help

grants for these four countries amounted to $1.13 million;
in addition, $0.25 million was provided by UNDP to co-finance
the technical assistance project for Western Samoa.

At the end of 1985, the Bank had approved 41 loans
amounting to $87.7 million for 38 projects in the smaller
SPDMGCs. Technical assistance totalling about $9.5 million
for 65 projects, of which 16 had resulted in Bank loans

the year. Cumulative disbursements of Bank loans totalled
$58.2 million, or 73.7 per cent of the total amount of effective
loans.

Implementation of Bank-financed projects in the smaller
SPDMCs is generally satisfactory, although some delays
associated with the geographical remoteness and small size
of these countries have occurred. Long-term problems which
must continuously be addressed include land tenure issues,
tack of skilled manpower to impiement and manage projects,
shortage of government funds for recurrent costs, and
difficulties in transferring skills from expatriate project staff
to national staff. The Bank aims to improve the capabilities
of local staff to execute projects and has planned a training
course in procurement and project implementation management in 1986 for SPDMCs.

DURING 7985, the Bank made appropriate changes in its project administration practices and procedures in order to improve coordination and take prompt action on project administration matters. Accordingly, Project Administration
Units have been established in two Projects Departments on
an experimental basis. All ongoing projects are now being
reviewed once a month within the Projects Departments and
once a quarter by the Project Administration Committee
chaired by the President. A revised project administration
reporting system which makes extensive use of departmental/divisional surmmaries and Project Administration Committee notes enabied staff and Management to review the performance of each departmentidivision, assess the status of
implementation of every project, identify present or potential problems and issues, and formulate and consider appropriate remedial measures.

Other measures intended to strengthen the monitoring of
projects include the use by Projects Departments staff of
mictocomputer-based project monitoring tools and the
periodic review of contract awards and disbursemenis by the
Central Projects Services Office, The Loan Financial Information System allows Bank staff to gain instantaneous access to computer-based data for project monitoring and control. With respect to development bank loans, improvements
have been introduced in the evaluation of sudioan applications by the adoption of a simplified format for processing,
and in monitoring the performance of development banks by
closely analyzing quarterly and audited reports.

There were 433 projects under implementation in 1985
compared with 412 in 1984. Of these, 376 were classified as
satisfactory and 57 as unsatisfactory. There were unsatisfactory projects in 15 borrowing member countries. Countries
which experienced economic difficulties in 1885 were
especially hamstrung by shortages of local counterpart
funds. Other problems commonly encountered included
delays in procurement of goods and consultants’ services,
changes in scope and components of projects, difficulty in
recruiting qualified project staff and in coordinating actions
of multiple impiementation agencies, inability to comply with
loan covenants, technical problems not foreseen during project preparation, delays in construction work, cost overruns
and. declining profitability of some development finance
institutions.

Field visits io projects and discussions with borrowers and
executing agencies are vital aspects of the Bank’s project
administration activities. In this respect, 438 missions were
dispatched in 1985.

Country Project Review Missions were held for
Bangladesh, indonesia, Nepai, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Highlevel discussions were held on various problems and issues
arising from policy, institutional, procedural and other government requirements which affected a broad range of projects.
These missions were able to resolve implemeniation issues
and to accelerate the award of contracts and withdrawai of
loan funds. Another important function of these missions
was to provide project information to the central agencies
to enabte them to monitor the implementation of Bankfinanced projects. Other review missions examined the progress of individual projects while project inception missions
provided assistance to executing agencies in carrying out
initial activities for implementing projects.

In order to assist executing agencies in carrying out project activities, several publications are in advanced stages
of preparation. These include the Handbook on Management
of Project Implementation, Handbook on Problems in Procurement, Handbook on Use of Consultants, sample bidding
documents for civil works, and supply, installation and commissioning of equipment and revised loan administration instructions. Furthermore, in order to improve the knowledge
and skills of project staff, the Bank conducted two regional
seminars on project implementation management, one
regional seminar on procurement and five country seminars
on procurement in Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and Thailand.

Competition is the key to economic and efficient procurement. Accordingly, the Bank has taken steps to promote
widespread interest in international competitive bidding.
Symposia on business opportunities generated by Bank projects were conducted in several member countries. Trade
delegations visiting the Bank were briefed on its lending and
technical assistance operations, procurement practices and
procedures, and the potential demand for goods and services.
Improvements were made in the computer-based systems
for registering consultants in order to expand the data base
and to facilitate extraction of information on consultants.

During the year, 26 consulting firms and 28 individual consultants were engaged by borrowers for loan-financed projects while 44 consulting firms and 74 individual consultants

6162

were employed by the Bank for technical assistance projects.
The net value of contracts awarded for all projects amounted
to $879 million in 1985, of which $523 miflion was for loans
under ordinary resources and $456 million for loans under
the Asian Development Fund. This brought cumulative procurement to $8,278 million, or 56 per cent of effective loans.

Loan Disbursements

The Bank’s loan disbursements are a major indicator of
prolect performance and of the actual transfer of its
resources to DMCs. The Bank disbursed $1,010 million in
1985, one per cent more than In 1984. This was the second
consecutive year In which loan disbursements exceeded $1
biillon.

Disbursements under ADF loans increased to $390 mililon,
31 per cent above the 1984 figure of $298 million. Countries
which showed a marked increase In disbursements were
Bangladesh and, to a lesser extent, Burma and Nepal.
Moreover, the higher level of ADF disbursements to Pakistan
which had been achleved in 1984 was maintalned in 1985 and
this greatly Influenced the overall ADF disbursement !evel.
Factors which contributed to Increased ADF disbursements
included the Improved momentum in implementation of
earlier ADF projects, the rise In {oan commitments, as well
as the partloular type of projects for which ADF loans were
made in recent years.

OCR disbursements during 1985 declined to $620 million,
12 per cent lower than the 1984 figure of $762 miillon. This
decline reflected a stowdown in contracts awarded caused
by budgetary constraints and new procedural requirements
in some DMCs, the economic situatlon in the Phillppines and
a gradual deceleration of project activitles in the Republic
of Koraa and Malaysia. Other factors affecting OCR
disbursements In 1986 included a greater-than-expected level!
of competition and complex procurement exercises (especlally relating to Bank-fInanced power and gas projects), the exceptionally long time required for completing evaluation of

prices of certain commodities (for example, fertilizer).
During the year, the Bank focused on formulating a better assessment of borrowers’ accounting systems and
streamlining disbursement procedures, thereby improving the
accountability and utilization of loan funds. In this respect,
the Bank’s ultlmate objective is better financial management
and maximum effectiveness from aid provided to DMCs.

Projects Completed

Thirty-six projects were completed in 1985, bringing the
number of projects completed to 302 out of a tatal of 704
projects approved as of the end of the year. These completed
projects were mostly approved In the latter part of the 1970s
although a few were approved in the early 1980s. Despite
delays in project implementation due to problems related to
recrultment of consultants, procurement of goods and services and internal government procedures, the objectives of
most projects were substantially achieved, The following
projects were completed at jower-than-estimated total project costs: the Jute Seed and Chittagong Power Distribution
Projects in Bangladesh, the Petroleum Refining industry Program in Burma, the Third Power Project in Fiji, the Tribdhuvan
International Airport Project in Nepal, the Sha Tin Urban
Development Project in Hong Kong, the Ujung Pandang it
Power Project in Indonesia and the Surabaya Institute of
Technology Project In indonesia.

Forty Project Completion Reports (PGRs} were completed
in 1985. As of the and of the year, a total of 206 PCRs had
been circulated to the Board of Directors.

Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaluation

During 1985, the Bank took steps to ensure that information about beneficiaries would be available to feasibility
study teams and appraisai missions. Ali project preparatory
technical assistance implemented by the Bank’s frrigation
and Rural Development Department as well as some implemented by the Agriculture Department was so framed.
While there is still room for Improvement in technical content and admintstrative arrangements, benchmark information about beneficiaries was obtained for several projects
appraised during 1985. This enabled the formulation of projects more responsive to the needs and capabilities of
beneficiaries, including the Chirang Hiil Irrigation Project in
Bhutan and the Pat Feeder Canal Remodelling and improvement Project in Pakistan. In addition, lessons learned from
a technical assistance for Project Benefit Monitoring and
Evaiuation (PBME) to Indonesia which was implemented during 1985 will jead to simpier procedures for collecting information and !mproved project preparation and appraisal. Pliot
PBME work continued on the Phitsanulok Irrigation Project
in Thailand. This project has enabled the Royat Irrigation
Department to develop its capabilities so that such activities
can be gradually introduced on a broader scale.

Furthermore, the development of a management Information system — designed to facilitate management and policy
decision-making ——.was enhanced by the introduction of
PBME arrangements in the Fourth Crop Intensification Program loan to Bangladesh. Similar modifications are expectedto be incorporated into other crop intensification program
loans under consideration in other DMCs.

post-Evaluation

Post-evaluation of the Bank’s first program loan — the Low
Lift Pump Maintenance Program in Bangladesh — was
among the major features of 1985. It tended to confirm that
the Bank's program lending can serve as an effective instrument for ensuring fuller utilization of existing production
capacity in a key sector or subsector, yielding quick and
reasonably high returns on investment. However, the Bank
had not taken the opportunity to utilize the Program as a vehicle for policy dialogue with the Government on sectoral and
jnstitutional issues that had significant implications on equity impact and long-term agricultural growth. It is now a requirement of program lending that policy dialogue be undertaken on institutional and policy issues relating to the longerterm operation and management of the sector concerned;
key policy issues are now identified and specifically
discussed at the time of appraisal of program joans.

The Bank’s post-evaluation system was unchanged during the year and preparation of Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs) continued to be the principal activity of the
Post-Evaluation Office (PEO). The number of PPARs prepared
rose to 33 in 1985 from 27 in 1984. These 33 PPARs covered
37 projects in ten sectors or subsectors of Bank operations
in 16 DMCs. As of the end of 1985, a cumulative total of 165
PPARs covering 176 projects had been prepared.

The series of !mpact Evaluation Studies on Bank
assistance to the fisheries subsector was completed during
the year with the issuance of a report on Pakistan and a concluding report. The latter summarized the results of the three
country reports, reviewed all Bank assistance to the fisheries
subsector and identified lessons of general relevance to Bank
operations in marine fisheries. One finding was that, based
on performance of vessels operated by the public and the
private sectors, Bank assistance should be channeled mainty
to the private sector.

The Seventh Review of Post-Evaiuation Reports was circulated to the Board of Directors in April 1985. It reviewed
findings and conclusions of 27 PPARs prepared for 30 loan
projects and the results of the two special studies (one on
the executing agency arrangements and the other on the effectiveness of project-related technical assistance) and the
two impact Evaluation Studies (which dealt with Bank
assistance to the fisheries sectors in Sri Lanka and
Indonesia) completed during 1984. in terms of overall results,
22 projects (73 per cent) were judged to have been generally
successful in achieving the objectives set at the time of appraisai, while the other eight projects were considered only
partly successful. As to the jatter, some factors such as inadequate design and preparation could have been avoided,
whereas others, such as changes in government policies and
economic environment, could not have been foreseen at the
time of project formulation and appraisal and were generaily beyond the control of the Bank and the project entities.

The Seventh Review presented four major points for consideration by the Board of Directors: (i) executing agency arrangements should be given greater emphasis at the time
of project appraisal and during project implementation;
(ii) for suitable projects, completion of detailed engineering
design prior to appraisal should be encouraged; (iii) attempts
should be made to improve the reliability of demand

forecasting for projects in the water supply, power, road and
port sectors; and {iv) the application of the marginal cost pricing principle, which is presently used in the power sector,
should be encouraged in other relevant sectors such as water
supply and ports. Action has been initiated within the Bank
to implement these recommendations.

Timely dissemination and feedback of post-evaluation findings, particularly those related to ongoing and future Bank
operations, continue to be important activities of PEO. The
establishment of a computerized Post-Evaluation Information System enables PEO to furnish pertinent findings and
conclusions in relation to any specific aspect of the Bank's
lending operations drawn from all post-evaluation reports.
To help ensure that the post-evaluation findings are appropriately taken into consideration in the Bank’s lending and
project administration activities, PEO continued to take an
active part in the processing of new projects, and in the
monitoring of ongoing projects. Appraisal reports for new
projects are now required to incorporate a summary of
lessons learned from similar completed Bank-assisted projects, and a description of how those lessons have been taken
into account for the proposed project.

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES
AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

 

Variable Lending Rate System

THE Bank's ordinary operations loans have traditionally cartied interest rates fixed at the time of joan commitment for
the entire life of the loan. However, in the light of capital
market developments over the past decade, notably the increased volatility of interest rates which led both the World
Bank {IBRD} and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
to review and modify their lending rate systems, a detailed
examination of the Bank's lending rate system for ordinary
operations loans was initiated in 1983 following the comprehensive review of the Bank's financial policies undertaken
in that year. In 1984 and 1985, the Board of Directors under
took a series of studies in which consideration was given |

to the income risks inherent in the traditional fixed-atcommitment lending rate system as well as to a number of
alternative lending rate systems. Finally, in October 1985, the
Board of Directors approved the adoption of a pool-based
variable fending rate system similar to that adopted by the
IBRD.

The new lending rate system will apply as from 1 July 1986
to all ordinary operations toans approved on or after that date.
It will also, at the option of the borrowers, apply, as from 1
July 1886, to joans approved from 24 September 1985 to 30
June 1986. Undes the new system, the lending rate will not
be fixed for the entire life of the loan but witl be adjusted
every six montis, Le., on 1 January and 1 July. The rate will
be determined by adding a variable spread (initially 0.50 per
cent per annum) to the average cost of a “pool” of Bank borrowings to be established on 1 July 1986. Ail Bank borrowings settled on or after 1 July 1986 will be added to the pooi,
and borrowings will be removed from the pool as and when
they are redeemed.

The decision to move to a pool-based variable lending rate
system is an important step towards adapting the Bank’s
financial structure to uncertain conditions in international
financial markets and ensuring its effectiveness as a development institution in the years ahead. In addition to protecting
the Bank’s net income against fiuctuations in interest rates,
the new system will provide a high degree of borrowing flexibility that could result in lower overall borrowing costs and,
consequently, lower lending rates over time.

Current Lending Rate

~ In view of the reduction in the cost of the Bank's borrowings, the Board of Directors decided to lower the fixed lending rate on new ordinary operations loans to 9.65 per cent
per annum from 10.25 per cent per annum, effective 1 July
1985. This rate will apply to all loans approved from 1 July
1985 to 30 June 1986 except that, as indicated above, in the
case of loans approved from 24 September 1986 to 30 June
1986, the borrowers may choose to have the variable lending
rate system applied to such joans as from 1 July 1986.

Borrowing Policies

The four principal elements of the Bank's borrowing
policies under the new lending rate system would de: {i} to
ensure continued availability of funds; (ii) to minimize borrowing costs with a view to keeping the lending rate as iow
as possible; (iif) to minimize fluctuations in the lending rate
over time; and {iv} to ensure a reasonable maturity rejationship between the Bank's joans and borrowings.

Ensuring Continued Availability of Funds: 1n order to ensure continued availability of funds, the Bank must make a
continuous and systematic effort to develop its borrowing
capabilities in the major capital markets. The present policy
of phasing its annual borrowings is designed to give the Bank
flexibility to formulate market development strategies, to tap
new sources of funds and to take advantage of favorable
market conditions. The new fending rate system will provide
further scope for diversification by allowing the Bank to borrow over a wider range of maturities and to use new borrowing techniques, The use of such techniques, however, will
depend on specific market circumstances and the Bank’s
other funding objectives. :

Minimizing Borrowing Costs: [tis an important objective
of the Bank to minimize the effective cost of its borrowings
in order to keep its iending rate as low as possible. While
the Bank’s cumulative borrowings to date have been
predominantly in low-coupon currencies, the Bank has also

6566

endeavored to maintain as regular a presence as possible
in high-coupon currencies. There will be no fundamental
change in this approach. The new lending rate system will
allow the Bank to shorten its borrowing maturities when so
warranted by market conditions, thereby giving the Bank the
flexibility to reduce the Impact of expensive borrowings (e.g.,
when interest rates are high, or when yield curves are very
positively sloped). In general, however, the Bank would prefer
to borrow long-term fixed-rate funds when low rates of interest can be tocked In.

Minimizing Lending Rate Fluctuations: Under the new
lending rate system, changes in the average cost of the pool
of outstanding Bank borrowings, on which six-monthly adjustments In the lending rate will be based, will be influenced
by the size and cost of new borrowings as well as redemptlons during any given six-month period. White changes in
the average cost of the pool are unavoidable as the Bank
passes through varlous stages of the interest rate cycle, it
would be desirable to avoid disruptive changes and to aim
for a reasonably stable lending rate over time. The Bank's
funding strategy would, therefore, take this into account
atong with the other funding objectives.

Ensuring Appropriate Borrowing Maturities: It has been
the Bank’s policy to maintain a reasonable relationship between the maturity of Its borrowings and Joans, Although the
new lending rate system will practically eliminate any
adverse income effect of maturlty mismatching, lt would be
prudent for the Bank to avoid any excessive use of shorterterm borrowings so as to avold causing potentially serious
lending rate fluctuations, or exposing the Bank to unnecessary liquidity risk in the event of roll-over difficulties.
The Bank’s maturity decisions must also take account of the
existence of undisbursed balances of fixed-rate toans which
wilt account for a substanttal portion of disbursements for
the next few years.

Borrowings

Durlng 1985, the Bank’s borrowings, consisting of ten
public bond issues, amounted to the equivalent of $791.9
milion, compared with the 1984 borrowing total of $971.7
miltion. Details of the year's borrowings are shown in the
table on page 142. .

The Bank continued to borrow in the longest maturities
available taking account of cost considerations. It borrowed
in varlous cusrencies and markets and thereby maintained
an adequate presence in the major capita! markets. Its public
offering of yen-denominated bonds in the New York capital
market was the first-ever public bond issue denominated in
a foreign national currency in that market, marking the
development of a new and important source of borrowings.
In two of Its issues in the Swiss capital market, the Bank
undertook its first floating-rate borrowings.

Yen-denominated borrowings accounted for over 43 per
cent of the total amount borrowed during the year, with two
public bond issues in Japan, each for ¥ 25 billion, In March
and July, and the public offering of yen-denominated bonds
in the United States for ¥ 35 billion.

In the German capltal market, the Bank made two public
bond Issues, each for DM200 million, in April and September.

The Bank again made three public bond issues in the Swiss
capital market. Two of the Issues, in January and May, con

fioating-rate tranche to be reset every six months at 1/8 per
cent above the London interbank Offered Rate for six-month
Swiss franc deposits. This rate, for both issues, cannot be
set lower than 3.5 per cent per annum or higher than 8.5 per
cent per annum. The third Swiss franc Issue, in November,
was for SwF100 million and had a finai maturity of 25 years.

In the United States, besides the yen-denominated bond
issue, the Bank, in May, also made a public offering of $100
million,

In May also, a public bond issue of {200 million with a final
maturity of 15 years was floated in the Dutch capital market.

The average maturity of the year's borrowings, weighted
by amount, was 12.72 years and the average life of outstanding borrowings at the end of 1985 was 8.32 years. The average
cost, weighted by amount and average life of each borrowing, was 7.36 per cent per annum.

Capitalization

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in its Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 1
April 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the vaiue of the Bank's capital stock
is expressed, for purposes of the Bank’s financial statements,
in terms of the SDR on the basis that each share has the value
of SDRi0,000, The mutual obligations of each member and
ihe Bank with respect to maintenance of value of currency
holdings are also measured by the same standard, but settlement of such obligations is being held in abeyance. For
purposes of the financial statements, the SDR is translated
into current United States dollars at the rate computed bythe IMF. As of 31 December 1985, the rate was $1.09842 per
SOR. Further information on vatuation of capital and
maintenance of value is given in Notes A and E of the Notes
to Financial Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources,
OCR-7.

The third general capital increase (GCI Ill), approved by
Governors’ Resolution No. 158 in April 1983, consisted of an
additional 754,750 shares in the Bank’s authorized capital
stock. At the 31 December 1985 exchange rate of $1.09842
per SDR, the total amount authorized was $8,290.3 million
(SDR7,547.5 million). The final date specified in the Resolution for subscribing to GCI lil was 31 May 1984. Since then
and pursuant to the provisions of the Resolution, the Board
of Directors has extended this deadline several times to
enable subscriptions to be made by member countries which
had not taken up their GCI fit entitlements. It was envisaged
that the latest deadline of 31 May 1986 would be the last. At
the end of 1985, subscriptions to GCI Ilf had been made by
37 member countries. A total of 737,877 shares had been
subscribed, representing about 98 per cent of the total share
entitlements of all member countries.

The Bank's authorized capital stock as of 31 December
41985 amounted to $16,221.5 million (SDR14,768, 1 million), During 1985, four member countries subscribed to GCI lit, for

ADB President Masao Fujioka (seated second from left) signing documents in New York in September for a ¥35 billion offering of

a total amount of $216.6 million (SDR197.2 miflion). At the
end of 1985, the Bank's subscribed capital stock stood at
$15,970.1 million (SDR14,539.1 million).

Special Increases in Subscriptions

in the past few years the Bank has received a number of
requests from individual member countries for special increases in their capital subscriptions. The Board of Directors agreed in 1985 as part of certain arrangements for processing these requests to recommend to the Board of Governors the approval of special increases in the capital subsoriptions of Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland.
On 30 September 1985, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolution No. 174 concerning such special increases and
an increase in the Bank’s authorized capital stock to be made
available for subscription to these special increases. The increase, which will become effective to the extent that the
special subscriptions become effective, amounts to $324.3
million {SDR235,2 million) and is divided into 29,520 shares
each having a par value of $40,000 in terms of United States
dollars of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January
1968.

At the end of 1985, the Bank’s OCR investments were
denominated in 22 currencles and amounted to the
equivalent of $3,471 million ($2,856 million at the end of 1984),
including investments in Special Reserve Fund assets. Of
the total investments, 76 per cent (68 per cent at the end of
1984) was held in securities issued or guaranteed by member
governments, obligations of other multilateral development
banks and of approved government agencies of member
countries. The remainder was invested in time deposits and
certificates of deposit of banks in member countries and the
Bank for International Settlements. The overall average yield
on the Bank’s OCR investments over the year increased to
11.03 per cent in 1985 from 10.59 per cent in 1984,

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ordinary capital resources during 1985
amounted to $620 million, bringing cumulative disbursements
from this source to $5,480 miliion up to the end of 1988.
Repayments during the year amounted to $221 million from
loans held by the Bank. As of end-December 1985, cumulative
loan repayments reached $1,231 miillon. This consisted of
$1,214 million on loans held by the Bank and $17 million on

Three years after the introduction of the System on
j January 1983, the amount of undisbursed loans covered
under the System increased to $5,377 million or 95.3 per cent
of total undisbursed loans as of 31 December 1985. Loans
outstanding under the System increased to $1,355 milion or
31. per cent of total outstanding jeans as of 31 December
4985.

Income and Expenses

The Bank's gross income in 1985, generated mainly from
its loans and investments, was $685 milion, a rise of $116
million of 20.4 per cent over gross income in 1984. Income
from loans and investments rose by $52 million and $64
million, respectively.

Gross expenses In 1985 amounted to $428 million, an increase Of $65 million or 18.1 per cent over total expenses in
1984. Financial expenses increased by $59 million, administrative expenses by $5 million and services to member
countries by $1 million.

Reserves

As of 31 December 1984, the Bank’s Ordinary Reserve

amounted to $998 million. During 1985, $190 million was:

added through the transfer of net income for the year ended
31 December 1984 after appropriation of commissions to
Special Reserve. This, however, was partly offset by a net
charge of $30 million resulting from the restatement of the
Bank's capital stock in terms of SDR. As a result, the balance
of the Ordinary Reserve as of 31 December 1985 stood at

$1,158 million.

The appropriation of commissions earned on loans during the year increased the Special Reserve from $167 million
as of 31 December 1984 to $177 million as of 31 December
4985. In accordance with Resolution No. 163 adopted by the
Board of Governors in March 1984, the commission. on
outstanding ordinary operations loans was reduced in 1985
to 0.25 per cent per annum, while no commission has been
charged on new loans approved since the date the Resolution was adopted.

Fourth ADF Repienishment (ADF V}

THE period over which the third Asian Development Fund
replenishment (ADF IV) is intended to finance the Bank’s concessional lending program ends in 1986. Accordingly, in 1985,
the Board of Directors commenced an examination of the
need for a further ADF replenishment. This action was noted
with approvai in Board of Governors’ Resolution No. 172.
Discussions were then initiated with ADF donor countries
on a fourth ADF replenishment (ADF V) to finance the concessional lending program over the four-year period 1987-90.
At meetings in Rome and Tokyo, donors reaffirmed their
strong support for ADF as a vehicle for concessional lending
to the Bank’s poorer member countries. They exchanged
views on a number of policy matters, the possible amount
of ADF V, burden-sharing and other replenishment issues.
They also decided that a further donors’ meeting be held in
Vancouver, Canada, in February 1986.

Progress of Earlier ADF Replenishments

The third Asian Development Fund replenishment (ADF [V)
was authorized by Governors’ Resolution No. 154 in July 1982.
At the exchange rates specified in the Resolution, the total
amount authorized was $3,214 million.

Canada and the United States have both deposited
qualified contribution commitments to ADF fV, whereby, as
permitted in the Resolution, payment of their contribution
instalments is subject to budgetary appropriations. Under
the ADF IV “trigger” arrangements, the release of the second,
third and fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions for
loan commitments is subject to the availability of the first,
second and remaining two tranches, respectively, of the
qualified contributions. The arrangements envisaged that the
third tranches of the unqualified contributions would be
released on 1 January 1985. While Canada made available
its first and second tranches in full in 1983 and 1984, respectively, the United States, by the end of 1984, had made
available its first tranche and only $67 million, or 51.54 per
cent, of its second tranche.

 

With the United States, in February 1985, indicating its intention as regards making up the shortfall in its second
tranche, the third tranches of the unqualified ADF IV contributions, pursuant to the Resolution, were released to the
Bank for loan commitments to the extent of 51.54 per cent.
Subsequently, ten donor countries released the third tranche
balances of their unqualified contributions on a voluntary
basis. The full third tranche of Canada’s qualified contribution became available in July.

in August, the United States made available the $63 million
balance of its ADF !V second tranche. This triggered the
release of the third tranche balances previously withheld by
nine donors.

Also in August, the United States made available the
outstanding balance of $28.2 million of its ADF It contribution. The full amount of aj] ADF I! contribution commitments,
totalling $781 million (at 30 June 1975 exchange rates), had
accordingly been made availabie to the Bank.

Following the adoption on 30 September of Governors’
Resolution No. 174 on special capital increases (see page
67}, France advised the Bank that it would make an additional
ADF IV coniribution of $15 million equivalent (at the Resolution No. 154 exchange rates), The additional contribution
would be paid to the Bank in 1986 along with the first instalment payment for the special increase in France's capital
subscription. .

At the end of 1985, legislative procedures to enable the
United States’ ADF IV third tranche of $130 million to be made
available had not been compieted.!

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

In view of a shortage in ADF resources at the end of 1984,
about $65 million of the provision for exchange rate fluctuatlons had been used for loan commitments, while loans
amounting to a total of about $83 miljlion had been approved
subject to the condition that they would not be signed until
sufficient resources became available. These loans were
signed following the release of the unqualified ADF iV third
tranches to the extent of 51.54 per cent in February 1985. Ad
 

1 $95.7 million of the United States’ third tranche became available in February
1886, .

at the end of 18984) was held in securities issued or
guaranteed by member governments and obligations of approved government agencies of member countries. The
balance was invesied in time deposits and certificates of
deposit of banks in member countries. The average yield on
ADF Investments over the year was 9,75 per cent, compared
with 9.58 per cent in 1984.

countries (DMCs) and other developed member countries
which contribute on a similarly untied basis. The contributions from india, Norway, Pakistan and Sweden are available
to finance the costs of services and facilities from the respective contributor country and all DMCs. Also, in the use of the
contributions from Norway and Sweden, priority should,
whenever possible, be given to their application for projects
in the least developed member countries.

As of 31 December 1985, total contributions to TASF 5 e 5

THE Bank's staff at the end of 1985 totailed 1,553 from 36
member countries: 581 professional staff and 972 supporting staff. During the year, there were 47 professional staff
appointments and 36 terminations of appointment. Among
supporting staff, 68 were appointed and 37 resigned.

The successful recruitment efforts of 1984 were generally repeated in 1985; at the end of the year, about 97 per cent
of professional staff positions had been filied.

The Young Professionals Program saw its second intake
in 1985 when six young professionals joined the Bank. Five
more were selected In the last quarter of 1985 and are expected to take up their appointments early in 1986. This latter group will replace the 1984 intake who will progress fo
regular professional staff positions in 1986,

The Bank’s training.and development programs have been
strengthened and expanded in specific areas to meet the
developmental and operational needs of staff. in-house
courses and seminars on loan administration, project
management, financial management, language and communication skills and persona! computers for professional
staff have received particular attention. For supporting staff,
the focus has been placed on courses in staff orientation,
loan administration, work planning and work simplification.
Self-instruction facilities have been expanded and many professional and supporting staff have availed themselves of
various video and audio programs available at the Learning
Centre. On a selective basis, Bank staff have aiso attended
external training programs.

Staff salaries and benefits were reviewed during the year
to take into account developments in the compensation of
international and loca! comparator organizations and refevant cost-of-living indicators. The Board of Directors
approved a general salary increase of 18 per cent for supporting staff, effective 1 August 1985; this supplanted an
earlier interim salary supplement of 10-14 per cent which had
been approved, effective 1 May 1985. There were no changes
in the satary structure of professional staff. However, the
Board of Directors approved certain changes in professional
statf benefits.

Organization

A working paper setting out the various considerations in
establishing Bank resident offices was considered by the

Board of Directors in March 4985. It was suggested that
specific proposals for prospective resident offices in DMCs
and an office for financial operations in another time zone
should in due course be put forward.

The South Pacific Regional! Office, established in Vanuatu
in July 1984, has progressively assumed more of its delegated
operational functions and responsibilities. Initially, the Office has focused on developing ties and close working relationships with the South Pacific developing member countries and their agencies, on familiarizing itself with the
special problems of conducting the Bank’s operations in
those countries, and on developing the procedural arfangements for coordinating various activities between the
Office and Headquarters units. In December 1985, special
attention was given to detailed coordinating arrangements
and delineation of work between the Office and Headquarters
units on its 1986 work program.

During 1985, the Bank decided to establish a new Private
Sector Division in early 1986 within the industry and Development Banks Department (see page 23).

internal Audit

Internal auditing provides Management with independent
and objective evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness
of controls, systems and procedures in the financial, account
ing, administrative, data processing and other functions of
the Bank. The Internal Audit Office (IAQ) reports to the President and the Audit Committee of the Board (ACB).

During 1985, IAO reviewed systems and procedures
relating to financial, accounting, general administrative matters and project loan administration. Visits to certain borrowing countries were undertaken to review audit-related
issues. IAQ participated in the development of a number of
computer systems and sub-systems developed by the Office
of Computer Services and took part in the signing off of these
systems, {n working with the Bank's external auditors, the
IAO provided integrated assistance to cover in rotation portions of their overall audit coverage. [AO also played an active role in preparing for the audit of consultants’ contracis,
in drafting procedures on certain administrative and financial matters and participated in various Bank committees.

The results of audits and recommendations were conveyed
to Management and Heads of Departments and Offices concerned for information and appropriate action. The format
and contents of the six-monthly Audit Recommendations !m
776

plemeniation Report was revised to facilitate focussing on
the most important issues. This report serves as a means
of informing Management, the ACB and Bank staff of the continuous efforts made by concerned Departments/Offices to
enhance internal! controls, economy and efficiency in the
Bank's operations in general.

Computer and Office Automation Systems

During 71985, computer-based information and office
systems were expanded to support Bank operations. As of
December 1985, 110 computer terminals and 127 microcomputers, including word processors and portable microcomputers, were in use In the Bank. Data base applications
developed or enhanced in 1985 included loan financial information, technical assistance information, staff benefit administration, Bank procurement administration, investments
portfolio, member country subscriptions, depository bank
liability, automated check printing and travel advance
vouchering systems. A microcomputer-based payroll system
was implemented.

Office Accommodation

Several projects covering office accommodation and
facilities which were begun in 1984 were completed during
the year, Including the Bank’s Telecommunications Project.
These measures provided the office space and facilities required until early 1988 when the Bank relocates to its new
Headquarters bullding; they also facilitated implementation
of the office automaiion program through the planned tocation of self-contained departmentai information centers,

A capital expenditure project for upgrading and Improving facliltles was also approved by the Board of Directors
during the year at a cost of $564,000, Implementation of this
project — which is aimed at strengthening safety and energy
conservation measures as well as improving office facilities
— began In the jatter part of 1985. It is expected to be completed in 1986.

New Headquarters Building

During 1985, buik excavation at the new Headquarters site
in Ortigas Commerciat Center was completed. A Supplementary Agreement to the Headquarters Agreement was ehtered
into between the Bank and the Philippine Government to deal
with various issues related to the Project. The Main Building
Contract was awarded to Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company Limited, Republic of Korea. Consultants completed evaluation of bids received for various nominated subcontracts and Bank approval of the nomination of subcontractors was in progress. Competitive prices were received
for all the bid packages. Bids for the Telecommunications
Nominated Subcontract were expected during the first
quarter of 1986. The Project is expected to be compieted by
early 1988,

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1985 amounted to
$80.1 million against the original Budget of $87.9 million,
representing 91 per cent utilization of the latter. The difference of $7.8 million against the Budget is due mainly to
savings in staff salaries, benefits, relocation, business travel,

other administrative expenses and non-use of the general
contingency.

The Administrative Budget for 1986, which was approved
by the Board of Directors in December 1985, is summarized
in Appendix 1. Ht provides for Internal Administrative Expenses in 1986 amounting to $89.3 million, an increase of
$9.2 million over actual expenses in 1985. The increase is
largely attributable to: (i) the full-year effect of the past year's
staff increase and to additional supporting staff required for
4986; {ii} salary improvements for supporting staff and
benefits improvements for professional and supporting staff
approved in 1985 and further improvements subject to consideration in 1986; {iii} consultant services required for the
Bank's work in 1986; (iv) higher overheads, mainly in contractual services and depreciation; (v) past and prospective price
escalation; and (vi) provision for general contingency.

Commitments for Services to Member Countries in 1985
amounted to $19.4 million representing 72 per cent utilization of the original Budget of $27 million and an increase of
8 per cent over actual commitments of $17.9 million in 1984,
Provision is made in 1986 for new commitments amounting
to $24 million, representing an increase of 23 per cent over
the actual commitments In 1985.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank (the Charter)
“in terms of United States dollars of the weight and
fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar) and
thé value of each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars.

currént United States doliar (the Bank’s unit of accountyon:.

the basis of its pat value in terms of gold: From 1973 until

have been $205,333,000 ($284,925,000 —- 1984) receivable

the period. Translation adjusiments other than those
relating to maintenance of value of currency holdings (see

CONTINUED

translation adjustments’’. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions among functional currencies are includ

loss.

HOLDINGS

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second
Amendment to the IMF Articles, the Bank implemented
maintenance of vaiue In respect of holdings of member cursencles in terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 of its Charter and relevant resolutions
of the Board of Directors. The “Amounts required to maintain vaiue of currency holdings” under “AMOUNTS
RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS” represent the aggregate
amounts receivable resulting from changes in exchange
tates of member currencies from those previously used for
the purpose of computing maintenance of value of the
Bank’s holdings of certain member currencies.

Since 4 April 1978, inasmuch as the valuation of the Bank’s
capital stock and the basis of determining possible
maintenance of value obligations are still under consideratlon, notional amounts have been calculated provisionally
as teceivable from or payable to members in order to maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR. The
timing of any establishment and settlement of such
amounts is uncertain. The notional amounts as of
31 December 1985 consisting of receivables of $184,453,000
{$126,592,000 — 1984) and payables of $99,003,000
{$113,202,000 — 1984) represent (a) the net decrease of
$203,958,000 ($283,569,000 — 1984) in the value of currency
holdings in relation to the United States dollar, the Bank's
unit of account, during the period from 1 April 1978 to
31 December 1985 offset by (b) the decrease of $118,508,000
($270,179,000 — 1984) in amounts required to maintain the

and paid capital subscriptions due to the decrease in the
value of the SDR in relation to the United States dollar during the same period.

NOTE F — INCOME AND EXPENSES

income from other sources includes exchange gains or
tosses which are not material.

Total interest expense incurred amounted to $333,094,000
($286,815,000 — 1984), Of this amount $1,608,000
($1,103,000 — 1984) were capitalized as a part of the cost of
the new headquarters building.

Administrative expenses {other than those appertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations) for
the year ended 31 December 1985 have been apportioned
between ordinary capita! resources and the Asian Develop-ment Fund according to the number of loans approved for
the year. Of the total administrative expenses of
$81,709,000 ($74,722,000 — 1984}, $36,141,000 ($34,372,000
— 1984) has accordingly been charged ‘to the Asian

before 1984; 1/2 % — 1984} per annum on the outstanding
amount of loans made by it from the ordinary capital
resources prior to 28 March 1984 and an amount equivalent
to such commissions is appropriated to a Special Reserve.

be tevied as interest and will be accounted for as such by
the Bank. Special Reserve assets consist of government
and government guaranteed obligations and are included
under the heading “INVESTMENTS”.

NOTE H.— CAPITAL TRANSFERRED TO ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT FUND

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 4{i) of
" the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid
by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a} and of the
" convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to
Article 6, paragraph 2(b) as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a
part of the Special Funds of the Bank. The resources so set
asidé, amounting to $52,295,000 as of 31 December 1985
($46,667,000 — 1984) expressed in terms of the SDR on the
" basis of $1.09842 ($0.980205 — 1984) per SDR ($57,434,000

of Governors shall determine annually what part of the net
income after appropriation of commissions to Special
Reserve (see Note G) shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves, to surplus and what part, if any, shal! be
distributed to the members. Net income after appropriation
of commissions to Special Reserve for the year ended
31 December 1984 was allocated to the Ordinary Reserve.

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note A) resulted in a net charge of
$29,690,000 to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended
31 December 1985 {net credit of $16,110,000 — 1984). That

OCR-7

charge (credit —- 1984) is the increase (decrease — 1984) in
the value of the matured and paid capital subscriptions
caused by the change during the period in the value of the
SDR in relation to the United States dollar not allocated to
members as notional maintenance of vatue adjustments in
accordance with resolutions of the Board of Directors.

POHGIES...
Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency.”
The currencies of contributing Hambers are functional cur
rencies. The reporting currency is the United States dollar,
and the financial statements are expressed in tholisands of
current United States dollars:

Transtation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and contributions. committed ‘are
translated from their functional currencies to the reporting

“currency generally at the applicable rates of exchange at

the end of a reporting period. Income and expense amounts
are translated for each semi-monthly period generally: at

‘ the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each

period; such practice approximates the application: of
average rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating to contributions are offset by increases
or decreases in the contribution accounts. Translation adjustmeénts ‘relating to capital set-aside (see Note £) aré
recorded as receivable from or payable to Ordinary Capital
Resources. Other translation adjustments are charged or
credited to “Accumulated translation. adjustments”. Exchange gains or tosses on currency transactions among
functional currencies are included in income.

CONTINUED

Loans

Concessional loans of the Fund have been extended to certain developing member countries, bear only a service
charge and generally require repayment over a 40-year

period. The Fund requires Borrowers to absorb exchange °

tisks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies disbursed. The Fund has not suffered any loan losses
to date and follows a policy: of not taking part in -debt
rescheduling agreements.

Contributions

Contributions by member ‘countries ‘are included. in. the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date
instruments of Contribution are deposited and related formalities are completed.

NOTES — INVESTMENTS:

“As of 3+ December 1985, the market vaiue of investments

was”. $442,822,000. ($321,676,000"—-' 1984), including: investments not traded in. the market (time deposits, etc.)
which. were valued at’ their. cost’ or amortized cost of
$350,667,000 ($262,690,000 — 1984). During the year ended

* 31 December 1985, salés of investments resulted in a net .

gain of $1,534,000 ($534,000, — 1984). Gairis and losses on

_ sales of investments aré measured by the differencé be
tween average amortized cost and the net proceeds of
sales; The annualized rate of return on the average investments held during the year, based on the portfolio held
at the beginning and end of each quarter, including realized
gains and losses, was 9.75% (9.58% — 1984).

NOTE D — ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

ment of all administrative expenses of the Bank (other than
those appertaining directiy to ordinary operations and
special operations} based on the number of loans approved
for the year.

NOTE E — SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph ifi} of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board
of Governors has authorized the setting aside of
18% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Articte 6, paragraph 2(a) and of the convertible
currency portion paid by members pursuani to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as part of the
Special Funds of the Bank, The capital so set aside was
allocated and transferred from the Ordinary Capital
Resources to the Fund as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Articte 4, paragraph 1 ‘in terms of United States doliars of the weight and

fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar).
Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the currant United States dollar {the Bank's
unlt of account), on the basis of its par value in terms of
gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on
this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978,
at which time the Second Amendment to the Articies of
Agreement of the international Monetary Fund (IMF) came
Into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold, Pending the Sank’s selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has
been valued for purposes of the accompanying financial
statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at
the value in current United States dotiars as computed by
the IMF. As of 31 December 1985, the value of the SDR in
terms of the current United States dollar was $1.09842
{$0,880205 — 1984). On this bas!s, Set-Aside Resources
amounted to $52,295,000 ($46,667,000 — 1984). If the
capital stock of the Bank as of 31 December 1985 had been
valued in terms of $12,063.80 per share, Set-Aside
Resources would have been $57,434,000,DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS

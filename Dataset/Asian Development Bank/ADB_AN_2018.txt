so too must ADB. Our new strategy, Strategy 2030,
positions ADB well to help the countries of Asia and
the Pacific cope with the development challenges
and opportunities that lie ahead.

PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE

STRATEGY
2030
PROVIDES
US WITH

A CLEAR
ROADMAP
TO MEET
THE NEEDS
OF OUR
DMCs AND
GUIDE OUR
OPERATIONS
FORTHE
NEXT
DECADE

n presenting
this year’s
Annual Report,
we draw
attention to the
broad context
of a rapidly
changing Asia
and the Pacific
and the Asian
Development
Bank’s (ADB)
response to the evolving development needs
facing the region.

 

Asia and the Pacific has made great strides

in poverty reduction and economic growth in

the last 50 years. Today, the world’s economic
center of gravity is shifting toward the region, and
almost all of our developing member countries
(DMCs) already have, or are advancing to,
middle-income status. At the same time, there
are unfinished development agendas. Issues such
as poverty and vulnerability, rising inequality,
climate change, growing environmental pressures,
and large infrastructure deficits remain to be
addressed. Emerging trends, such as technological
advancements, urbanization, and changing
demographics, present opportunities and
challenges.

 

As our region continues to develop and
transform, so too must ADB. When | visit our
DMCs and talk to leaders and ministers, their
expectations of ADB are high and their demands
are becoming ever-more sophisticated. That is
why, in July 2018, after an extensive consultation
process, we adopted a new long-term corporate

strategy, Strategy 2030.

This strategy will guide us in achieving a
prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable
Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining efforts to
eradicate extreme poverty. These aspirations are
aligned with international development objectives
such as the Sustainable Development Goals and
the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Strategy 2030 recognizes that each of our DMCs
faces a unique set of challenges, and we will

pursue tailored approaches to support each member.
Country partnership strategies will continue to be
the primary platform for defining ADB’s operational
focus in each country. We will strengthen our support
by applying innovative technologies. We will offer
integrated solutions by combining expertise in a wide
range of areas from across our institution. These
solutions will be delivered through an appropriate
mix of public and private sector operations.

Strategy 2030 provides us with a clear roadmap

to meet the needs of our DMCs and guide our
operations for the next decade. We set out clear
corporate targets to significantly increase operations
to build climate and disaster resilience, address
gender equality, and mobilize long-term private
financing.

Our efforts are now focused on implementing the
strategy. This Annual Report highlights the strategic
transition in progress across all aspects of ADB
operations and organization.

In 2018, the demand for ADB assistance continued
to grow. Our commitments in 2018 reached

$21.58 billion in loans and grants, exceeding our target
of $19.71 billion and the 2017 total of $19.69 billion.
Of the 2018 total, private sector commitments saw
year-on-year growth of 37% to about $3.14 billion, the
highest level to date. Our private sector operations
also mobilized cofinancing of $7.17 billion. Including
official and commercial cofinancing and technical
assistance, ADB’s total commitments last year were
$35.82 billion, a13% increase on 2017. Disbursements
also improved, rising to $14.19 billion in 2018, an
increase of 24% from 2017.

We continued to deliver on our climate commitment.
In 2015, we set a target to double our annual climate
financing to $6 billion by 2020. In 2018, we approved
$3.6 billion in financing. Using commitments, our new
performance measure, we reached $4.5 billion. We
also scaled up innovative financing to support Pacific
DMCs in building disaster resilience.

We also made significant progress in designing
projects with a gender focus. In 2018, 47% of our
newly committed projects (on a three-year-average
term) included elements that directly improve the
lives of women and girls.

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018We continued our important work as a provider of
nowledge services in 2018. Our DMCs benefited
rom products such as the Asian Development
Outlook’s special theme chapter “How Technology
Affects Jobs” and the hosting of events such as the
Asia Clean Energy Forum, Transport Forum, and
Global Infrastructure Forum. By attracting experts
rom across the region and around the world, these
events garner breakthrough ideas and innovations
that can later be embedded into our projects and
programs.

On the funding side, we raised more than
$23 billion in 17 different currencies to ensure a
robust resource base for ADB.

nternally, we continued efforts to modernize our
human resources practices. We recruited a record
370 new staff in 2018. This includes 22 young
professionals, our largest intake ever. Performance
management was strengthened, thanks to stronger
inks between performance reviews and work plans
and more frequent feedback from supervisors.

We also continued efforts to improve our gender
balance at ADB. Women now account for 36% of
the bank’s international staff, putting us on track to
meet our target of 40% by the end of 2022.

 

Central to Strategy 2030 is aOne ADB approach,
channeling knowledge and expertise from across
the organization to benefit specific projects or
investments. We will also reach out to others
within and outside Asia and the Pacific to forge
stronger partnerships for knowledge and financing
leverage.

Overall, the renewed vigor and enthusiasm brought
by Strategy 2030 positions ADB well to help the
countries of Asia and the Pacific cope with the
development challenges and opportunities that lie
ahead.

Note: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding.
10 * Commitment is the financing approved by ADB’s Board of Directors or Management for which the investment agreement has been
signed by the borrower, recipient, or the investee company and ADB. It is the amount indicated in the investment agreement that
5 may or may not be equal to the approved amount, depending on the exchange rate at the time of signing. In the case of official and

commercial cofinancing not administered by ADB for which the signed amount is not readily available, the approved amount is used.
The 2016 adjusted figure excludes the transfer of a Pakistan project design advance of $5 million to its 2018 ensuing loan.

Formerly Asian Development Fund loans. Effective 1 January 2017, ADB transferred loans and other assets from the Asian
Development Fund to ordinary capital resources in accordance with the Board of Governors’ resolution authorizing the termination
of the Asian Development Fund’s lending operations and retaining the Asian Development Fund as a grant-only operation.

The 2017 adjusted figure excludes three Afghanistan grant commitments amounting to $405 million resulting from re-signing of
project agreements following a resolution to the conflicting government decrees on authorized signing official and/or agency.

Special funds other than Asian Development Fund such as the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund and the Climate Change Fund.
Technical assistance in 2018 totaled $371 million, comprising $241 million in technical assistance from the Technical Assistance
Special Fund and other Special Funds, and $130 million from partner cofinancing, including trust funds (see Appendix 1).

The 2017 adjusted figures include an increase in Pakistan grant cofinancing from $75 to $150 million and exclude two Afghanistan
grants amounting to $75 million resulting from re-signing of project agreements following a resolution to the conflicting government
decrees on authorized signing official and/or agency.

“Others” includes private sector cofinancing through foundations and corporate social responsibility programs, and any public source,
such as national development banks, that do not fall under official cofinancing.

Nonsovereign cofinancing includes commercial cofinancing such as Trade Finance Program cofinancing, B loans, and parallel loans,
among others. B loans are cofinancing arrangements involving the coordinated process of pooling funds from various sources for a
single borrower or grant recipient, and/or distributing related risks among such other financiers.

TO GLOBAL
AND REGIONAL
DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES

The Asia and Pacific region is now a powerful
engine for the world economy, contributing 60%
of global growth. The region’s economic expansion
has averaged 6.8% a year since the 2008-2009
global financial crisis—underpinned by stable
economic conditions that have accelerated
development and fostered poverty reduction.
While the outlook for growth remains positive,
several development challenges remain.

The countries of Asia and the Pacific are
experiencing rapid urbanization, huge
demographic shifts, growing environmental
pressures, and large infrastructure deficits.

Income inequality has risen in several countries
and social disparities persist. Meanwhile, an
increasingly interconnected and interdependent
world brings the potential for faster transmission
of global shocks.

Despite its strong economic growth, Asia and

the Pacific is home to 264 million people living

in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 a day).

An additional 836 million people are living in
poverty (on an amount between $1.90 and

$3.20 a day)—with many at risk of being pushed
into extreme poverty through economic downturn
or external shocks.

How economies in Asia and the Pacific utilize new
and emerging technologies will be important in
meeting development challenges. Technological
advancements are broadening the platforms for
education and health care, making renewable
energy competitive and expanding access to
modern communications. The challenge for the
region is to capitalize on these opportunities while
managing the disruptive impacts—such as labor
displacement, cyber fraud, and data theft—that
some technologies may have on society.

STRATEGIC FOCUS
Introduction of Strategy 2030

In July 2018, after a comprehensive consultation
process with all of its stakeholders, ADB adopted
anew corporate strategy for the coming decade—

Strategy 2030. This strategy now guides
ADB's support to its developing member countries

(DMCs) to achieve a prosperous, inclusive,
resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while
sustaining efforts to eradicate poverty.

Strategy 2030 highlights new operational priorities
and approaches to respond more effectively to
global and regional development challenges. These
strategic directions are aligned with the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and Financing for
Development agenda, the Paris Agreement

on climate change, the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction, and the G20 agenda on
infrastructure development.

Strategy 2030 recognizes that the ambitious
global development agenda must be tailored to
specific local circumstances. ADB will strengthen
the way it addresses the evolving needs of its
DMCs—providing them with appropriate finance,
knowledge, and partnerships. Strategy 2030
emphasizes the use of innovative technologies
and the need for integrated initiatives that unite
the bank’s diverse expertise and draw on a mix

of public and private sector operations. Staff

are expected to work together as One ADB to
deliver Strategy 2030, promoting greater synergy
among departments and across all offices within
headquarters and in the field.

ADB will continue to prioritize support for the
region’s poorest and most vulnerable countries.
It will apply differentiated approaches across
various country groupings—fragile and conflictaffected situations and small island developing
states, low-income and lower middle-income
countries, and upper middle-income countries.
In addition, the bank will address the needs of
lagging areas and pockets of poverty and fragility
within these countries.

ADB will promote infrastructure investments that
are green, sustainable, resilient, and inclusive.

The bank is also doubling its efforts to expand its
private sector operations, catalyze and mobilize
more financial resources, and strengthen its role as
a knowledge provider.

STRATEGY 2030BYPASS A BOOST
FOR BANGLADESH

» In December 2018, a consortium of companies
from the People’s Republic of China—Sichuan Road
and Bridge Group, Shamim Enterprise, and UDC
Construction—signed a concession contract with the
Government of Bangladesh to upgrade the Dhaka
Bypass under a public-private partnership (PPP)
arrangement.

ADB acted as financial advisor on the transaction to the
PPP Authority of Bangladesh, focusing on commercial
aspects such as currency indexation, minimum revenue
guarantees, review of the financial model, and support
during the bid process and negotiations.

The project is the first road PPP to be implemented
under Bangladesh’s PPP Act. It will add 48 kilometers
of four-lane tollway and two-lane service road to

the N105 Highway, providing vital connections with
industrial zones, ports, and highways to other major
cities.

“This project brings a new dimension to public service
delivery in Bangladesh. It is the first access-controlled
expressway in the country,” says chief executive officer
of the PPP Authority, Syed Afsor H. Uddin. “This
landmark transaction will pave the way for a pipeline of
national expressways across Bangladesh.”

Traffic slows to a stop ona busy freeway in Dhaka, Bangladesh. ADB acted
as a financial advisor on a public-private partnership project to upgrade the

Dhaka Bypass.

Strategy 2030 highlights the critical role of
investing to reduce inequality in access to
opportunities; generate quality jobs; and improve
human capital and social inclusion through
health, education, and social protection. Such
investments will help address root causes of
poverty and inequality related to income and

other social constraints.

In 2018, ADB expanded its support for education
initiatives, with a vocational project in India that
will train 35,000 youth in industry-led courses
for upskilling and/or reskilling; a higher education
program in Sri Lanka to foster technologyoriented graduates equipped with marketrelevant skills and entrepreneurial spirit; and
primary education development in Bangladesh
to train more than 100,000 teachers to use

technology resources in the classroom.

 

In health, ADB committed financing to improve
the delivery of health services, increase
accountability in the health sector, and strengthen
management in subnational health systems in
Papua New Guinea. The bank also committed
financing for rural primary health care in
Uzbekistan, which will allow women to access
ultrasound services as part of available antenatal
and reproductive health services.

In Mongolia, ADB committed its first disability loan
to ensure social and economic inclusion for people
with disabilities. The $25 million loan, cofinanced
with a $2 million grant from the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction, will help provide early medical
and social intervention services to children with
disabilities, construct infrastructure and public
spaces designed to accommodate people with
disabilities, build industry partnerships to enhance
their job opportunities, and support policy reform.

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018To advance financial inclusion, ADB committed
support for the development of a national

retail payment system and a new national
identification system in the Philippines to reach
small businesses, farmers, and poorer households.

Under Strategy 2030, ADB will focus on
accelerating progress in gender equality. The
bank aims to have 75% of its operations promote
gender equality by 2030 and, for the first time, will
include private sector operations.

ADB focuses on five areas concerning gender
equality: promoting women’s economic
empowerment, supporting equality in human
development, advancing equality in decisionmaking and leadership, reducing the time
poverty of women, and strengthening women’s
resilience to economic shocks and other setbacks.
In addition, ADB will align with targets and
indicators in SDG 5 (gender equality) such as
narrowing gender gaps in access to land and
other economic assets and resources, addressing
gender-based violence, challenging genderrelated social norms, meeting reproductive and
other health needs of women and girls, and
reducing gender gaps in access to information
and communication technology (ICT).

In 2018, ADB continued to help empower women
and girls through newly committed operations.

In Sri Lanka, the bank is financing a credit project
that supports small and medium-sized enterprises
led by women, helping them access loans to either
start or scale up their businesses, with targets for
first-time borrowers and those in lagging regions.
Through a grant from the Women Entrepreneurs
Finance Initiative, an additional 600 women

will benefit from access to finance, and at least
500 more will be provided with on-site and online
business training and mentoring.

In Tajikistan, as part of a cross-border corridor
development project, ADB supported women’s
economic empowerment by providing business

skills training to 300 women managers and seed
grants to 140 women entrepreneurs. It also
increased awareness of HIV/AIDS and sexually
transmitted diseases among 35,000 people.

Climate change and disasters threaten the
long-term sustainability of development in

Asia and the Pacific. These challenges, if not
addressed, will threaten the economic gains made
by DMCs. Under Strategy 2030, ADB will step up
its efforts in tackling climate change, building
climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing
environmental sustainability.

The bank’s work includes scaling up support

to address climate change, disaster risks, and
environmental degradation; accelerating efforts
to lower greenhouse gas emissions; ensuring a
comprehensive approach to building climate
and disaster resilience; promoting environmental
sustainability; and increasing the focus on the
water-food-energy security nexus. ADB has set
new climate change targets so at least 75% of its
committed operations will be supporting climate
change mitigation and adaptation by 2030. Climate
finance from ADB’s own resources will reach
$80 billion for 2019-2030.

In 2018, ADB launched a platform to help DMCs
translate their nationally determined climate
contributions into viable investment plans.

A technical assistance package was approved

to provide capacity building and technical support
to DMCs, allowing them to develop and test

the viability of mitigation actions made under the
Paris Agreement.

ADB has successfully mobilized a total of

$373 million in financing from the Green Climate
Fund for nine projects, including four committed
in 2018. Together, the four projects will boost
the climate resilience of critical agriculture
infrastructure in Cambodia; transform parts of
Ulaanbaatar City into affordable, low-carbon,
and livable ecodistricts; build Nauru’s first fully

Energy policymakers across developing nations are working to engage
communities, financial institutions, private sector partners, and
nongovernment organizations to deploy small hybrid renewable energy
systems in remote areas. To further these efforts, ADB supported three
pilot projects in the island communities of Maldives and Sri Lanka, one in

a remote mountain village in Nepal, one in a local school in Bangladesh,
and one in a small village in Pakistan. This publication discusses the lessons
from the projects and highlights key considerations in the deployment of
small hybrid renewable energy systems.

provided funding of over $27 million from two trust
funds administered by ADB—Leading Asia’s Private
Sector Infrastructure Fund and the Canadian
Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia |I—for
the implementation of Indonesia’s first utility-scale
solar power project.

In 2018, ADB supported investments to build
climate resilience in water supply and urban
management as well as in the conservation,
restoration, and sustainable management of natural
resources. In the People’s Republic of China,
technical assistance projects supporting the green
development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt
will help develop policies and economic incentives,
as well as establish public-private mechanisms, to
support the restoration of ecosystems.

In 2018, ADB continued to promote financial
preparedness for disasters in its DMCs. In Palau,

it committed a $15 million loan to support the
country’s disaster resilience program. The Asian
Development Fund Disaster Response Facility was
also accessed to reconstruct Tonga’s electricity
network following Tropical Cyclone Gita in February.

ADB will pursue its priority of making cities

more livable by taking an integrated approach

to projects that simultaneously address multiple
development goals, including environmental
sustainability; urban health; gender equality; and the
resilience of cities to climate and disaster risks. ADB
will support improved inclusive urban mobility and
accessibility for all residents, especially the elderly
and people with disabilities.

In 2018, ADB expanded its urban sector portfolio.
The bank now supports integrated urban planning,
solid waste management, flood control, urban
transport, climate-resilient infrastructure, urban
drainage systems, economic corridors, energy
utility management incorporating low-carbon
technologies, and the use of ICT in the operation
of urban governance systems. The Urban Climate
Change Resilience Trust Fund also commenced
the development of pilot projects on climate
resilience in selected communities within 10 cities
across Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan,
and the Philippines.

 

 

In Maldives, ADB committed a $35 million grant to
establish a modern waste collection, transfer, and
disposal system. The project will not only improve
environmental conditions for the 216,000 residents
in the 35 inhabited islands of Greater Malé, it will
also make the area more attractive to tourists to
support local economic growth.

In Viet Nam, ADB invested $170 million to help
develop the resilience of the cities of Ha Giang,
Hue, and Vinh Yen to climate change impacts,
primarily flooding. The project will benefit around
116,000 households.

Strategy 2030 emphasizes the role of rural
development in modernizing agriculture to achieve
food security, while improving quality of life in rural
areas. In promoting rural development and food
security, ADB will focus on increasing agricultural
productivity; improving market connectivity and
agricultural value chains; expanding access to
nutritious, safe, and affordable food; and creating
public goods to spur rural growth. The bank will
support initiatives that improve natural resources
management; climate-resilient technologies and
practices; infrastructure for modern wholesale
markets and agribusinesses; rural finance, health,
and education; rural-urban connectivity; and
agriculture policy and regulatory reforms.

In 2018, ADB investments covered irrigation;
institutional and capacity development;
agro-industry, marketing, and trade; solid waste
management; water supply services; and flood
protection. The bank’s nonsovereign investments
focused on increasing agricultural production and
developing agro-industry, marketing, and trade.

ADB supports climate-friendly agribusiness value
chains across Southeast Asia, and has provided

a $90 million loan to Cambodia, a $40.5 million
grant to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
and a $40.5 million loan to Myanmar. These
projects will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions
by 240,000 tons, rehabilitate 30,000 hectares

of land for farm irrigation, and train more than
100,000 farmers on climate-smart agriculture. The
projects aim to implement climate-smart water
management across 13,000 hectares; provide
35,000 smallholders with debit cards of up to
$300 to purchase quality seeds, fertilizers, and
other inputs as well as access farm mechanization
services; and give 50,000 farmers access to
improved weather, market, and credit information
systems.

With a priority on strengthening governance
and institutional capacity under Strategy 2030,
ADB will continue to support public management
reforms and financial stability, help improve
service delivery, and strengthen governance
capacity and standards. In line with the SDGs

and the Financing for Development agenda, the
bank will increase support for mobilizing and
optimizing domestic resources, enhancing public
expenditure management, promoting private sector
participation, building economic and institutional
resilience, and responding to economic shocks.

At the service-delivery level, ADB will prioritize
decentralization and local governance as well as
reforms to state-owned enterprises. To improve
the quality and performance of operations, the
bank will support DMCs to strengthen country
systems and standards and increase accountability
and transparency. It will also promote the use of
digital technology and the engagement of citizens
to create and sustain good governance practices.

In 2018, ADB supported public sector
management projects that promote good
governance and institutional capacity
development. The projects covered reforms

to economic management, fiscal and public
expenditure management, private sector
participation, ICT development, environmental
management, and disaster management.

and improve social sector and infrastructure
spending by strengthening medium-term
expenditure planning.

ADB approved a $300 million loan to the
Philippines to increase financial inclusion by
creating an enabling institutional and policy
environment, improving infrastructure, and
strengthening financial service providers. The
program will enhance the capabilities of the central
government and private stakeholders such as rural
banks; micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises;
and industry associations.

ADB's support for fostering regional cooperation
and integration across Asia and the Pacific
focuses on reducing gaps in connectivity-related
infrastructure, addressing income inequality within
and across DMCs, and promoting open regionalism
in trade and investment. ADB works to enhance
financial interconnectedness among DMCs,

build stronger resilience to financial shocks and
contagion, respond to climate change, and generate
more regional public goods.

In 2018, ADB committed financing for projects

to promote connectivity, competitiveness, and
regional public goods across Asia and the Pacific,
mainly through the subregional cooperation
programs for which ADB serves as Secretariat.

ADB also made new investments in the Pacific to
improve internet connectivity, ensure the climate
resilience of port facilities, and facilitate the regional
purchase of critical vaccines.

ADB continued to provide technical assistance
that fostered regional cooperation through
studies, capacity building, and key events. The
bank helped organize the Sixth Greater Mekong
Subregion Summit of Leaders in Viet Nam, where
the Ha Noi Action Plan, 2018-2022 was adopted.

In expanding its private sector operation under
Strategy 2030, ADB will seek to: add value in

areas such as corporate governance and social

and environmental safeguards; assist in preparing
bankable projects for private sector financing;
diversify its sector and geographic coverage; support
greater financial inclusion; strengthen capital
markets; and extend its reach through the use of
private equity funds.

CATALYZING AND MOBILIZING
FINANCE

In 2018, ADB mobilized $6.83 billion in external
funds from bilateral and multilateral agencies and
other financing partners, including $2 billion from
the World Bank for nine projects, and $133.9 million
from the Green Climate Fund for five projects.

During the year, ADB renewed its memorandum

of understanding with the Export-Import Bank of
Korea for a co-lending contribution of $650 million,
and its framework cofinancing agreement with the
International Fund for Agricultural Development
to strengthen cooperation for another 6 years.

The bank also signed its first memorandum of
understanding with the Spanish Agency for
International Development Cooperation to promote
knowledge sharing through joint research and
analytical works. In April, ADB established the

Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity Fund with a
$29.6 million contribution from the Government

of the United Kingdom to support regional
cooperation and integration in selected countries
in Central and South Asia. The trust fund focuses

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018TOWARD A RESILIENT KOLKATA

> Flooding is a hard fact of life in Kolkata, India. The
sprawling coastal city of more than 14 million people is
considered one of the world’s most flood-prone. Heavy
monsoon rains and frequent storms cause water to
regularly flood into a city with flat terrain, poor drainage,
and a population largely unprepared. These events, which
have become more frequent due to climate change, cause
major damage to both lives and livelihoods.

In September, the city’s residents received some good
news when Kolkata’s mayor launched India’s first
city-level flood forecasting and early warning system.
Supported by ADB technical assistance, the system will
provide forecasts as well as real-time information on
inundation, temperature, air quality, and other climaterelated data through 400 sensor nodes placed around the
city. The data will be analyzed and shared with the city’s
residents immediately through mobile alerts and public
service announcements on radio and TV. The system will
improve flood awareness and safety at the community
level, as well as reduce economic impacts.

The system’s launch is part of a 20-year partnership
between ADB and Kolkata’s local government to make a

more livable city through integrated planning and phased
investments to improve resilience and urban services.

A flood warning system will help Kolkata city officials and residents act
decisively to minimize damage before and during disasters.

poor by generating increased trade and investment.
In 2018, the fund approved two projects worth
$2.5 million to facilitate transport and trade.

In 2018, ADB mobilized about $7.7 billion in longand short-term cofinancing for private sector
operations. Long-term nonsovereign commercial
cofinancing totalled $3.6 billion in 2018. This means
that every $1 of ADB financing for private sector
operations was matched by $1.20 in long-term
cofinancing from commercial and official sources.

Public-Private Partnerships

ADB fosters the efficient delivery of public

services and assets through private investment and
innovation. Public-private partnerships play a major
role in this area. As well as financing public-private
partnerships, the bank assists in building capacity of
key public sector agencies in DMCs, strengthening
institutional frameworks, and scaling up project
preparation activities.

 

In Central and West Asia and Southeast Asia,
ADB assisted in building robust legal and
institutional frameworks and establishing
dedicated facilities to prepare projects for private
sector development. In South Asia, the bank is
supporting sovereign projects that attempt to
leverage private sector participation, not only to
augment project financing, but also to provide
operational efficiencies.

To increase the pipeline of bankable projects,
ADB secured seven new transaction advisory
mandates in 2018 to advise on infrastructure
projects totaling approximately $4.62 billion,
while it completed three transaction advisory
mandates for projects with a capital expenditure
of $1.23 billion.

The bank also continues to manage donor trust
funds such as the Asia Pacific Project Preparation
Facility—funded by Australia, Canada, and
Japan—to help prepare projects.

STRENGTHENING KNOWLEDGE SERVICES
UNDER STRATEGY 2030

Under Strategy 2030, ADB will continue to
strengthen its role as a leading provider and
distributor of development knowledge. It will work
closely with developing member countries (DMCs)
to identify their needs and respond with the most
relevant knowledge products and services.

In 2018, ADB’s knowledge products and services
promoted innovation and the integration of
advanced technologies in project design. Such
projects included investments in digital health,
information and communication technology for
education, financial innovation and disruptive
technologies, innovations in energy generation and
storage systems, closing of the financing gap for
infrastructure, and climate-resilience building.

The 2018 edition of ADB’s flagship publication,
the Asian Development Outlook, draws attention

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2013.

 

to opportunities and concerns presented by new
technologies in the workplace. New technologies
drive higher productivity and are the foundation
for economic growth, better-paid jobs, and poverty
reduction. However, because these technologies
may threaten some jobs and displace less-skilled
workers, governments must pursue education
reforms that promote lifelong learning and
maintain labor market flexibility. Governments
must also strengthen social protection systems.
This will ensure that new technologies develop in
ways that benefit people and protect their rights.

ADB's research work continues to stimulate new
ideas, encourage discussions on policies, and
provide insights from regional perspectives. The
September update to the Asian Development
Outlook found that developing Asia was holding
up against economic headwinds from beyondthe region, with external demand supporting
the region’s large economies and higherthan-expected oil prices boosting prospects

for many oil and gas exporters. The update
further explored key pockets of vulnerability

in the region and the policy options available

to manage them, given the new challenges to
maintaining macroeconomic stability brought
about by the changing global landscape.
Meanwhile, a special supplement to the ADB
publication Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific
2018 demonstrated the role of remote sensing in
improving the quality and timeliness of statistics
on rice area, yield, and production. Building on
research and field surveys undertaken in the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Thailand,
and Viet Nam, the study emphasized the need
to invest in technologically advanced agricultural
data collection and management practices to
support evidence-based policymaking.

ADB is producing knowledge products and
services that cut across various sectors and
themes. It recently released publications

on inclusive business, smart cities, regional
industrialization, aging societies, and regional
integration. Through its Law and Policy Reform
Program, ADB supported DMCs with legal
reforms and capacity building to help them
accomplish national development goals. The
program aims to help DMCs establish regulatory
and judicial institutions that adopt and apply
laws and regulations fairly, consistently, ethically,
and predictably. The bank’s leadership in
fostering lateral thinking and creative problem
solving is demonstrated through several
prominent forums. These include the bank’s

annual Asia Clean Energy Forum, the ADB
Transport Forum, the ADB Water Forum, and the

Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Forum.
Other examples include work on climate change
and environmental justice; risk management in
lending to small and medium-sized enterprises;
anticorruption awareness for executive agencies,
the private sector, and civil society; internal
auditing and accountability mechanisms; and
public sector accounting capacity.

ADB continually works to streamline knowledge
partnerships and identify appropriate modes
for engaging with other institutions. In 2018,

the bank developed new joint work programs

to engage knowledge partners and deliver
specific outputs. Across the year, it signed three
knowledge partnership agreements and seven
cooperation agreements for development
partnerships. These partnerships complemented
ADB's in-house expertise by providing specialist
knowledge in areas such as spatial information
solutions for urban development, research

and technical advice in building the capacity

of higher education institutions, training
programs for environmental law professionals,
and collaborative platforms to promote solar
technologies.

In 2018, ADB created the Knowledge Services
Division in its Department of Communications
to meet demand within the bank for knowledge
support. This will complement existing
knowledge efforts upstream through the
Sustainable Development and Climate Change
Department’s Knowledge Advisory Services
Center and midstream through the various
sector and thematic groups. The creation of the
division is in line with Strategy 2030’s emphasis
on integrating ADB departmental knowledge and
expertise under the One ADB approach. The
bank is also surveying its personnel to assess its
capabilities in terms of managing knowledge. The
results of this internal survey will help identify
ways to strengthen knowledge support.

Growth in the Central and West Asia region
remained robust in 2018.

In Azerbaijan, the economy recovered due to
higher oil prices, while Kazakhstan’s oil and natural
gas production was steady, as were exports and
investment. In Uzbekistan, growth accelerated,
driven by investments in manufacturing,
construction, energy, and mining. Tajikistan’s
economy expanded due to continued large-scale
public investments, higher remittances, and
improved relations with Uzbekistan that boosted
bilateral trade. Georgia saw steady growth on gains
in net exports and higher investments.

Most other economies in the region recorded
slower but still robust growth in 2018.

Turkmenistan’s growth was driven largely by

public investment and gas exports. Armenia’s
slower growth reflected a slowdown in industry
and a contraction in agriculture. Despite higher
remittances, growth in the Kyrgyz Republic fell due
to declines in gold production and manufacturing.
Drought and continuing security concerns led to a
slowing of growth in Afghanistan. Pakistan posted
lower growth in the fiscal year 2018, affected by
challenges in the country’s balance of payments.

A newly elected government, which took office in
August 2018, has begun formulating policies to deal
with Pakistan’s fiscal budget and current account
deficits and restore its economic growth.

Through its ongoing country programs in Central

STRATEGIC FOCUS

ADB's work in Central and West Asia in 2018
anticipated Strategy 2030’s operational priorities.

As one of the leading providers of infrastructure
finance in the region, many of ADB’s infrastructure
development projects are aimed at fostering
regional cooperation and integration under

the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation

CAREC) Program.

In November, at the 17th CAREC Ministerial
Conference in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, ADB
President Takehiko Nakao announced $2 billion
in new assistance for regional projects in CAREC
countries. The funding is part of $5 billion in
ADB support over 2018-2022 to underpin the
CAREC 2030 strategy. The new assistance will
be dedicated to improving regional connectivity,
promoting electricity exports, and strengthening
trade facilitation.

 

During 2018, ADB committed $500 million for its
first energy project in Turkmenistan. The project
will establish a power transmission backbone

for the country, improving the reliability of

power supply for both domestic consumers and
neighboring power-importing countries, including
Afghanistan. ADB also committed a $35 million
grant to reconnect Tajikistan’s electricity system
to the Central Asian Power System through an
interconnection with the Uzbekistan system. This
will enable Tajikistan to export summer surplus
electricity to Uzbekistan and allow for more
efficient use of regional energy resources.

In Georgia, ADB signed a $300 million loan
agreement to finance the construction of a
4-lane, 12-kilometer (km) road on the East-West
Highway between Khevi and Ubisa. The highway
carries about 60% of Georgia's foreign trade
freight. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of
Pakistan, ADB will help rehabilitate 214 km of
provincial roads, while also enhancing the capacity
of municipal authorities to maintain roads in
Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the Kyrgyz Republic,
the bank committed $78 million to complete

the rehabilitation of two further road sections

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018on the North-South Alternate Corridor between
CAREC Corridors 1 and 3. The project will improve
connectivity and mobility, link economically
underprivileged regions with economic hubs, and
strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry
of Transport and Roads.

ADB investments contributed to accelerating
progress in gender equality across the region
in 2018.

About 43% of ADB projects committed for Central
and West Asia in 2018 included gender-related
outcomes, the highest number since the bank
introduced gender-mainstreaming measures in
2010. ADB undertook work on five country gender
assessments (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the
Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan), and the findings
informed country policy dialogue. The bank also
initiated project gender studies to highlight success
stories of women who benefited from projects

for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in
Kazakhstan and rural housing in Uzbekistan.

to participate more effectively in horticulture value chains. In
2018, the bank approved a $75 million grant to Afghanistan
and additional financing of $198 million for Uzbekistan to
expand access to finance for farmers and enterprises.

In Afghanistan, where agriculture employs two-thirds of the
workforce and contributes 22% of gross domestic product,
enterprises are benefiting from the latest in precooling
rooms, storage facilities, processing equipment and
machinery, a quality control accredited laboratory, a tissue
culture laboratory, and an introduction to international best
practices for horticulture processing plants. Eligible farmers
are accessing assistance for modern greenhouses; planting
materials; storage facilities; processing, drying, and grading
equipment; and water sourcing and distribution systems.

In Uzbekistan, the additional financing is increasing farm
productivity by improving processing and storage capacities
and reducing post-harvest losses through the establishment
and upgrade of intensive orchards; modern water- and
energy-efficient greenhouses; and processing, storage, and
refrigeration facilities. This ADB assistance will help improve

BENEFITS FROM TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE

Abdullo Dargaev contemplates the lack of water in his drought-stricken village
in the Pyanj River Basin of Tajikistan. Through ADB support to address the
impacts of climate change, Abdullo’s village will have a steady supply of safe
drinking water in 2019.

» Tajikistan is one of the world’s countries most vulnerable

to climate change. Communities in the country’s Pyanj River
Basin—covering 114,500 square kilometers and home to around
1.5 million people—are already experiencing extreme weather
events such as floods, droughts, and landslides, which destroy
crops and infrastructure and, in the worst cases, take lives.

Abdullo Dargaev lives in the Pyanj River Basin village of
Namuna Jamoat, where a lack of water due to drought has
impacted daily life.

“Our villagers go as far as 5 kilometers every day to bring water
for drinking, cooking, and other household needs,” Abdullo says.

Through an ADB project, funded by a $21.6 million grant from
the Strategic Climate Fund to reduce adverse effects of climate
change in 59 villages in the river basin, over 4,000 households in
Abdullo’s village will enjoy the flow of safe drinking water for the
first time in March 2019.

 

In Tajikistan, the bank committed a $41 million grant
to rehabilitate and expand climate-resilient water
supply and sanitation infrastructure in the southeast
of Dushanbe, establishing 18 district metering areas
and installing a new network management system
with smart water meters for nonrevenue water
management and efficient water usage.

In 2018, ADB committed $223 million for urban
infrastructure investments across Central and West
Asia, with the aim of making cities more livable.

ADB provided $37 million to the Kyrgyz Republic

The People’s Republic of China, Mongolia

 

_— The People’s Republic of China (PRC) and

BY THE Mongolia continued their recent record of solid

NUMBERS economic performance in 2018, amid unstable
external conditions. Policymakers in the PRC were
faced with the challenges of tackling financial

$2 25 B risks and stabilizing growth, particularly in the

COMMITTED second half of 2018. The economy decelerated

from the second quarter onwards as a result

of a slowing housing market, tight conditions
$1 76 B for nonbank lending, and lower export growth

relative to imports. These underlying concerns
DISBURSED 6
were exacerbated by increased uncertainties
surrounding global trade. In response, the country’s
$678 6 M macroeconomic policy was reversed in the second

° half of 2018. Fiscal expansion and loosening of

COFINANCED monetary policy, combined with strong momentum
in the first half of the year, kept gross domestic

$27. 8 M product growth on track at 6.6%.

TECHNICAL Mongolia’s economic performance continued to

ASSISTANCE improve, with growth reaching 6.9% in 2018 from
5.3% in 2017. The main drivers were increasing coal
exports, large investments in the mining sector, and
strong domestic demand. Sound macroeconomic
policies also played an important role.

In the PRC, 2018 marked the 4oth anniversary of
reforms and the opening up of the economy. The
country is expected to continue reforms to realize
high-quality development and the transition to
high-income country status. Its major targets
include preventing financial risks, alleviating
poverty, and controlling pollution. Meanwhile,
29.6% of Mongolia’s population remains classified
as poor, and the country’s progress continues to
be restricted by underdeveloped infrastructure,
lack of export diversification, underemployment,
desertification, and air pollution.

ADB's program in the PRC continued to promote
innovation and advanced technology, pollution
control and climate change mitigation and
adaptation, more equitable access to services,
reduced rural-urban disparities, and enhanced
regional connectivity. In Mongolia, ADB’s
operations in 2018 helped sustain inclusive growth,
promote economic and social stability, develop
infrastructure for economic diversification, and
strengthen environmental sustainability.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

In addressing remaining poverty and reducing
inequalities across East Asia, ADB focused its
efforts on promoting inclusiveness, improving
education for all, and lowering vulnerability in urban
and rural areas.

In 2018, ADB and the PRC signed a memorandum
of understanding in which the bank commits to
help the government implement its rural vitalization
strategy. Works under the agreement will address
rural-urban disparities, modernize agriculture,

raise farming productivity, identify appropriate job
training, and deliver employment assistance for the
rural poor.

In January, ADB committed $150 million to improve
basic infrastructure and living conditions in the
PRC’s Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The project
will construct and rehabilitate urban roads and
install utility pipes for water as well as piping

for wastewater, heating, and gas. Adopting an
innovative approach to urban-rural development,
the project will not only provide for physical
infrastructure but will also help 13,800 rural migrants
transition to urban life by providing appropriate
skills training.

ADB is working with the PRC to help develop care
facilities for the improved wellbeing of the country’s
aging population. In 2018, ADB committed a

$50 million results-based loan to help Yichang City
in Hubei Province partner with the private sector
to pilot integrated residential, community, and
home-based elderly care services that are expected
to benefit around 3,000 older people annually

by 2022. The project will help demonstrate how
public-private partnerships can be used by local
governments to deliver social services in the PRC.

In April, ADB committed a $50 million loan to help
improve access to, and the quality of, pre-primary,
primary, and secondary education in Mongolia.

The project aims to expand the capacity of schools
and kindergartens and reduce class sizes; reform the
curriculum and associated assessment systems; and
train teachers, school managers, and local education
administrators. It will directly benefit about 15,000

REGIONS | EAST ASIAA ROAD FORWARD ON URBANIZATION

A villager in Wangyuantun, People’s Republic of China enjoys cooking with
clean, piped water for the first time. Water purification is just one aspect of
ADB’s efforts to tackle rapid urbanization in the country.

> Yan Zhigang is a former farmer living in Wangyuantun, a village
in the Hebei Province of the People’s Republic of China, where
wastewater management and sanitation were severely lacking
until recent times.

“When it rained, the sewer would overflow into the village, with
mosquitoes and flies multiplying everywhere,” says Zhigang.

Now, thanks to ADB assistance, the foul-smelling sewer next to
his village has been turned into a paved road.

The new road is part of an ADB investment to address rapid
urbanization, severe pollution, stifling congestion, and growing
poverty in two of the country’s provinces, Liaoning in the
northeast and Hebei in the north.

ADB provided a $100 million loan and accessed grants of
$250,000 each for Liaoning and Hebei from the Multidonor
Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility to
build and upgrade roads; improve water supply, water purification,
and drainage systems; and install urban and district heating.

The combined investment has benefited more than 3 million

the project will supply clean and reliable electricity

to about 260,000 people in remote towns in the west
of the country—where people rely on costly and
high-polluting power sources.

ADB's work in making cities more livable across East
Asia includes projects that promote green, inclusive,
and environmentally sustainable urban living.

n the PRC, the bank committed $150 million to
address environmental and infrastructure needs
associated with municipal solid waste management in
10 counties and county-level cities in the Xiangjiang
River watershed of Hunan Province. The project is
part of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Framework.

t will help close or remediate substandard municipal
andfill sites, pilot integrated municipal solid waste
management systems, and upgrade sanitary landfill
cilities, reducing discharge of pollutants and directly
benefiting 6.9 million people.

n Mongolia, ADB committed a $130 million
policy-based loan to improve air quality in
Ulaanbaatar. The loan will help reduce emissions in
the city’s most polluted ger areas (tent communities)
by replacing raw coal used for heating and cooking
with more efficient and cleaner-burning processed
coal. The project will also replace inefficient and
highly polluting coal-fired, heat-only boilers with
distributed heating systems. The program is expected
to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions

by 133,800 tons per year and improve the health

of ger residents.

 

ADB is fostering regional cooperation and
integration by enhancing physical connectivity
and increasing the competitiveness of exports from
the PRC and Mongolia.

In 2018, ADB committed $180 million to support

the PRC’s participation in the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS) Program and to deepen economic
integration with countries in Southeast Asia. The
program will improve key trade infrastructure and
services, develop e-commerce platforms in border
economic zones, achieve efficient transport and trade
operations along the GMS North-South Economic
Corridor, and strengthen economic ties between the
PRC’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the
rest of the GMS.

ADB also committed $60 million to improve
Mongolia’s regional road network, enhancing the
safety of road sections that provide crucial links with
the PRC and the Russian Federation. The project
will improve economic cooperation and trade for
Mongolia, while expanding access to markets and
basic services for local residents.

Economic growth across the Pacific region
remained positive in 2018, averaging 1.1%.
Although uncertainty persists concerning
key economic drivers in Timor-Leste (public
spending) and Palau (tourism), each of these
economies rebounded from declines in 2017.
Growth in Tuvalu also picked up, boosted by
government spending that was supported by
higher fishing license revenues.

Despite overall expansion, three disaster events
contributed to average growth in the Pacific
slowing by 1.3 percentage points against the

2017 growth rate of 2.4%. ADB’s developing
member countries (DMCs) in the Pacific are
among the world’s nations most exposed to
disasters. Moreover, their small size, remoteness,
and limited resources restrict their ability to
rebound from external shocks. In 2018, the Pacific
experienced an earthquake in Papua New Guinea
(PNG), the region’s largest economy; a Category 4
severe tropical cyclone in Tonga; and a volcanic
eruption in Vanuatu.

The earthquake in PNG resulted in a temporary
halt to liquefied natural gas exports, but strong
performance of the country’s mining sector and
some stimulus from hosting the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Summit helped keep
PNG’s growth positive. Growth in Fiji and Vanuatu
eased, mostly because reconstruction activity in
response to earlier major disasters—Cyclone Pam
in 2015 and Cyclone Winston in 2016—wound
down. In Tonga, growth slowed as Cyclone Gita
damaged homes, government buildings, and
infrastructure for basic services, with total impacts
estimated to be equal to 38% of the country’s
gross domestic product. In addition to disaster
events, the closure of the Yazaki automotive
wiring harness plant in Samoa and reduced
activity at Nauru’s processing center for asylum
seekers both restricted growth.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

ADB focuses on addressing the root causes of
fragility and vulnerability in the Pacific.

In 2018, under the operational priority of tackling
climate change, building climate and disaster
resilience, and enhancing environmental
sustainability, ADB helped the Pacific increase its
access to contingent financing, respond to disasters,
increase renewable energy generation capacity, and
climate-proof its infrastructure.

ADB provides disaster-contingent financing to the
Cook Islands, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. In 2018,
it extended coverage to Palau with a $15 million
policy-based loan that will enable the government
to rapidly access finance for short-term recovery
needs, complementing parallel reforms to improve
disaster resilience. ADB also mobilized $2.5 million
from its Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund for
relief efforts in PNG, Tonga, and Vanuatu. When
Cyclone Gita hit Tonga, the fund enabled ADB to
disburse $1 million for humanitarian relief in less
than 2 weeks. The bank subsequently committed a
$6.8 million grant through the Asian Development
Fund to reconstruct priority areas of Tonga’s
electricity network to a higher standard of disaster
resilience. In PNG, ADB mobilized $1 million

for relief supplies in provinces affected by the

7-5 magnitude earthquake. In Vanuatu, it disbursed
$500,000 to provide food and water, medical and
hygiene kits, and emergency shelter for people
affected by the volcanic eruption.

ADB continues to support climate change
mitigation and fuel security initiatives in the
Pacific. In the Cook Islands, the bank administered
a $12 million grant from the Green Climate Fund,
which provides additional financing to expand
solar power generation on Rarotonga, reducing
fossil fuel consumption and enhancing energy
security. In Tonga, ADB committed $5.5 million for
a solar power generation plant on the outer islands,
increasing access to electricity and reducing costs
for consumers.

In 2018, ADB approved a $12.7 million grant from the
bank’s Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility
to rehabilitate a fuel tank farm in the Marshall
Islands. The project will improve fuel security and
address critical safety hazards.

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018In Nauru, 95% of international trade relies on port
facilities, which are susceptible to the impacts

of climate change. ADB committed $21.3 million
to build a climate-resilient port and upgrade
associated facilities. The project received
cofinancing of $26.9 million from the Green
Climate Fund and $14.1 million from the
Government of Australia.

In PNG, ADB administered a $5 million grant from
the Strategic Climate Fund and $3 million from

the Government of Australia to climate-proof a
provincial wharf in Milne Bay Province. The wharf
will serve as a model for upgrading similar structures
in PNG. The project will also increase the capacity
of communities, government agencies, and civil
society to plan for, and respond to, climate change.

To promote rural development and food
security, ADB is helping to improve connectivity
in Timor-Leste by investing $44 million to upgrade

» ADB has made a series of major investments in
communications technology to connect Pacific island nations
to the internet via fiber-optic submarine cables.

In 2013, 827 kilometers of cable (cofinanced by ADB,

the Government of Tonga, Tonga Cable, and the World

Bank Group) connected Tonga to the main trans-Pacific

link between Australia and the United States. Since then,
connection speeds have doubled and internet costs have
fallen 75% (compared with satellites), delivering digital health
and digital education services, stabilizing business expenses,
and greatly improving the social life of Tongans.

Palau was connected to a cable between Indonesia and
Guam in 2017, while the 1,300-kilometer Tui-Samoa cable
(cofinanced by ADB, the governments of Australia and
Samoa, Samoa Submarine Cable Company, and the World
Bank) was switched on in February 2018 and links the
country’s largest islands, Upolu and Savai’i, to the cable
network in Fiji.

These projects, together with two others currently in
implementation, are projected to benefit nearly 450,000
people in the Cook Islands, the Federated States of
Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, and Tonga.

NEW GENERATORS LIGHT THE WAY FOR NAURU

Aworker monitors power loads at the Nauru Utilities Corporation. ADB has
helped residents of the island nation enjoy access to cheaper, cleaner, and more
reliable electricity.

>» Itema Moses lives on Nauru, the world’s smallest island
nation, where frequent power outages were a constant challenge
in the recent past.

“When the place was dark, it was easy for crooks to think of
something bad to carry out, like stealing,” 25-year-old Itema says.

Aside from the potential for crime, long outages caused food
to spoil and made household appliances vulnerable to surges.
Expensive power generation also had businesses struggling to
manage costs and many families unable to afford electricity.

In early 2018, however, Nauru replaced its poorly maintained
40-year-old diesel generators with two new energy-efficient
2.9-megawatt generators and made other system improvements,
thanks to grant funding from ADB and the European Union, with
subsequent funding from the governments of Australia and Nauru.

The project has dramatically increased access to cheaper,
more reliable, and cleaner electricity. The country’s power
utility reported a rise in grid connections from 2,175 in 2015 to
3,164 by June 2018.

 

efficient water and sanitation services to urban and
peri-urban areas, and to improve hygiene behavior.

Throughout 2018, ADB continued its work in
strengthening governance and institutional
capacity in the Pacific. It is helping shape fiscal
policies, reform state-owned enterprises, and foster
private sector development across the region. ADB
committed $61.3 million to Fiji, Kiribati, and Solomon
Islands for policy-based loans and grants that support
public sector management reforms and private sector
development. The bank is building the capacity of key
transport agencies in Solomon Islands with a $6 million
project preparation facility designed to improve the
implementation readiness of priority transport projects.

To improve health outcomes in the Pacific, and to help
address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities,
ADB is supporting a regional project of $25.1 million

to deliver comprehensive vaccine programs in Samoa,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, reducing outbreaks of
vaccine-preventable diseases and making primary
health services more available to poor, remote, and
underserved communities.

ADB is also supporting PNG’s health sector

through policy reforms and direct investments in
health systems. The bank committed $195 million

to an ongoing program to support the long-term
sustainability and effective use of health sector
financing, decentralized health service delivery, and the
delivery of quality health care.

Given the small size, isolation, and limited capacity
of many Pacific island countries, ADB is fostering
regional cooperation and integration to pool
resources, leverage economies of scale, and deliver
development results.

Samoa, whose maritime transport is its economic
lifeline, plays a vital role as a subregional hub port,
distributing essential goods to the neighboring islands
of American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Niue, Tokelau,
Tonga, and Tuvalu. ADB is therefore supporting a port
development project in the country, with $3 million for
preparatory work to rehabilitate and extend the existing
breakwater at Apia Port, reconfigure the port area to
enhance operating efficiencies, and provide ancillary

South Asia achieved economic growth of 7%
in 2018, making it the world’s fastest-growing
region.

Several economies in the region posted
significant rises in investment and consumption
for the fiscal year 2018. India’s economy grew
7.3%, largely driven by heightened government
capital expenditure on new infrastructure, while
consumption was supported by a recovery in
rural demand. Bangladesh achieved its fastest
economic expansion in more than 4 decades as
growth reached 7.9%, led by a steep rise in private
consumption as remittances recovered and by
higher public investment in large infrastructure
projects, notably the Padma Bridge and Dhaka
Metro Rail. Similarly, sustained consumption

and greater fixed investment in Nepal saw
growth register 5.9%, following a rebound in
manufacturing, construction, and services, along
with increased private investment in energy
generation and tourism.

The economy of Maldives performed strongly,
with growth at 6.7% for 2018, driven by increases
in tourist arrivals and construction activity.

In Bhutan, economic growth moderated

slightly to 6.7% as industry and tourism
performed below expectations and hydropower
production declined slightly. Sri Lanka’s growth
remained subdued at 3.6%, with tight fiscal
conditions restraining a recovery in agriculture
and continued growth in services. Both
economies also felt the effects of a slowdown in
construction.

 

ADB's program across South Asia in 2018
centered on addressing rapid urbanization,
environmental deterioration, and unemployment;
providing better education and health services;
and building climate and disaster resilience. In
India, ADB committed $3 billion in sovereign
loans in 2018, the highest level of assistance

since sovereign operations began in the country.

Through the South Asia Subregional Economic
Cooperation (SASEC) Program, ADB also

continued to support regional infrastructure,
connectivity, and trade facilitation.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

As key long-term measures in addressing
remaining poverty and reducing inequalities
across South Asia, ADB increased support to
education and the provision of health services.

In Bangladesh, ADB committed $500 million in
2018 to help provide quality primary education to
approximately 18.6 million pupils from preschool
to fifth grade. ADB also committed $225 million to
ongoing reforms in secondary education. The bank
is also supporting a program that will contribute

to increased access, retention, and completion of
secondary schooling by adolescent girls.

In Sri Lanka and Bhutan, ADB committed a
combined $115 million to improve the quality of
technical and vocational education and training to
provide more job-oriented skills and increase youth
employability. An accompanying grant in Sri Lanka
allows for collaboration with the private sector to
support women’s participation and employment in
male-dominated areas of the economy.

To deliver better health services to poor, isolated,
and vulnerable communities, ADB launched a
program in Bhutan to establish satellite clinics and
upgrade existing primary health-care facilities,
improve disease surveillance and response
mechanisms, develop capacity in the health system,
and promote general hygiene. The bank also
committed $50 million for a similar program in four
underserved provinces of Sri Lanka.

ADB is accelerating progress on gender equality
by expanding access to finance for women in
Sri Lanka.

ADB committed $75 million in long-term loans

to Sri Lankan banks, with the funds to be on-lent

to underserved micro, small and medium-sized
enterprises located outside of the Colombo District,
especially women-led enterprises and first-time
borrowers. ADB also committed $12.5 million

in grant and technical assistance to a project to
improve women’s access to finance by providing
loan principal paydowns for women-led enterprises.
The grant is also supporting a program to employ,
train, and promote more women in banks and

In Nepal, ADB is applying innovative technology to the
country’s outdated electricity distribution system. Nepal
makes use of analog meters, which may produce inaccurate
readings and require meter readers to make frequent visits to
remote locations. ADB is supporting the country’s switch to
smart meters, which are more accurate, reliable, and capable
of remote customer metering—enhancing the efficiency of
Nepal’s electricity network.

Displaced mothers care for their young children inside a migrant camp in
Bangladesh. ADB provided emergency assistance to improve basic amenities in
32 camps across Cox’s Bazar.

» Since August 2017, Bangladesh has received more than
700,000 people displaced from Myanmar. This influx has caused
a huge strain on the environment and local economy in the Cox’s
Bazar District of Bangladesh, posing significant challenges in the
supply of food, shelter, health care, sanitation, water, and other
essential services to the 32 camps spread across the district.

Within 2 months of receiving a request for grant assistance from
the Government of Bangladesh in May 2018, ADB approved
$100 million in emergency assistance. Although Bangladesh

is not eligible for grants, ADB made an exception in this

case because of the urgent need for finance to address the
humanitarian crisis.

The grant funding is helping rehabilitate access roads to and
within the camps to connect essential food distribution and
storage centers; provide multipurpose cyclone shelters, mobile
water carriers, and community bathing facilities; and build

small piped-water supply systems, waste management

facilities, and water treatment plants. It is also helping install
solar-powered street lighting and augment electricity substations
and distribution lines for electricity to reach the camps.

 

resources more judiciously, and ensure that key assets
are resilient to climate risks.

In India, ADB committed $169 million to develop water
supply, sewerage, and drainage infrastructure in six cities
in Tamil Nadu; install the country’s first solar-powered
sewage treatment plant; and introduce smart water
management systems to reduce water loss. Around

4 million people will benefit from piped water, sewerage
connections, and improved drainage.

During 2018, ADB worked to better connect rural and
urban areas of South Asia as a means of promoting
rural development and food security. The bank
focused on improving rural roads and logistics centers
to allow more producers, agribusinesses, and consumers
to participate in national, regional, and global markets.
In India, ADB committed $375 million to expand and
modernize irrigation networks in Madhya Pradesh.

The financing will develop 125,000 hectares of new,
water-efficient irrigation networks and improve water
use in more than 400 villages, benefiting over 800,000
residents and allowing farmers to grow high-value crops.
ADB also provided $360 million to construct all-weather
rural roads which benefit rural communities living in
4,600 locations in the states of Assam, Chhattisgarh,
Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. In Nepal,
ADB committed $103 million to upgrade 300 kilometers
of rural roads and improve transport access in
agriculture value chain development zones.

ADB’s work in strengthening governance and
institutional capacity includes a program in India to
train 500 rural road engineers and assist in road safety
audits. In Maldives, ADB committed knowledge support
and technical assistance to conduct analytical research,
strategy planning, and other studies to identify priority
development programs. In Bhutan, ADB’s support to
develop secondary towns includes strengthening of
institutional capacity to operate and maintain municipal
infrastructure assets and develop water tariff guidelines.

Across South Asia, ADB is fostering regional
cooperation and integration by supporting crossborder infrastructure needs. It is working to transform
transport corridors into trade and economic corridors,
which will allow South Asian countries to participate in
regional and global value chains, promote agriculture
trade, and generate regional tourism.

In 2018, ADB committed $150 million to upgrade key
sections of SASEC road corridors in India and Nepal.
These investments will improve connectivity between
India’s Manipur State and Myanmar; build an
India—Nepal international bridge on the border at
Panitanki in India and Kakarvitta in Nepal; and improve
the safety of Nepal’s vital East-West Highway.

To complement these investments, ADB approved a
technical assistance project to improve the expertise of
trade facilitation officials in SASEC countries.

Economic growth across Southeast Asia
moderated in 2018. The rate of growth in 6 of 10
Southeast Asian economies—Brunei Darussalam,
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and
Singapore—was lower in 2018 than in 2017.

In contrast, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and
Viet Nam sustained strong economic expansion,
underpinned by significant export growth and
buoyant domestic demand.

Governments in the region implemented
measures to stabilize the impacts of higher oil
prices, a stronger US dollar, weather disturbances
and natural calamities, and uncertainties in

global trade. Central banks, particularly those

of Indonesia and the Philippines, raised official
interest rates to arrest the weakening of the

rupiah and peso against the US dollar. Indonesia
aggressively tightened rates to ease pressure

on the country’s balance of payments. Higher
government subsidies for fuel kept inflation low in
Malaysia and Indonesia. On the other hand, higher
fuel prices and depreciating local currencies added
to inflationary pressures in the Lao PDR, Myanmar,
and the Philippines. Heavy rains damaged
agricultural production in the Lao PDR and the
Philippines, the latter also affected by rice supply
bottlenecks. Inflationary factors in Viet Nam
included the continued increase in governmentadministered fees for medical services, education,
and transportation.

Investment remained high in Indonesia and

the Philippines, boosted by infrastructure
spending. Public investment in Thailand also
rebounded strongly as the government pursued

an ambitious infrastructure plan. In Malaysia,
however, infrastructure spending moderated,

with the new government deciding to reexamine
several large projects approved by its predecessor.
Private investment remained robust in Viet Nam,
supported by high credit growth and strong foreign
direct investment. Meanwhile, foreign direct
investment declined in Myanmar due to lackluster
progress on economic reform and slow headway in
the national peace process.

STRATEGIC FOCUS

In 2018, ADB’s operational emphasis in Southeast
Asia was on the development of critical infrastructure,
education, disaster relief, and water management.
The bank completed a new country partnership
strategy for the Philippines, with priority support for
the national government’s infrastructure program.
Meanwhile, ADB provided its first sovereign loan to
Thailand after 8 years to help expand the country’s
transport infrastructure. Through various technical
assistance projects and services under its portfolio,
the bank also helped prepare more than 50 other
infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia, in addition to
those it directly financed.

Addressing demand from its developing member
countries (DMCs), ADB introduced regional technical
assistance facilities that focus on particular sectors or
development themes. These regional facilities support
DMCs in project preparation, project implementation,
policy development and coordination, capacity
development, and knowledge work.

During 2018, developing high-quality human resources
and creating jobs were central to ADB’s efforts in
addressing remaining poverty and reducing
inequalities in Southeast Asia.

The bank committed $50 million to help Cambodia
upgrade science and technology classrooms and
school libraries in 36 secondary resource schools. The
project will provide a conducive learning environment
for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics;
and equip youth with the skills they need to thrive in
the digital economy. In Indonesia, ADB committed
$200 million as the first phase of higher education
reform, helping upgrade three public universities in
Sumatra and one public university in Bandung, West
Java. The project will provide university places for
20,000 additional students (half of whom are women)
and train 586 additional staff. Gender considerations
were integrated into these projects to enhance women
and girls’ access to quality education.

Committed to helping the disadvantaged in the
Philippines, ADB provided two loans and two grants
totaling $408 million as emergency assistance for the

barangays (villages) will have their water supply
restored and health clinics reconstructed; around
3,600 youth and adults will have greater economic
opportunity through the scaling up of employment
and livelihood programs; and thousands of children
will receive mental health support and culturally
sensitive peace education.

In 2018, ADB focused on improved water
management and better roads in tackling climate
change, building climate and disaster resilience,
and enhancing environmental sustainability in
the region.

In Cambodia, ADB committed $70 million to
improve 147 kilometers of flood-prone and unsafe

> In August 2018, an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of

Lombok. In September, an earthquake and tsunami struck the
city of Palu in Sulawesi. The disasters killed over 2,600 people,
injured 18,000, and displaced more than 550,000. A One ADB
approach was critical to providing rapid and effective support
to Indonesia.

ADB specialists in energy, water and sanitation, transportation,
and public finance worked together to conduct damage
assessments and provide technical advice to counterparts from
the Government of Indonesia. A team of social development
experts helped ensure that ADB’s support addressed the

needs of women and girls, and incorporated best practices in
disaster preparedness and resilience. Financial management
specialists helped the government explore effective channels
for monitoring, evaluation, and financial reporting.

In November, ADB approved $500 million in emergency
assistance to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts—
less than 5 weeks after the government requested assistance.

Across Lombok and Sulawesi, around 36,000 households are
expected to benefit from climate-resilient housing and access
to improved water and sanitation services; about 5,000 farmers °
will have better access to water for irrigation; and over 650,000
displaced people will benefit from livelihood assistance and

Viet Nam received scholarships to pursue their career of choice.

>» Lo Van Kim, from Viet Nam’s northwestern province of
Dien Bien, dreamed of one day becoming a veterinarian.

His family, however, earned only a small income from raising
livestock and could barely afford regular meals. He had to walk
2 kilometers, over mountains and on an empty stomach, to get
to school each day. By the sixth grade, his family could no longer
afford to keep him in school.

This is just one example of why ADB and Viet Nam partnered
ona $65 million project to improve lower secondary education
in 17 of Viet Nam’s poorest provinces. The project financed the
construction of 820 new classrooms, 61 libraries, 959 boarding
rooms and dormitories, and 467 teacher housing units. A total of
33,190 teachers completed training on the new curriculum, while
225 students—including Lo Van Kim—received scholarships.

With the scholarship, Lo Van Kim was able to buy a bike for his
daily ride to school and pay for his meals and school supplies.
He went on to study veterinary medicine at the Son La College
of Agriculture and Forestry, later returning to his hometown to
become the only veterinarian in his community.

 

The bank committed $60 million for the third phase

of a road project in Cambodia, which will rehabilitate
about 360 kilometers of rural roads in Kampong Cham,
Kratie, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, and Tboung Khmum
provinces. By revitalizing the rural road network, ADB
is helping to provide safer roads and allow year-round
access to markets and other social services for farming
communities that may otherwise be restricted in
earning income and fulfilling basic needs. The project
will be complemented by a regular maintenance regime
and community-based road safety program.

To foster regional cooperation and integration

in Southeast Asia, ADB committed $233 million
(including $62 million in cofinancing) to develop
agribusiness value chains across the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS), boosting rural household incomes
and agricultural competitiveness in Cambodia, the
Lao PDR, and Myanmar. It also committed $99.4 million
for a second phase of highway expansion in the GMS,
designed to strengthen regional connectivity and
cooperation. To further promote regional tourism

and economic connectivity, the bank supported
improvements in sanitation, solid waste management,
drainage, and urban planning along the GMS NorthSouth Economic Corridor, investing $48 million in the
Lao PDR and $80 million in Myanmar.

In 2018 in Southeast Asia, ADB continue to support
strengthening governance and institutional
capacity. It supported public management reforms

and financial sustainability through a mix of modalities,
including policy-based lending and technical assistance.

To improve the general business environment in
Indonesia, ADB contributed to reducing the costs

of doing business through a $500 million program
loan. The financing helped entrench good regulatory
practices, reduce burdensome regulations, consolidate
business licensing and company registration into a
single process, and introduce a new and cost-effective
online land registration system. ADB is working with
the Government of Indonesia to introduce innovative
financing instruments that will attract private sector
participation in infrastructure.

ADB also moved to deepen institutional and regulatory
reforms to promote, develop, and implement publicprivate projects in the Philippines, supporting the
country’s public-private partnership program through
a $300 million loan and technical assistance. The bank
also provided technical assistance to help upgrade

the country’s financial market infrastructure, and is
assisting the Philippine Competition Commission to
enforce newly enacted laws that promote free and fair
competition.

In the Lao PDR, ADB committed $30 million in 2018 to

In most of the world’s economies, the private
sector is the most powerful and dynamic vehicle
for generating growth, creating employment, and
delivering innovative solutions for development.
It has been highlighted as critical to achieving the
goals of ADB’s new Strategy 2030—eradicating
extreme poverty and achieving a prosperous,
inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and

the Pacific.

Reflecting the vital role of the private sector,

ADB has set a target to expand its private sector
operations to one-third of its total operations by
2024. The bank will continue to pursue the dual
mandate of development impact and profitability
in its private sector operations. It plans to expand
and diversify these operations into new and frontier
markets, scale up financing for agribusiness,

and support social sectors such as health and
education. ADB also plans to widen its coverage

in sectors such as transport, water, waste and
sanitation, and information and communication
technology. In terms of product innovation, the
bank plans to devote more resources to equity
operations to enhance its additionality, or added
value, and toward credit enhancements to mobilize
more cofinancing.

ADB continues to help its developing member
countries (DMCs) improve their business
environments, foster competitiveness in the private
sector, and provide pathways for new and existing
businesses to succeed. In 2018, the bank further
scaled up support for public-private partnerships
(PPPs) to help generate private investment in

key development initiatives. It also continued

to directly prepare and finance private sector
infrastructure projects to attract private sector
financing and expertise. To help increase access to
finance—especially for micro, small,

and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in poor
and vulnerable communities—ADB supported
financial intermediaries and pursued opportunities
in new sectors such as agribusiness, manufacturing,
and services (e.g., health).

In 2018, ADB’s private sector investments increased
to $3.14 billion in commitments, compared to

$2.3 billion in 2017 and $1.8 billion in 2016. The
bank also generated a record $7.17 billion in private
sector cofinancing, almost half of which was
long-term cofinancing. In addition, ADB mobilized
$250 million from transaction advisory services.

CONTRIBUTION TO STRATEGY 2030
OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES

Addressing Remaining Poverty and
Reducing Inequalities

n 2018, ADB’s private sector operations continued
to assist DMCs in broadening access to financial
services—such as savings and credit—and health
care. The bank focused 19% of its private sector
operations on inclusive business initiatives that
provide economic opportunities to the poor.

n India, ADB provided $150 million in debt
inancing to Cholamandalam Investment and
Finance Company, a pan-Indian financial institution
that provides finance to MSMEs operating logistics
and distribution services, mostly in lagging or lowincome states. Given the slowdown in credit growth
rom banks in India, ADB assistance is providing
valuable support for the Government of India’s
inancial inclusion agenda.

n Sri Lanka, ADB is providing medium-term

unding to DFCC Bank to improve access to finance
or MSMEs. At least 20% of the borrowing MSMEs
are located outside of Colombo.

ADB further contributes to achieving financial
inclusion through its Microfinance Risk
Participation and Guarantee Program, which
acilitates local currency lending to microfinance
institutions across DMCs. The program expands
access to finance for businesses and people at the
bottom of the commercial pyramid by partnering
with local and international banks to share the risk
of loan defaults. In 2018, it supported new loans
totaling $271 million and cofinancing of $137 million
to over 1.26 million poor borrowers, mostly women.
It also expanded by enlisting two microfinance
institutions in Myanmar and accrediting Hatton

> In November 2018, ADB signed an $80 million loan
agreement with Samruk-Energy, the largest power generation
company in Kazakhstan. A state-owned enterprise wholly owned
by the sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, Samruk-Energy
commands 31% of Kazakhstan’s installed generation capacity.

  

As part of the Government of Kazakhstan’s privatization plan, the
company aims to prepare for an initial public offering by 2020.

   
 
   
   
   
   
   
 
 
 
   
    
 
   
   
   
 
   
       
     
   
   
    

ADB is providing Samruk-Energy with long-tenor tenge
financing that is not sufficiently available in the local market.
The financing supports the company’s business restructuring
and transformation plan aimed at reducing foreign exchange
risks, improving operational efficiency, and identifying renewable
energy opportunities to attract investors for the initial public
offering.

   

The financing arrangement was ADB’s first nonsovereign
transaction with a state-owned enterprise in Kazakhstan, and
an example of the One ADB approach with colleagues from
various ADB departments leveraging their respective areas of
expertise and interacting to achieve a unified result. Staff with a
specialization in engaging with sector stakeholders, promoting
policy dialogue, and providing technical assistance oversaw the
project’s conception and due diligence, while experts in private
sector development were primarily responsible for the financial
structuring of the transaction and commercial due diligence.
Lessons from this successful engagement are expected to guide
collaborative approaches to project preparation in the future.

to address the immediate need for affordable
housing for poor students wishing to attend these
universities, which account for about 30% of all
university students in Azerbaijan.

Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality

Throughout 2018, ADB promoted gender
equality by advancing private sector operations in
the health sector. It also supported the economic
empowerment of women by expanding

their access to finance and entrepreneurial
opportunities.

n Indonesia, the bank invested $19 million

rom its own funds and LEAP in PT Medikaloka
Hermina, which operates 28 hospitals with
2,780 beds across the country. ADB’s equity
investment will help the company expand

its operations to 40 hospitals with around

4,000 beds by 2020. The project, through its
partnership with the Government of Indonesia’s
universal health insurance program, will improve
access to quality, affordable maternity and child
health care as well as general hospital services.

n Cambodia, ADB committed $10 million in
equity to BRED Bank Cambodia to improve
inancial access and services to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It is also
providing technical assistance of up to $500,000
to support special projects in digital finance

and women’s banking, specifically focused on
improving women’s entrepreneurship skills.

n India, ADB provided $30 million in equity

and $20 million in debt security to Annapurna
Finance, one of the country’s largest microfinance
institutions. The investment will help provide
microfinance loans to women customers.

nthe People’s Republic of China (PRC), ADB

is supporting MicroCred China, which is known
or providing unsecured microfinance to MSMEs
in Sichuan Province. The investment aims to
provide microfinance loans to more than 10,000
emale borrowers.

 

Tackling Climate Change, Building
Climate and Disaster Resilience, and
Enhancing Environmental Sustainability

Past and present projects of ADB’s private sector
operations helped DMCs reduce their combined
carbon dioxide emissions by 2.2 million tons

in 2018. In addition to the bank’s clean energy
projects, ADB financed infrastructure projects
and water and agriculture initiatives that will have
significant climate-related benefits.

The bank is supporting a 25-megawatt (MW)
biomass waste-to-energy (WTE) power plant
to be built by Gulf Energy Development in the
south of Thailand, where investment is minimal.
This project will convert 825 tons of agricultural
waste into electricity each day, helping make
other rural communities more aware of the
benefits and sustainability of WTE projects.

In Indonesia, ADB financed the first utility-scale
private sector solar projects in the country,
totaling 42 MW and sponsored by Equis Group,
one of the largest independent infrastructure
private equity fund managers in Asia. The bank
also committed $305 million from its own funds
and LEAP to PT Jawa Satu Power to build,
operate, and maintain a 1,760-MW combinedcycle, gas-fired power plant in West Java.

The assistance will support the development

of one of the first and largest power projects
using liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Indonesia,
highlighting the country’s commitment to
reduce its dependency on coal.

In India, ADB provided a $100 million loan

to Ostro Kutch Wind, a renewable energy
company owned by investment funds under
the management of Actis Capital, for the
construction and operation of a 250-MW

wind power project in Gujarat. The project was
awarded under India’s first wind energy auction,
launched in 2016 by the Ministry of New and
Renewable Energy. This auction reduced the
cost of wind power to be lower than that under
the feed-in tariff regime.

ADB committed a $200 million direct loan

to Minsheng Financial Leasing Company

to procure more electric buses as well as
batteries and charging stations to reduce
traffic congestion and air pollution in the PRC’s
poor central and western regions. The project,
supported by technical assistance financed by
the Global Environment Facility, will strengthen
the capacity of bus companies in operating and
maintaining green vehicles.

Making Cities More Livable

In 2018, ADB private sector operations focused
on providing solutions to help build cities that
are more livable, affordable, and sustainable.
This included projects in geothermal

district heating, wastewater, and solid waste
management.

In Viet Nam, ADB committed $100 million for
China Everbright International to implement
WTE plants in primary and secondary cities
to treat 7,500 tons of municipal solid waste

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018every day. This is the first municipal WTE project
financed entirely by the private sector in Viet Nam
and the first to use advanced clean technologies,
including flue gas emission control, that meet
international standards.

Through a $200 million loan, ADB is helping
China Water Affairs Group develop and operate
integrated urban water management projects

in the PRC. These projects will increase or
improve treatment capacity for over 10 million
cubic meters of water and 1.8 million cubic meters
of wastewater per day, while also constructing at
least 5,000 kilometers of sewage pipelines.

Also in the PRC, ADB is providing a $250 million
loan to support a collaboration by Sinopec Green
Energy Geothermal and Arctic Green Energy to
construct, acquire, rehabilitate, and/or operate
geothermal-based heating systems under a PPP
arrangement with a municipal government. The
systems will serve residential, commercial, and
industrial users, while the project is expected to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 7 million
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent every year.

In the Philippines, ADB assisted the Bases
Conversion and Development Authority in the
evaluation of the master plan for New Clark

City, the country’s first technologically smart,
environmentally sustainable metropolis. The
bank also provided a resilience framework that
highlighted the guidelines the authority should
consider to ensure its vision of a smart, green, and
disaster-resilient city, as well as recommendations
to enhance the city’s financial viability. ADB is
also helping the authority screen and prioritize
the infrastructure packages needed to develop
New Clark City, advising on appropriate water

and wastewater infrastructure. In December, the
authority signed a 30-year joint venture agreement
with the winning consortium, comprised of
established local players and a leading global
provider of sustainable infrastructure.

ADB's Trade Finance Program works with over 200 partner banks to

help enterprises of all sizes import and export across Asia’s most
challenging markets. It is essential that these trade activities ensure social
protection, avoid integrity risks, and, above all, do not involve acts that
ADB prohibits. At the end of 2018, in Singapore and Turkey, ADB for the
first time provided training to approximately 160 representatives from
the program’s participating banks on environmental, social, and integrity

Promoting Rural Development
and Food Security

ADB continues to promote rural development
and food security through its private sector
agribusiness operations, which support climatesmart agriculture as well as food processors

and distributors that embrace environmentally
responsible practices.

In the PRC, ADB is supporting Kingenta Ecological
Engineering Group, the largest fertilizer producer in
the country, with a $50 million loan and $30 million
in equity to establish 300 crop production service
centers and upgrade 10 associated fertilizer
manufacturing plants. The centers will provide
high-efficiency fertilizers and other agricultural
products and services to around 3 million
smallholder farmers in 8 provinces, including

6 poor and/or remote inland provinces. The use of
these fertilizers is expected to help lower overall
fertilizer consumption because of more efficient
nutrient use.

In Armenia, ADB is helping Spayka—a leading
food processor, exporter, and logistics company—
develop 30 hectares of climate-controlled
greenhouses equipped with drip irrigation systems
to produce tomatoes and bell peppers for export.

At the regional level, ADB is supporting Olam
International, a global leader in agribusiness,

to promote value chains with higher local value
addition across a variety of products. This

includes financing midstream processing plants
and working capital requirements in Indonesia
(coffee and cocoa), Papua New Guinea (coffee
and cocoa), Timor-Leste (coffee), and Viet Nam
(coffee, cashews, and peppers). The project will
also train approximately 13,000 smallholder farmers
in strategies to deal with temperature increases
and precipitation change, water harvesting and drip
irrigation, integrated pest management, resources
conservation, use of agricultural chemicals and

Strengthening Governance and
Institutional Capacity

Through lending and technical assistance
operations in 2018, ADB helped strengthen
the institutional capacity of DMCs to improve
the business environment for private sector

development, attract investment, and foster PPPs.

In Pakistan, a country programming and

PPP seminar was conducted to enhance

the understanding of PPPs among various
stakeholders and reinforce ADB’s strong role in
building the business case for such partnerships.

ADB committed new investments in urban
infrastructure and municipal management in
several South Asian countries to improve the
environment for private businesses. In India,

the bank committed the third tranche of a
financial intermediation loan to create a suitable
environment for PPP projects in roads and
renewable energy.

In Indonesia, ADB helped reduce the costs of
doing business through a program loan aimed at
consolidating regulations, combining business
licensing and company registration into a

single process, and introducing an online land
registration system. The bank further supported
the PPP program in the Philippines through a
program loan and technical assistance.

In the Pacific, ADB—through its Private Sector
Development Initiative, which is supported

by the governments of Australia and New
Zealand—encouraged policy and legislative
reforms that help expand access to loans and
significantly reduce the time and cost of starting
a business.

Fostering Regional Cooperation and
Integration

Through its Trade Finance Program (TFP),

ADB helps close market gaps for trade finance—
estimated in 2017 to be $1.5 trillion globally—

by providing banks with guarantees and loans in
support of cross-border trade finance. For 2018,
the program facilitated 4,476 transactions valued
at $6.2 billion, with $3.74 billion cofinanced by
banks, private insurers, and official agencies.

Of the total transactions, 3,476 supported SMEs

and 1,167 supported trade between DMCs. Among
the 21 countries covered by the TFP, the most
active were Armenia, Bangladesh, Mongolia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. In 2018, ADB
increased the program limit by $350 million to
$1.35 billion to support the growth in demand for
the program’s offering.

In 2018, ADB continued to implement its Supply
Chain Finance Program.

The program complements the TFP by assuming
corporate risk and developing both domestic

and cross-border trade. For 2018, the program
supported 530 transactions valued at $217 million,
with $109 million, or 50%, cofinanced by partner
financial institutions. Of the 530 transactions, 395
supported SMEs.

In 2018, ADB increased the program limit by

$100 million to $300 million to help reduce SME
financing gaps and continue the bank’s support for
SME growth in DMCs.

OTHER APPROACHES TO
DEVELOPING THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Preparing Bankable Private Sector Projects

In October 2018, ADB approved a $3 million
regional technical assistance project to set up the
ADB Ventures Facility, a multidonor trust fund

for the identification, deployment, and scaling up
of technologies and business solutions that
contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals
in Asia and the Pacific. The technical assistance
will provide capacity building and funding to local
startups that are taking products to market as well
as to technology companies attempting to expand
into new markets.

The project preparation support that ADB has
been providing for the Rantau Dedap power
project in Indonesia came to fruition in 2018.

In 2014, the bank provided a concessional loan
from the Clean Technology Fund to PT Supreme
Energy Rantau Dedap to explore geothermal
resources, which would determine the viability and
scope of this project. After successful exploration,
the company proceeded to the implementation
phase of the project and, in 2018, ADB committed
a loan of $175 million as well as a concessional loan
of $50 million from the Clean Technology Fund.

The bank is playing a pivotal role in building a
critical mass of renewable energy projects in
Indonesia to stimulate investor interest in future
opportunities.

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018FANNING THE WINDS OF CHANGE
IN PAKISTAN

> In 2009, ADB provided a long-term, US dollardenominated loan to Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim to finance
the construction of a $147 million 56.4-megawatt (MW)
wind farm—Pakistan’s first wind power project.

ADB’s commitment and structuring of financing provided the
impetus for investment in Pakistan’s renewable energy sector,
with six wind projects totaling 310 MW developed from 2009
to 2014.

The original project produces 155 gigawatt-hours of
competitively priced electricity every year and contributes to
annual greenhouse gas emission savings of 102,525 tons of
carbon dioxide.

The project’s success resulted in a follow-up project with
Zorlu Enerji for the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of a 100-MW solar power plant and associated
infrastructure.

Such projects are helping to improve access to clean power
supply and alleviate Pakistan’s severe power shortage, which
hampers the country’s economic growth and efforts to reduce
poverty. The projects are also promoting further private sector
investment in renewable energy.

Engineers inspect a wind-power generation plant in Pakistan. Investment
in Pakistan’s renewable energy sector is helping to improve access to a
clean power supply and reduce power shortages.

 

Strengthening the Finance Sector and
Capital Markets

Using Private Equity Funds
to Extend Reach

In 2018, ADB subscribed $155 million in corporate
bonds issued by B.Grimm Power to support the
refinancing and construction of 16 utility-scale
solar power plants in Thailand, providing a total of
98.5 MW.

The bank facilitated the issuance of bonds

as the first green bonds issue by an energy
company in Thailand, in compliance with the
International Capital Market Association’s Green
Bond Principles, and as the first climate bonds

in Thailand to be certified by the Climate Bonds
Initiative. Based on this experience, ADB hopes to
replicate the issuance of internationally certified
green bonds in Thailand and other countries under
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to
mobilize new commercial investors into renewable
energy projects.

Given their ability to leverage and mobilize

large amounts of capital, private equity funds

are an important market for ADB assistance.

In 2018, the bank invested $25 million in Exacta
Asia Investment II, a private equity fund with a
target capitalization of $250 million managed by
Exacta Capital Partners. The fund will support
established and well-managed SMEs and middlemarket companies in Southeast Asia to realize
their growth plans and thereby drive employment,
generate tax, encourage skills transfer, and
promote regional trade. The fund will focus on
operations driven by domestic consumption
(food, beverages, health care, and business
services) and export-oriented manufacturing
companies. Through its investment, ADB will
help support the development of capital markets
in Southeast Asian countries where lower- and
middle-market companies often struggle to find
targeted growth equity.

In July, ADB completed its first transaction
advisory service mandate with the signing of

the agreement between the Philippines’ Bases
Conversion and Development Authority and the
private sector concessionaire for the development
of anew national government administrative
center at New Clark City. The second mandate
for the development of the city’s water supply

and wastewater treatment facilities was
completed in December.

ADB completed its third advisory mandate

for 2018, also finalized in December, with

the awarding and signing of the concession
agreement by Bangladesh’s PPP Authority for
the development of the Dhaka Bypass Road.
The advisory mandate was supported by the
Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility (AP3F)
through the provision of legal support for the
project and capacity-building assistance to the
PPP Authority and the Roads and Highways
Department of Bangladesh. The signing marked
the first successful collaboration between ADB’s
transaction advisory services and the AP3F.

ADB also successfully secured seven new
transaction advisory mandates in Bangladesh,
Myanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines during
2018. In addition to delivering much-needed
transport, energy, and urban infrastructure, these
mandates are expected to strengthen the capacity
of involved agencies and create a template for
future PPPs in individual countries and sectors. In
the Philippines, ADB is working on three mandates
in the natural gas, power, and water sectors.

The bank is advising and assisting Philippine
National Oil in setting up the first LNG hub in the
country. ADB has started advising private sector
infrastructure developers in other countries,
including an LNG terminal in Bangladesh, an LNG
terminal and gas-fired power station in Myanmar,
and a hydropower project in Pakistan.

The AP3F provides technical assistance for
project preparation and structuring, capacity
development and policy reform, and project
monitoring and restructuring support to
governments of DMCs.

In 2018, the facility approved seven applications
for technical assistance totaling $4.7 million.

Of these approved applications, project-definition
assistance (prefeasibility studies for specific
projects) will be provided in Kazakhstan, the
Kyrgyz Republic, and Indonesia, while capacitybuilding assistance will be provided in the

Cook Islands, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.

AP3F-supported technical assistance for Samoa
(tariff-setting for the regulator) and Timor-Leste
(support for the Tibar Bay Port PPP) were also
completed during the year.

CATALYZING AND MOBILIZING
FINANCE

To meet the extensive development needs of

Asia and the Pacific, ADB mobilizes long- and
short-term cofinancing, including from transaction
advisory services.

In 2018, ADB mobilized about $7.7 billion in

long- and short-term cofinancing for private
sector operations. This included B-loans valued at
$135 million (B-loans are co-financing arrangements
for a single borrower or grant recipient that are
funded by commercial banks and other eligible
financial institutions with ADB acting as the lender
of record), parallel cofinancing of $2.55 billion,
trade finance and supply chain cofinancing totaling
$3.85 billion, guarantee cofinancing of $137 million,
and risk transfers of $135 million. Nonsovereign
official cofinancing totalled $356 million. In
addition, ADB mobilized $250 million through
transaction advisory services.

ADB marked four major cofinancing achievements
in 2018.

n Myanmar, the bank issued its first B loan—
$35 million for Meeyatha Development, which
supplies residential and office space in Yangon.

n Viet Nam, a first-ever B loan was also issued—
$100 million for the Bank for Investment and

OPERATIONALIZING STRATEGY 2030
AND MONITORING RESULTS

ADB is mobilizing all staff across departments to
operationalize Strategy 2030. Teams with members
drawn from ADB’s 15 sector and thematic groups
are developing operational plans for priority areas
set out under the strategy. These plans, to be
finalized in 2019, will define the strategic focus,
specific areas of engagement, approaches, and
broad skills required under each priority.

Country partnership strategies (CPSs) have been
aligned with Strategy 2030, while ADB’s Work
Program and Budget Framework, 2019-2021,
approved in September, reflects operational
resources and priorities in line with the strategy.

 

ADB held consultations throughout 2018 to
develop a new corporate results framework
covering 2019-2024. The results framework will use
results indicators, baselines, and targets to track the
bank’s performance in achieving the priorities of
Strategy 2030.

ENHANCING SERVICE TO ADB
MEMBERS

Modernizing Business Processes and
Improving Operational Efficiency

In 2018, ADB continued implementing initiatives
to improve operational efficiency and business
processes. The bank (i) advanced its digital
transformation through the Real-Time ADB
information technology (IT) reforms and approved
an IT capital investment plan for the next 5 years;
(ii) prepared guidance notes and provided training
to ADB staff and government agencies on a new
procurement framework; and (iii) approved the
Access to Information Policy, increasing public
access to ADB’s historical information.

To respond more quickly to the needs of
developing member countries (DMCs) and
deliver innovative solutions, ADB continued to
delegate more responsibilities to its field offices.

Regional departments further improved operational
processing and delivery times by taking measures to
increase the design and procurement readiness of
infrastructure projects.

ADB also revised operations manuals and staff
instructions for several lending modalities and
technical assistance; updated staff guidance on
results-based lending (RBL); enhanced qualityreview processes for loan documents, CPSs, and
country operations business plans (COBPs); and
updated templates for CPSs, COBPs, and project
proposals, aligning them with Strategy 2030.

Maintaining a Strong Country Presence

In 2018, to increase the capacity of the bank’s
field offices, ADB assigned over 900 staff, which
represents 59% of staff in regional departments,
to roles within DMCs. Country presence was
reinforced by establishing 11 field offices in Pacific
countries classified as small island developing
states, allocating more positions to field offices,
and outposting staff from ADB headquarters.
ADB also adopted flexible staffing measures to
ensure that departments can address emerging
business and country needs with the right mix of
job roles and skills.

The bank supports the increase in staff at field
offices through a combination of improved onthe-job training and targeted learning activities. It
focuses on developing the skills of field office staff
in project design, implementation, and evaluation.
In 2018, over 150 staff traveled to ADB headquarters
for learning events. Of the 105 training programs
available in 2018, 87% of field office staff undertook
at least one.

Improving ADB Products and Instruments

ADB enhanced its products and modalities to meet
the evolving needs and demands of its DMCs more
effectively. In July, the bank introduced project
readiness financing; a small expenditure financing
facility; policy-based guarantees, including for
Group A countries (concessional assistance only);
and a public-private partnership standby financing

facility. These are designed to make ADB more agile
and responsive, strengthen the bank’s ability to
catalyze finance, and expand its support for publicprivate partnerships. ADB’s regional departments
are now using these new modalities to process and
develop projects.

n April, ADB increased the resource allocation
ceiling for its RBL programs to 10% of the total
allocations for ordinary capital resources and the
Asian Development Fund. The increase applies to
the final 3 years of the RBL pilot phase (2016-2019).
RBL strengthens motivation and accountability
within development projects by linking financial
disbursements to the achievement of results.

ADB is completing the required preparatory

work to mainstream RBL programs, as the pilot
phase ends in June 2019. It is also formalizing
contingent disaster-financing options under policybased lending to improve countries’ resilience

to disasters.

n November, ADB approved an increase in the
base allocation for its concessional assistance,
rom $6 million per year to $13 million per year
during 2019 and 2020. This benefits poorer DMCs,
particularly eligible small island developing states,
whose access to concessional resources will
increase by more than 50% over the 2-year period.

 

ADB has intensified its training and outreach
program to enhance knowledge and skills on its
lending modalities. In 2018, the bank conducted
37 learning sessions covering 922 ADB staff and
external stakeholders. It also improved its learning
materials such as guidance notes, quick guides,
and documents responding to frequently asked
questions. To further strengthen the effectiveness
of its training and outreach, ADB is working ona
demand-driven staff development curriculum.

Achieving Timely and Value-for-Money
Procurement

The implementation of the ADB Procurement
Policy in 2017 addressed the evolving needs

of DMCs and other stakeholders in terms

of increasing lending operations, improving
procurement delivery systems, and harmonizing
with other multilateral development banks.

By providing a principles-based approach to
procurement, the new policy delivers solutions
to enhance value for money and quality, as well
as reduce time to deliver procurement outcomes
through effective risk assessment and contract
management.

The new procurement framework—covering
the policy, regulations, and guidance notes as

well as supporting standard bidding documents,
user guides, and staff instructions—will deliver
improved outcomes for ADB and its DMCs. The
framework is expected to encourage more quality
suppliers to bid for projects, lower transaction
costs, and improve relationships between ADB
clients and their suppliers.

Strengthening and Use of Country
Safeguards

In 2018, all ADB projects were assessed for
environmental and social impacts, as required

by the bank’s Safeguards Policy Statement. ADB
delivered a safeguards training program that
covered general orientation and specialist training
in air quality, noise, vibration and water impacts,
and involuntary resettlement and associated
livelihood restoration. The bank facilitated regional
knowledge sharing through the Joint Safeguards
Community of Practice, with representatives of
multilateral financial institutions and bilateral
partners. At the country level, ADB is providing
ongoing support to develop country safeguard
systems for the governments of India, Indonesia,
and Sri Lanka, which have requested the use of
country safeguards in ADB-supported operations.

Addressing the Concerns of People
Affected by ADB Projects

The ADB Accountability Mechanism is an

independent forum for people adversely affected
by ADB-assisted projects to voice complaints and
seek solutions to their problems. The mechanism
is designed to contribute to ADB’s development
effectiveness and improve project quality.

The Compliance Review Panel (CRP) handles
operational policy compliance, while the Office
of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF) handles
problem solving.

In 2018, OSPF received 11 complaints. The office
found four eligible for the problem-solving process,
while others were referred to relevant operational
departments for action. The details and status of
each complaint are available on ADB’s website.

The CRP submitted to the ADB Board of Directors
an eligibility report on a hydropower project in
Georgia. It also monitored the implementation of
remedial actions for a transport project in Georgia,
power projects in India and the Philippines, and

a rail project in Cambodia. The CRP assessed
complaints received on a road connectivity
program in India (eventually withdrawn by the
complainants), while two complaints on an urban
transport program in Georgia did not warrant a
compliance review.

OSPF conducted 10 training programs on grievance
redress mechanisms and problem-solving tools

in Armenia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the
Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

The CRP held workshops in Cambodia, Canada,
India, Mongolia, Nepal, the People’s Republic of
China, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and the
United States. It also produced four guidebooks on
compliance review.

In 2018, ADB also approved technical assistance

to respond to demand from DMCs for capacity
building on grievance redress and dispute resolution
during project implementation.

STRENGTHENING ADB AS AN
INSTITUTION

Strengthening Disclosure and Transparency

In 2018, 4,755 documents and reports—including
project documents, flagship studies, specialized
reports, working papers, and other publications—
were uploaded on ADB’s website. The bank received
4,043 official requests for documents, and 71% of
requests received responses within 20 days.

ADB's new Access to Information Policy, approved

in September, replaces the Public Communications
Policy and is a result of extensive consultations
with stakeholders. It retains the key information
disclosure and sharing principles and exceptions of
the previous policy, and includes a new overarching
principle of clear, timely, and appropriate disclosure
that is underpinned by a presumption in favor of
disclosure and a commitment to sharing information
and ideas. ADB has expanded some areas of
disclosure. For example, the types of information
that will be made available after 20 years will now
include historical country financial information

and certain external audit reports on ADBadministered trust funds. ADB ranked first among
45 leading development organizations in the 2018
Aid Transparency Index, achieving a score of 98.6%.
The index is an independent measurement of aid
transparency by the nongovernment organization

Legal Services

The Office of the General Counsel (OGC)
provides advice and assistance to the ADB Board
of Directors, President, management, and staff on
legal matters, compliance, and policy relating to the
operations, finance, and administration of ADB.

In 2018, OGC contributed to the development of key
policies and guidelines such as the policy on New
Products and Modalities, the Access to Information

sovereign, nonsovereign, and transaction advisory
projects, and the implementation of ADB’s

borrowing program in 2018. In 2018, IED contributed to the strategic and operational directions

of ADB by evaluating the bank’s engagement with state-owned
enterprises; conducting a sector-wide evaluation on agriculture, natural
resources, and rural development; and reviewing the performance,
results, and design issues of policy-based lending.

Anticorruption and Integrity

ADB’s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI)
helps ensure that all ADB funds are utilized for
their intended purposes. It conducts investigations;
integrity due diligence; procurement-related
reviews; and outreach activities such as training,
workshops, e-bulletins, and online courses.

IED evaluated ADB’s support for small and medium-sized enterprises,
focusing on the business environment, access to finance, value chains,
and women in business. IED also conducted an impact evaluation of a
water supply services project in Nepal and reviewed the outcomes of

ADB's urban sanitation projects.
In 2018, 96 entities were debarred for violating

ADB's Anticorruption Policy. The enforcement of
the policy acts as a deterrent to others.

 

Over the year, IED also provided validations
of country partnership strategy final reviews
for the Kyrgyz Republic, Solomon Islands,

and Uzbekistan. The findings fed into the
preparation and design of country partnership
strategies and operational plans. In February,

Development Initiative in the Pacific helped

The OAI conducted six reviews related to project
procurement, which mitigated fraud and corruption
risks in ADB projects through enhanced controls
and transparency.

The Respectful Workplace Unit, which is housed

in the OAI, began operations in 2017 to promote
professional and respectful behavior in ADB’s
various working environments. In 2018, the unit

conducted a variety of advisory, policymaking, and

awareness-raising activities.

ADB also introduced a pilot program to ensure that
internal controls are in place to identify and address

any potential integrity or reputational risks in the
recruitment of consultants.

During 2018, the OAI conducted 117 training
and learning events for over 4,398 participants
comprising ADB staff and other stakeholders.

These events covered integrity risks, anticorruption,

and respect-at-work awareness. They were
complemented with the launching of e-learning
courses on anticorruption and respect at work,
which were completed by over 98% of ADB staff.

In April, the OAI launched an anticorruption video

explainer to highlight the effect of corruption
and other integrity violations on projects. It also

published Asset Inspection for Project Integrity, which

serves as a reference guide for executing and/or
implementing agencies.

September, IED worked with the Asia- operations:

Pacific Finance and Development Institute

to organize the third Asian Evaluation Week. Considered the premier
evaluation forum in Asia, the 2018 event discussed the increasing

role of evaluation in shaping public policy to promote accountability
and learning perspectives. In March and November, IED hosted the
biannual meetings of the Evaluation Cooperation Group—composed of
independent evaluators from multilateral development banks—

to promote consistency in the practice of evaluation.

The ADB Board of Directors, to which IED reports, released the results
of an external review of the department. While identifying that IED
evaluation is on par with, or superior to that of peer organizations, the
evaluation also pointed to areas for improvement, including an updated
evaluation policy, a results framework for IED, improved quality and
usability of evaluation reports, and improved staff evaluation skills.

green bond. The bank also issued its first euro
benchmark in the New Safekeeping Structure
ormat, which allows for the bonds to be
repo-eligible with the European Central Bank.

n preparation for the move to alternative
benchmarks, ADB issued its first-ever Sterling
Overnight Index Average-linked bond in the
pound sterling market, which was also its largestever outing in sterling to date. In local currency
bond markets, ADB issued its first Armenian draminked bond, with the proceeds repatriated and
invested onshore.

 

n 2018, ADB completed its largest annual local
currency financing volume, registering about
$630 million over five different currencies
(Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Kazakhstan
tenge, Malaysian ringgit, and Thai baht).

Audit

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) offers
independent audit and advisory services to
determine whether internal controls for managing
risks and achieving ADB’s development objectives
are operating effectively and efficiently.

In 2018, the OAG issued 16 audit reports covering
operations, administration and operations support,
finance and risk, and IT. It also completed eight
advisory engagements on governance, risk,

and controls.

In November, the OAG hosted the 2-day
conference iaTech 2018 to promote the use of
digital technology in internal audits in the public
sector. The conference saw members of the online
community known as AuditWithoutWalls!—
initiated by the OAG in April 2017—come together
for the first time. The conference was attended by
over 200 members from 29 countries, who were
joined by digital solution providers and internal
auditing students from Far Eastern University in
Manila. The conference highlighted the need for
auditors to develop skills in data analytics, machine
learning, and robotics; and to help one another
keep pace with advances in digital technology by
proactively sharing knowledge.

During the year, the OAG leveraged artificial
intelligence technology to validate its country risk
audit model to determine which country portfolios
to audit. The model uses machine-learning
technology to automatically group country offices
based on several risk indicators.

Risk Management

ADB maintains a corporate culture that is acutely
risk aware. It implements business processes that
allow departments and offices to monitor, mitigate,
and manage specific risks associated with their
operations.

ADB continues to devote substantial resources

to managing its credit, market, and operational
risks. In 2018, the credit risk management function
was reorganized by industry sector. This sectoral
specialization of risk professionals will provide
stronger support to ADB’s nonsovereign operations,
which are expanding in line with Strategy 2030.
ADB also continued to provide technical assistance
to regional financial institutions to expand their
knowledge and capabilities in risk management.

Administrative Expenses

ADB continues to rationalize internal administrative
spending and to improve cost efficiency. Among
major contributors to cost efficiency are continuing
efforts with IT reforms, operations efficiency
improvements, and measures to strengthen

budget management and to improve resource
use efficiency in ADB’s administrative services.
Furthermore, ADB continued with human resources
reforms, including flexible position management,
which also contributed to overall budget efficiency.

Actual net internal administrative expenses in 2018
totaled $636 million, a budget utilization rate of
94.6%.

Modernizing ADB Information Technology
Systems, Strengthening Data Management
and Moving Forward with the Digital
Agenda

In 2018, ADB continued to modernize its IT systems
and infrastructure. New device standards were
introduced with a shift from staff using desktops

in the workplace to notebooks, hybrid computers,
and smart devices. Voice, video, and cloud-based
telephony were also made available, enabling greater
collaboration, and flexible work arrangements.
SharePoint, a web-based collaborative platform,
was rolled-out in headquarters and field offices

to improve the exchange of information. To aid
treasury operations, new post-trade processing and
pricing solutions were implemented to improve
ability to manage complex structured financial
products. An online technical assistance claims
processing system was introduced to reduce
manual accounting processing. Two new human
resources management systems, to better manage
staff information and improve human resources
inquiries, were implemented. IT security was
further strengthened through online training and

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018the introduction of additional investigative and
protective controls. More than 1,500 IT system
enhancements and upgrades were implemented to
support ADB’s corporate reforms.

To complement the advances in IT infrastructure
and systems, ADB also moved to improve the
quality, timeliness, and consistency of its data. In
2018, the Data Management Subcommittee, under
the IT and Data Committee, initiated efforts to
introduce data governance.

ADB’s digital transformation will advance further
in coming years. In October, ADB approved the
Digital Agenda 2030, Stage 1, with an IT capital
investment of $118.3 million for 2019-2023.
Investment priorities include further optimizing
operations, financial, administrative and corporate
services; establishing the digital workplace; and

improving data governance and delivery, including
real-time access to data.

Enhancing Human Resources

Human Resource Management

In 2018, ADB posted 639 job vacancies, which
generated 45,554 applications from nationals

of ADB’s 67 member countries, highlighting

a strong demand to work at ADB. The bank’s
secondment program hosted 16 secondees and its
internship program hosted 35 graduate students.
Through proactive, strengthened, and streamlined
recruitment processes, ADB recruited 370 new
staff in 2018, including 22 young professionals—the
largest intake ever. Four online recruitment events,
including two events that targeted qualified women
professionals and attracted 445 participants, were
carried out. The use of social media for talent
sourcing also continued.

ADB continued to implement actions and

targets to improve gender balance and inclusion

in its various workplaces, with an emphasis on
recruiting women and retaining women already on
staff. Women now account for 36% of the bank’s
international staff, putting ADB on track to meet its
target of 40% by the end of 2022.

The Experts Pool program was scaled up to bridge
skills gaps in ADB’s priority areas to support the
implementation of Strategy 2030. Under the
program, experts from leading organizations in the
public or private sector join ADB on a 2- to 3-year,
fixed-term basis to help design and implement
projects, and strengthen the bank’s expert
knowledge.

ADB provides measures to support the career
development of all staff. Under its staff mobility
framework, the bank provides a rotation program
and a short-term assignment program so staff

(ADBI) is the think tank of ADB, providing

intellectual insights and support for
policymakers in the bank’s developing
member countries. It does so by conducting
research on medium- to long-term
development issues and providing capacity building and training to
help improve agencies and organizations engaged in development
work within ADB’s developing member countries.

Dye

Administration, Management, and Coordination

ADBI continued to strengthen and diversify its financial sources

by securing contributions from Indonesia, the People’s Republic of
China, and the Republic of Korea. The institute also continues to
receive support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the
nstitute of Transportation Economics in Japan. In December, ADBI
took a lead role in organizing the collaboration of Think2o think tanks
in G20 countries, as part of the lead-up to the G20 Summit to be
hosted by Japan in late June 2019.

Research

n 2018, ADBI’s research department
broadened its knowledge partnership base,
hosted conferences and events to reach out
to policymakers and other stakeholders, and
reduced the costs of implementing projects. It
continued to produce high quality knowledge
products that support the adoption of
innovative policy solutions in ADB developing
member countries. The department
published 12 open access books, more than
110 working papers, 52 blogs, and 17 journal
articles. It also organized 49 research
conferences and dissemination events for
policymakers and other stakeholders. Areas
of focus included Asian productivity drivers,
green finance, financial inclusion and financial
iteracy, services-led development, and human capital for inclusive
growth.

With institutional knowledge key to the success

of Strategy 2030, ADB invests in staff training and
development and fosters a culture of continuous
learning, accountability, innovation, and leadership.

In 2018, ADB delivered 129 different learning and
development programs, which benefited 7,725
participants (5,567 from ADB headquarters in
Manila and 2,158 from field offices).

Across the year, approximately 100 leaders within

ADB completed leadership development programs.

The bank also launched a new flagship program to
develop the capacity of supervisors and other staff
to have more effective performance conversations
through feedback and coaching. Over 550 staff
participated in this program. Since 2016, over

850 managers and staff have undertaken training
to raise awareness about unconscious bias at work
and provide practical tools to mitigate bias and
support objective decision-making.

Through collaboration with various ADB

offices and departments, the bank offered

37 e-learning courses in 2018, with about 10,929
participants coming from academia, governments,
nongovernment organizations, the private sector,
and international organizations.

Recognizing an increase in ADB’s private sector
operations under Strategy 2030, the bank
invested in building private sector finance skills
through training in equity investments, corporate
credit, financial modeling, and corporate board
governance.

Conflict Management

The Office of the Ombudsperson (OOMP)
provides the ADB community with a confidential,
neutral, and informal resource to help manage
conflicts in the workplace.

In 2018, the OOMP presented to 16 management
teams, 42 business units within ADB headquarters,

and 10 field offices to raise awareness of the
office’s work and share trends and patterns of
workplace concerns. The OOMP initiated a forum
for the ADB community to discuss challenges and
enhancements to the bank’s organizational culture.
The ombudsperson informed ADB management
of systemic issues and provided suggestions for
resolution. These activities resulted in a significant
increase in the number of people who sought

help and raised concerns. Several business units
and field offices also asked the OOMP to share
knowledge related to conflict management.

Delivering Effective Administrative
Services

ADB continued a process of building
organizational resilience throughout 2018.

To mitigate the risks presented by having

key resources—people, processes, and |T—
concentrated at ADB headquarters in Manila,

the bank continues to progressively decentralize
key critical processes. In 2018, it launched a
treasury regional hub, established a secondary
disbursement processing center, outposted

IT staff to field offices, secured an alternate
workplace recovery site, and expanded business
continuity coverage to operational departments.
In March, ADB enhanced its disaster recovery by
establishing an offshore data center in Geneva for
online replication of financial data. ADB furthered
strengthened safety and security at its Manila
headquarters and for staff in the field by upgrading
and expanding the Security Operations Center

in 2018.

With Strategy 2030 stressing that stronger field
offices are essential to ADB’s success in delivering
integrated public and private sector solutions, the
bank created a Resident Mission Support Unit
within the Office of Administrative Services.

The unit offers enhanced support to field offices
by providing expert advice for the establishment,
relocation, expansion, and safety and security of
field offices.

In September, ADB completed the second phase
of implementing its institutional procurement
system, e-Procurement. Since its launch in July
2017, the system has reduced by 96% the average
processing time from date of requisitioning to
approval of purchase order. Staff productivity has
also increased through automated workflows and
use of catalogs for repeat purchases. The system
has enhanced sourcing, improved compliance and
governance, and increased transparency through
auditable procurement processes. The final
implementation phase will roll out to field offices
in 2019.

 

ADB ANNUAL REPORT 2018FORGING PARTNERSHIPS
Partnering for Development

Strategy 2030 envisions stronger partnerships with
a range of institutions. In 2018, ADB undertook
multiple initiatives to support this vision, starting
with a more rigorous definition of cofinancing that
narrows the counting of cofinancing initiatives to
only those that contribute to achieving outcomes
in ADB projects and programs. The bank also
adopted a more tailored approach for engaging
with development partners. One example is the
harnessing of contributions from various ADB
units to pitch to the Government of Canada six
targeted opportunities aligned with its Feminist
International Assistance Policy.

To ensure early engagement with partners, the
Office of Cofinancing Operations worked closely
with ADB regional departments during the
development of CPSs and COBPs for Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan. To
improve trust fund operations and accountability,
the office undertook initiatives such as automating
application processes, providing IT support

to increase donor information access, and
strengthening outreach activities to attract new
financing. The Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust
Fund immediately benefited from these initiatives.

Strengthening Collaboration with Civil
Society Organizations

In 2018, ADB continued to strengthen its
relationship with civil society organizations (CSOs)
and encourage their input into ADB projects.

The bank delivered knowledge products and
services for CSOs and government agencies,
showcased how CSOs can contribute to improving
the quality of ADB operations, and sought CSO
knowledge and perspectives on ADB operations.

In May, ADB conducted a consultation workshop
on Strategy 2030, attracting more than

130 representatives of CSOs from DMCs. In
September, the ADB Institute and the bank’s
Sustainable Development and Climate Change
Department delivered a forum on engaging CSOs
to advance the Sustainable Development Goals.
In Mongolia, ADB engaged two CSOs, the Ger
Community Mapping Center and the Universal
Progress-Tugeemel Hugjil (a nongovernment
organization run by people with disabilities), to
conduct an assessment to identify the latent needs
and concerns of transport users in ger areas (tent
communities) of Ulaanbaatar.

plasa [plaesa] - a Filipino public space used
for ideas exchange and open discourse.

 

More than 200 representatives from civil society attended ADB’s Annual Meeting in Manila in May. The meeting emphasized the
increased opportunity for civil society to play active roles in the design, implementation, and monitoring of ADB projects.

A New Strategy for ADB

Strategy 2030 sets the course for ADB to respond to the changing needs of the region and sustain efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

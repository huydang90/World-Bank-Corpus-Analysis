he year 2001 was for me particularly moving.
Together with the rest of the world, I shared the
pain of nations rocked by disasters, natural and
otherwise. Throughout the year, I met so many
people who cope with life in the most difficult
circumstances. I recall in particular the
wonderment of a young street child as she
celebrated a birthday, an event never before
acknowledged.

That which moved me also inspired me. |
took the opportunity to learn more from our
developing member countries (DMCs). | visited
several, some for the first time. I met with
governments to form partnerships for reducing
poverty. I visited project sites. | saw bridges that
strengthened economic cooperation among
neighboring countries. I listened to the voices of
the poor.

1 saw poverty.

But I also saw hope.

1 saw nations working together, new
alliances being formed, old friendships drawing
new strength from a common goal.

My travels reconfirmed my belief in what we
at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are doing.
The Poverty Reduction Strategy we adopted in
1999 brought us closer to realizing the goal of a
region free of poverty. The Long-Term Strategic
Framework (LTSF), adopted in 2001, provides the
fundamental operating principles to shape the
future. Our Social Protection Strategy will help
vulnerable populations throughout the region to
better manage risks and develop their capital. Our
community empowerment projects and natural
resources management projects will benefit
indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities, groups
that often bear the greatest burden of poverty.
The private sector supports growth and catalyzes
investment—necessary to support our poverty
reduction efforts. Governance initiatives and

09/04/02, 1:35 PMassistance to DMCs in implementing policy, legislative,
and administrative reforms are creating the environment
necessary to sustain growth. Our new water policy that
calls for conservation and awareness campaigns will
lead to better regional management of this precious
shared resource. The Pacific Strategy will help the island
economies realize the benefits of economies of scale
and encourage private sector investment as a way to
address poverty.

My travels also validated the importance of
partnerships—the strength we all gain by working
together. In times of crisis, partnerships are especially
important. ADB acted swiftly to help the people of
Gujarat following a devastating earthquake. After
witnessing the events of 11 September, we joined the
partnership of nations and individuals in dealing with
this tragedy. Videoconferencing with our development
partners closed the physical distance between us.
Partnerships are helping the people of Afghanistan face
the future with hope. Agreements we reached with
governments and other development institutions are
strengthening the region’s legal systems, improving
governance, saving fragile ecosystems, and helping
nourish a mother and her child.

We need not travel long distances to see the
benefits of partnerships. When we invited 500 Filipino
street children and several nongovernment organization
caregivers to ADB headquarters in April, we asked the
children to draw the streets of their city. Their drawings
touched us. We want for them what they want for
themselves: a life of dignity, a life without poverty. Like
the agreements we signed with other governments, the
Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Philippines
and ADB will bring us closer to that goal.

These experiences renewed my determination to
ensure that ADB will continue to make a difference.
DMCs and ADB cooperate to develop country strategy
and program reports and their updates, ensuring DMC
ownership of the development agenda. With our new

loan products, based on the London interbank offered

| | 00PresMessage-J3.p65, 5

rate (LIBOR) and introduced in 2001, we help our public

and private sector borrowers better manage interest rate
and exchange rate risks. Our reorganization and new
business processes—developed in 2001, and made
effective in January 2002—ensure our responsiveness to
our partners. Our efforts must not be in isolation.

Individually our institution can make a difference.
We can comfort a sick child, teach a village to feed
itself, help educate the people. We can help harvest
crops, empower women, and build ports and bridges.
We can tap energy sources, and strengthen private
sector enterprises. But this is not enough.

If there is a lesson I can share from 2001, it is that
individually we can do much, but with our partners and
a common goal of poverty reduction, we can achieve so

much more.

 

Solidarity gives us strength.

or the Asian and Pacific region and the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), 2001 was a year of
great challenges and tragedies. It was a year when
earthquakes shook India and Tajikistan; a harsh
winter hurt Mongolia; and terrorism shocked the
world. Exports, tourism, and foreign investment
fell, and currency and equity markets became
more volatile as the impact of 11 September hit
consumer and investor confidence. It was a year
of slow and uneven growth worldwide, a year
when the external economic environment
challenged many of ADB's developing member
countries (DMCs) at every turn. And, it was a year
when ADB took up the challenge of reorganizing
itself to meet the complex development needs of
the region.

The year was also one of cooperation,
consultation, and commitment; when nations united
in the fight against terrorism; when multilateral
organizations and governments, and the public
and private sectors, banded together to meet the
challenges of poverty. It was a year when the
public and private sectors began to adapt their
procedures and practices to meet international
standards of accountability, transparency, and
disclosure. It was a year when nations cooperated,
when diversity and common goals were bridged
through consultation and dialogue.

ADB met the challenges of 2001: strengthening itself with the approval of key policies and
strategies, encouraging participation and
broadening partnerships, and providing loan and
technical assistance where needed.

In 2001, the Board of Directors (the Board)
approved directly, or through authority delegated
to the President, 76 loans totaling $5.3 billion,

3 equity investments worth $30.4 million,

257 technical assistance projects amounting to
$146.4 million, and grants for 16 projects totaling
$93.8 million. Emergency assistance was approved
for earthquake-stricken Gujarat, India, and
assistance for the DMCs affected by the aftermath
of the 11 September events—including
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Central Asian
republics—was extended.

Strengthening the framework

The strategies and policies approved in 2001,
discussed in this Annual Report, resulted from
consultation with governments, nongovernment
organizations (NGOs), other international

09/04/02, 2:04 AM| | 01Board-4.p65

organizations, and stakeholders throughout the Asian
and Pacific region, as well as from internal reviews of
priorities and operations. Interconnected and intertwined, these policies strengthen ADB's framework.

In March, the Board approved the Long-Term
Strategic Framework (LTSF) 2001-2015, a 15-year plan
for ADB's all-out assault on poverty. Drawing from the
1999 Poverty Reduction Strategy and the 2000 Private
Sector Development Strategy, the LTSF focuses on
achieving sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and good governance.

The LTSF sets out fundamental operating principles
for reducing poverty, including ensuring DMCs own their
poverty reduction programs, enhancing strategic
partnerships, and measuring development impacts.

The Board also approved the Medium-Term
Strategy (MTS) 2001-2005—the bridge between the LTSF
and the activities ADB will undertake in its DMCs over
the next 5 years. Designed to enhance the development
impact of ADB assistance, the MTS advocates stronger
ADB commitment in addressing the institutional and
policy issues that support its thematic priorities. The
MTS strengthens ADB's leadership role in regional
cooperation—one of ADB's unique strengths—and
reiterates the importance of economic growth in
reducing poverty. The MTS also advocates investments
in the physical infrastructure necessary to promote
growth and productivity in both rural and urban areas,
as well as social infrastructure and services for human
development to support pro-poor growth.

The MTS is translated into action by
individual country strategy and program (CSP)
reports. The CSP and CSP updates—developed
in cooperation with each DMC—emphasize a
countrywide approach to development and
ensure a DMC perspective for ADB operations.

Several operational procedures and
policies were approved in 2001. Acknowledging
the powerful force of information and
communication technology (ICT) in shaping
the social and economic development of Asia
and the Pacific, ADB adopted a strategic
approach to assist its DMCs in seizing the
opportunities created by ICT. The new
strategy—Toward E-Development in Asia and
the Pacific: A Strategic Approach for
Information and Communication Technology—
creates an enabling environment for ICT
development, builds the human resources to
promote ICT literacy, and develops the
applications and information content for
ADB-supported activities.

approved ADB's

Strategy, which confirmed the role of ADB's private

In 2001, the Board affirmed ADB support for infrastructure projects, funds, and financial intermediaries, and
ensured that such support would be oriented toward
achieving greater development impact and
demonstration effects.

Regional cooperation, sustainable growth, and
private sector development were further promoted with
the approval in 2001 of the Pacific Strategy for the New
Millennium. The strategy focuses on streamlining the
public sectors and boosting private sector investment as

Better coordination, improved communications, a more clearly defined
division of labor, and increased efficiency are expected when the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Administrative Arrangements
for Cooperation, signed in 2001 by ADB and the World Bank, takes effect.
The MOU provides the framework and processes for the two development
banks to work more closely. It also calls for implementation of an existing
joint protocol on collaboration that is expected to support the preparation
of poverty reduction strategies. Operational procedures and processes will
be harmonized, and efficiency and effectiveness at the country and
institutional levels will be enhanced.

Management of the two institutions will review implementation

Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian
Development Bank, approved by the Board in 2001, also
promotes regional cooperation. It emphasizes that water
is a vital economic good that needs careful management
both to sustain growth and to reduce poverty. The
policy stresses the need for integrated cross-sector
approaches to water management and development.
Conservation and participatory approaches to protecting
water resources are at the heart of the policy.

ADB's policy foundation was further strengthened
with the approval in September 2001 of the Social

development bank to visit Pakistan

after 11 September, Mr. Chino saw

firsthand the effects of isolation on
Afghanistan's people. He was able to draw on this
experience when he later traveled to Washington, DC
for a Senior Officials’ Meeting on Reconstruction
Assistance to Afghanistan, cochaired by Japan and the
United States.

Also in 2001, Mr. Chino attended the Confederation of Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and
Industry in Batam, Indonesia—where he reiterated
ADB's strong commitment to supporting the Government's efforts for reform and poverty reduction—and
visited four of the Central Asian republics—Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. He opened

Directors’ visits

A group of Directors visited Cambodia
and Viet Nam from 24 February to

10 March; and another group traveled
to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
Tajikistan from 27 August to

12 September.

The visits provided the
Directors an opportunity to better
understand the development
conditions in the DMCs and to
discuss priorities and constraints
with senior government officials,
civil society, NGOs, and others from
the perspective of the DMCs
concerned. The visits also allowed
the Directors to look at specific
ADB-supported development

projects, and review the implementation status and
challenges being faced by the DMCs. The Directors
assessed agency coordination, focusing in particular
on those areas where duplication could be avoided,
and provided stakeholders with a better understanding

of the work ADB does in each DMC.

Strengthening Partnerships: ADB and the United Nations

They share the goal of reducing poverty. They share the democratic
governance framework for achieving that goal. And in May 2001, ADB and
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) strengthened their
common purpose even further when they signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) on Strategic Partnership.

The MOU specifies priority thematic areas and modalities of cooperation
between the two organizations. It provides for a UN Development Assistance
Framework, and cooperation between ADB and other UN organizations—
particularly in aid coordination and in such activities as preparing common
country assessments, country strategies and programs, and a common
database on poverty and other social indicators.

The agreed guidelines call for an annual consultation meeting to
monitor, report, and review the progress of partnership. The guidelines
also stipulate the designation of focal persons for each thematic area of
cooperation to identify opportunities for cooperation and initiate action
toward realizing those opportunities.

Partnership initiatives include cooperating in monitoring and assessing
the Millennium Development Goals, which are mostly poverty related, and
negotiating an umbrella agreement to include ADB staff in UN security
arrangements.

In Cambodia and Viet Nam, the Directors
recommended that ADB focus on increasing loan
disbursements to strengthen implementation, and
reducing the number of regions and sectors in the
CSP reports. The Directors noted the Vietnamese
authorities’ concern regarding the use of consultants

in projects and recommended that
this be studied. They noted that the
technical assistance program should
be demand-driven and developed in
full consultation with DMC
governments. The Directors also
recommended that ADB consider
establishing a credit line for smalland medium-sized enterprises as
requested by the private sector.

The Directors noted the similar
development challenges faced by
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
Tajikistan, especially those relating to
their landlocked geography and their
transition from centrally planned to
market economies. At the same time,
each country faces unique challenges.
The Directors concluded that, while
regional cooperation among the three
countries is important, a common
approach to development challenges
cannot be applied to these countries
simply because of their location.
ADB's country focus is, therefore,
particularly relevant. The Directors
also noted the willingness of each
DMC to take ownership of its
respective development programs,
from which the Directors concluded
the importance of ensuring that ADB
program designs and procedures are
flexible. The distance of the DMCs
from ADB headquarters highlighted
the need for resident missions in
each country; the Directors noted
that most major multilateral
financial institutions already have
missions in all three countries. The
importance of ADB's mission in
Kazakhstan was noted, and the
need to establish missions in
Azerbaijan and Tajikistan to
facilitate more effective aid
coordination and program planning
was stressed.

Funding agencies

Bank, and the United Nations| | 01Board-4.p65

Development Programme prepared the Preliminary
Needs Assessment for Afghanistan's recovery and
reconstruction for presentation at the Ministerial
Conference on the Reconstruction of Afghanistan in

Tokyo in January 2002. The Japanese
Government and ADB established the
Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology to
facilitate advances in technology and
communications and to bridge the
growing digital divide in Asia and the
Pacific. ADB signed a Memorandum
of Understanding on Administrative
Arrangements with the World Bank
and also helped develop the
Comprehensive Development
Framework and Poverty Reduction
strategy papers.

General operations

In 2001, the Board of Directors met
formally on 62 occasions, including
executive sessions, and held

19 informal meetings, including
briefings, discussion seminars, and
presentations.

Of the Board-approved
$5,339 million for 76 loans covering
60 projects, the largest share went to
the transport and communications
sector. Seventy-two loans totaling
over $5,301 million for 57 projects
were made with government
guarantee—$3,940 million from
ordinary capital resources and
$1,362 million from the Asian
Development Fund. Four loans,
totaling $37.5 million, were
approved for three private sector
projects, including the first private
sector support for social sectors for
education and health care. The
Board also approved three equity
investments amounting to
$30.4 million.

The Board approved directly, or
through authority delegated to the
President, 257 technical assistance
grants totaling $146.4 million, of
which $59.8 million came from the
Technical Assistance Special Fund,

$53.8 million from regular and supplementary contributions to the Japan Special Fund, $16.1 million from the

from other sources.

The Boards and Their Functions

ADB is governed by a Board of Governors, which, at the end of 2001,
consisted of 59' members (43 regional and 16 nonregional). Under Article
28 of ADB's Charter, the Board of Governors is vested with all the powers
of ADB. In turn, the Governors delegate their authority to the Board of
Directors, except for certain powers reserved to them under the Charter.

The Board of Governors meets formally once a year for ADB’s Annual
Meeting. For resolutions approved by the Board of Governors in 2001 and
its membership, see Appendixes 1 and 2.

Under Article 28, the Board of Governors elects a 12-member Board
of Directors, 8 elected by regional members and 4 by nonregional
members (see Appendix 3). Each Director appoints an Alternate Director.
The President of ADB is the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. In 2001,
the Board of Governors unanimously reelected President Tadao Chino for
a new 5-year term, beginning 24 November 2001.

The Board of Directors performs its duties full-time at ADB’s
headquarters in Manila, Philippines, and meets in regular formal and
executive sessions. The Directors exercise their authority and functions by
supervising preparation of ADB's financial statements, approving ADB's
administrative budget, and reviewing and approving policy documents and
all loan, equity, and technical assistance operations.

1 Portugal became a member of ADB on 2 April 2002, bringing the total membership to 60.

Providing Support: The Office of the Secretary

Providing advice and counsel to the Board of Governors, Board of Directors,
and President is the Office of the Secretary. Its other principal functions
are to help organize the Annual Meeting; to plan the calendar of the Board
of Directors and to organize and facilitate meetings of the Board and its
committees; to edit, classify, and circulate Board documents; to administer
the terms and conditions of engagement of Management and the Board;
to process applications for membership in ADB; to administer the inspection
function; and to provide protocol support and services.

In 2001, to facilitate Board consideration of loan projects, the summary
procedure was revised. Processes were developed to discuss country strategy
and program reports and their updates at Board meetings, and an integrated
documents management system was initiated. The process for reelection
of the President was organized. A new roster of independent experts for
the inspection function was drawn up, and the first inspection was begun.
Public seminars on the inspection function were held in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic and Nepal, and eight seminars to brief ADB staff were
held at headquarters. The 34°" Annual Meeting of ADB’s Board of Governors
was held in Honolulu, Hawaii, from 9 to 11 May 2001.

In informal meetings, the Directors examined a
range of issues, including country strategies and
program reporting structure and updates, working with
NGOs, and a strategic approach for ICT for the Asian
and Pacific region.

Board committees

The Board of Directors had four standing committees
and one working committee in 2001. For membership,
see Appendix 4.

Audit Committee

The responsibility for evaluating operations was
transferred from the Board’s Audit Committee to its
newly created Development Effectiveness Committee in
2001. This shift allowed the Audit Committee to focus
on internal controls, and internal and external audits. In
its 2000-2001 report, the Audit Committee concentrated
on the impact of the new financial accounting standards
(FAS 133) on ADB's financial statements. It stressed the
importance of closely following the evaluation of current
thinking among the multilateral development banks
regarding figures to be adopted for financial decisions
and the use of three parallel accounting frameworks.
The Committee oversaw the bidding process for
selecting external auditors for 2001-2004 and concurred
with the reappointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP; reviewed and endorsed the 2001 work program
of the Office of the General Auditor, including the
activities of the Anticorruption Unit; recommended
that the new Regional and Sustainable Development
Department be the focal point in ADB for good
governance activities; and monitored the
implementation of and internal operational controls in
the development of INTEGRA, the integrated computer
system being implemented in ADB.

Budget Review Committee

The Budget Review Committee met in June 2001 to
review the implementation status of the Information
Systems and Technology Strategy (ISTS), future
information technology directions for ADB, and capital
expenditures for 1998-2002. In November, it reviewed
Management's 2002 budget proposal, 2001 work
accomplishments, and 2002 work plans of ADB
departments and offices.

At the June meeting, the Committee noted the
generally satisfactory progress of most ISTS subprojects.
While noting delays in implementing the INTEGRA
system, it asked that the interface between the INTEGRA
and other planned systems be properly established and

 

. oe

coordinated promptly to ensure seamless data
generation and information flows to optimize the
system's integration.

In November, the Committee noted the expected
benefits in the new regional department structure,
especially in terms of services to DMCs, and focus on
long-term approaches. It noted that the success of the
reorganization would hinge on the effectiveness of the
Regional and Sustainable Development Department. It
emphasized the critical role of the Knowledge Management Committee in effectively coordinating departments
and offices in the knowledge group, and stressed the
importance of the new business processes in improving
efficiency and effectiveness, and reducing transaction
costs.

The Committee noted that the number of new
policies and mandates approved over the last 5 years
had placed increased pressure on ADB resources, and
that ADB's policy mandates needed to be adequately
funded and staffed.

The Committee welcomed the introduction of
environmental and social guidelines in private sector
operations and suggested that the Private Sector
Operations Department explore more ways to address
poverty reduction. It noted that ADB’s portfolio
management was as important as project processing
and stressed the importance of exploring innovative
ways to assess the leverage effects of ADB’s assistance.

The Committee noted that the transition to London
interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending (LBL)
would require a radical change in accounting systems
and a strong team to ensure that ADB and its DMCs get
the full benefit of LBL.

On the budget process, the Committee urged ADB
to explore translating into budgetary terms the cost of
implementing policies and other key initiatives, and
also, to the extent feasible, the benefit expected in terms
of the leverage effects of ADB assistance. It sought
clarification of the rationale for cost demarcation
between technical assistance and internal administrative
expense (IAE), stressing the need for ADB to remain
rigorous in distinguishing between technical assistance
and IAE-financed activities.

The Committee noted several key training programs
aimed at building mission leaders’ capabilities. It also
urged more effort in the recruitment and career
development of women professional staff. It urged that
security, financial, personal, and professional issues be
considered to facilitate recruitment and retention of
these staff.

The Committee recommended approval of the
budget for 2002.

Development Effectiveness Committee

The Development Effectiveness Committee, established
in December 2000, became active in 2001. The
Committee’s mandate is to help the Board ensure that
ADB's programs and activities achieve the desired
development objectives and use ADB resources
efficiently.

The Committee focused on ADB's operations
evaluation program and results. It reviewed the annual
work program of the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED); reviewed the annual programs for project and
technical assistance completion reports coordinated by
the Central Operations Services Office (COSO); discussed
with staff OED’s Annual Review of Evaluation Activities
in 2000 and COSO’s Semiannual Report on Loan and
Technical Assistance Portfolio Performance for the
period ending 31 December 2000, and prepared
Committee reports on these; and reviewed selected OED
evaluation reports.

The Committee concluded that the evaluation of
ADB's development effectiveness was carried out
adequately and efficiently in 2001.

In its reports to the Board, the Committee
emphasized the need to assess realistically the
achievements and sustainability of completed projects,
and specify and implement follow-up measures to
support sustainability; incorporate adequate provisions
for operation and maintenance in project design; ensure
government ownership and local participation in
projects; whenever possible, specifically target the poor

13

to ensure that they benefit from projects; focus on
long-term rather than short-term reforms; continue
efforts in capacity building for project implementation
in the DMCs; and use ADB’s resident missions
effectively.

Inspection Committee

In 2001, the Inspection Committee assisted in evaluating
candidates for the new roster of independent experts,
who were subsequently appointed by the Board in July
2001, with 5-year terms expiring on 30 June 2006.

The roster now comprises 35 names from 20 countries.
For details, see http://www.adb.org/inspection.

In April 2001, the Inspection Committee received a
request for an inspection of the Samut Prakarn
Wastewater Management Project in Thailand and, in
July, the Board approved the Committee’s recommendation for an inspection.

The Committee noted and subsequently expressed
concern that some policies had been approved by the
Board but had not yet been incorporated into the
Operations Manual, thereby excluding them from the
scope of the Inspection Policy. Management is reviewing
the issue.

The Committee selected three panel members (the
Panel), who inspected the Project in September 2001.
The Panel's final report was forwarded to ADB
Management in December 2001.

Also in December, the Committee received a request
for inspection of the Southern Transport Development
Project in Sri Lanka.

ogether, the strength of a whole is greater than
that of its individual parts. Together, nations are
empowered. This is the essence of regional
cooperation.

Not long ago, 22 senior government officials
from 6 countries, 7 staff members from Asian
Development Bank (ADB), and 3 representatives
of the private sector and civil society traveled
together along a bumpy Mekong road. Like
regional cooperation, the road was not always
smooth. Together, they overcame the discomforts
of this long journey. The ultimate goal was to
experience firsthand the need for, and benefits
of, regional cooperation on their individual
nations.

Cooperation is a powerful instrument for
dealing with regional issues. It enables nations to
combine their strengths and optimize benefits
from positive external influences. By the same
token, regional cooperation enables nations to
mitigate the adverse effects of negative externalities, such as crossborder pollution and the spread
of infectious diseases. It also creates an environment where common services and development
programs can be shared.

Nations work together. Nations grow
together. This special theme chapter discusses
this growth through cooperation.

ADB: a natural partner

ADB has long recognized the value of regional
cooperation for individual nations and the Asian
and Pacific region as a whole. In its 1966 Charter,
ADB cited economic cooperation as a means for
achieving a more efficient use of regional
resources, making economies more complementary, and promoting the orderly expansion of
foreign trade, in particular, intraregional trade. In
1994, ADB approved a policy that formalized its
role as a catalyst for regional cooperation. And
more recently, ADB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
and the Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF)
2001-2015 formally identified regional cooperation as a core component in the agenda for
reducing poverty.

Its location and policy framework position
ADB for maximum impact in bringing nations
together. Its over 35 years experience in development work—loan projects, sector studies, and
technical assistance—provide the foundation for
linking national sector development programs to

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| | O02Theme-3.p65

crossborder regional projects. This foundation was
strengthened in 2001 when ADB's new organizational
structure—which mirrors the Asian and Pacific region’s
major geographical subregions'—was approved. The
programming, processing, and delivery of all ADB
development activities are now within regional departments; ADB can help its developing member countries
(DMCs) plan and manage regional cooperation initiatives
as part of each regional department's aggregate operational program.

Being positioned to catalyze cooperation is key, but
several other factors also contribute to ADB’s comparative advantage in the field, the most important being the
mandate of the participating DMCs. In each regional and
subregional cooperation initiative, the DMCs themselves
proposed the programs ADB launched. The countries
recognized the potential economic and social benefits of
cooperation, and provided the political will to ensure
effective implementation. ADB, in the role of an honest
broker, brought the initiatives together.

ADB has promoted several regional and subregional
cooperation initiatives over the years. The oldest and
perhaps best known by the development community is
the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program which
combines the individual strengths of six countries—
Cambodia, People’s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and
Viet Nam. Other important initiatives include the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT),
the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines
East ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), Central Asian Regional
Economic Cooperation (CAREC) initiative, and the South
Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC)
initiative. In addition, ADB has long promoted the
grouping of 12 Pacific DMCs, and is now also supporting
a new regional cooperation initiative between the PRC
and Mongolia.

As poverty reduction in the Asian and Pacific
region is ADB's overarching goal in all its operations,
interventions within regional cooperation are focused on
those areas with the most widespread poverty. The most
stark example is the South Asian initiative, which covers
a subregion of over half of Asia’s poor, or about 500
million people living on less than a dollar a day.

Regionalization in a global context

Global forces are reshaping the context of Asian
development. Globalization has meant significant growth
in the Asian and Pacific region in areas such as trade,”
and the increase in global capital flows has been even

more dramatic. Globalization has made capital
increasingly mobile, which in turn has led to the
potential to accelerate the development of countries.
Globalization has increased the volume and speed of
international communications, and is changing the
structure of global production. Globalization, supported
by technology transfer, has led to a rise in productivity
and increasing specialization of the labor force.

Although globalization has led many Asian countries
to an unprecedented level of material well-being, it has
also brought risks, as evidenced by the 1997 Asian
financial crisis. In the aftermath of 11 September—for
the first time since the 1970s oil crisis—all three engines
of global economic growth (expansion of regional trade
and tourism, foreign exchange earning capacity, and
employment-intensive activities) are faltering. Without a
carefully coordinated response, global economic
progress may begin to reverse.

On a global scale, international institutions can
monitor and promote globalization to maximize benefits
and minimize risks. For example, the United Nations
(UN) system and Bretton Woods Institutions formulated
the institutional architecture of global governance and
global economic management.

Similarly, regional institutions and groupings act as
conduits between individual countries and global
institutions.’ Regional consensus can facilitate and
monitor regional compliance with international
agreements. Regional groupings can be platforms for
regional cooperation in infrastructure projects.

Regional integration initiatives in Asia include the
expanding ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) structure.

Regional groupings are not necessarily protective
trading blocks that militate against the mandate of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) by promoting trade
diversion instead of trade creation. Rather, regional
institutions and arrangements can form the intermediate
building blocks of a global economic system—
thus forming a relationship of synergy rather
than substitution.

Regional integration complements globalization in
two general ways. First, indicators of global trends—
such as investment, production, and trade linkages—are
most clearly discernible at the regional level. Second, in
an increasingly globalized world, national governments
must address shared issues. This creates pressure for
mutual adjustment on matters previously regarded as
domestic—fiscal, monetary, and investment policies;
commercial legislation; and environment and social
protection. Regional integration helps individual countries
balance domestic development needs with the forces of

ADB's Role in APEC

APEC, today consisting of 21 economies,' was established in 1989 in
response to the growing interdependence of economies in the Asian and
Pacific region. The region's leaders first met in 1993 to share a vision of
achieving regional stability, security, and prosperity. They pledged to find
cooperative solutions to the challenges of the rapidly changing global
economy by supporting greater regional linkages, reducing trade and
investment barriers, and improving education and training. APEC’s main
goals are to promote a free and open multilateral trading system and
enhance trade and investment liberalization and development cooperation
in the Asian and Pacific region.

In 1996, ADB was invited by the APEC Secretariat to join the APEC
Finance Ministers to help assess the global and regional outlook and advise
on emerging economic and financial sector issues. ADB participates actively
at all levels (ministerial and technical) with the APEC Finance Ministers,
from hosting workshops and conferences, to coordinating work on important
reports. For example, ADB helps
* facilitate private sector participation in infrastructure development;
* promote financial and capital market development; and
* create market-based financial structures and policy instruments to

facilitate increase capital mobility.

Other topics in which ADB has been involved include
* financial and currency turmoil in Asia: origins, contagion, and policy

responses;

* pension reform: a critical assessment of the policy agenda;

* _ issues of capital account convertibility and the status of APEC economies;

* training for bank supervisors and securities regulators in the APEC Forum
member economies;

* credit rating services in APEC economies; and

* corporate governance in the APEC region.

At the 8"" APEC Finance Ministers Meeting, held in the People’s Republic
of China on 8-9 September 2001, the Ministers resolved to encourage greater
economic cooperation, integration, and openness among APEC economies.

social development, environmental
protection, and protection against
crime and terrorism—especially
significant in the aftermath of

11 September.

Economic development

Regional cooperation eliminates
physical and nonphysical barriers. It
amplifies domestic development by
widening the options available to
participating countries, expanding
markets and access to key imports.
This is particularly important for
countries—or regions within countries—with limited access to markets
and resources. Integrating smaller
economies into larger regional
economies expands the size of the
market, thus facilitating cost reduction through economies of large-scale
production.

Regional cooperation makes
possible the coordinated development
of basic infrastructure, from
crossborder power grids and telecommunications links to railways,
highways, and inland waterways.
Transport projects, in particular, can
reduce physical barriers to the
movement of goods and people
across national boundaries, which
may in turn expand regional trade
and tourism, increase foreign
exchange earning capability, and
create employment-intensive
activities.

However, cooperation alone is
not sufficient to enhance a participat
globalization, creating a manageable context within
which to address key global concerns, such as protecting
natural resources and controlling the crossborder
transmission of diseases.

Dimensions of regional cooperation

Regional cooperation exists regardless of globalization.
Historically, several regional arrangements were initiated
to provide strategic defense, especially during the postSecond World War period, but security was not their
only reason for existence. Regional cooperation also
exists to nurture and enhance economic development,

. oe

ing economy's growth potential. The benefits of
infrastructure that reduce physical barriers to trade and
investment may still be severely constrained by
nonphysical barriers to the movement of goods,
services, information, and people. Procedures,
regulations, and policies must be streamlined to
increase the efficiency of investments in infrastructure
and production facilities. A streamlined policy framework can also stimulate crossborder investment and
trade growth. Regional cooperation that simultaneously
addresses physical infrastructure and software needs,
such as trade and investment facilitation, can increase
the subregion or region’s potential attractiveness to

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| | O02Theme-3.p65

investors, to the benefit of all participating economies.
It can also help integrate the region more closely into
the global economy.

Likewise, the effective collection and sharing of
financial information as well as regional policy
coordination and cooperation can support global
financial stability.

Social development

As regional and global integration accelerates, so too
does the crossborder transmission of diseases such as
malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. The ability of
individual DMCs to monitor and respond to outbreaks of
these diseases varies. The overall health of a region can
improve if the spread of diseases is prevented.

Just as regional cooperation can help control the
spread of disease, it can help promote education.
Networks of advanced learning centers can serve as
resource centers for the entire region. For example,
while it may not be financially feasible for individual
countries to host a large learning center or university,
centers such as the International Rice Research Institute
and the Asian Institute of Management in the Philippines
and the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand can
and do service entire regions.

Environment and natural resource
management

Environmental degradation is not confined to individual
countries. This is especially so in the Asian and Pacific
region, which covers 23% of the world’s land area and
contains 55% of the world’s population—a population
density of 93 people per square kilometer, compared
with a worldwide density of 24 people per square
kilometer. The rate of urbanization is unprecedented.
The region's environment is besieged by pollution and
resource degradation. Renewable resources are being
depleted faster than they are regenerated; air and
water pollution, poor sanitation, and urban congestion
are causing profound long-term health problems;
traffic congestion is resulting in millions of dollars of
lost work; and fragile ecosystems are being destroyed
with critical long-term development implications. The
region is often struck by floods, droughts, landslides,
forest fires, and chemical and nuclear accidents—all
of which are aggravated or caused by environmental
degradation. Better environmental management can
prevent such disasters. Regional cooperation
initiatives can help mitigate the effects of natural
environmental disasters and those caused by human
activities, such as erosion, flooding, forest fires, and
air and water pollution.

Crime prevention

Globalization has led to a surge in crossborder
activities—legal and illegal. And while crime is
becoming increasingly global, law enforcement remains
constrained by national boundaries. Crossborder
trafficking of people especially women and children,
drugs, arms and other contraband, and money
laundering through global banking and capital markets
have grown rapidly. These global crimes require a
coordinated international response, which is reinforced
by regional initiatives based on close cooperation
among countries.

Economic cooperation initiatives

Subregional programs

Greater Mekong Subregion: When initiated in 1992,
relations among several of the GMS countries were
strained, and trade and other forms of cooperation were
limited. Peace in the region was complemented by
ADB's program for subregional economic cooperation,
and the GMS program is now regarded as one of the
most successful models of regional cooperation in Asia.

The establishment of trust and goodwill, and
improved confidence among the participating countries
led to investments in infrastructure and promoted
further cooperation. Participating countries have formed
cooperation agreements on new air routes, river
navigation agreements, and border development. By
mid-2001, 10 projects totaling $2 billion and technical
assistance amounting to $46 million had been
completed or were being implemented.*

The initial emphasis was on developing physical
infrastructure linkages to increase trade and encourage
investment among the countries. Priority went to
subregional projects in energy, transport, and telecommunications, including the Phnom Penh-Ho Chi Minh
City Road Project and the Theun Hinboun Hydropower
Project. As the program evolved, increased attention
went to human resource development, tourism,
environment, and investment and trade. Initiatives in
human resource development included addressing the
needs of ethnic minorities in the border regions,
searching for ways to mitigate the transborder spread of
communicable diseases, and joint efforts to counter drug
production and use. Initiatives in tourism included
improving the access, promotion, and development of
projects in full partnership with the private sector.

The GMS program now emphasizes the software
components of physical infrastructure projects, such as

ensuring the success of investments in transport projects
by working to reduce legal and policy barriers to the
movement of goods and people. Synergy between
economic activities and infrastructure development is
being achieved by developing economic corridors. The
first of these—the East-West Economic Corridor—is a
1,500-kilometer road link from Mawlamyine on the
Andaman Sea in Myanmar, traversing Lao PDR and
Thailand, and ending at Da Nang near the South China
Sea in Viet Nam. By 2004, it will be possible to traverse
90% of the corridor along a modern, all-weather highway.

At the 10" GMS Ministerial Conference in late 2001 in
Yangon, Myanmar, the GMS ministers expressed their
intention to strengthen and accelerate their economic
cooperation initiatives and endorsed a 10-year strategic
framework to serve as the blueprint for this. They agreed to
¢ strengthen infrastructure linkages with a

multisectoral approach;

e facilitate crossborder trade and investment;

¢ enhance private sector participation;

¢ — develop human resources; and

* promote environmental protection and sustainable
use of shared natural resources.

The ministers endorsed 10 flagship projects,
including further developing the East-West Economic
Corridor and the Chiang Rai-Kunming road (NorthSouth Corridor Project); facilitating crossborder
movement of goods and services; and promoting the
role of the private sector, particularly small- and
medium-sized enterprises. Public-private partnerships
will be promoted through the recently established
GMS Business Forum. Major activities will include
pilot testing single-stop customs inspection procedures, and working to complete the accession process
for all GMS countries to the Framework Agreement for
the Facilitation of Crossborder Movement of Goods
and Peoples in the GMS by 2005. ADB will continue to
help build the capacities of national institutions in
program management.

Several lessons from the GMS program have
relevance to other regional initiatives in Asia.
¢ Countries must have ownership as well as the

capacity to lead, manage, and monitor the

initiative.

¢  Broad-based participation of local officials, civil
society, private sector, and nongovernment
organizations is needed.

¢ Equitable sharing of the costs and benefits of
crossborder projects is required.

* Success requires sustained diplomacy and longterm commitment by parties concerned.

Central Asia: The former Soviet republics in
Central Asia face the twin challenges of building their
nations and making the transition to a market economy.
Given the countries’ landlocked and remote locations
from major world markets, small domestic markets, and
complementary resource endowments, especially in
energy and water, these challenges are formidable.

The Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation
(CAREC) program was initiated in 1997 to support and
encourage economic cooperation among the PRC,®
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and
Uzbekistan. Azerbaijan and Mongolia are expected to
join soon. With the overall objectives of promoting
economic growth and raising living standards, CAREC
focuses on promoting market integration within and
outside the region, financing infrastructure projects, and
improving the accompanying policy environment.

Like other regional cooperation initiatives, CAREC’s
focus has evolved. Early efforts were on raising
awareness of the importance of regional cooperation,
mainly through workshops, seminars, and studies. As
mutual understanding and trust developed, the emphasis
shifted to identifying and preparing priority regional
projects in transport, energy, and trade, and in policy
reforms to remove crossborder barriers to the movement
of goods and people.

In August 2001, senior government officials
reemphasized reiterated their support for ADB
involvement in transport, energy, and trade. They also
agreed to establish an overall institutional framework—
consisting of a policy-making ministerial-level conference and implementation arrangements—to help
strengthen the program and provide a mechanism for
high-level policy dialogue, consensus building, and
mobilizing resources.

ADB's efforts have begun to bear concrete results.
In October 2000, ADB approved a $57 million loan for
the Almaty-Bishkek Regional Road Rehabilitation Project
to improve a road link between Kazakhstan and the
Kyrgyz Republic. A feasibility study on improving the
Central Asia power transmission system has been
completed. In addition, ADB continues to lead in
addressing issues with a direct impact on the livelihood
of people and poverty reduction. A project to manage
education reform by reviewing key policy issues and
development strategies, and collective discussions on
education reform is one such initiative. Another is a
project to improve nutrition of poor mothers and
children by fortifying salt and flour with iodine.

The events of 11 September led to increased ADB
support for economic cooperation in Central Asia. Trade
facilitation initiatives will focus on regional cooperation

 

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| O2Theme-3.p65

in customs, a pilot joint processing project, and capacity
building. An agreement has been reached with the
Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for ADB to assist in
customs modernization and cooperation. In the
transport sector, the focus will be on rehabilitating key
sections of the regional transport networks. Technical
assistance will help prepare the Kyrgyz Transport
Corridor Project, which will develop a transcontinental
rail and regional road link. ADB will continue to provide
support to rationalize the use of regional energy
networks and support regional initiatives to explore
hydropower resources.

Annual ministerial conferences for the CAREC
initiative will serve as important means for achieving
long-term stability and prosperity in the region. The
Ministerial Conference’ planned for 2002 is expected to
advance support for economic cooperation in the region
by prioritizing regional investment and other projects,
explore new prospects for cooperation in the context of
Afghanistan's reconstruction, and facilitate coordination
with other funding agencies and the international
community within the CAREC initiative. For more on the
CAREC initiative, see http://www.adb.org/CAREC.

South Asia: The South Asia Subregional Economic
Cooperation (SASEC) subregion, comprising Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, and Nepal, has significant resources and
potential. It also has more than 500 million of the
900 million people in Asia living on less than a dollar
a day.

The complementarities among these countries—vast
endowments of hydropower, hydrocarbon, and other
minerals; ports; a large deltaic rice bowl; and skilled lowcost workforce—could rapidly reduce poverty through high
growth, led by subregional cooperation.

In 1997, the foreign ministers of Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, and Nepal organized the South Asia Growth
Quadrangle (SAGQ) to build on those complementarities.
Launched by the Foreign Ministers, SAGQ identified five
priority sectors for cooperation, established action
committees for each sector, and assigned coordinating
responsibilities among its members. Bangladesh was
responsible for energy, Bhutan for environment, India
for trade and investment, and Nepal for transport and
tourism. SAGQ requested assistance in developing the
sectors; that request led to the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation (SASEC).

The SASEC program began in 2000 with a regional
technical assistance for a private sector forum on
economic cooperation in South Asia, an ADB-supported
initiative of the chambers of commerce of Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, and Nepal. Subsequently, a regional
initiative was launched to identify and prioritize subre
 

° oe

gional projects in tourism, environment, transport,

power and energy, trade and investment, and private

sector cooperation. Each working group met in 2001,5

with the participation of top officials demonstrating the

governments’ high-level commitment to the program.

The sector working groups established specific priorities

and identified project concepts.

The SASEC program also organized a regional
roundtable on information and communication
technology (ICT)? to bring together key players from the
ICT sector in SASEC and the GMS to interact with their
public and private sector counterparts. The activity was
aimed at learning from India’s success in ICT and
applying the lessons to their own ICT development
strategies. The roundtable generated concrete proposals
for regional cooperation in physical infrastructure, and
institutional and capacity-building dimensions of ICT.
These range from fiber optic extensions to India’s
neighbors to cyber laws and human resource development
in the ICT sector.

In addition, several investment projects initiated
within SASEC countries have subregional implications:

*  anorth-south transport corridor in India, from Siliguri
to Kolkata and Haldia in West Bengal, with links to
border points in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal;

¢ the Northwest Road Corridor Improvement Project
in Bangladesh, from Panchagar to Bangla Bandh,
which can be linked to Nepal and India; and

¢ the Fourth Road Improvement Project for Nepal’s
East-West Road Corridor, which links to the road
corridors in Bangladesh and India through
Kakarbita.

ADB's Private Sector Group has also invested in
Lafarge Surma Cement, Ltd., the first subregional private
sector project, which will transport limestone from
Meghalaya, India, to a cement plant in Bangladesh
through a crossborder conveyor system. For more on the
SASEC initiative, see http://www.adb.org/SASEC.

Southeast Asia: Significant advances were made in
regional cooperation in Southeast Asia in the mid-1990s.
However, progress stalled after external and internal
shocks spoiled the investment climate: the Asian
financial crisis in 1997; the destruction caused by the
El Nifo and the La Nifa weather phenomena in 1998
and 1999; changes in political leadership at national
and local levels; and armed domestic conflict in
some areas.

Opportunities to revive regional cooperation in
Southeast Asia increased in 2001. Efforts of governments concerned are focused on the IndonesiaMalaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) and the
Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East

Power and Energy
* Regional power system master plan

Trade, Investment and Private Sector Cooperation

* Various subregional trade and investment facilitation services to be provided through the South Asia
Business Forum, a new network of apex chambers
of commerce from the SASEC countries

ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). Political leaders
are focused on addressing the socioeconomic causes
of security problems, and are planning measures to
improve the environment for private sector participation,
such as identifying new prospects for private sector
partnerships in each other's countries and lowering
trade barriers.

ADB reaffirmed its support for regional cooperation
in BIMP-EAGA in late 1999 when it initiated a study of
small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
Indonesia and the Philippines to help develop and
strengthen the private sector. The resulting strategy was
endorsed by both countries’ governments and was
aimed at developing SMEs in areas within the framework
of the BIMP-EAGA subregional cooperation mechanism.
ADB is undertaking activities to implement the SME
development strategy and encouraging other bilateral

21

and multilateral funding agencies to participate. ADB is
examining options to expand the strategy across the
entire EAGA region;'° reviewing the EAGA structure and
mechanisms; and examining harmonization of customs,
immigration, quarantine, and security rules, regulations,
and procedures to revitalize subregional economic
cooperation initiatives.

In November 2001, at a meeting of the ASEAN
heads, it was agreed to invite ADB as an advisor to
BIMP-EAGA. In this role, ADB is preparing a program to
help revive and strengthen economic development in the
region by reengineering subregional cooperation and
jumpstarting economic activity to restore business
confidence. Reengineering requires upgrading subregional cooperation mechanisms and improving coordination
with bilateral, multilateral, and other subregional
development partners, including ASEAN. The initiatives
will seek to redefine subregional development priorities
and strategies, enhance crossborder trade and
investment, strengthen SME access to information, and
establish an economic development fund.

ADB is closely following activities in the IMT-GT to
help strengthen regional cooperation. As improved
transport links are a priority for both the IMT-GT
and BIMP-EAGA initiatives, ADB has approved
technical assistance to strengthen regional cooperation
in this sector."!

Pacific DMCs: Regional cooperation has underpinned ADB's operations in its 12 Pacific DMCs, which
stand to gain from collectively reaping the benefits of
economies of scale in public and private activities. The
Pacific has more than 200 regional organizations
covering issues such as politics, economics, sector
development, commerce and trade, and religion. ADB's
promotion of regional cooperation has focused on
fisheries, airline and airspace management, regional
stock exchanges, public sector management, and
governance and money laundering. ADB also supports
regional studies to assess poverty in the Pacific region
and analyze financial sector issues and strategies.

Fish are the most significant economic resource for
the small Pacific economies. Together, the exclusive
economic zones of the Pacific islands total 30.5 million
square kilometers. The total tuna catch in the Pacific
averages | million metric tons a year—almost one third
of the worldwide catch. The tuna industry is worth some
$1.9 billion per annum to Pacific economies.

ADB has a special role in responding to emerging
regional concerns. For example, marine resource
management, including the Multilateral High-Level
Consultations to develop an international tuna
management agreement, is an area where ADB

 

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| O2Theme-3.p65

assistance can be especially beneficial. The Forum
Fisheries Agency approach gave the distant water
fishing nations an improved bargaining position. ADB
has also supported live reef fish trade management;
environmental and resource management, including
climate change and sea level rise resulting from
global warming; biodiversity; and indigenous
environmental management.

ADB is encouraging negotiations in the area of
airline and airspace management. As private investment
is often not viable in this area, regional cooperation will
enable Pacific nations to develop collaborative
arrangements that allow economic and financial
viability. Similarly, ADB is helping Pacific DMCs assess
their ICT readiness, closing the gap between ICT
demand and supply, and increasing the awareness of
regional cooperation in this sector. In particular, ADB is
focusing on ICT infrastructure development, social
inclusion, and electronic governance.

Also showing promising results in the Pacific is
ADB's support for regional cooperation in capacity
building and information sharing. For example, ADB is
promoting regional cooperation to develop economic
statistics capacity in selected Pacific DMCs. Public sector
management and governance reform continue to be an
important ADB focus through support to the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Center and regional
seminars. ADB initiated governance assessments for
some Pacific DMCs in 2001, and will continue this
process in 2002. ADB has also, in collaboration with the
ADB Institute, supported the training of trainers in
public expenditure management and private-public
partnership in the social sectors.

The financial and utility services sectors are
essential for long-term private sector development. An
ADB-assisted review of financial sectors in seven Pacific
DMCs identified key constraints and facilitated dialogue
among countries on regional solutions, including the
possibility of electronically linking regional stock
exchanges. ADB continues to promote regional
cooperation among utility providers through the Pacific
Water Association and the Pacific Power Association,
which developed benchmarks for their members’ utilities
and facilitated sharing of experiences and approaches to
providing drinking water and power in Pacific countries.
ADB also helps Pacific DMCs combat money laundering
by establishing legal and financial frameworks that meet
international standards.

The PRC and Mongolia: Trade and economic
relations between the PRC and Mongolia were previously
limited. However, by participating in the Tumen River
Area Development Program,” both countries expressed

 

° oe

interest in accelerating growth and development by
strengthening economic cooperation.

To support this, ADB provided technical assistance
in 2000 for a strategic study of the options for economic
cooperation among three eastern provinces of
Mongolia,'* and the Xinganmeng Prefecture of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region in the PRC.'‘ The study
highlighted the region's potential for developing mineral
resources, preserving its diversified ecosystem and
unique natural environment, and developing green food
production and international tourism. The study recognized that rapid development of the PRC transportation
system would help break the region's physical isolation
from world markets.

As a result of the study, the two governments
agreed on a phased approach for promoting cooperation,
beginning with the construction of joint border facilities
to allow year-round trade and travel, and also formulating a plan to manage the environmental impact of
development arising from enhanced crossborder
activities. In the medium term, they agreed to review the
export potential of mineral deposits in eastern Mongolia.
A shared view on the mining sector's potential will help
them formulate a mutually agreed medium-term
regional transport plan.

Regional monetary and financial
cooperation

In the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, many
countries in East Asia sought closer monetary and
financial cooperation to achieve greater regional
financial stability. Initiatives were in three broad areas:
information exchange and economic surveillance;
regional financing arrangements; and coordination of
macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.

Information exchange and economic surveillance:
There are three major initiatives in information exchange and economic surveillance: the Manila Framework Group, the ASEAN Surveillance Process, and the
ASEAN+3 Surveillance Process.

The Manila Framework Group!® was formed in
November 1997 with the overriding purpose of regional
surveillance. Under this process, deputies from the
finance ministries and central banks of member
countries meet semiannually to discuss regional
economic issues of common interest. ADB supports
this process by participating in all the meetings and
presenting a regional economic outlook to help
facilitate policy dialogue.

The ASEAN Surveillance Process was established in
October 1998 to strengthen policy-making capacity
within the group, based on the principles of peer review

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| | O02Theme-3.p65

and mutual interest. The Process
monitors exchange rates and macroeconomic aggregates, and also
sectoral and social policies; and
includes provisions for capacity
building, institutional strengthening,
and information sharing. The ASEAN
finance ministers meet twice a year
for policy coordination.

The ASEAN+3 Surveillance
Process, established in November
1999, involves 10 ASEAN countries
and PRC, Japan, and Republic of
Korea. ASEAN+3 finance ministers
meet semiannually to exchange
information and discuss policy issues,
and have taken steps to enhance
cooperation in monitoring short-term
capital flows and developing early
warning systems to assess regional
financial vulnerabilities and prevent
future financial crises.

Regional financing arrangements: The ASEAN+3 finance
ministers met in May 2000 in Chiang
Mai, Thailand, on the sidelines of the
ADB Annual Meeting. They agreed on
the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) to
expand ASEAN Swap Arrangements
(ASA) to all ASEAN member countries,
set up a network of bilateral swap
and repurchase arrangements (BSA)
among ASEAN+3 countries, and
establish a regional financing facility

Preventing and Mitigating Transboundary
Atmospheric Pollution

In protecting Asia’s environment, ADB takes a proactive approach to many
environment issues. One of the most pressing issues in recent years has
been the threat of forest fires affecting the ASEAN region. The fires that
hit Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 were among the most damaging in
recorded history, causing a vast pall of haze to hang over the region for
months and bringing widespread destruction, disruption of economic
activity, health problems, and even deaths. Estimates of the total damage
caused by the fires and haze exceeded $9 billion, covering an area of about
9.76 million hectares (ha), mostly in Indonesia. The resulting smoke and
haze spread over an area the size of Western Europe and lasted 6 months,
affecting 70 million people in the region. At times, visibility was reduced,
making land, sea, and air travel hazardous. Use of open burning techniques
for converting forestland to other land uses was one of the underlying
causes of these catastrophic fires. But extremely dry conditions associated
with the El Nifo weather phenomenon also contributed.

Affected ASEAN countries drew up strategies for coordinated action
at national and regional levels. At the ASEAN level, a Regional Haze Action
Plan was formulated and endorsed by ASEAN Environment Ministers in
late 1997. This represented a turning point in the region's approach to the
problem. ADB responded by providing advisory technical assistance to
Indonesia and regional technical assistance to ASEAN to strengthen its
capacity to put the plan into operation. These interventions have been
implemented. The regional technical assistance sought to strengthen and
formalize cooperation among affected ASEAN countries through short-term
measures to support early implementation of the Action Plan; and mediumterm measures to enhance awareness of the fires and associated
transboundary atmospheric pollution. Another medium-term objective is
to strengthen the capability of institutions concerned to implement and
monitor the Action Plan.

to supplement existing international facilities. Subsequent
progress in both areas includes the November 2000
expansion of the ASA to cover all ASEAN member
countries. The total amount of the ASA involved is now
$1 billion. Seven of 30 bilateral agreements are now in
place, and negotiations are ongoing for several more.
Although the amounts involved in these arrangements
are relatively small, compared with total crossborder
capital flows, the CMI lays the foundation for enhanced
regional monetary and financial cooperation. It also
attempts to fill an important niche in the international
financial architecture.

Coordination of macroeconomic and exchange
rate policies: Efforts are also under way among East
Asian nations to go beyond the CMI and coordinate
macroeconomic and exchange rate policies. An ASEAN
Currency and Exchange Rate Mechanism Task Force was
set up in March 2001. The Kobe Research Project is one

23

of the recent initiatives of the Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) launched by the Asia-Europe Finance Ministers
when they met in Kobe, Japan, in January 2001. In this
initiative, studies undertaken by institutions and experts
in Asia and Europe explore ways of improving regional
monetary and financial cooperation. The ASEM is a
gathering of heads of governments from 10 Asian
countries,' 15 European nations, and the President of
the European Commission. Its objective is to strengthen
the political, economic, and cultural ties between the
two continents. The inaugural ASEM—held in Bangkok
in March 1996—started a series of initiatives involving
the public and private sectors of all ASEM countries.
ADB support for monetary and financial
cooperation in East Asia—The Regional Economic
Monitoring Unit: ADB established the Regional
Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU) in early 1999, and
has so far approved 10 regional technical assistance

 

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| O2Theme-3.p65

 

projects, totaling $5.1 million, to enhance East Asian

countries’ capacity for economic monitoring and regional

surveillance. Activities under these projects include

¢ training secondees from ASEAN central banks and
finance ministries in economic monitoring and
surveillance;

* supporting the activities of the ASEAN Surveillance
Coordination Unit located in the ASEAN Secretariat
in Jakarta;

¢ helping establish national surveillance units in the
finance ministries of ASEAN countries;!7

¢ providing monitoring input to high-level meetings
of the ASEAN, ASEAN+3, and Manila Framework
Group;

* promoting regional initiatives in monitoring shortterm capital flows and establishing early warning
systems;

¢ developing and maintaining a web-based
clearinghouse of information on East Asia’s
recovery and growth; and

* conducting special studies on regional monetary
and financial cooperation, including policy options
to pursue ASEAN+3 countries' monetary and
financial cooperation efforts as part of the Kobe
Research Project.

Sector themes in regional cooperation
within ADB

Agricultural research: ADB provides annual financing
of about $4 million to the Consultative Group for International Agricul
 

women, 50% of all women of childbearing age, and 40%
of preschool children are anemic. Anemia permanently
impairs cognitive development and learning capacity in
infancy, limits capacity to undertake physical labor,
reduces immunity, and substantially increases maternal
mortality. Since all these factors inhibit income generation, iron deficiency anemia contributes significantly to
increased poverty and poses an enormous public health
problem. The nutrition study to eliminate anemia is a
clear example where multilateral and regional institutions,
through regional cooperation, work to address major
development issues.

Water: The pressure on Asia's water resources is
rapidly becoming acute. ADB and its DMCs need to
move from water sector investment aimed primarily at
creating assets, to holistic, integrated investment to
promote efficient water use as stated in ADB's water
policy. Investments in water supply and sanitation,
irrigation and drainage, hydropower, flood control, and
watershed management need to be made in the context
of managing water resources within river basins. ADB
fosters integrated water resource management, based on
comprehensive studies, and concentrates interlinked
water investments in river basins. ADB also promotes
regional cooperation to increase the mutual benefits of
shared water resources within and between countries.
The primary focus is to exchange information on water
sector reform. Support will also be provided to enhance
awareness of the benefits of shared water resources,

tural Research Centers and supports
continued research by the International Food Policy Research Institute

ADB Joins the Cities Alliance

The Cities Alliance is a multilateral coalition designed to achieve the promise
of well-managed cities. ADB's participation in the Alliance seeks to promote,
facilitate, and support improved urban management; strengthen the impact
of urban poverty reduction interventions; and enhance networking and
cooperation among rapidly urbanizing cities in the region. It also provides
a means to improve the efficiency and impact of ADB's urban sector
interventions by
* strengthening the process by which local stakeholders define their vision
for their city, analyze its economic prospects, develop a viable practical
city development strategy, establish priorities for action, and formulate
integrated high-priority investments; and
* supporting slum eradication, urban upgrading, and urban regeneration.
ADB's participation in the Cities Alliance expands the level of resources
reaching the urban poor by improving urban programs, catalyzing partners’
efforts beyond their individual programs, and more directly linking grantfunded urban development cooperation with investment. ADB takes a lead
role in promoting sound urban sector policy to advance collective knowledge
and share lessons from across regions and through networks of local
authorities and their associations.

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| | O02Theme-3.p65

create sound hydrologic and socioenvironmental databases
relevant to managing transboundary water resources, and
implement regional or subregional projects.

Successful examples of water sector regional
cooperation include the Mekong River Commission and
the Interstate Water Commission of Central Asia. ADB
supports the Southeast Asia and South Asia water
partnerships in exchanging information and ideas on
national water sector reforms. In the GMS, ADB funds
studies that will lead to improved management of the
Tonle Sap, an internationally significant wetland area
shared by six countries along the Mekong River. ADB
will continue to assist governments in developing
collaborative frameworks with stakeholders, including
assessing the downstream impact of any ADB-financed
water project, in a river basin context.

Environment: ADB helps its DMCs address many
transboundary environmental issues, including atmospheric
pollution, global climate change, greenhouse gas abatement strategies, acid rain in Northeast Asia, emission
reduction, cleaner technology, coastal and marine resource
management, integrated water resource management, and
soil-conserving farming systems. ADB has collaborated
with ASEAN to produce Fire, Smoke, and Haze,* a general
guide on preventing fire and haze in the ASEAN region.

A key focus of ADB efforts is promoting regional
cooperation for improved environmental governance,
including capacity building, policy reform, a regional
action plan, data collection, and information sharing.
Many vital institutional and infrastructure changes will
be required. ADB supports its DMCs in their compliance
with environmental provisions of international treaties
and agreements.'? ADB also targets high-level regional
conferences on key policy and capacity issues to
highlight their relevance to regional development.

Urban development: The Asian and Pacific region
is experiencing rapid urbanization. Already, one third of
the region's 3.5 billion people live in cities and this is
forecast to increase by 54% in 2020. The private sector's
role in providing services is increasing, and governments are focusing on providing an enabling environment, rather than giving direct services. Most cities in
developing countries receive inadequate information,
which undermines their ability to understand the forces
shaping their urban environments, and thus does not
allow them to develop and test effective urban policies.
Major economic data measuring the health of an urban
economy are seldom collected; data on population
growth, rural-urban migration, infrastructure, and the
environment are not available in a single location or
consistent format; and some data are not collected at
all, such as the distribution of job opportunities.

 

25

ADB has established a policy-oriented database of
urban indicators for research, policy formulation,
monitoring development impact of interventions in the
urban sector, comparing performance between cities,
and improving the efficiency of service delivery. The
database, involving 18 cities in 15 countries in the Asian
and Pacific region, develops methodologies and criteria
to measure and evaluate the efficiency of urban service
delivery,”° and establishes a network for exchanging
information on the quality and efficiency of urban
management between cities. Urban Indicators for
Managing Cities: Cities Data Book is designed primarily
for policymakers and urban managers of cities in the
region and provides information to trigger reforms. ADB
has also joined the Cities Alliance, a group of countries
and international organizations committed to the goal of
“cities without slums.”

Transport and energy: Regional cooperation in
developing transport infrastructure takes advantage of
economies of scale, helps reduce the physical isolation of
remote regions in Asia, promotes year-round trade and
travel in border regions, and opens new areas to mineral
exploration. Border areas are also usually the poorer
regions, and building proper infrastructure further reduces
poverty by promoting the mainstreaming of isolated
people. ADB is a driving force in financing or promoting
infrastructure for regional and subregional cooperation.

Although the economic feasibility of several
regional projects has been established through ADBfunded regional technical assistance, several sector
issues must be resolved by participating countries before
the infrastructure projects become bankable. The 1997
Asian financial crisis was a major setback, as investments
and economic growth in general slowed in the region,
and the development of large infrastructure projects was
deferred for nearly 3 years.

In the energy sector, regional impact and global
warming issues, such as acid rain and greenhouse gas
abatement, require effective crossborder commitment.
Increasing the use of renewable energy sources
minimizes environmental degradation from energy
production, facilitates trading in credits, and increases
opportunities for decentralized energy service provision.
ADB's regional cooperation focus in the energy sector
has been on energy trade. Energy resources are not
always close to demand centers. Often, DMCs with large
resource endowments have small populations and low
demand, while DMCs with high demand do not have
adequate energy resources. Energy trade benefits both
groups. In the power sector, for instance, reducing
reserve margins leads to lower overall system costs, and
the importing DMC can often avoid adding to pollution.

Regional Cooperation in Infrastructure Projects

The first ADB initiative to promote regional cooperation
in infrastructure was in the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS), where several transport and power sector projects
are ongoing. These include national projects with
subregional dimensions and others that are purely
subregional projects with a total project cost of more
than $1.9 billion. ADB's assistance to these projects
amounts to $772 million ($575 million for national
projects with subregional dimensions and $197 million
for purely subregional projects). ADB has helped mobilize
$234 million through cofinancing.

In Central Asia, ADB-financed studies in 1997 and
1998 outlined infrastructure needs and policy issues for
promoting regional energy trade between People’s
Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,
and Uzbekistan. Based on these studies, ADB invested in
subregional road rehabilitation projects ($70 million)
between Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic.

The most recent development in ADB’s initiatives for
regional cooperation is the South Asia Subregional
Economic Cooperation Program. The area has resources,
including hydropower and natural gas that can be
developed economically for the larger subregional market.
The subregion has several ports, and complementary
transport infrastructure can be created to serve the
developmental needs of the subregion and facilitate
international trade.

In the next few years, ADB will help put structures in
place to start implementing the following regional and
subregional infrastructure projects.

Natural gas pipeline

* — Grissik-Batam-Singapore pipeline between Indonesia
and Singapore

* Gas transmission network among Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz
Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan

* Bangladesh-India natural gas pipeline

Telecommunications

ADB helps DMCs in the Pacific, which have small
energy sectors, share information and performance
data, and pool resources for skills development and
capacity building. Larger countries with proven energy
resources beyond their domestic needs can also
benefit from regional cooperation—often requiring
regional contracts and significant up-front investment
to realize the full benefits of these natural resources.

Combating corruption: Following an inaugural
conference in Manila, Philippines, in late 1999, ADB and
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) have been collaborating to create
an anticorruption forum for Asian and Pacific nations to
foster regional cooperation in the fight against corruption.

09/04/02, 2:15 PM| | O02Theme-3.p65

At a conference in December 2000 in Seoul, Republic of
Korea, participants from more than 35 ADB and OECD
member countries endorsed the ADB/OECD AntiCorruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific. Its initial objective
was to provide a support network for preparing national
and regional anticorruption strategies.

At the request of participating countries, ADB and
OECD convened expert meetings to draft an action plan
based on the priority areas identified in Seoul. The plan
includes promoting good governance through legal,
institutional, and administrative reforms; strengthening
the rule of law; promoting integrity in business
operations; and developing proactive strategies to
promote citizens’ participation in anticorruption efforts.
Seventeen countries”! endorsed the Anti-Corruption
Action Plan at the third ADB-OECD Conference,?? where
participants pledged to undertake reforms to curb
corruption in their countries.

The Action Plan rests on three reform pillars:
improving the civil service, reducing bribery, and
involving civil society. The partnership of international
civil society, business community, and funding agencies
will reinforce the visibility of the Plan. Countries
endorsing the Plan will identify actions within the three
pillars, and report reforms undertaken to a peer group.
An ADB-OECD Secretariat will support each country in
implementing the Plan. At the close of the third
Conference a steering Group of 17 countries discussed
the next steps and expressed interest in subregional
cooperation.

In support of the ADB-OECD initiative ADB
instituted a Governance Cooperation Fund, with an
initial contribution from Canada, to help countries
reform their institutions in fighting corruption. Other
funding agencies have expressed interest in supporting
the initiative.

Conclusion

There are no blueprints for developing regional

cooperation programs. Components such as size,

underlying rationale, and degree of public or private

sector involvement will always vary. Nevertheless,

certain preconditions have to be met if regional

cooperation is to be successful, including

* — relative assurance of net social gains,?>

* some complementarity among nations,

*  aresource base (natural resources, labor, and capital)

¢ — geographic proximity and cultural and linguistic
affinity,

¢ political commitment and willingness to forgo some
measure of sovereignty,

27,

* ownership and commitment to the success of the
initiative,

¢ aclear vision and strong public policy, and

¢ readiness to invest in physical infrastructure and
accommodate policy changes.

Certain elements are required for successful
cooperation, notably patience, monitoring mechanisms,
and financial resources. It takes time to create the
appropriate institutions and build up national capacities.
It takes time to achieve results. In regions with a recent
history of political conflict, even more time is needed to
overcome suspicion and build trust. Regional cooperation programs become more complex as they mature.
This leads to increased potential for disagreements over
the cost of borrowing for physical investments and the
division of benefits—outcomes and natural resources—
resulting from the regional cooperation program. To
minimize the incidence of disagreements, it is important to
establish—as early as possible—monitoring and evaluation
capabilities and dispute resolution processes, and to
provide training in project appraisal techniques for both
local and national planners.

Successful regional economic cooperation also
requires significant financing to establish links among
geographically contiguous countries and to develop
national and regional economies once the basic
framework for cooperation has been established.

ADB has provided much of the financing needed to
establish the modalities of regional cooperation, most

The IMT-GT and, to a lesser extent, BIMP-EAGA, were
successfully mobilizing private sector capital before the
1997 Asian financial crisis. With the current global and
regional economic climate, private capital inflows will
slow. Nevertheless, regional cooperation programs will
continue to look to the private sector for financing, as
well as for local knowledge of small- and medium-sized
enterprises.

The form of future ADB assistance will depend on
such factors as global and regional developments,
program maturity, strength of the private sector, and
capacity for mobilizing capital. In programs established
more recently, efforts will be directed toward improving
confidence among participating members, and ensuring
that the institutional basis for sustainable cooperation is
properly established. ADB assistance could also be
extended to develop new cooperation programs which
have a limited number of members and have come into
being as a result of greater confidence between countries.
Programs in Northeast Asia and several initiatives within
the GMS are in this category. In these, ADB's role as a
catalyst and honest broker is still critical.

ADB's new regional departments are East and Central Asia; Mekong; Pacific; South Asia; and Southeast Asia.

Trade as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) has increased from about 27% to more than 39% in developed
countries, and from 10% to 17% in developing countries in the last 10 years.

Foreign direct investment rose from about $192 billion to $610 billion in the past decade.

In promoting such regional cooperation arrangements, it is essential to ensure that these are compatible and consistent
with higher-level global agreements, such as those under the World Trade Organization, for example.

ADB financing for these projects is approximately $770 million for investment projects and $28 million for technical
assistance projects. The Greater Mekong Subregion Program has been successful in attracting cofinancing for regional
cooperation projects, particularly in the transport and energy sectors and, to a lesser extent, in the human resource
development and environment sectors.

The initiative includes Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang, People’s Republic of China [PRC]), the western-most
territory of the PRC bordering the Central Asian republics (CARs). While the development path it has followed in the past
decade differs from that of the CARs, it faces similar key regional factors, and thus has similar needs for economic
cooperation.

The First Ministerial Conference on Central Asian Economic Cooperation (CAREC), held at ADB headquarters on

25-26 March 2002, confirmed transport, energy and trade facilitation as the priority areas for economic cooperation, with
human resource development as an important aspect of all three. The delegates advocated a practical and results-oriented
approach to developing projects. Azerbaijan and Mongolia are now members of CAREC.

In 2001, the Tourism Working Group met in Kathmandu on 15-16 May; Environment Working Group in Thimpu on

between members of the group vastly increases the basis for cooperation.

28 09/04/02, 2:15 PM | |wo years ago, the Asian Development Bank

(ADB) rededicated itself to reducing poverty in

the Asian and Pacific region. Its strategy—

Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific:

The Poverty Reduction Strategy—approved in

1999, provided the direction for all new ADB
operations and activities. In 2001, ADB approved the
framework to support the implementation of the poverty
strategy—the Long-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF)
2001-2015 and the Medium-Term Strategy (MTS)
2001-2005.

In the 2 decades prior to adopting the strategy and
framework, Asia had experienced high, sustained
economic growth rates and lower population pressures,
which led to better living conditions and less poverty.
Between 1990 and 1998, the percentage of people in
Asia and the Pacific living below the dollar-a-day
poverty line fell from 29% to 24%. The sharpest reductions
were in the market economies (Hong Kong, China;
Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China) and the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), with the number of
people living on less than a dollar a day decreasing by
100 million in the PRC.

The advances, however, were not evenly
distributed. Many people continued to live in poverty

| | O30prior-3.p65 29

 

and several countries faced additional problems. For
example, rapid urbanization increased urban poverty. As
populations aged in Asia, protection of the elderly
became a new challenge. The transitional economies of
Central Asia were severely affected by the breakup of
the Soviet Union and their adjustment to becoming
market economies has not led to reduced poverty.
Many Pacific developing member countries (DMCs)
struggled also to transform their economies from
subsistence to market-based economies and, as in the
Central Asian republics, the reduction in poverty has
not been significant.

The impact of the financial and political crises in Asia
and the Pacific much more severely affected the poor than
those above the poverty line. The 1997 Asian financial
crisis revealed the extreme volatility of capital and the
consequent vulnerability of a large portion of the region's
population. In Indonesia, for example, the incidence of
poverty decreased continuously from 1980 to 1996, from
28.6% to 11.3%. But in 1998, the incidence of poverty
increased to 24.2%, back to the levels of the 1980s.
Between 1996 and 1998, the number of poor people in
Indonesia increased by 27 million. In Thailand, the 1997
crisis sent 1 million people back into poverty. This was the
climate in which ADB sharpened its focus on poverty.

To implement its Poverty Reduction Strategy, ADB

hired new staff, trained existing staff,
reclassified lending, strengthened
operations, and began work on
reorganizing itself. Detailed poverty
analyses were conducted in nearly all
DMCs, the majority of the high-level
forums on poverty were completed in
Asia, 8 DMC partnership agreements
on poverty reduction were signed,
and 13 more were prepared. Projects
are now designed to either accelerate
pro-poor growth or to focus directly
on reducing poverty. A Presidential
Committee, chaired by ADB’s President,
monitors these interventions.

Long-term strategic
framework

The LTSF, approved in 2001, responds
to the development challenges in the
Asian and Pacific region, including
the need for investments in
infrastructure and growth-promoting
activities for ensuring sustainable
economic growth, inclusive social
development, and good governance;
policy reforms; and institution and
capacity building. The LTSF also
addresses the International Development Goals and the more recently
endorsed Millennium Development
Goals.
The LTSF addresses three core
strategic areas:

Assessing Poverty

Collaboration in the Pacific

Poverty assessment for all Pacific developing member countries (DMCs),
conducted by ADB in 2001, built on existing databases and further identified
preliminary country-specific poverty reduction strategies. Essential to the
process is government commitment to examining poverty in this
multidimensional context. Civil society participation and stakeholder
consultations on poverty as well as the collaboration of funding agencies
continue to be critical in conducting regional poverty assessment.

In Papua New Guinea, ADB is collaborating with the Australian Agency
for International Development, United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), and World Bank in conducting poverty analyses for socioeconomic
development strategies. Participatory assessment is occurring at the
national and community levels.

In East Timor, ADB is collaborating with the United Nations Transitional
Administration in East Timor, UNDP, and World Bank in conducting a
comprehensive poverty assessment to develop the country’s socioeconomic
development strategies. In 2001, a village-level survey was completed, and
the household survey and participatory poverty assessment were begun.

Participation in India
ADB started its participatory poverty assessment (PPA) in three states in
India—Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh—in 2001 with technical
assistance administered by the India Resident Mission’s staff. ADB worked
closely with other funding agencies to develop synergies in the process.
Stakeholder consultations involving state governments and nongovernment
organizations ensured ownership and provided feedback for determining
the themes for India’s PPA. The PPA covers urban and rural areas and includes
the socially, ecologically, and economically vulnerable groups in over
300 villages spread over 30 districts in the 3 states.

Field-level PPAs will be documented in a state poverty assessment report.
A quantitative study is being conducted simultaneously in the 3 states by
the National Institute of Rural Development to consolidate the results of
the PPA. The findings will be discussed at various stakeholder forums and
incorporated in future strategies for India. Based on the state governments’
response to the assessment, a fact-finding mission visited 4 more states
in 2001 to assess the possibility of extending the PPA.

10/04/02, 9:45 AMprocesses and procedures for
more effective participation in
decision making, which would
lead to equitable and inclusive
growth especially by civil
society, are also promoted.
Several operating principles—to
ensure selectivity at the country level
and to enhance the development
impact of ADB's support to its
DMCs—guide the implementation of
the LTSF. Among these are
ensuring country leadership and
ownership of the development
agenda, enhancing strategic alliances
and partnerships, and measuring the
impact of development.

Sustainable economic growth

Building and upgrading physical and
social infrastructure throughout the
region is a precondition for sustained
growth. Extensive unfulfilled demand
© exists across the region, ranging from
t the basic to the more sophisticated
infrastructure, services, and skills.
The region's investment needs are
substantial: physical infrastructure
alone is estimated at close to
$3 trillion over the next 15 years.
Although the role of private
capital and markets is expanding
rapidly, public investment in
providing physical infrastructure will
continue to be important. Many

sustaining growth and productivity and
for promoting human development.
Providing efficient social services to the
poor and women is essential.

The nature of the social
infrastructure and investment
required evolves in response to
changing demographics and
technology. For example, providing
basic education is a continuing
investment challenge in many
DMCs, especially when a large
proportion of the population is
young. On the other hand, providing
educational systems and curricula
that raise the levels of technical
knowledge and skills carries
different challenges as a result of
globalization, accelerating
industrialization, and rapidly
evolving information and communication technology (ICT).

To maximize the benefits of
growth, ADB focuses its resources
where the poverty impact is likely to
be greatest. Rural development
remains an important focus of ADB
support: the majority of the region’s
poor are likely to continue to reside
in rural areas over the next 15 years,
and agriculture and agro-industry
continue to be vital to the region's
growth. Rapid growth, along with
increasing population and rural-urban
migration, has resulted in extensive

| | O30prior-3.p65

areas of investment—all too often those where
poverty is most persistent—are perceived by private
investors as entailing high risks and low financial
returns, and thus do not attract private investment.
Because of fragile capital markets, ADB's role in helping
DMCs mitigate high sovereign risk and obtaining capital to
finance development will continue, as will its traditional
role of providing finance for public investment in
infrastructure. As the region's economies, capital
markets, and financial institutions and instruments
develop and diversify, ADB will increasingly act as a
catalyst in mobilizing private sector resources and
facilitating public-private partnerships for infrastructure.
Large investments will also be required in the
social infrastructure sector, particularly education,
health, housing, and water supply and sanitation.
Investments in education and health are needed for

31

urbanization and worsening congestion and pollution in
major cities. This, in turn, has led to deteriorating living
conditions and lower quality of life for many. ADB’s role
in providing urban infrastructure, especially to serve the
new urban poor and disadvantaged groups, will be a
priority over the next 15 years. Similarly, providing the
ICT to promote development and close the gap between
the information-rich and the information-poor is
becoming more important to ADB. More and better
access to information will allow the society's less
privileged and the region's less developed areas to gain
wider options and to play a greater role in determining
their future.

Inclusive social development

Growth that results in pervasive inequalities in income
and wealth is neither desirable nor sustainable.

 

10/04/02, 9:45 AM| O3Oprior-3.p65.

Equitable access to assets and opportunities and a stake
in the outcome are essential for ensuring growth that
leads to development and addresses poverty. Development,
in turn, must be inclusive. Its benefits must reach all
groups that make up the poor in the region—including

women, children, minority groups, the extremely poor in
rural areas, the growing numbers of urban poor, and
those vulnerable to being pushed below the poverty line.
An important dimension of inclusive development—and
a key area of ADB’s long-term focus—involves

Working Toward Development Goals'

Following the agreements and resolutions of various conferences organized
in the first half of the 1990s, world leaders identified the following broad
International Development Goals.

* — Reduce the incidence of extreme poverty by half between 1990 and 2015.
* Attain 100% primary school enrollment by 2015.

* Eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by

2005.

* Reduce infant and child mortality by two thirds between 1990 and
2015.7

* Reduce maternal mortality ratio? by three quarters between 1990 and
2015.

* Provide access for all to reproductive health services by 2015.

¢ Ensure that every country implements a national sustainable
development strategy by 2005, and reverses the loss of environmental
resources by 2015.

1 More recently, the International Development Goals were subsumed into a set of eight goals at
the Millennium Summit of the United Nations (UN). These goals, known as the Millennium
Development Goals, have the formal endorsement of the entire UN body.

2 Infant mortality rate is the annual number of deaths of children less than 1 year of age expressed
per 1,000 live births.

3 Maternal mortality ratio is the number of deaths per 100,000 births attributable to pregnancy,
childbearing, or puerperal complications, i.e., within 6 weeks following childbirth.

Infrastructure Development and Poverty Reduction

Poverty can be reduced substantially if the poor are provided opportunities
to participate in the nation's growth process. Building and upgrading basic
infrastructure facilities throughout the region is a prerequisite for private,
employment-generating investments, which provide the poor with access
to jobs, increased incomes, and the ability to participate in decision-making
and political processes.

Initial findings of a major research project—by ADB in collaboration
with the World Bank and the Department for International Development
of the United Kingdom, to assess impact of transport and energy
infrastructure on reducing poverty—indicate that roads are the single most
important sector investment in pursuing a rural poverty reduction program.
Rural roads and electrification infrastructure have significant effects on
the quality of life of the rural poor, as they increase employment
opportunities and contribute to economic and social progress at the local
and national levels. Community-based, income-generating activities such
as agro-processing activities, production of higher value crops, and local
small trades and industries are sustained, with a well-developed infrastructure network to link these activities to larger, new, as well as export markets.

Governance

Governance encompasses the
institutional arrangements through
which governments are chosen and
the authorities’ ability to form and
implement policies effectively. It also
encompasses the extent to which
constituents are able to voice their
opinions and influence decisions that
affect their lives. For example, the
local governments in Bangladesh, o
Nepal, and Pakistan are responsible
for planning and implementing
development projects, and for
resolving local disputes through
arbitration committees. Women have
only recently begun to participate in
local government in these countries,
and little has been done to prepare
them effectively for their roles in
government. An ADB regional
technical assistance aims to better
prepare women leaders for their roles
in local government and to promote
efficient and transparent public
service delivery. It also aims to
promote linkages between gender,
poverty reduction, and good
governance in local government, and
to identify regional gender and
governance issues in the context of
local government for policymakers.
An ADB-financed Governance Reform
Program in Nepal aims to make the
country’s civil service and public
sector organizations more results
oriented, more responsive to people’s
needs, and more gender balanced.
The Government's ability to lead the| | O30prior-3.p65

reform agenda will be developed. Expected outcomes
are improved civil service efficiency, reduced corruption,
and improved governance. In Papua New Guinea, a
Public Service Program is expected to support the
Government’s broader reform agenda. Policy reform
measures are planned in building a performanceoriented public service, reorienting personnel manage
enhance job creation through private sector development, and increase development effectiveness. These
operational priorities will be implemented selectively
at the country and subregional levels. Identifying the
needs and priorities of each DMC for addressing
poverty reduction and achieving the International
Development Goals will help determine the choices

ment systems and processes,
strengthening probity and oversight
agencies, and improving delivery of
major services. Basic services at the
national and provincial levels will be
improved. For more on governance,
see Supporting Law and Policy Reform
on page 38.

Medium-term strategy

The MTS 2001-2005 is the bridge
between the LTSF and ADB's
activities in its DMCs over the next
5 years. The MTS defines operational
priorities within the context of the
strategic agenda that directly address
the medium-term challenges for the
region. The MTS also identifies the
organizational changes and
requirements necessary for implementing ADB’s operational priorities
and operating principles with greater
efficiency. The MTS is designed to
enhance the development impact of
ADB assistance.

The MTS supports policy and
institutional strengthening of DMCs;
investments in several key areas
will be supplemented by this
support. These areas include
physical infrastructure necessary to
promote growth and increase
productivity in rural and urban
areas, and social infrastructure and
services for human development to
support pro-poor growth. Agriculture and natural resource management will be supported to promote
growth and environmental
sustainability. Financial infrastructure and systems will be strengthened—as will public and private
sector governance systems—to
support broad-based growth,

Energy Strategy in Kazakhstan Focuses on the Poor

Kazakhstan is rich in natural resources, but its power subsector needs
considerable rehabilitation and upgrading if the country is to improve the
efficiency of energy production and use. In 2001, ADB approved a $150,000
technical assistance grant to Kazakhstan to prepare an energy strategy
that will focus on increasing investment and expanding power supply to
the poor and to remote areas of the country. A further $95,000 grant from
the Government of Finland will be administered by ADB to support a study,
expected to produce a policy framework to improve reliability and efficiency,
determine priorities for rehabilitation and maintenance, and encourage
the development of renewable energy resources in remote areas not
currently served by the national power grid. The study will also identify
barriers to market-oriented development and recommend measures to
improve the environment.

Rapid Urbanization Addressed in ADB Projects in 2001

Mongolia has experienced rapid urbanization over the past 30 years, with
more than half the country’s population now living in urban areas. But
very little housing has been built in Mongolia, and many of the poor live
in informal urban settlements or ger housing areas. A lack of long-term
financing and an inadequate legal framework for property rights have kept
commercial banks from lending for housing. The major sources of housing
finance for low- and middle-income households have been their own savings
and family assets. In 2001, ADB approved a project that will have a catalytic
impact on improving the access of low- and middle-income households to
housing finance by increasing the capacity of participating commercial banks
and other financial intermediaries to respond to their housing finance needs.
The project will also generate construction-related employment
opportunities for the poor. In addition, the project will support the
Government's Housing Area Action Plan to improve low-income housing,
and households’ income-earning potential and access to basic infrastructure
and services.

Rapid urbanization in and around Bangkok and in some cities in the
northeast corridor of Thailand has also caused considerable environmental
and social problems. In 2001, ADB approved a technical assistance grant
to formulate a sustainable urbanization strategy; establish monitoring
systems at national and local levels; assist pilot urban centers in collaborative
planning; and identify and design priority urban projects for funding
considerations—all with the goal of providing sustainable urbanization and
reducing urban poverty.

that ADB makes in each country and for each
subregion.

ADB helps DMCs meet the medium-term challenges
by providing investments combined with technical
assistance support; economic, sector, and thematic
studies; and policy dialogue. ADB's unique strength as a

development financier is its knowledge of the region
and experience at the country and subregional levels.
ADB will strengthen this knowledge and use it to
supplement its investments by addressing critical
institutional constraints, and economic and sector
management issues; and improving policy and

Bridging the Digital Divide

ADB is committed to helping bridge the growing digital divide within and

across its developing member countries (DMCs). As noted in the Okinawa

Charter on Global Information Society,' ICT will help accelerate social and

economic development in the DMCs, improve governance through the free

flow of information and knowledge, and support the fight against poverty.
ADB's assistance for ICT development encourages regional cooperation

and networking to enhance local efforts in promoting private sector

participation in developing ICT capacity. ADB also encourages DMCs to

manage their own ICT strategies and activities to achieve their own

development agenda. ADB proposes to

* create an enabling environment by developing innovative sector policies;
strengthening public institutions; and developing ICT facilities, related
infrastructure, and networks;

* — build human resources to improve knowledge and skills and promote
ICT literacy, E-learning, and awareness programs; and

¢ develop ICT applications and information content for ADB-supported
projects/activities, such as governance and poverty reduction.

1 The Okinawa Charter on Global Information Society was agreed by Canada, European Union, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom, and United States at the G8 Kyushu-Okinawa Summit
Meeting on 22 July 2000.

Reducing Poverty through Education

Improving education services, particularly for women, disadvantaged groups,
and the poor, is a critical component of ADB’s operations. Projects that
provide primary education, basic skills education and training, teacher
training, and education system reforms benefit those who have been
underserved by education in the past by improving their literacy and
productivity, thus enhancing their potential income-earning capability.
Through loans, ADB supported policy reforms to ensure adequate resources
and financial sustainability and through technical assistance, improved the
planning capacity of education ministries. ADB focused on providing support
for education planning, particularly to improve secondary education, and
continuing learning for adults who had recently obtained literacy.
Education investments help eliminate poverty through skills development in rural areas, literacy training of rural adults, teacher training to
increase the number of qualified women teachers, and improving the level
of general academic skills taught in rural secondary schools. By linking
education and training closely with the occupational needs of poor communities, ADB helped narrow the gap between the supply and demand for
skilled labor, leading to greater employment opportunities for rural youth.

regulatory frameworks. ADB’s
financial support alone is not enough
to meet DMCs’ capital requirements;
but by packaging and supplementing
its loans appropriately, ADB can
address the critical constraints to the
region’s development over the medium
term and provide strong leverage for
the overall investment undertaken by
DMCs and external partners.

In selecting interventions, ADB is
guided by several operating principles
specified in the LTSF, including
ensuring country leadership and
ownership of the development
agenda, enhancing strategic alliances
and partnerships, and measuring the
impact of development. o

The country strategy and
program (CSP) for each DMC is the
mechanism by which ADB’s
strategic agenda is operationalized
at the country level. ADB will
develop a CSP for each DMC,
catering to the specific needs and
conditions of the DMC and reflecting
the operational priorities of the
MTS. The CSP for each country in a
subregion will also specify the
regional cooperation activities that
ADB will undertake at the subregional level. Based on these
activities, an ADB-wide regional
cooperation plan will be developed.

To implement the country and
regional programs effectively and to
ensure the desired impact of ADB
interventions in terms of its
strategic objectives, ADB needs to
select its interventions strategically
and align the organization to
increase efficiency. Several internal
changes must be undertaken in the
medium term to make ADB more
efficient and responsive to its client
needs. For more on these changes, see| | O30prior-3.p65

Social protection strategy

In September 2001, after 3 years of consultations with
governments and nongovernment organizations (NGOs)
in the Asian and Pacific region and with other
international organizations, ADB approved its Social
Protection Strategy—another key weapon in the

battle to halve poverty in Asia and the Pacific by 2015.
The strategy is aimed to help the region's most
vulnerable groups.

Half of the world’s population—3.2 billion people—
live in the Asian and Pacific region. Of these, 900 million
people are poor, representing 70% of the world’s poor;
about 60% of the region's total population live in rural
areas; and about 40% of the population are below 19
years of age.

The rural population remains highly vulnerable to

 

social protection has been largely neglected, or
addressed with inadequate tools and insufficient funds.
However, economic history shows that several economies
of the region—Hong Kong, China; Japan; Republic of
Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China—built development
policies through active public or public-private interventions in medical care, social and housing assistance,
minimum retirement levels, and education. Investing in
social protection was an essential part of the modernization programs of these wealthier societies at the early
stages of their development. Higher levels of social
security allowed high productivity gains in the workforce,
expanded domestic demand, and increased economic
growth. Lack of adequate social protection may severely
limit future economic growth. In children, malnutrition
and poverty damage health, cause death, harm
reproduction, reduce intelligence, and lower productivity
and opportunities for the future adults—a high tax on
future economic development. Social protection is an
economic need in the Asian and Pacific region.

risks and lacks access to social
security schemes. The same applies
to the youth. Additionally, the youth
often do not find jobs because of the
large number of entrants into the
labor market and insufficient
economic activity in the region. One
challenge for the region is to achieve
sustainable growth to absorb the poor
and these new entrants into the labor
market.

However, growth alone cannot
generate inclusive societies.
Populations, households, and
individuals face various risks that can
plunge them into poverty: natural
disasters, civil conflicts, economic
downturns, and household reversals,
such as crop failures, unemployment,
or illness can all threaten the future
of the household. Globalization can
help promote renewed opportunities
for growth but, at the same time, may
increase a country’s vulnerability to
external shocks. Globalization
requires the development of effective
social protection systems.

ADB's Social Protection Strategy
provides a strong rationale for
increased investments in the sector.
Welfare systems have not been a
priority for most Asian policymakers;

35

Defining Social Protection

Social protection refers to the set of policies and programs designed to

reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets,

diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to
protect themselves against hazards and interruption or loss of income.

Social protection consists of five major elements:

* — labor market policies and programs designed to facilitate employment,
ensure good working conditions including core labor standards, and
promote the efficient operation of labor markets;

* social insurance programs to cushion the risks associated with
unemployment, health, disability, work injury, and old age;

* — social assistance and welfare service programs for the most vulnerable
groups;

* micro- and area-based schemes to address vulnerability at the
community level, including microinsurance, agricultural insurance, and
social funds and programs to manage natural disasters; and

* child protection to ensure the healthy and productive development of
the future Asian workforce.

Social protection is an integral part of social development, one of the
three pillars of ADB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy. Social risk is a dynamic
concept—insecurity means exposure to risks of events that may worsen
vulnerability. The poor and persons near the poverty line are particularly
at risk since they have fewer assets, reserves, and other opportunities. While
the long-term solution to vulnerability depends on social and economic
development decisions that address the structural causes of vulnerability,
social protection offers various instruments to deal with the diversity of
risks. Considering these issues, ADB has developed a definition of social
protection based on labor markets and small-scale agriculture to help reduce
poverty in the Asian and Pacific region.

Improving Nutrition of Children
in Central Asia

lodine and iron are micronutrients essential for the normal development
of the body and brain. Millions of mothers and children in Asia lack these
micronutrients and are unaware of their importance. In the Central Asia
and Trans-Caucasus region, more than half the women of reproductive
age and children suffer from iodine deficiency or anemia. Anemic women
are more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth and iodine-deficient women
give birth to infants with diminished cognitive and motor skills. This
catastrophic loss of human potential can be averted with relatively small
amounts of investment. A few cents a year worth of iodine and iron is all
a person needs.

In 2001, ADB approved a $6.9 million special grant facility, financed
by ADB's Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to reverse the alarming increase
in physically and mentally retarded children in some developing member
countries. The grant will improve nutrition for poor mothers and children
in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and
Uzbekistan. ADB assistance will be used for a regional program to promote
the fortification of salt with potassium iodate and flour with an iron-based
premix. ADB's partners in the program include the United Nations Children’s
Fund and the Kazakh Academy of Nutrition. The project supports ADB's
goal of reducing poverty by raising intelligence, school achievement, adult
productivity and wages, and the health of mothers who can care properly
for their children. The project will also build public-private, government
after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.
The demand for rapid, short-term
social support projects will hopefully
not be necessary in the future.
Instead, ADB and its DMCs should
concentrate on developing more
comprehensive and effective social
protection systems to help countries
reduce poverty and vulnerability. In
addition, social protection measures
will be included, where feasible, in
ADB's regular projects and programs:
for instance, components to reduce
child labor could be added to
education projects. In its policy
dialogue, ADB will encourage
governments to improve social
protection systems and shift from
funding activities that benefit the
wealthy upper income groups or have
low benefit-cost ratios.

As exemplary practice, ADB will
comply with internationally
recognized core labor standards in
designing and formulating its

NGO, and intraregional partnerships.

ADB's new strategy identifies common issues to
be addressed in the region as well as individual
country needs—the region is too broad and diverse to
generalize. For instance, in Pakistan, where 50% of
the population are children and youth, the programs
will be very different from those in the PRC, after its
“one child policy.” ADB's strategy provides a menu of
options and possible social protection programs and
the criteria to prioritize them. Country initiatives will
be developed based on a country’s needs, available
resources, and institutions. Selected social protection
interventions should provide adequate coverage and
benefits, target vulnerable groups, and promote good
governance. Prioritized programs should be selected
in a transparent and participatory manner, through
institutions such as the National Commission for
Social Protection.

ADB, together with other development partners,
can finance these prioritized social protection programs.
Since 1985—when social protection projects made up
only about 1% of total ADB lending—the portfolio has
been expanding. In 1998-2000, it represented 13% of the
total ADB lending volume, a significant increase
resulting from the support to safety net interventions

projects. It will also take steps to

ensure that for ADB-financed

procurement of goods and services,
contractors, subcontractors, and consultants comply
with the country’s labor legislation (e.g., minimum
wages, safe working conditions, and social security
contributions) and core labor standards.

Supporting gender and development

In 2001, ADB continued to strengthen institutional
mechanisms for mainstreaming gender equity in ADB
projects and programs. Dialogue and cooperation
between ADB and civil society were improved.

An ADB-wide Gender and Development (GAD)
Action Plan was finalized, operationalizing ADB's
strategic objective and policy on GAD. An External
Forum on Gender consisting of experts on GAD and
women’s rights representing various disciplines and
perspectives held its first meeting in Manila. The Forum
will advise ADB on specific gender issues in Asia and
the Pacific and provide feedback on ADB activities
related to GAD.

Two gender sector checklists (Urban Development
and Housing, and Agriculture) were published to assist
and guide staff in mainstreaming gender in all ADB
assistance. New country-focused briefing papers on

10/04/02, 9:45 AM| | O30prior-3.p65

women were published for Bangladesh, Maldives,
Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.

The importance of the links between good
governance and GAD was reflected in several loan and
technical assistance projects approved in 2001, including
a regional technical assistance on Gender and
Governance Issues in Local Government in Bangladesh,
Nepal, and Pakistan. The technical assistance aims at
promoting and facilitating pro-poor governance through
capacity building of elected women officials in local
government. To ensure pro-poor and well-targeted
public policies, it also assists these governments in
formulating strategies to strengthen effective delivery of
public services and to promote accountability and
transparency at local levels.

In recent years, global attention on trafficking of
women and children has increased. The problem has
grown in intensity and expanded geographically with
increased poverty, globalization, war and political
conflicts, natural disasters, and improved regional
transport networks and communications systems. A
regional technical assistance on combating trafficking of
women and children in South Asia—including
Bangladesh, India, and Nepal—was implemented in
2001. This technical assistance supports, among other
things, the compilation of a database on key issues
related to trafficking of women and children, pull-push
factors leading to trafficking, and stakeholder mapping.
Support is also provided to DMCs to build their capacity
in combating trafficking of women and children.

For more on GAD, see http://www.adb.org/gender/.

Cooperating with nongovernment
organizations

ADB recognizes NGOs as significant players in the
development process, and cooperates with them to
improve the impact, sustainability, and quality of its
services.

In 2001, ADB approved the Task Force Report on
Institutional Arrangements for Cooperation with NGOs.
The report—prepared by a high-level committee appointed
by ADB President Tadao Chino—recommended several
actions, including the creation and staffing of a centralized
unit to coordinate ADB relations with civil society. This
unit—the NGO Center—began operations in February
2001. It interacts with humanitarian and relief agencies,
community-based organizations, advocacy NGOs,
mobilization networks, foundations, trade unions, and
other institutions; and coordinates a network of ADB staff
responsible for NGO issues in operational departments,
resident and regional missions, and representative offices.

37

ADB cooperates with NGOs along two parallel
streams: institutional cooperation on strategies and
themes, whereby ADB engages NGOs in continuous
consultation on crosscutting issues; and operational
cooperation whereby ADB includes NGOs as partners in
its operations at the country and project levels, and at
the conceptual, design, and implementation stages.

NGOs participated in 43 of 76 loan projects (57%) in
2001. More than half were social infrastructure, and
agriculture and natural resource projects. Most
participating NGOs were local and community-based
groups, able to enhance project quality by identifying
the specific needs of their community and encouraging
participation of direct beneficiaries. NGO involvement
in projects took place primarily in consultation
workshops and meetings, although NGOs also performed
technical tasks.

NGOs also played an important role in implementing technical assistance projects. As in the case
of loan projects, the social infrastructure and
agriculture and natural resource sectors accounted for
over half of the technical assistance projects involving
NGOs. ADB carried out 32 technical assistance
projects in 15 DMCs with NGO involvement. NGOs
were also involved in 9 regional technical assistance
projects in 2001.

During the year, ADB participated in several forums
involving NGOs. These workshops, conferences, and
consultation missions provided the opportunity to solicit
NGO views and raise NGOs’ awareness of ADB policies,
practices, and development objectives.

The NGO Center organized a series of topical
consultations at the 34'" Annual Meeting of ADB’s
Board of Governors in Honolulu in May 2001. Ninetytwo NGO representatives participated in the meeting.
In a private session with NGOs, President Chino
reaffirmed ADB's commitment to strengthening its
partnership with NGOs. He also accepted an invitation
to meet with antiglobalization protesters on the street
outside the conference center where the Annual
Meeting took place.

ADB was the leading sponsor of the International
Conference on NGO Poverty Reduction Policy, held
in October 2001 in Beijing. This event brought together
for the first time more than 200 representatives of local
and international NGOs, bilateral and multilateral
funding agencies, universities, and government
institutions. Participants discussed NGO experiences
with poverty reduction in the PRC over the past
2 decades, and the challenges confronting NGOs in
areas such as recruitment, training, fund-raising,
internal management, and capacity building.

 

10/04/02, 9:45 AM| O3Oprior-3.p65.

 

ADB recognizes that an essential ingredient in
strengthening its partnership with NGOs is good
communications, and took several steps to further
disseminate information and enhance two-way
communications with civil society. A centralized E-mail
account was created to receive general queries from
NGOs, and the NGO pages on ADB's web site were
redesigned and expanded. By the last quarter of 2001,
files on the NGO pages of ADB's web site were among
the most frequently accessed, reflecting high interest in
ADB's cooperation with NGOs.

In September, ADB published the first issue of
Partnership, an electronic news bulletin for NGOs. The
bimonthly publication provides NGOs with information
about policy developments, projects, conferences,
documentation, and educational and training opportunities in Asia and the Pacific. Partnership also cites the
latest ADB documents made available to the public. ADB
fulfilled over 200 requests from NGOs for documentation
under its Policy on Confidentiality and Disclosure of
Information and dispatched nearly 2,000 documents.

Among the NGO Center’s major endeavors was
setting up a database management system, “NGO Link,”
to centralize all NGO-related information within
ADB for staff use. This Intranet database aims to
promote information flows across the institution, raise

 

assistance projects with law and policy reform
components. In addition, stand-alone technical
assistance grants focusing on law and policy reform
have been provided for judicial reform; private sector
development, particularly for finance, banking, and
corporate governance; legal training; dissemination of
legal information; and environmental protection.

In 2001, ADB continued to pursue law and policy
reform as a means of reducing poverty and strengthening good governance with its first stand-alone loans for
judicial reform. Two policy loans to Pakistan amounting
to $330 million will bolster the Government's Access to
Justice Program, which will strengthen legal protection
for all, and is specifically designed to empower the poor
and other vulnerable groups. ADB's assistance also
includes a $20 million technical assistance loan to
translate the program’s legal and policy framework into
institutional and organizational arrangements.

Other activities in judicial reform in 2001 included a
regional judicial independence project and a technical
assistance to the Philippines to strengthen the
independence of the judiciary. The regional project will
improve awareness of the importance of judicial
independence and the means to achieve it in selected
DMCs; it will also include surveys on judicial independence and challenges in these DMCs and selected

staff awareness of NGO interests and
expertise, and improve coordination
in the interaction of ADB offices with
NGOs. For more on NGOs, see http://
www.adb.org/NGOs.

Crosscutting strategic
themes

Several crosscutting themes—law and
policy reform, promoting the role of
the private sector in development,
addressing environment sustainability,
and supporting regional cooperation—
broaden and deepen the impact of
ADB's core interventions.

Supporting law and policy
reform

Law and policy reform is at the heart
of good governance, supporting the
legal and institutional framework for
predictability, transparency,
accountability, and participation. Over
the years, ADB has provided
numerous loan and technical

38

Delivering Justice to the Poor in Pakistan

A new program—Access to Justice Program—will give greater meaning to
the rule of law in Pakistan. It will help the poor, support gender sensitization, and provide resources to reform policy and the judiciary.

The program will enable the poor to exercise their legal rights and
protect their property from being taken away by the bureaucratic or political
elite. Through a legal empowerment fund, the program will provide free
legal advice and advocacy for the poor by civil society, including lawyers
and nongovernment organizations, and promote awareness campaigns
about legal rights in the national language, Urdu. The program will promote
opportunities to encourage the appointment of women judges and provide training courses in gender sensitization for the judiciary and the police.

The program will also strengthen judicial independence by separating
the judiciary from the executive branch of government and ensuring
adequate funds for the judiciary to meet its mandate.

The program aims for an independent, accountable, transparent, and
professional police force that is free of political interference. It will help
establish a prosecution service and a police complaints authority, which
will both be independent. In addition, it will improve police-citizen relations and raise awareness of gender and human rights issues. Finally, by
helping create a legal and judicial system that can uphold the rule of law,
check bureaucratic excesses, and enforce contracts, the program will
contribute to an enabling environment for private sector-led growth.

developed countries, and a workshop and conference on
conceptual and practical aspects of judicial independence
(e.g., guidelines and methods for evaluating judicial
independence and compensation for judges and other
court staff). The technical assistance for the Philippine
judiciary will support its independence, accountability,
impartiality, and competence. A framework for the
judiciary’s fiscal and administrative autonomy will be
designed; the appointment process and the
accountability and incentive system, under which the
judges and justices function, will be improved; and the
capacity of the judicial training academy will be
strengthened.

ADB continued its support for good governance
and anticorruption in 2001 through a regional project
to counter money laundering. This project will help
DMCs establish a sound financial framework to avoid
becoming easy targets of money launderers. The
project will also strengthen regional cooperation in
collaboration with the Secretariat of the Asia-Pacific
Group on Money Laundering. The importance of
united efforts to fight money laundering became more
evident following the 11 September terrorist attacks
on the United States.

In promoting law and policy reform in the
financial sector, ADB continued to contribute to the
regional debate on issues of insolvency and secured
transactions law reform in Asia and the Pacific. ADB
assistance to the PRC, in connection with the country’s
entry into the World Trade Organization, includes
strengthening the legal capacity of key government
organizations and legal professionals—a hallmark of
ADB's law and policy reform activities. Also, ADB
financed training for government lawyers, judges, and
prosecutors in Bhutan, Cambodia, India, Indonesia,
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),
Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Tajikistan,
Thailand, and Viet Nam. For more on law reform, see
http://www.adb.org/law.

Promoting the role of the private sector
in development

The development of many Asian economies has been
driven to a large extent by private investment, both
domestic and foreign. However, the role of the private
sector in assisting DMCs remains limited. As governments face complex development choices and resource
constraints, private sector participation is needed to help
release scarce resources for public budgets. The private
sector, thus, has an increasingly vital role in development, directly and indirectly through public-private
partnerships, of physical and social infrastructure.

39

However, the private sector's contribution to development, particularly in infrastructure, has been hampered
by institutional shortcomings, weak corporate governance, unclear rules and regulations, and corruption—all
of which increase the costs and risks of doing business.

Having the capacity for both public and private
sector operations, ADB is uniquely positioned to broker
public and private sector linkages to support the
development process. These linkages allow ADB to
strengthen the capacity of DMCs to create an effective,
enabling environment for the private sector and to
encourage the development of innovative public-private
partnerships. ADB helps its DMCs design policies and
reforms that support socially responsible private sector
development and activities consistent with its pro-poor
agenda. ADB assists individual DMCs in strengthening
commercial, regulatory, and legal frameworks;
reforming taxation systems; supporting efficient and
competitive markets; and establishing environmental
and labor standards.

ADB also helps broker partnerships between the
public sector and private investors in DMCs, where such
partnerships allow risks and development costs to be
shared. Promoting such partnerships, particularly in
agriculture and other activities in the rural areas, where
the greatest concentration of poor people live, can
contribute to development and poverty reduction. ADB’s
activities will help finance the public investment portion
of such initiatives, assist in building the long-term
capacity of governments, design the partnerships, and
provide risk mitigation for private investors.

In implementing its LTSF, ADB will emphasize the
domestic private sector in DMCs. Strengthening
entrepreneurship of small- and medium-sized
enterprises and the informal sector—major sources of
employment and income contributors to a broader tax
base—can help reduce poverty.

Although private sector operations are currently a
small part of ADB's total portfolio, its private sector
investments are expected to increase in the years ahead,
partly as a result of the increasingly important
development role of the private sector in DMCs. To
support this role, ADB’s public and private sector
activities need to become more integrated. The
elements of the strategy to promote the development
role of the private sector will be tailored to the
particular needs of each DMC.

 

ADB’s strategy for private sector operations

In 2001, ADB approved a strategy to enhance the
impact of its private sector operations. The strategy
calls for focusing on private sector participation in

 

10/04/02, 9:45 AMImplementing the Private Sector Development Strategy

In 2001, ADB began implementing the Private Sector Development Strategy.
Progress was made in creating enabling environments, generating business
opportunities, and catalyzing private sector investment.

Private sector assessments were initiated in seven developing member
countries (DMCs). These assessments provide information necessary for
developing a country-specific private sector development strategy for
each DMC.

Monitoring and measuring progress in implementing the strategy were
initiated. Each DMC’s potential for private sector development was
considered, and the private sector potential in various public sector projects
assessed. A matrix for measuring private sector development potential in
ADB operations was introduced, and the creation of a scorecard for
monitoring private sector activity in public sector projects began.

Best practices in private sector development were disseminated through
a series of seminars and workshops, and through publication of the
five-volume Developing Best Practices for Promoting Private Sector
Investment in Infrastructure. A series of workshops enhanced ADB-wide
networking and helped disseminate sector-specific private sector
development initiatives in public sector operations.

An education and awareness program for ADB staff on private sector
development was initiated. ADB also established a Management steering
committee to oversee and monitor implementation.

Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility

ADB joined the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) in 2001
to promote private sector participation in infrastructure in line with its
Private Sector Development Strategy. The PPIAF is a multiple-donor technical
assistance facility, established in July 1999, to help eliminate poverty and
achieve sustainable development by facilitating private sector involvement
in infrastructure and delivery of basic services. It finances studies and
activities that promote private sector involvement in infrastructure. Two
ADB initiatives were approved by the PPIAF in 2001: Indonesia—Pekanbaru
Water Regulatory Study ($75,000) and regional—Framework for Financing
Merchant Power Plants in Asia ($450,000). ADB's membership in the PPIAF
demonstrates its commitment to promote the private sector as an engine
of growth for the economies of its developing member countries.

funds that can mobilize resources to
finance infrastructure, and smalland medium-sized enterprises. ADB
will gradually extend its reach to
new sectors, such as education and
health care, selectively and on a
pilot basis initially.

ADB's prudential limit for private
sector risk was raised from $50 million
to $75 million per project, but still
subject to a maximum of 25% of
project cost. This will enhance ADB's
capacity to catalyze investments in
larger infrastructure projects that the
region will need as economic
recovery proceeds. To ensure that
commercial lenders and investors are
not crowded out, ADB will also aim
to make use of its political risk
guarantees and partial credit
guarantees to attract long-term
lenders such as banks, pension funds,
and insurance companies.

Under the strategy, alliances o
with other international financial
institutions will be intensified to
facilitate knowledge and risk sharing
to make challenging projects
bankable. Joint support also signals
greater confidence in the DMCs'
investment environment and paves
the way for further private capital
flows.

ADB's private sector operations
deliver development impacts, catalyze
funding from other sources eight to
nine times its own commitment,
create employment, and promote
governance and environmental
protection. While ADB's support is
diversified in private enterprises in
developing and emerging markets,

infrastructure and capital markets, broadening country
and sector reach, increasing financing limits, expanding
the use of credit enhancement instruments such as
guarantees, and forging strategic alliances with other
development agencies.

Under the strategy, ADB is building on its existing
strength in infrastructure development, particularly
energy, water, telecommunications, and transport
projects. In capital markets, the emphasis is on
investments in key market institutions and investment

the comparative performance of its private sector
portfolio, benchmarked against other institutions and
investment funds, has been satisfactory.

Such performance has generally mirrored the trends
in the Asian markets, particularly the downturns over
the last 5 years since 1997. The majority of private
sector loans are being fully serviced in terms of interest
payments and principal repayments. ADB exits from
equity investments where it is evaluated that ADB’s
developmental role has been played out. Cumulative net

Private Sector Operations: Pioneering Projects in the Social Sectors

ADB's new strategic directions led to project initiatives
in its private sector operations in 2001. For example, two
pilot projects in the social sectors were supported in
Viet Nam—one in health care and another in education.

The first pilot project is the Franco-Vietnamese
Hospital (Far East Medical Vietnam Ltd.), promoted by a
group of French doctors and investors. The hospital will
provide state-of-the-art facilities in tertiary health care.
Improved health care in Viet Nam can lead to substantial
economic gains in terms of improved productivity. In
addition, quality medical facilities can help induce further
private investment. The project will also transfer medical
technology and expertise.

The second pilot project, the RMIT (Royal Melbourne
Institute of Technology) International University, will be
the first international standard university in the country,
providing a model for the standards of higher education
and training. Sponsored by RMIT, the project will bring
into Viet Nam expertise in vocational and higher education
that will have a positive impact on education in local
universities and will help enhance tertiary education in
information technology, engineering, and business
administration.

These projects could demonstrate that commercially
viable, social infrastructure projects can be undertaken
by the private sector. To ensure project sustainability, the
pricing of services must generate sufficient revenues for
self-sustenance and cost recovery. The indirect impact of
these projects on the economy as a whole is substantial:
private sector involvement frees public sector fiscal
resources for the underserved population; private sector
providers can also promote efficiency by increasing
competition and strengthening accountability; and the
private sector can introduce expertise and technology in
the developing member country with a positive impact
on social infrastructure.

Investing in capital markets

ADB also helped launch two new vehicles: a private equity
fund in Thailand and a new housing bank in Sri Lanka.

ADB agreed to invest up to $25 million in the Lombard
Thailand Intermediate Fund, LLC, a private equity fund
that will assist Thai private companies recovering from
the 1997 Asian financial crisis to restructure, expand, and

realized gains from divestments and dividends receipts
have reached $150 million as of December 2001.

Like other financial institutions, ADB has its share
of nonperforming assets in private sector lending and
equity investment operations. These are mostly of earlier

generate jobs. This will raise investor confidence in
Thailand and generate reasonable risk-adjusted returns.
The fund manager will also focus on establishing and
introducing best corporate governance practices.

The funds will be channelled through an onshore
fund, Thailand Equity Fund, which will then invest directly
in Thai enterprises and provide debt and debt-linked
instruments such as convertible bonds, preferred shares,
and subordinated debt. The onshore fund will identify
priority sectors and industries, particularly those that have
strong growth prospects and those that need to be
restructured. The fund will have a diversified portfolio
that helps improve corporate performance and supports
the recovery of Thailand’s industry and services sectors.

Apart from ADB, the investors include the California
Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) through
Lombard Pacific Partners Il, L.P.; and the International
Finance Corporation (IFC). The participation of CalPERS,
regarded as a champion of corporate governance, is
consistent with ADB’s capital markets strategy to coinvest
with institutional investors.

ADB also approved an equity investment of
$360,000 in the National Development Bank (NDB)
Housing Bank Limited, a new market-based financial
institution in Sri Lanka. Investment in this type of
private sector institution brings a range of benefits.
The NDB Housing Bank will help alleviate housing
constraints and will contribute to capital market
development in Sri Lanka.

The NDB Housing Bank Limited is the first private
sector housing bank investment in Sri Lanka. The main
sponsor is NDB, which receives technical assistance and
equity support from the leading housing finance
institution in neighboring India—the Housing Development Finance Corporation—the pioneer and market
leader in housing finance in India. Further investment
support is being provided locally by the Employee
Provident Fund and Eagle Insurance, the IFC, and the
Netherlands Development Finance Company.

The NDB Housing Bank Limited will provide loans to
low- and medium-income borrowers, initially in the
Colombo region. It will diversify and cover most of
Sri Lanka, providing loan products designed to meet the
funding needs of low- and medium-income home owners.

discontinued investments in manufacturing and industry.

The proactive rehabilitation and restructuring of
impaired assets have averted further deterioration of
asset quality. The impaired accounts have remained
stable over the past 5 years, hovering around

10/04/02, 9:45 AM| O3Oprior-3.p65.

 

12-13 accounts out of a portfolio of
around 100 active investments. In
addition to specific provisions for
impaired assets, ADB's conservative
8% general provisioning policy for the
balance of the private sector portfolio
ensures a sufficient loss reserve
cover, currently at 20% of the
outstanding portfolio.

ADB promotes a risk management culture in its private sector
operations, monitors early warning
signals closely, and reports to the
Board of Directors quarterly, in detail.
ADB is committed to learning lessons
to improve the assessment of
development impacts, remove
impediments to private sector
investment in DMCs, and identify
further needs for regulation and
capacity building. ADB aims to apply
these lessons from impaired and
nonperforming projects.

Addressing environmental
sustainability

Asia's remarkable growth was
accompanied by resource depletion
and environmental degradation. Air
and water pollution, water scarcity,
desertification, and the depletion of
natural resources are beginning to
affect agricultural productivity,
causing increasingly frequent
disasters, such as floods and
landslides; and impairing the quality
of life in the region. As the
population grows, demands on the
environment and the natural
resource base increase. The
challenge for development planners
and institutions in the region is not
only to preserve and protect the
environment, but also to reverse
environmental degradation while
maintaining robust economic
growth. Recognizing that environ
mental sustainability is essential for development and
poverty reduction in the region's resource-based
economies, ADB addresses the social and environmental
aspects of development. In 2001, ADB provided
resources, shared knowledge, developed capacity, and

Linking Environmental Protection to Poverty Reduction

Protecting the environment and managing natural resources, on which
most of the poor depend for their livelihood, help reduce poverty. In 2001,
ADB financed several projects in line with this thrust.

A project in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) will control acid rain
and air pollution in Anhui Province, thereby reducing adverse health impacts,
improving agricultural productivity, and protecting the environment. These
improvements will be achieved through an action plan to reduce sulfur
dioxide and other acid rain-causing gas emissions, investment support for
cleaner production subprojects, and strengthened institutions for
environmental monitoring and enforcement, including human resource
development. A second project in the PRC will improve the environment
and enhance protection of the poor against flood hazards. The project will
reduce flooding and damage in the lower Yellow River by providing sound
river management and flood protection.

A project in the Cook Islands will facilitate the adoption of sustainable
and appropriate solid waste management practices in Rarotonga and
Aitutaki. Aside from safeguarding public health and the environment, the
project will also support private sector participation and increase public
awareness.

A project in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will improve
environmental and social safeguards in the energy and transport sectors
by strengthening the associated national policy and regulatory framework;
enhancing implementation capacity at sectoral and provincial levels;
improving compliance and enforcement; promoting river basin management
as a planning framework for hydropower and roads; and establishing an
environment fund.

A project in Tajikistan will help restore the irrigation and household
water supply systems damaged by the 2001 earthquake.

Building New Partnerships for the Environment

On 26 September 2001, ADB signed a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), a conservation
organization with a growing involvement in the Asian and Pacific region.
Under the MOU, the two agencies formed a partnership for sustainable
management of natural resources in the region. ADB and WWF will develop
collaborative ventures to address poverty and environmental challenges.
Stakeholders such as local communities, government agencies, and
nongovernment organizations will be involved in this process through
forums and stakeholder consultations. To be reviewed annually, the MOU
will also include information sharing, knowledge management, and capacity
building by transferring skills and tools to target groups and exchanging
staff and documentation between the two organizations.

forged partnerships with the public and private
sectors, including NGOs and civil society.

Progress was made in mainstreaming the
environment within ADB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
by institutionalizing new requirements in ADB’s

Protecting Ecosystems and Livelihoods

India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have extensive coastal and marine
ecosystems that have acquired regional and global significance because of
their diversity as vital habitats for a wide range of marine and coastal fauna
and flora. Unfortunately, a fast-growing human population, combined with
inadequate infrastructure and management capacity, is placing heavy
pressure on South Asia’s coastal and marine resource base. These coastal
areas provide the sole source of subsistence and livelihood for millions of
people, most living below the poverty line. Environmental mismanagement
has caused severe pollution, depleting the coastal waters of aquatic life
to the extent of eliminating some species and depriving the poor of their
only source of income—fishing in the coastal waters.

In 2001, ADB approved a technical assistance grant of $600,000 to
promote coastal and marine resource management and poverty reduction
in South Asia. Implemented with the global environment NGO, World
Conservation Union (IUCN), and cofinanced from the Japan Special Fund,
the project aims to promote regional cooperation among the participating
countries to strengthen management of environmentally sensitive coastal
and marine resources. A regional strategic plan will be prepared, which
will include recommendations for information exchange, database
development and management, and capacity building.

At the national level, the plan will identify areas of the highest
environmental and ecological significance and sensitivity; and analyze and
address barriers to collaborative approaches to integrated coastal zone
management. The plan will propose a strategy that applies integrated coastal
zone management in the identified areas; and estimate the required financial
and human resources, and other needs to implement the strategy with
suggestions for possible institutional arrangements. Poor coastal
communities will participate in implementing pilot projects aimed at testing
for achieving integrated coastal zone management approaches.

Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency,
and Climate Change Initiatives

ADB's program of assistance to its developing member countries (DMCs)
for promoting initiatives related to renewable energy, energy efficiency,
greenhouse gas abatement, and adaptation to climate change was
strengthened in 2001 with support from the governments of Canada,
Denmark, and The Netherlands. The Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency,
and Climate Change (REACH) program, cofinanced by The Netherlands
($4.5 million) and ADB ($0.5 million) on a grant basis, will strengthen
participating DMCs’ capacities to access financial resources and
technology transfers to mitigate emissions of greenhouse gases and to
achieve sustainable development in their own economies. The Canadian
Cooperation Fund on Climate Change ($3.2 million) focuses on reducing
greenhouse gases in the People’s Republic of China and India, carbon
sequestration in Indonesia, and adapting to climate change in the Pacific
DMCs. The Danish Cooperation Fund ($3 million) focuses on promoting
renewable energy and energy efficiency for development of rural areas
and small towns in DMCs.

business processes. For example,
when preparing a poverty analysis—
a major input in preparing the
country strategy and program—new
environmental considerations need
to be taken into account. These
include analysis of the geographic
and environmental characteristics,
details on areas with high poverty
incidence, the state of the natural
resource base, the presence of
environmental threats to the poor,
or conflicts between the needs of
the poor and environmental
concerns. Thus, poverty analysis
facilitates the determination of
priorities and the sequence of
environmental interventions with
the greatest impact on poverty.

In 2001, ADB provided
resources for five loan projects,
totaling $323 million, designed to
alleviate the plight of the poor, and
protect and conserve environmental
resources. These projects were
identified based on ADB's new loan
classification system, designed to
assist in monitoring performance
against the poverty target and to
enable it to track its lending in
support of thematic priorities.

Two new ADB-Global Environment Facility (GEF) proposals entered
the formal GEF pipeline in 2001: the
Biodiversity Conservation and
Sustainable Livelihoods in the Indian
Sundarbans Project, and the GEF-PRC
Strategic Partnership for Land
Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems.
A GEF grant of $6.4 million to
cofinance the Efficient Utilization of
Agricultural Wastes Project in the PRC
was approved by the GEF Council in
2001. The project promotes the
reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions by expanding the use of
small- and medium-scale biomassbased renewable energy technologies
(BIORETS) in rural agricultural areas.
This replaces the use of coal, straw,
and firewood for household fuel and
reduces open field burning of crop

10/04/02, 9:45 AMresidues. Once completed, the project will reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by about 78,338 tons annually and
will lead to further expansion and adoption of similar
BIORETS in other PRC provinces.

Technical assistance activities were undertaken in
2001 to build DMCs’ capacity for sound environmental
planning and management, covering urban, coastal,
and marine ecosystems, and strengthening environmental
and social management in their operations. Similarly,
some DMCs will receive help in implementing the
Kyoto Protocol and in evaluating national and
subregional achievements in preparation for the 2002
World Summit on Sustainable Development in South
Africa. Others will receive help in integrating cleaner
production technologies into their industrial
development policies.

ADB supports projects with direct benefits to the
environment, and ensures that its projects and programs
are environmentally sound. In this regard, the impacts
of loan projects and programs are reviewed to ensure
that environmental risks, especially to the poor, are
minimized. For environmentally sensitive projects, public
consultation starting from the early stage of project

@ processing is undertaken, and ADB requirements
concerning disclosure are satisfied. Compliance with
these environmental safeguards is monitored and
ensured through field visits during project implementation. To mainstream environmental considerations
into ADB operations, work on the Environmental
Assessment Guidelines continued. Moreover,
preparation of an environment policy was pursued in
2001, along with broad-based public consultations

that covered
more than 20
countries within
and outside the
Asian and
Pacific region.

Environmental strategic
partnerships were
further enhanced
in 2001. The
public and private sectors, development agencies, NGOs,
and civil societies participated in conferences, interagency
consultations, and senior-level meetings in regional,
subregional, and international forums that addressed
common and emerging environmental issues. Environmental awareness of ADB staff and DMC officials was further
enhanced through workshops, seminars, and publications
dealing with emerging environmental issues.

ADB supports projects
with direct benefits to
the environment, and
ensures that its projects
and programs are environmentally sound.

Supporting regional cooperation

ADB's support for regional cooperation involves three
related dimensions: facilitating the economic development of participating countries through cooperation and o
integration; providing key regional public goods that
address shared constraints and opportunities; and
encouraging—through processes associated with broader
and deeper cooperation—regional stability, which is
necessary for developing the region.

ADB supports several broad-based regional
economic cooperation initiatives, discussed in more
depth in the special theme chapter on page 14.

10/04/02, 9:45 AMn 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) took

pioneering and well-balanced steps to address

the needs of its developing member countries

(DMCs). ADB established the Japan Fund for

Information and Communication Technology to

bridge the growing digital divide in the Asian
and Pacific region. In its private sector operations,
ADB approved its first two loan projects in the social
sectors for education and health care. Also in 2001,
ADB continued to emphasize good governance and
transparency in portfolio management and project
implementation.

Lending

Lending for both public and private sector operations
in 2001 amounted to $5,339 million for 76 loans in
60 projects, compared with $5,653 million for 88 loans
in 74 projects in 2000. The average loan size in 2001
was $70 million.

Of the total lending, loans with government
guarantee were over $5,301 million for 57 projects,
comprising $3,940 million for 26 loans from ordinary

© capital resources (OCR) and $1,362 million for

T 46 loans from the concessional Asian Development

Fund (ADF). Lending to the private sector without
government guarantee amounted to $37.5 million for
four loans in three projects. The transport and
communications sector received the largest share of
loans, $1,426 million or 26.7% of total lending in
2001, followed by multisector, others, energy,
agriculture and natural resources, social infrastructure, and industry and nonfuel minerals. Environment
and governance projects are included in the current
classification “others.” For details, see Tables 1-6 and
9-13 in the Statistical Annex. For more on lending, see

Technical assistance

In 2001, ADB approved 257 technical assistance grants
totaling $146.4 million. Project preparatory technical
assistance accounted for 64 projects amounting to
$40.4 million, while advisory and operational technical
assistance accounted for 142 projects amounting to
$76.1 million. The agriculture and natural resources
sector received the largest share of project-specific
technical assistance followed by social infrastructure and
finance. The remaining 51 projects, valued at $29.9 million, were for regional technical assistance. For details,
see Tables 24-28 in the Statistical Annex. For more on

and eight projects that received ADB loans during the
year also received grants totaling $69.8 million from
the governments of Australia, Denmark, The
Netherlands, United Kingdom, and the Global

Equity investments

In 2001, equity investments in private sector
operations were made in three projects amounting to
$30.4 million. The investments were made in a
housing bank, a regional fund in the Mekong region,
and a country equity fund. For details, see Table 10 in

Resource transfers

The net transfer of resources from ADB to its DMCs
increased from $3.7 million in 2000 to $464.3 million in
2001. During the year, net transfers to ADF borrowers
were $658.4 million ($782.1 million in 2000). Compared
with net inflows of $778.4 million in 2000, net inflows
to ADB from OCR borrowers decreased to $194.1 million.
For details, see Tables 29-30 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements in 2001 totaled $3.9 billion,
comprising 90% of the year's target of $4.3 billion. Of
the total, OCR disbursements were $2.8 billion or 74%
and ADF disbursements were $1.0 billion or 26%. For
2000 and 2001 disbursements by lending modality, see
Table 8 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan service payments reached $3.4 billion in 2001,
compared with $4.0 billion in 2000. The decrease was
mainly because of lower prepayments ($52.5 million in
2001, $693.4 million in 2000).

In 2001, the four largest net resource transfers from
ADB were to People’s Republic of China (PRC), Viet Nam,
Bangladesh, and Pakistan.

Cofinancing and
guarantee operations

In 2001, cofinancing for loan projects mobilized from all
sources amounted to $1.4 billion, equivalent to about
26% of ADB's total lending of $5.3 billion. For details,
see Table 7 in the Statistical Annex. Although this level of
cofinancing is significantly lower than the 2000 level of
nearly $3.0 billion, 2001 was the fifth consecutive year
in which cofinancing was arranged for more than 40%
of ADB projects. The decrease in the cofinancing
amount is mainly because of the slippage or cancellation of several large projects with cofinancing possibilities from both market and official sources; and the
global economic slowdown, which inevitably affected
Asia's economy and reduced the demand for large
physical infrastructure projects.

Twenty-five projects in 11 DMCs received
cofinancing in 2001. The PRC received the largest
amount, with about $867.0 million cofinancing (primarily
from its domestic financial institutions), followed by
India with $150.0 million, and Sri Lanka with $102.0
million.

During 1970-2001, 580 ADB-assisted loan projects
and programs received cofinancing in an aggregate
amount of $36.2 billion, consisting of $21.7 billion
from official sources, $9.2 billion from commercial
sources, and $5.3 billion from export credit sources.
The energy sector accounted for $15.3 billion or 42%,

10/04/02, 10:13 AMfollowed by transport and
communications ($8.2 billion or
23%), agriculture and natural
resources ($4.2 billion or 11%),
social infrastructure ($3.1 billion
or 8%), finance ($1.7 billion or
5%), and other sectors ($3.7 billion
or 11%).

Official cofinancing: Cofinancing from official sources for ADB
loan projects amounted to $425.2
million in 2001, a decrease of about
24% from the $557.9 million in
2000. Germany provided cofinancing of $185.0 million for four
projects, followed by France with
$45.4 million, and United Kingdom
with $38.0 million. The European
Investment Bank provided
cofinancing of $50.0 million for the
Guangxi Roads Development Project
in the PRC. Other major multilateral
cofinanciers were International
Finance Corporation, Nordic
Development Fund, and the OPEC
Fund for International Development.

Portfolio management

In 2001, under its Portfolio Management Action Plan,
ADB introduced an automated project rating system to
improve the consistency and timeliness, and reduce the
subjectivity of ratings. An “at risk” approach was
adopted in the rating system, combining an enhanced
project rating system with an early warning device for
flagging projects rated satisfactory or better but with
potential problems. In addition, the project performance
report was restructured and expanded to make it a more
useful project monitoring tool.

The Project Administration Instructions were revised
completely in 2001 to incorporate improvements in
business processes and changes in delegation of authority.
The revisions, which streamline project administration

 

activities, are expected to be adopted in 2002.
ADB continued to emphasize

works contractors, on which ADB will base a standard
prequalification document in 2002. The working group
also commenced work for preparing a similar master
document for civil works contracts.

To improve its effectiveness, ADB reviewed its
policies and procedures on selecting consulting firms.
To expedite processing and improve transparency, ADB
finalized a proposal to introduce the quality and costbased system (QCBS). The QCBS focuses on quality as
the primary selection criterion (80%), while considering
to a degree (20%) the cost of the services.

Project administration: A total of 76 new loans
(72 public and 4 private sector) were approved in 2001.
This brought the number of loans under administration to
552, comprising 501 loans in the public sector and 51 in
the private sector. Of the public sector loans, 399 were
rated satisfactory (including 6 highly satisfactory) in

terms of implementation progress and

good governance and transparency in
portfolio management and project
implementation in 2001, and pursued
timely submission of quality-driven
audited project accounts and agency
financial statements. Better
assessment and strengthened
financial management of executing
agencies at the early stage of project
processing remained important
features of ADB's drive toward better
governance and fiduciary safeguards
and controls in project implementation. Portfolio performance at the
country, sector, and project levels;
and sound financial management
procedures and practices in executing
agencies were increasingly factored
into ADB’s country programming and
project processing work.

ADB also continued to
collaborate with the Procurement
Cooperation Group of Multilateral
Development Banks (MDBs) and
International Financial Institutions to
develop master bidding documents
and master documents for consultant
recruitment. Based on the master
documents, ADB prepared four
related documents reflecting its
procedures and policies for the
procurement of goods. The working
group also prepared the master
document for prequalifying civil

objectives, while 79 loans were
rated partly satisfactory and

23 loans unsatisfactory.

Altogether, 690 project
administration missions, including
private sector loan and multiproject
reviews, were fielded to assess
project progress and discuss
problems; improve portfolio
performance; and strengthen the
linkages between country and sector
performance, including joint project
reviews with the World Bank and
other MDBs. A total of 9,352 persondays (or an average of 21.4 persondays per project) were spent
reviewing projects. Country portfolio
review missions were undertaken in
16 DMCs to discuss with senior
government officials implementation
problems, timely submission of
audited project accounts and audited
agency financial statements, crosssectoral issues, and remedial
measures. Special portfolio
restructuring for Indonesia was
undertaken; $101.8 million was
identified for loan cancellation.

ADB's regional and resident
missions continued to play an
important role in project implementation, in accordance with ADB's policy
on resident missions. Majoroperational functions such as country programming,
project processing, and portfolio management continued
to be delegated to the missions. By end-2001, administration of a total of 32 loans for 27 projects had been
delegated to the resident missions in Bangladesh,
Cambodia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and
Viet Nam; and the regional mission for the South Pacific
in Vanuatu. For more on the Resident Mission Policy, see
http://www.adb.org/documents/policies/resident_mission.

Eighty-three projects were completed during the
year. Sixty-one project completion reports were
circulated in 2001, bringing the total number of reports
prepared as of end-2001 to 989. For details, see Table 14
in the Statistical Annex.

Contract awards: Contracts totaling $2.6 billion
(excluding contracts for technical assistance projects)
were awarded in 2001 by executing agencies in DMCs
for engaging consulting services and procuring goods,
related services, and civil works. This represented a
24% decline from 2000, and 2001 contract awards fell
short of projections for several large borrowers:
Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam.
Consultancy contracts under loan projects totaled
$142.9 million and involved 344 consulting contracts
(113 international and 231 domestic). For details, see
Tables 15-23 in the Statistical Annex.

Loan disbursements: The 2001 loan disbursements
of $3.9 billion fell short of the $4.3 billion projected for
the year, and were slightly lower than the 2000 disbursements, mainly because of shortfalls in program loan
disbursements. For 2000 and 2001 disbursements by lending
modality, see Table 8 in the Statistical Annex.

Project implementation and administration
seminars: ADB conducted a series of seminars in 2001
to help DMCs understand the changing environment in
which projects are implemented. Eight seminars focused
on improving project implementation and administration
in the DMCs; a total of 315 DMC representatives
participated in the 2-week sessions. Seven of the eight
were in-country seminars held in PRC, Indonesia, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Pakistan,
Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. One was a regional
seminar held at ADB headquarters. In addition, seven
seminars on the use of consultants, attended by about
300 participants, were held in Bangladesh, Cambodia, PRC,
India, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan. Also,
seminars on developing domestic consulting services
attended by about 250 participants were held in Cambodia,
PRC, India, Indonesia, and Viet Nam.

Business opportunities seminars: Fourteen
seminars on business opportunities were organized in
2001 in 10 countries: Austria; Belgium; Hong Kong,

| | 040perations-10.p65 49

 

China; Italy; Japan; Republic of Korea; Pakistan; Spain;
Turkey; and United States. Participants were provided
with an overview of business opportunities under ADBfinanced loans and technical assistance, given advice

on preparing bids and proposals in line with ADB
guidelines, and informed of the procedures for
evaluating bids and ranking consulting proposals. Overall,
more than 519 participants joined the presentations,
discussions, and one-on-one consultations. In addition,
several seminars were held at ADB headquarters for
visiting missions and delegations from various members.

Private sector operations portfolio

ADB's private sector portfolio has delivered developmental impacts, leveraged and catalyzed other sources
of funding, created employment, and continued to
promote governance and environmental protection. In
2001, the portfolio amounted to $1.2 billion. This consisted
of $718.7 million in loans (62% of the portfolio) and
$449.2 million in equity investments (38%).

Since ADB's first private sector investment in 1983,
cumulative approvals have totaled $2.0 billion, financing
148 projects and mobilizing $655.8 million of complementary financing loans. ADB’s involvement also
catalyzed $15.5 billion in additional financing,
leveraging ADB investments by a ratio of 7.7 times.

At the end of 2001, cumulative disbursements rose by
$67.3 million and reached $1.4 billion. Of the approvals,
$614 million or 31% has been repaid and divested.

For details, see Tables 9-13 in the Statistical Annex

and table below.

ADB's private sector operations continued to focus
on infrastructure and capital markets. In 2001, two
pioneering private sector projects were approved in
social infrastructure—one in health care and another in
education. Infrastructure projects in DMCs account for
46.3% ($539.3 million) of the private sector portfolio. In

companies, which provide equity and/or loans to
infrastructure projects, small and medium enterprises,
and financial institutions in DMCs.

The remaining 15.1% of the private sector portfolio,
or $176.5 million, was made in the mid-1980s when
ADB supported several DMC governments that
encouraged the private sector to invest in large
agricultural and industrial ventures.

At the end of 2001, there were 99 projects under
administration, net of repayments, cancellations, and
divestments. Of the total number of projects, 18 are in
regional financial entities and funds. Operationally,

71 companies were demonstrating strong financial
performance, 4 were performing marginally, and 24 were
underperforming. Risk management vigilance continued
in 2001. This included an active effort to rehabilitate,
restructure, or exit impaired assets.

Interest and other income earned on the private
sector portfolio in 2000 and 2001 were at the same level
at $31.1 million. Dividend income rose from $11.4 million (4.3% yield) in 2000 to $13.2 million (4.9% yield) in
2001. On a cumulative basis, dividends to date
amounted to $80.1 million. In addition, cumulative net
realized gains totaled $69.4 million.

Provision for possible losses on impaired assets
increased from $140.1 million in 2000 to $144.5 million
in 2001. The loss reserve was 21.1% of the total
outstanding portfolio at the end of 2001, compared with
20.6% in 2000. For more on private sector operations, see

Capacity building: In 2001, ADB jointly organized
a workshop with the International Finance Corporation
and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation on
environmental management for private sector fund
managers and finance professionals.

Performance evaluation and
development impact

The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) independently evaluates ADB's operations, including the
performance of completed projects, programs, and
technical assistance, and thematic studies in the form of
impact, special, and country assistance program
evaluations. The primary objectives of ADB's evaluation
activities are to provide resource accountability, cite
lessons learned for future operations, and identify
follow-up actions for sustaining the benefits of activities
supported by ADB. Operations evaluation activities were
strengthened in 2001: the Operations Evaluation Office
became a department with additional posts, under the
oversight of the Board of Directors’ Development
Effectiveness Committee.

During the year, OED completed 37 evaluation
reports; the main reports comprised 26 performance
audit reports and 6 special evaluation reports.

Project/program performance audit reports

In 2001, 17 projects and 5 programs were assessed in
21 reports, using the four-category rating system of
highly successful, successful, partly successful, and
unsuccessful. Of the 22 evaluated projects/programs in
2001, 3 (14%) were rated highly successful and 9 (41%)
successful. The remaining 10 (45%) projects/programs
were rated partly successful. None was rated unsuccessful.

Of the five performance audit reports for programs,
one was rated successful and four were rated partly
successful. The evaluations demonstrated that reforms
require longer periods, more policy dialogue, and
sustained commitment from governments. The
evaluations also underscored the need for detailed
sector studies and use of participatory approaches in
program design, and confirmed the importance of
realistic assessment of and systematic capacity building
for executing agencies.

Of the 17 projects, including 4 using the sector loan
modality, 3 (18%) were considered highly successful,
8 (47%) successful, and 6 (35%) partly successful. Of the
seven physical infrastructure projects, three were found
to be highly successful. Of the social sector projects,
four targeting underserved areas and lower-income
communities were rated successful. Five other

10/04/02, 10:13 AMagriculture and social sector projects
and one multisector project were
rated partly successful.

Two of the three projects
evaluated in Group A DMCs (see box
on Classification of ADB’s Developing
Members) were rated highly
successful; two road projects in the
Lao PDR improved a vital road
section from the national capital to
the northern provinces, strengthening
national integration and generating
substantial benefits to the economy.
Of the 14 projects in Groups B1 and
B2 DMCs, 6 were rated successful
and the rest partly successful. Of the
five projects in Group C countries,
one was rated highly successful and
three successful. The highly
successful Second Erawan Gas Project
in Thailand highlighted two factors
critical to the success of a project: a
high degree of ownership by the
Government and the executing agency,
and strong institutional capability of the
implementing agencies.

Lessons from these evaluations
are relevant to future ADB operations.
For example, the Dhaka Urban
Infrastructure Improvement Project in

Classification of ADB's Developing Members

A revised classification system for ADB’s DMCs, approved by the Board of
Directors in December 1998, took effect on 1 January 1999. Two criteria—
per capita gross national product and debt repayment capacity—are used
to determine the classification of borrowing developing members into
Groups A, B1, B2, and C.' The system determines the degree of eligibility
to borrow from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), applicable ceiling on
ADB project financing, and minimum share of government contribution to
technical assistance costs.

Group A (ADF only) includes Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati,
Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia,
Myanmar, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

Group B1 (ADF with limited amounts of ordinary capital resources [OCR])
includes Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cook Islands,” Marshall Islands, Federated
States of Micronesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tonga, and Viet Nam.

Group B2 (OCR with limited amounts of ADF) includes People’s Republic
of China, India, Indonesia,? Nauru, and Papua New Guinea.

Group C (OCR only) includes Fiji Islands, Kazakhstan, Malaysia,
Philippines, Thailand, and Uzbekistan.

In addition, the criteria for graduation from regular ADB assistance
were established. Four members—Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea;
Singapore; and Taipei, China—have graduated from regular ADB assistance.

For details on ADB's graduation policy for DMCs, see http://
www.adb.org/documents/policies/graduation.

2. Limited eligibility for OCR will be applied only after the external debt position improves.
3 On a watch list for graduation from the ADF.

Bangladesh, rated partly successful, showed that
community participation is a critical factor in ensuring
proper operation and maintenance of project facilities,
and the sustained delivery of services. The Heilongjiang
Expressway Project in the PRC, which was rated
successful, highlighted the need for a rigorous review of
technical features at appraisal and during implementation to improve design, for example, for safety.

Technical assistance performance
audit reports

Five performance audit reports of technical assistance
clusters were prepared in 2001. Twenty-five technical
assistance activities were evaluated; 2 were rated highly
successful, 11 successful, 7 partly successful, and

5 unsuccessful.

In Cambodia, two technical assistance grants
supported a detailed survey of transport needs and
provided formal training to the Planning Department of
the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. In Viet Nam,
a technical assistance grant helped formulate a Road

| | 040perations-10.p65 51

Act. The evaluation highlighted two main issues: a
heavy reliance on external funding for road maintenance; and the higher remuneration packages offered to
project management units that attracted qualified
personnel away from regular activities. One of the
technical assistance in Cambodia was highly successful,
and the other partly successful. The technical assistance
in Viet Nam was rated partly successful.

OED evaluated two technical assistance projects in
the social sectors of two DMCs. One helped generate
social survey data for formulating social sector reforms
in Viet Nam. The other introduced a cost resource
allocation method for the budget allocation system for
health in Sri Lanka. Three main lessons emerged:
technical assistance focused on DMC priorities is more
likely to succeed; the use of technical assistance outputs
needs to be specified during design; and important
findings should be widely disseminated. Both technical
assistance were rated successful.

Six technical assistance grants designed to build
evaluation capability in Nepal, Philippines, and Sri Lanka
were evaluated. It was found that for evaluation

capacity to be built in DMCs, there must be a high
degree of government ownership, backed up by highlevel support and stable staffing; participation by all key
stakeholders in project performance management
systems; and creation of awareness among senior
decision makers during preparation. Weaknesses were
identified in implementation. The two technical
assistance to strengthen postevaluation capacity in
Nepal and the Philippines were rated partly successful;
that for Sri Lanka was rated highly successful. Three
technical assistance to strengthen each country’s project
performance management system were rated unsuccessful, partly successful, and successful.

and urban management. The first two technical
assistance approved in 1992-1993 were rated unsuccessful but the last four approved in 1995-1998 were rated

 

should include in their design mechanisms to
disseminate the results and findings to a wider
audience in the country.

Eight technical assistance, involving four Pacific
DMCs, focused on institutional strengthening and
capacity building for financial institutions. In the
Marshall Islands, the institutions involved failed to
sustain their small enterprise activities, and the Small
Business Development Corporation in Papua New
Guinea was closed soon after the technical assistance
was completed. These technical assistance were rated
unsuccessful. Technical assistance was provided for
institutional strengthening of other banking institutions
in the Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea. It was
found that implementation time was inadequate in the
first case, and a corporate plan for the rural development bank was not implemented in the second. Both
were rated partly successful. Technical assistance for

successful. The trend has been
toward successful outcomes in recent
years as ADB gained more experience
in the PRC and focused on areas in
urban development where it had a
comparative advantage, mainly water
supply and sanitation. Two of the
more recent technical assistance
helped formulate and implement
build-operate-transfer water supply
projects, and had a significant impact
in strengthening the relevant
institutions. An urban policy
workshop provided a venue for
dialogue between government
agencies, city administrations, and
ADB. Many of the recommendations
in the urban development plan for
Hohhot were considered by the
executing agency. Three lessons were
learned. First, ADB needs to be more
thorough in preparing technical
assistance projects in the urban
development sector. For example,
data availability needs to be
adequately assessed. Second, ADB
needs to ensure that sufficient
resources are allocated for meeting
the requirements of the terms of
reference, for the supervision of
technical assistance implementation,
and for translation services. Third,

Program Lending: A Lending Modality for Policy Reform

Program lending has been the main instrument through which ADB has
supported policy reforms in its developing member countries (DMCs). The
modality was used extensively in responding to the 1997 Asian financial
crisis. From 1987 until the end of 2001, 117 programs or program
components of sector development programs were approved with a combined loan amount of $16.1 billion, 22% of total ADB lending. Program
lending now involves a diverse range of countries, including Pacific DMCs
and newer members in Central Asia; program loans now support a broader
range of activities, including social infrastructure and public sector reforms,
in addition to the initial focus on the agriculture, financial, and industry
sectors. The special evaluation study assessed the role of program lending
in promoting policy reforms in the DMCs and identified generic measures
that could enhance its effectiveness.

The programs met their immediate targets. Total disbursements for
58 completed programs were only 9% below the approved loan amount.
Although ambitious—containing a large number of conditions within a
tight time frame—nearly all program conditions for 40 programs with
completion reports were met. However, tranche releases and program
completion were delayed; disbursements planned over an average of
15 months from loan effectiveness were actually completed within an
average of 24 and a maximum of 52 months. Most programs had been
designed with two tranches; 72% of second tranche releases were delayed
and 11% canceled altogether.

According to the performance reporting system and stakeholder
consultations in seven countries, program impacts did not always achieve their
potential. DMCs made significant progress in adopting more market-oriented
policies; however, the recurrence of conditionalities between loans and sectors indicated that reforms could not always be sustained. In several cases,
program conditions were enacted after program completion, indicating a
problem of process and timing. In other cases, program lending provided

10/04/02, 10:13 AMrehabilitating the Development Bank of Western Samoa,
strengthening government financial institutions in
Samoa, and preparing a strategic plan for the National
Bank of Vanuatu provided two main lessons:
government action to resolve known problems should
precede technical assistance, and technical assistance
should be designed with sufficient flexibility to permit
midcourse adjustments. These technical assistance
were rated successful.

Special evaluation studies

A special evaluation study examined the impact of
ADB's crisis support interventions in Indonesia, which
included five loans, totaling $2.8 billion, to augment
liquidity and budgetary resources; promote transparency
in financial sector governance; provide social protection
to the poor; and support important structural reforms
related to the crisis. Nonlending support included

(continued)

providing policy advisory technical assistance. The study
found that, although slow, the overall impact of the
crisis management interventions was evident in major
economic indicators. Nonlending support prior to or
with the crisis support loans was timely and useful, and
helped restore investor confidence. Four main lessons
were identified: crisis conditions require different
approaches, procedures, and instruments from noncrisis
operations; restoring investor confidence is the most
important objective of crisis assistance; crisis assistance
must be continuous and intensive both during the
preapproval and postapproval phases; and nonlending
support is an important part of crisis assistance.

A special evaluation study on gender and
development used a project case study approach to
examine factors influencing the incorporation of gender
considerations in ADB-financed projects. Cultural and
religious barriers, and indifference toward gender

objectives, are the most common
obstacles to addressing gender
effectively. Project design often fails
to recognize relevant gender issues

 

insufficient resources for capacity building during policy reform implemen- Nd effective targeting provisions;

tation. Greater assistance for capacity building is needed, especially in policy
analysis and implementation coordination. Stakeholder consultation and
commitment to the reforms, specialized skills in program implementation,
and a change in the focus of economic and sector work from outputs to
results, would also help in successful implementation.

Overall, program lending has had and will continue to have high
relevance to the needs of DMCs, and has been moderately effective in
supporting substantive legislative and policy changes. However, programs
have not always been based on achievable rates of change; stakeholder
participation in program formulation could be better; and analysis of the
incentive structure for effecting changed behaviors could be strengthened.

The study recommended specific actions for increasing the efficacy,
sustainability, and development impact of program lending:

* more options should be considered in program design, including
multiple and floating tranches, providing a justification in each case;

* government authorship of the reform package needs to be
complemented by participation of affected groups, and dissemination
of information relating to proposed policy changes and the costs of
not changing;

* counterpart funds should be used for building government capacity
for designing and implementing programs; and

¢ — further evaluation of programs, including selected reevaluation studies
and evaluation of selected programs during implementation, should
be done and guidelines for program evaluation updated.

This study has already been discussed by the Development Effectiveness
Committee and at an informal Board seminar, and the Board of Directors
continues to take an active interest in the objectives and design of this
important lending modality. For more details, see http://www.adb.org/
documents/policies/program_lending.

| | 040perations-10.p65 53

executing agencies often accord low
priority to social and gender
awareness training because they do
not have the relevant authority. A
sequence of steps to follow during
project preparation and implementation is recommended: conduct an
initial social assessment, collect and
analyze relevant gender information,
adopt a gender inclusive design,
conduct timely policy dialogue, and
monitor gender provisions. For more
on gender and development, see
http://www.adb.org/gender.

A special evaluation study, based
on 50 activities in four countries,
found that total economic and sector
work absorbed around 5%-6% of staff
time, $3 million-$5 million in staff
consultant inputs, and $30 million$50 million of technical assistance
resources annually. The study found
perceptions that present staff
resources are inadequate for
generating effective economic and
sector work outcomes, governments’
involvement in planning such work is
limited, and stakeholders are
concerned about the cost-effective
10/04/02, 10:13 AM| | 04Operations-10.p65

 

ness of such activities. A focus on results rather than
inputs would improve the effectiveness of economic and
sector work. Five steps for improving the management
of this work were identified: define economic and sector
work as a separate nonlending service in ADB's
Operations Manual; establish a tracking system for
monitoring resource use and results; introduce internal
processes to enhance overall quality; develop a
dissemination strategy; and establish a change agent
within ADB to enhance economic and sector work.

A special evaluation study on the impact of ADF
resources covered the first five ADF commitment
periods, 1973-1991, and the Special Funds period (19691972) that preceded them. Total commitments were
$10.2 billion: Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka
accounted for 76% of the total. It was found that projects
designed to enhance DMCs’ productive capacity—such as
energy, transport and communications, and irrigation—
promoted economic growth and indirectly reduced poverty.
Projects designed to reduce poverty directly, while
making positive contributions, generally produced
results below expectations. The following lessons have
been considered in designing and implementing subsequent ADF-funded projects: thorough project preparation
should consider local culture, and technical and financial
aspects; beneficiary participation is essential for developing
project ownership; ADB staff's capability to deal with
stakeholders at the grassroots level must be enhanced;
commitment to a sector or subsector must be long term;
transparency and accountability in project management
are essential; and the policy environment must support
the project.

A special evaluation study on privatizing public
sector enterprises assessed the global experience on
privatization; analyzed ADB's support for privatization
through loan and technical assistance projects since
1994; and evaluated the DMC experience by surveying
active borrowers. The main findings include the

Harmonization of evaluation activities

An Evaluation Cooperation Group, established in 1996
among the MDBs, is pursuing greater harmonization of
evaluation activities to reduce the costs on borrowing
countries and allow clear comparisons between
participating institutions. The group is examining the
criteria used in evaluations, timing and procedures for
evaluations, and governance issues relating to
independence and disclosure. Draft sets of good
practice standards have been developed in relation to
evaluating public sector lending and private sector
operations. OED is also involved in a joint evaluation
in Viet Nam of the Comprehensive Development
Framework Approach to Partnership. For more on

evaluation.

10/04/02, 10:13 AMhe Asian Development Bank (ADB) monitors
the economic performance and assesses the
needs of its developing member countries
(DMCs). These regular evaluations are the
basis for the country strategy and program
reports and updates. Policy dialogue with
governments helps ADB prepare operational strategies,
and from project implementation evaluations, ADB
derives lessons to improve the quality of future projects.
In this chapter, ADB activities in 2001 in its DMCs—
including those in Afghanistan—are discussed. While not
yet a member, East Timor is included in the discussion
because ADB had activities there in 2001. Four members—
Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; and
Taipei,China—have graduated from regular ADB assistance; of the four members, only the Republic of Korea is
included in the discussion because of ongoing ADB
operations as a result of the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Afghanistan

Economic performance

Before the recent war that ousted the Taliban regime,
Afghanistan's aggregate gross domestic product (GDP)

| | 05Country-7.p65 55

 

was estimated at $6.9 billion, with per capita income of
about $300 in 1989. The bulk of national production
consisted of agriculture and forestry products (53%),
followed by light industry (28%), trade (8%), and
construction (6%). These estimates exclude illegal poppy
cultivation and narcotics production, which are major
sources of income.

Afghanistan’s social and economic structures and
institutions have been devastated by hostilities since
1978. At least 5 million people have been displaced
within and outside the country. The country’s infant
mortality, life expectancy, and literacy rates are among
the lowest in the world. Severe drought over the past
3 years has resulted in substantially less food supply.
While large-scale food aid and other humanitarian relief

remote mountain settlements remains a challenge.

Trade statistics for 1999, the most recently
available, indicate total exports of $235 million, the
major exports, in order of size, being fruit, nuts, and
carpets. Imports totaled $900 million in 1999, leaving a
trade deficit of about $665 million. Major imports
included capital goods, food, textiles, and petroleum
products. Arrears to multilateral creditors total nearly
$50 million. Nevertheless, over the coming years,

Afghanistan will need large financial inflows to fund
humanitarian, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts if
poverty is to be reduced and sustainable development
made possible. The major economic and social issues
are food security and provision of basic health, water
and sanitation services, as well as shelter and other
basic social infrastructure.

ADB operations

Afghanistan became a member of ADB in 1966.
Operations began in 1969, with the first ADB loan
being approved in 1970. By 1979, when ADB
assistance was suspended following the Soviet
occupation, Afghanistan had received nine loans
totaling $95.1 million and technical assistance grants
totaling $2.5 million, all outstanding loans at that time
being sourced from the Asian Development Fund
(ADF). ADB operations emphasized projects in
agriculture, irrigation, transportation, hydropower
development, and vocational education. As of

31 December 2001, the total principal outstanding was
$27.7 million, with arrears on four loans totaling
$15.3 million. These arrears are currently being
addressed as a prerequisite to resumption

of ADB operations.

Since October 2001, ADB has played a key role in
planning and assisting Afghanistan's reconstruction. At
the request of the Steering Group on Afghanistan
Reconstruction—chaired by the United States (US),
Japan, the European Union, and Saudi Arabia—ADB, the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and
World Bank jointly prepared a Preliminary Needs
Assessment for Recovery and Reconstruction. This
document was finalized at ADB headquarters in Manila
for use as the basis for international pledges in support
of Afghanistan’s reconstruction. The preliminary
assessment indicates a requirement of about $1.7 billion
for the first year, $4.9 billion for the first 2.5 years,
about $10 billion over 5 years, and $14.6 billion over
10 years under a base case scenario. ADB also plays a
key role in launching the Afghanistan Reconstruction
Trust Fund, which will be managed jointly by ADB, the
Islamic Development Bank, UNDP, and World Bank.

The agriculture, infrastructure, and social sectors
are crucial for rehabilitating and reconstructing
Afghanistan. ADB's immediate focus will be on
restoring irrigation systems and roads that can make
a major contribution to rebuilding the national
economy while creating local community employment.
As all social sector services have collapsed, ADB's
first priority will be to restore basic education,
including nonformal education.

Based on the preliminary assessment, ADB is
considering assistance in the form of ADF loans and
grants of around $500 million over 2.5 years.

Azerbaijan

Economic performance

Azerbaijan's real GDP growth rate in 2001 was 9.9%,
down from 11.1% in 2000. Economic performance in
2001 was generally strong, mainly because of growth
in the non-oil subsector of 12%. In contrast, growth in
oil and gas was 5%. Inflation as measured by the
consumer price

index (CPI)

remained at 1.5% Azerbaijan

during the year. The general fiscal balance position
slightly improved from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP during
the first half of 2000 to a deficit of 2.1% of GDP the
same period in 2001. Owing to an improved trade
balance, the current account improved with the deficit
falling from 3.4% of GDP to 2.3% of GDP, despite the
growing deficit in the nonmerchandise accounts. The
country’s export growth of 7.9% was fueled mainly by
oil. Because of a sharp increase in income outflows
from foreign oil consortia and subdued oil exploration
activities, oil equipment imports fell, causing overall
imports to decrease by 5.4% in 2001. Foreign
investment, mainly foreign direct investment in the oil
and gas subsector, recovered. Despite increased
capital repayment and growth in the state oil fund,
gross international reserves improved to $744 million
in 2001, equivalent to about 5 months of imports. Due
to significant underreporting and large employment in
the informal sector, the actual unemployment rate is
estimated at 18%, although officially, unemployment
has remained at 1.0% since 1995.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: Inequitable economic growth and
the need to assist growing numbers of poor people were
major concerns in formulating ADB's interim operational
strategy for the country, the goal of which is reducing
poverty and raising living standards by enhancing
human development, supporting good governance and
institutional strengthening, and promoting sustainable
growth. ADB's strategy for Azerbaijan consists of
helping the Government improve the delivery of
essential public goods and services to those in greatest
need, and strengthen the environment for private
investment and job creation.

Policy dialogue: In 2001, ADB's policy dialogue
focused on Azerbaijan's proposed national strategy for
reducing poverty. Discussions with the Government and
funding agencies focused on assisting 20,000 internally
displaced persons, with $2.5 million financing from the
Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.

Loans and technical assistance: While no loans
were approved in 2001, five technical assistance grants
totaling $2.0 million were approved during the year,
which will provide training in ADB policies and
procedures, support macroeconomic policy development,
facilitate development of a national program for poverty
reduction, and prepare ADB's first loan to Azerbaijan
that will fund urban water supply and sanitation
development.

Bangladesh

Economic performance

GDP growth in fiscal year (FY)2001 (ending 30 June) is
estimated at 5.2%, lower than the 5.9% growth rate
achieved in FY2000. This relatively robust growth was
due to a bumper crop in agriculture

and growth in the industry sector of Bangladesh
7.2%, higher than the 6.2% growth
achieved in FY2000. Growth in the (percent)
services sector in FY2001 was 5.4%,
against 5.5% in FY2000. Inflation, as
measured by the CPI, declined to 1.6% 120
in FY2001 from 3.4% in FY2000, 9.0
mainly due to depressed food prices.

GDP Growth Rate, 1997-2001

However, the budget deficit remained high at 6.1% of
GDP due to a surge in expenditures. Exports, mainly
garments and knitwear, grew by 12.4% in FY2001,
compared with 8.2% the previous year. However, the
current account deficit increased to 2.1% of GDP
compared with 1% in FY2000, following a surge in
imports and a decline in private current transfers,
including remittances. Foreign exchange reserves
declined to $1.3 billion or 1.7 months of imports at the
end of FY2001, compared with $1.6 billion at the end of
FY2000. Because the domestic garment industry and
overseas job markets—which have absorbed a large
proportion of the population entering the labor market
during the last 2 decades—have become saturated,
Bangladesh faces the challenge of absorbing 2 million
labor force entrants annually, as well as addressing
large-scale underemployment.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's focus remained on poverty
reduction, the most important challenge facing
Bangladesh since nearly half the population lives in
absolute poverty. The Partnership Agreement on Poverty
Reduction (PAPR) concluded in early 2000 also
recommended promotion of effective development
interventions, increased quantity and quality of social
sector investments, and greater attention to good
governance.

Policy dialogue: Major emphases in 2001 were
reform strategy and regulation for the energy sector,
improving performance of the water resource management sector, and the postliteracy and continuing
education subsectors.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: In 2001,
ADB approved four loans totaling $297.9 million for the
West Zone power system development, postliteracy and
continuing education, and second small-scale water
resources development sector
projects. Twelve technical assistance
grants totaling $4.9 million were also
approved for funding a poverty
assessment; a review of public
expenditure; erosion mitigation of the
Jamuna-Meghna River; a study on the
Jamuna Bridge; improvement of urban
governance and infrastructure; review
and strategy formulation in the
financial, industry, and trade sectors;
tural infrastructure improvement;
development of the Northwest Road
corridor; road network improvement
and maintenance; and primary

education sector improvement. Three grant-financed
projects amounting to $25.4 million were also approved:
one for beneficiary participation and project management, and one for the second small-scale water
resources development sector, both funded by the
Government of The Netherlands; and another for
supporting livelihood improvement for the poor through
water management associations, financed by the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1973, Bangladesh has received 147 loans, of which
37 were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards
totaled $137.9 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$4.7 billion. The contract award ratio was 14.6%, slightly
lower than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%. Disbursements during the year totaled $214.9 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to about $4.7 billion. The
disbursement ratio was 17.3%, lower than the ADB-wide
average of
20.5%.

being implemented.

Bhutan

Economic performance

While Bhutan’s real GDP growth was robust in calendar
year 2001, reaching an estimated 6.5%, this figure hides
a relatively wide variation in sectoral performance.
Growth in agriculture, traditionally the slowestgrowing sector, recorded an estimated 4.8%, while
growth in the industry and services sectors reached
estimated rates of 8.0% and 6.3%, respectively. Major
hydropower and industrial projects prompted
expansion in construction, and growth in transport
and communications was dynamic. However, the
performance of mining and manufacturing was
disappointing. Tourism, though not identified
separately in the national accounts, gained increasing
importance despite being adversely affected by the

11 September events.

Because of the fixed exchange rate between
Bhutan’s ngultrum and the Indian rupee, trends in
inflation in Bhutan have traditionally paralleled those
in India. That said, the country’s inflation rate fell
substantially in FY2000 and remained steady in
FY2001 at 3.6%, largely due to reduced food prices.
The Government has traditionally pursued a prudent
fiscal policy, with current expenditure being financed
completely from domestic revenues. While Bhutan’s
fiscal deficit increased to 5.1% of GDP in FY2001 from
4.1% in FY2000 as a result of increased capital
investment for hydropower and industrial projects,
domestic revenue is expected to increase as major
projects are commissioned over the coming months
and power export tariffs are raised in the long run. In
FY2001, the trade and current account deficits
increased to 22.6% and 27.5% of GDP, respectively.
However, capital inflows—mostly in the form of
grants—have continued to exceed by some margin the
deficits in the country’s trade and current accounts.
The net effect of these trends has boosted Bhutan’s
foreign exchange reserves significantly over time. As
of June 2001, foreign exchange reserves stood at
$294 million, equivalent to 16 months of
merchandise imports.

Operational strategy: In the
context of Bhutan, reducing poverty
will require continued economic
growth, and extending the coverage
of health, education, and other

intermediation, and risk; and formulating transparent
legislation and regulatory procedures. In the power

strengthened vocational, technical, 2001

and basic skills. To implement the

country strategy effectively, ADB 2000
assisted the Government's first study

on poverty. Published by the 1999
Government in December 2001, the 1998

study examines the nature and

extent of poverty in Bhutan and its 1997
geographical distribution. The

study's findings are expected to

contribute to improved national data
relating to poverty. While the findings will not change
the focus of ADB's country strategy, these will be
taken into account in future project design and
implementation.

Policy dialogue: In implementing the country
strategy, policy dialogue focused on promoting private
sector development; improving the efficiency of public
service delivery and cost recovery; and establishing
administrative and technical capacity for analyzing and
monitoring poverty, and formulating and evaluating
poverty interventions. ADB will continue to support the
Government's efforts in providing an enabling environment for private sector development by rationalizing
and strengthening banking and financial institutions;
continuing to liberalize foreign trade, exchange, and
investment regulations; liberalizing interest rates to
reflect the true underlying cost of resource mobilization,

of Power. ADB also supports the
Government's ongoing efforts for
improving domestic resource
mobilization, including cost recovery
of public service delivery in the
health and urban services. ADB's
operational program also includes a
comprehensive household living
standard survey.

Loans and technical assistance: One loan of $7 million for
basic skills development was
approved in 2001. Five technical
assistance grants totalling $2.1 million
were also approved, of which four
were advisory and one was for
preparing a rural electrification and
network expansion project.

bringing cumulative disbursements to $60.8 million.
The disbursement ratio was 16.9%, lower than the
ADB-wide average of 20.5%.

In October 2001, a country portfolio review
mission assessed key portfolio performance indicators
and, in particular, annual contract awards and
disbursement projections. Based on the review, an
action plan was developed for improving project
implementation and administration, as well as the
overall performance of the Bhutan project portfolio.
Improvements to project monitoring and reporting
were discussed with project directors. Procurement
briefings and a project administration workshop were
also conducted during the year for project directors
and line ministry officials.

Cambodia

Economic performance

Growth in Cambodia was led by the textiles and
tourism subsectors, which remained strong in 2001,
although both were vulnerable to the global economic
downturn. Price inflation in 2001 was negligible. As a
result of low inflation, the exchange rate remained
stable. The

Few benefits of economic growth have reached
the poor, with much of the growth concentrated in
urban areas. More opportunities need to be created
for the poor as the country undergoes agricultural
transformation. Government investments in health and
education have increased substantially in recent years.
Cambodia, still recovering from more than 20 years of

conflict, needs continued investment in infrastructure
to ensure sustained economic growth.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy
focuses on economic growth and poverty reduction in
line with the Government's own priorities. Three priority
areas have been identified. First, to support broad-based
development of rural areas, ADB coordinates efforts in
water resource management, while supporting
decentralization, rural development, natural resource
management, and agriculture sector reform. Second, to
assist human and social development, ADB facilitates a
sectorwide approach in education and provides
complementary support in health and rural water
supply. Third, to promote private sector development,
ADB supports the improvement of the nation’s road
network, while playing a key role in the area of
financial sector reform, and a supportive role in the
energy sector. In addition, ADB provides strategic
support to governance, focusing on economic
planning, public finance, decentralization, and legal
reform while ensuring appropriate gender focus in all
interventions.

Policy dialogue: ADB and the Government
continued policy dialogue on land management, public
financial management, civil service reform, decentralization, financial sector reform, natural resource
management, education, and governance reforms,
including anticorruption. The consultative group of
funding agencies held regular policy dialogue with the
Government on forestry management, public
administration reform, demobilizing military personnel, and legal and judicial reform. The Government’s
5-year socioeconomic development plan, approved
by the Cabinet in late 2001 and scheduled for
submission to the National Assembly in 2002, will
pave the way for a partnership agreement on poverty
reduction with ADB.

Loans and technical assistance: Four loans
totaling $75.2 million were approved in 2001 for the
financial sector program, rural development of the
northwestern region, and education sector development
(program loan and project loan). Eight technical
assistance grants totaling $6.8 million were approved in
2001. Four were advisory: strengthening public financial
management (technical assistance cluster), formulating
a transport sector strategy, providing institutional
support for national economic policy management, and
building capacity for banking and financial management.
Four were for preparing projects on basic health
services, rural water supply and sanitation, agriculture

09/04/02, 12:09 AMsector development program, and the northwest
irrigation sector.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, Cambodia has received 21 loans, of which 17
were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards
totaled $40.7 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$328.7 million. The contract award ratio was 19.2%,
higher than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%.
Disbursements during the year totaled $48.4 million,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $251.4 million.
The disbursement ratio was 18.7%, lower than the
ADB-wide average of 20.5%.

Portfolio performance in Cambodia continued to
improve in 2001 and most of the agreed actions of the
2000 country portfolio review were achieved. A joint
country portfolio review was conducted for the first
time between the Government, ADB, and World Bank,
and an action plan was prepared for improving
portfolio performance. It included the establishment
and use of a common set of portfolio performance

rose moderately.

Although the expansionary fiscal policy continued in
2001, the overall deficit has fallen since 2000. The planned
fiscal deficit in 2001 was 2.6% of GDP, compared with 2.8%
in 2000. In 2001, revenues increased by 22.2%, the highest
growth rate in the past 8 years.

With the global economic slowdown, exports in
2001 rose by only 6.8%, compared with 27.9% in 2000.
Imports grew by about 8.2%, compared with 35.4% in
2000. The current account surplus in 2001 is estimated
at $20 billion, slightly less than the 2000 figure. Foreign
exchange reserves amounted to $212.2 billion by the
end of 2001. The debt service ratio was below 10%.

The official estimate of the urban unemployment

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy

growth to reduce poverty in poor inland provinces, and
improving environmental protection and natural resource
management. These objectives guided ADB’s operations
in 2001. However, work also started in 2001 to update
the country strategy and program in view of significant
policy developments and structural changes in the PRC
economy and changes in ADB's policies. Continued
rapid economic growth, the PRC's entry to the World
Trade Organization (WTO), adoption of a regional
development strategy focusing on the western region,
and deepening economic reforms will help shape the
PRC's future development agenda. ADB's proposed
strategy and poverty reduction initiatives will have to
address the problems and challenges associated with a
country that is shifting from a centrally planned to a

market economy and from a rural to an urban economy.

Policy dialogue: A series of consultative meetings
were held to discuss poverty

reduction in conjunction with drafting — People’s Republic of China

also provided the policy inputs for 2001
exploring ways to reduce rural

poverty, improving the Government's 2000
poverty planning methodology,
measuring and addressing urban
poverty, and promoting the participa- 1998
tion of poor stakeholders in policy

planning and implementation. The 1997
poverty planning methodology,

developed with ADB assistance for

county and village planning, was

adopted as a national policy.

ADB continued to advance its environment
improvement and natural resource management agenda
in the PRC. A loan was approved to address acid rain
and air pollution in Anhui Province in the Yangtze River
Valley. Discussions were held with senior policymakers
to strengthen institutional capacity for combating land
degradation and desertification. Continuing ADB
assistance on water tariff reforms led to the enactment
of local tariff regulations in pilot cities to ensure
transparency and efficiency. ADB participated in 2001 in
the China Council for International Cooperation on
Environment and Development, a high-level advisory
body to the Government.

To promote transparent and competitive bidding
procedures and to reduce the potential for corruption in
the longer term, ADB initiated a technical assistance
grant to prepare a procurement law. More progress was

also made in strengthening the development of
economic laws, including the enactment of the Trust
Law, prepared with ADB assistance. To support the
PRC's membership in the WTO, two seminars were held
to discuss draft regulations on foreign trade, antidumping,
subsidy, and safeguard measures as part of ongoing
foreign trade law reforms in compliance with WTO
requirements.

In a conference organized in 2001 under the
technical assistance for Policy Support for the PRC 2020
(Phase III), ADB promoted the sustainable development
of the western region where most of the PRC's poor
people live. Discussions were held on poverty reduction,
human resource development, private sector development, environmental protection, good governance, and
regional cooperation.

ADB further advanced its policy work on social
security reforms with the approval of
a technical assistance grant for policy
and institutional support of the social
security reform pilot program in
Liaoning Province and with
strengthening the National Social
Security Fund, which was recently set
up as part of the social security
reforms.

Loans, technical assistance,

provinces; one railway project to promote pro-poor
economic growth by linking the poor and underdeveloped project area in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian
provinces with more prosperous parts of the PRC; an
acid rain control and environment improvement project
in Anhui Province; a power transmission project in
Liaoning Province; and a sector project to improve
flood management along the Yellow River. The
Government of Denmark provided $300,000 in
cofinancing for the latter project for Flood Forecasting
and Early Warning System in the Yellow River Basin.

ADB also provided 20 technical assistance grants
totaling $12.4 million. Of these, 7 were to prepare new
projects and 13 were to support policy-oriented studies
and promote capacity building. Two technical assistance
projects are focusing on poverty reduction; three on
environmental protection, including one to assist the
Government in enhancing partnership with the Global
Environment Facility; and two technical assistance
grants are helping the Government develop human
resources and improve foreign capital utilization in the
western regions. ADB also approved a technical
assistance grant of $970,000 to finance a planning study
for preparing the Yellow River Law. The $1 million JFPR
grant is designed to reduce environment-related causes
of poverty by supporting innovative community-managed
approaches where poor communities adopt effective and
sustainable ways of managing watersheds and land
degradation to reduce sedimentation of the Yellow River,
and thus their vulnerability to flood disasters.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1986, the PRC has received 91 loans, of which
51 were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards
totaled $587.8 million, bringing the cumulative figure
to $6.8 billion. The contract award ratio was 22.1%,
higher than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%.
Disbursements during the year totaled $1.1 billion,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $6.9 billion. The
disbursement ratio was 29.8%, higher than the ADBwide average of 20.5%.

The Government and ADB jointly organized
working groups to review the Government's and ADB's
approval processes and cost estimates. To identify ways
of improving the procurement and contracting
processes, procurement in the road and power
subsectors was reviewed jointly by ADB and the
Government. ADB also conducted various workshops on
project implementation and disbursement operations for
staff of executing agencies and line ministries. A series
of sector-specific studies on portfolio performance
review has been programmed and the road subsector
has been taken up first under these studies.

Cook Islands

Economic performance

Real GDP in the Cook Islands grew by 3.0% in 2001.
Record numbers of tourists have stimulated growth in
construction and services, particularly in Rarotonga and
Aitutaki. However, the loss of international air services

8.0% in 2001.

The budget was sound in FY2001 (ending 30 June),
with revenues amounting to 38.8% of GDP and an
operating surplus of 4.2% of GDP. Continued economic
and import growth led to increased receipts of valueadded tax and import levies, which explains the
unexpected strong revenue growth. Expenditure was
kept close to the budget estimate. However, the
Government's external debt obligations remained a
concern. Adverse exchange rate movement during the
past year increased the total debt in New Zealand dollar
terms. Net debt was about 72% of GDP at the end of
2001, with the Government maintaining a reserve for
future debt repayment.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy focuses
on building sustainable capacity for sound economic and
public sector management, promoting economic growth
through private sector development, and reducing poverty.
It is directed at economic and governance reform, and
infrastructure and outer islands development.

Several economic and governance reforms were

East Timor

Economic performance

With the restoration of order and security, economic
activities recovered in 2001, led by agriculture, commercial initiatives, external relief programs, rehabilitation and
reconstruction investments, and restoration of basic services. The United Nations Transitional Administration in
East Timor began reestablishing an administrative and
judicial system, introducing commercial and other regulations, and creating government bodies to manage budgetary and monetary affairs. During FY2001 (July 2000June 2001), economic recovery continued. Two banks
opened and external trade increased. According to an
International Monetary Fund estimate, gross domestic
product grew by about 18%, but poverty remains extensive. East Timor continued to be heavily dependent on
external funding agencies.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's interim assistance strategy

proposes the following measures for East Timor:

* strengthen the capacities of government agencies for
economic management and development administration;

* improve physical infrastructure in water, power, and
ports;

* support agriculture sector development in extension
services and marketing;

* foster private sector development associated with

East Timor is not yet an ADB member and is not eligible for loans. However, ADB's Board of Directors made
East Timor eligible for technical assistance grants primarily
for capacity building. Six advisory technical assistance
grants were approved totaling $2.3 million in 2001—for —
the demarcation of the exclusive economic zone, transport sector improvement, microfinance, information technology systems development, power sector development,
economic policies and strategies for development planning, and postal services development.

ADB is administering five grant projects, amounting
to $47.0 million, funded under the Trust Fund for East
Timor (TFET) using ADB guidelines. Total project disbursements from the International Development Association,
funded through the TFET for ADB to administer, was
$23 million as of 2001 for three active projects. Two
projects have had no disbursements to date.

Project implementation has been satisfactory. The
main role of ADB’s assistance has been to establish
institutional and regulatory frameworks in various sectors, including infrastructure and microfinance development. The Special Office in East Timor facilitated interaction with the East Timorese and among other funding
agencies.

2001, largely reflecting a partial
recovery in tourism. The weakness in Fiji Islands

economic activities was broad-based GDP Growth Rate, 1997-2001

supply and private sector credit contracted during the
year, reflecting depressed economic activities. The
current account deficit widened to 4.4% of GDP largely
due to a drop in exports and weakness in the services
account, reflecting the global economic slowdown and
uncertainties in the domestic economy. The overall
balance of payments was negative, leading to a
decrease in external reserves to about F$360 million
at the end of 2001, sufficient to cover about

4.4 months of imports. During 2001, the nominal and
real effective exchange rate indexes remained
relatively stable. The Government succeeded in
maintaining macroeconomic stability despite the
expansionary fiscal policy. Over the year, the central
bank eased the monetary policy and exchange
controls. In the second half of 2001, the commercial
banks were required to lend a certain minimum
proportion to the export sector.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: A new operational strategy for
the Fiji Islands is being prepared to reflect the newly
elected (September 2001) Government's socioeconomic
program for rebuilding the economy. The strategic focus
will be on helping the Government stimulate economic
growth by encouraging private sector development and
export-oriented activities to support employment
creation. This will involve enhancing public sector
reforms; supporting the establishment and functioning of
efficient financial sector and capital markets, promoting
corporatization and commercialization of public
enterprises, selective public sector investments for
infrastructure development, and poverty reduction; and
addressing environmental and natural resource
management concerns.

Policy dialogue: Poverty reduction, good
governance, enterprise policy reforms, cost recovery,
and operation and maintenance in
the road subsector were the focus of
policy dialogue between ADB and the
Government.

Loans and technical
assistance: No loans or technical
assistance were approved in 2001.
However, ADB reactivated all
suspended technical assistance and
further processed the Ports Development and the Suva-Nausori Water
Supply and Sewerage projects.

Project implementation: Since
joining ADB in 1970, the Fiji Islands

domestic demand. Industry sector performance remained
sluggish; the agriculture and services sectors’ performance recorded improvement in FY2001, compared with
FY2000. Fiscal deficits as a share of GDP declined in
FY2000. However, lower-than-expected tax revenues put
pressure on fiscal balances in FY2001, for which the
Government set a fiscal deficit target of 4.7% of GDP.
The Reserve Bank of India has taken measures to
accelerate economic growth, including lowering the
bank rate to 6.5% and reducing the cash reserve ratio to
5.5% by December 2001. Oil prices were a major cause
of rising inflation in FY2000, which eased in FY2001.
Wholesale price index inflation, at 2.0% in December
2001, has been on a downward trend. India’s external
position in FY2000 was favorable, owing mostly to
exceptional export performance. India’s trade balance
improved to 3.0% of GDP, narrowing the current account
deficit to 0.5% of GDP. Although the global economic
slowdown has caused export growth to drop in FY2001,
imports have followed suit in the context of a sluggish
industry sector performance and slow investment demand.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's strategy supports
achieving higher and sustainable pro-poor growth,
improved income, and reduced poverty by removing
infrastructure constraints and increasing investment. It
focuses on alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks and
improving supply side efficiency by supporting priority
public investment and catalyzing private sector
investment in energy and transport and communications;
and focusing on social infrastructure, including urban
development and housing. Emphasis is given to creating
a conducive private sector environment. ADB helps
foster further development of financial and capital
markets as an effective source of funding for
infrastructure projects. ADB's operational program
continues to be sectorally and
geographically focused. In the
medium term, about half the annual
lending to India will be for state-level
operations in ADB's focal states.
ADB state-level assistance supports
macroeconomic reform and fiscal
consolidation to improve public
saving and enhance resource
mobilization, increase efficient
resource use, promote policy
reforms in key physical infrastructure
sectors, and foster human development by reallocating budgetary
resources to social sectors.

2000-2001

09/04/02, 12:09 AMPolicy dialogue: In support of the operational
strategy in 2001, policy dialogue focused on improving
the policy environment and governance of the power
subsector at the state level; providing a policy and
operational framework for attracting private sector
participation in infrastructure; promoting subregional
economic cooperation; and removing the capacity
constraints on the transport corridor through private
sector participation. The Madhya Pradesh Power Sector
Development Program will support the creation of an
efficient, self-sustaining, and competitive power
subsector to provide sufficient quantity and quality of
power, thereby enhancing the economic and social
development of Madhya Pradesh, one of the poorest
states in India. Another project will promote private

and reconstruct areas damaged by the Gujarat
earthquake, develop the western transport corridor
and the West Bengal corridor, establish a private
sector infrastructure facility at the state level (two
project loans), and implement the Madhya Pradesh
power sector development program (program and

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, India has received 69 loans, of which 38 were
active at the end of 2001. Contract awards totaled
$106.5 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$6.0 billion. The contract award ratio was 4.5%, lower

during the year totaled $269.8 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to $5.8 billion. The
disbursement ratio was 11.9%, lower than the ADBwide average of 20.5%.

During the country portfolio review in December,
the Government agreed to accord high priority to the
readiness of new projects to facilitate implementation
and to ensure quality at entry. ADB will also provide
more training on ADB's policies and procedures. A
working group has been formed to identify steps for
improving the flow of funds to externally assisted
projects at the state level.

policy also contributed to inflation. The
Government faced difficulties in (15.0)

financing the 2001 budget deficit

targeted at 3.7% of GDP. Owing to shortfalls in expected
revenues, vital expenditures were curtailed. Development expenditures declined drastically from 42% of total
expenditures in the precrisis years to 10.5% in 2001. The
financing problem was worsened by limited performance
in privatization this year, although the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency achieved its asset-selling target.
To reduce the fiscal deficit, significant increases in
domestic revenue mobilization are necessary. The
Government plans to work for further debt relief from
the Paris Club. Weakening international markets affected
Indonesian exports. The dollar value of exports through
December 2001 declined to $59 billion, down by over
9% from its 2000 level. Oil, gas, and non-oil exports fell.
Total merchandise imports also fell through

December 2001 to $35 billion, dropping 12.2% from the
2000 figure. In light of external events, tourist receipts
dropped to 30% below target. The current account
surplus deteriorated from $8.0 billion in 2000 to

$5.1 billion in 2001. A slight increase in unemployment
and a fall in reported employment were experienced

in 2001.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: A country operational strategy
(COS) was finalized and discussed with the Board of
Directors. The COS replaced the interim strategy used

during the 1997 financial crisis, which focused on

. oe

structural reforms for economic recovery and social
protection for the poor and vulnerable. In contrast, the
COS focuses on longer-term development challenges,
stressing the need to improve governance. ADB
activities will be directed specifically to private sector
development, human and social development, and
mainstreaming environmental management to ensure
sustainable use of natural resources.

Along with the new COS, the
Partnership Agreement on Poverty
Reduction provided guidance for the
future program. Loan and technical
assistance projects processed in 2001
represented a transition between
those needed to ensure sustainable
recovery and activities to meet the
goals of the new COS. Relatively small
loan assistance—two loans—was
approved, reflecting the difficulties of
readjusting assistance plans to be
consistent with politically realistic
reform goals and to meet the needs
of a quickly decentralizing country.
The State-Owned Enterprise (SOE)
Governance and Privatization Program loan will support
sustainable economic recovery by improving resource
allocation in the public sector. Privatizing SOEs will
allow the public sector to release scarce resources for
poverty reduction and social development programs.
Government commitment in this program loan is an
important signal—offering the promise of a policy
environment supportive of private sector development.
The Decentralized Basic Education Project will support
devolution of basic education management. Supporting
the Government’s decentralization program, the loan will
be implemented primarily by local governments,
communities, and schools in rural and urban districts. To
cope with growing demand for transport services and
infrastructure, private sector resources (domestic and
foreign) need to be tapped to reduce pressure on the
available scarce public funding.

Policy dialogue: ADB President Tadao Chino
reiterated during his visit to Indonesia in September
2001 ADB's strong commitment to supporting the
Government's efforts for reform, fighting poverty, and
promoting sustainable development. The Indonesia
Resident Mission was strengthened and played an
effective role in wide-ranging policy dialogue. ADB took
the lead in coordinating the international community's
statement on poverty at the April Interim Meeting of the
Consultative Group for Indonesia (CGI) and on education
at the CGI meeting in November.

Java-Bali area, also offers a forum for wider economic
policy discussion.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB approved
two loans totaling $500 million in 2001 for the
decentralized basic education project and the SOE
governance and privatization program. ADB approved
19 technical assistance grants totaling about $15.9 million. Seven were to prepare projects on poverty
reduction, power transmission, private sector participation in infrastructure, decentralized health services,
capacity building for decentralization, participatory
irrigation, and microfinance; and the rest were for
advisory purposes on developing a financial services
supervisory institution; formulating a gas sector
development plan; decentralizing education management; developing leading indicators for poverty
monitoring; privatizing and restructuring SOEs;
strengthening procurement policies, legal framework,
and institutions; commercializing public service
obligations; providing a regulatory framework for private
and public water supply and wastewater enterprises;
supporting country financial accountability; promoting
fiscal decentralization; and reforming water enterprises.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in 1966,
Indonesia has received 256 loans, of which 66 were active
at the end of 2001. Contract awards totaled $456.3 million,
bringing the cumulative total to $11.2 billion. The contract
award ratio was 14.9%, higher than the ADB-wide average
of 14.8%. Disbursements during the year totaled
$686.0 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to
$12.1 billion. The disbursement ratio was 17.4%, lower
than the ADB-wide average of 20.5%.

A joint country portfolio review was conducted by the
Government, ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank, focusing on four topics: strengthening institutional arrangements for portfolio management
under decentralization, improving project management,
streamlining disbursement processes, and mainstreaming
project implementation readiness criteria. Further
strengthening fiduciary standards for public procurement
and financial management under decentralization, and
instituting reforms in the public procurement and financial
management systems will also be addressed.

Kiribati

Economic performance

Kiribati’s economy grew by 1.5% in 2001, after a
contraction of 1.7% in 2000. Much of the increase was

attributed to increased government and donor
spending, a recovery in copra production, and a rise
in construction activity. The inflation rate increased
from 0.9% in 2000 to 7.1% in 2001, largely due to the
delayed effect of the rise in local oil prices and fall in
the Australian dollar (A$). In 2001, imports are

estimated to have declined by 9.0%,
while commodity exports fell by

33.2%. The trade deficit is estimated

to have reached nearly 70.0% of
GDP, slightly higher than the 67.5%
level in 2000, with the current
account surplus falling to around
4.4% of GDP. The Revenue
Equalization Reserve Fund,

which accounted for almost all
external assets, decreased from
A$658 million at end-2000 to
A$635 million at end-2001. This is
equivalent to $329 million, over 10
years of imports or 8.2 times GDP.

The fiscal position weakened in 2001. The overall
budget balance deteriorated from a deficit of 0.8% of
GDP in FY2000 to a projected deficit of 37.5% of GDP in
2001. This increase in the deficit resulted primarily
from a higher wage and salaries bill, rising subsidies
to government-owned businesses and the copra
industry, payments for a landing craft, and a larger
government contribution to development projects.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s strategy envisages two
main priorities in its assistance program: water
assessment and management in South Tarawa and the
outer islands, and support for establishing and
expanding trust funds to provide sustainable financing
of basic services.

Policy dialogue: ADB assists the Government in
improving its water and environmental management in
South Tarawa and in identifying policy changes for
outer island development.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were
approved in 2001. ADB approved one advisory
technical assistance grant amounting to $500,000 for
strengthening development strategies and supporting
poverty reduction.

Economic performance

Despite the weakened global demand
for information and communication
technology (ICT) in the latter part of
2000, the economy of the Republic of
Korea grew around 3.0% in 2001,
following an impressive growth of
9.3% in the previous year. The
manufacturing subsector expanded
during the first half of 2001; in the
second half of the year, external
demand led to a strong growth in the

automotive subsector, offsetting the shortfall in the ICT
subsector. On the other hand, regained strength in
domestic demand boosted nonmanufacturing activities.
Construction rebounded from previous years. Services

provide fiscal stimulus. Total
merchandise exports, an indicator of
the impact of the global economic
slowdown, contracted by 14% in
2001, mainly due to substantial
declines in electronic and semiconductor exports. Merchandise imports
declined by 13.3% as a result of a
significant reduction in imported raw
materials used for exports. Current
account surplus narrowed slightly to
around 2.0% against GDP mainly due
to the declining merchandise trade
surplus. Revived nonmanufacturing
activities and increased domestic
demand contributed to a decline in unemployment.

To sustain economic activity, the Government averted
capital market turmoil and worked out high-profile
corporate restructuring in an increasingly difficult
economic environment. The Government took steps

to ensure the smooth functioning of capital markets

by guaranteeing new bond issues through the Quick
Underwriting Program and the Korea Credit

Guarantee Fund.

ADB operations

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in 1966, the
Republic of Korea has received 81 loans, of which only
one technical assistance loan for institutional strengthening of the financial sector remained active at the end
of 2001. The project scope of this technical assistance
loan was changed to add a new component for
financing management consulting services to commercial banks and other financial institutions for diagnostic
review, mergers and acquisitions, training and advice on
restructuring, and foreign capital inducement.

Kyrgyz Republic

Economic performance

The Kyrgyz Republic grew at 5.3% in 2001. Agriculture
rose 6.8% aided by double-digit growth in crop
production. Industry grew at 5.4%, while the output of
several subsectors shrank. The services sector grew at
2.4%. Gross domestic investment fell from 18% of GDP
in 1999 to about 16% of GDP in 2000 due to a fall in
public investment by the same magnitude. In 2001,
public investment, which is largely externally funded,
fell further to 4.4% of GDP. Tight monetary policy and a
good agriculture performance reduced the monthly
average rate of consumer price inflation to 6.9% in 2001

17/04/02, 1:57 PM| | 05Country-7.p65

from 18.7% in 2000. Food prices
remained stable and prices of

nonfood consumer goods increased (percent)
by a modest 1.4%. However, there 1997 1998
was a sharp increase in the 30.0
administered prices of utilities

(electricity, gas, and water). Foreign Par
trade volume shrank by 10.2% in

2001. Exports fell by 6.0% mainly due 00

to a decline in exports of electricity,

food products, and nonprecious (15.0)
metals. Imports also shrank by 14.4%

because of a fall in public investment. (30.0)

The current account deficit was

about 0.7% of GDP in 2001. The

Government embarked on a fiscal compression
program, cutting the fiscal deficit from 10.2% of GDP
in 2000 to 4.4% of GDP in 2001 under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). This was accomplished largely
by compressing public investment. These developments notwithstanding, the high external debt burden
continues to threaten macroeconomic stability
unless concessional treatment of debt is provided by
the Paris Club. Increased real wages, stable food
prices, and growth in farm output reduced the
incidence of poverty from 52.0% in 2000 to 47.4% in
September 2001.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The main objectives of ADB's
strategy are to support the Government's reform
activities and strengthen its policy formulation,
development management, and public service delivery
capacities; create a conducive environment for
promoting growth through private sector investment;
and enhance long-term growth potential by investing in
physical infrastructure, human development, and
environmental improvement. Since 1998, the emphasis
of ADB's assistance has shifted to addressing social
problems to mitigate the adverse impact of the high
poverty incidence. The current operational strategy will
be revised to focus on the priorities of the National
Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Comprehensive
Development Framework, once these two important
policy documents are finalized and approved by the
Government. It will also take into account the country’s
debt burden.
Policy dialogue: ADB's policy dialogue with the
Government covered several areas, including finalizing
the Comprehensive Development Framework and the
Interim National Poverty Reduction Strategy. ADB also

building capacity of the Ministry of Finance for
financial management and planning the public
investment program, and strengthening corporate
governance and judicial reforms.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1994, the Kyrgyz Republic has received 20 loans, of
which 16 were active at the end of 2001. Contract
awards totaled $41.1 million, bringing the cumulative
figure to $323.3 million. The contract award ratio was

Following a review of ongoing projects in
December, ADB agreed with the Government to
enhance staff resources to help implement agriculture
and social sector projects. Additional review missions
were scheduled to build capacity and promote
knowledge transfer.

Lao People’s Democratic Republic

Economic performance

In 2001, GDP grew at 5.5% in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), compared with 5.9%
in 2000. The agriculture, industry, and services sectors
all reported healthy growth rates in 2001. Agriculture,
which employed an estimated 85.0% of the workforce,
grew at 3.9% in 2001. Industry grew at a rate of 8.5%
in 2001, compared with 7.5% in 2000. In 2001,
inflation was brought down to
around 8%, due to strict monetary
policy—adopted in the second half
of 1999—restricting central bank
lending to the Government,
commercial banks, and state-owned
enterprises. This was coupled with 15.0
tight fiscal and monetary policies. In 10.0

largely financed by grants and external borrowing. In
2001, capital expenditure accounted for around 65.0%
of total expenditure. The current account deficit in
2001 was 7.2% of GDP, compared with 5.8% in 2000.
Exports continued to grow, reaching $393 million in
2000 and $425 million in 2001. Electricity from
hydropower plants was the leading export. Tourism
increased and was a major source of foreign exchange
earning. Imports also grew from $591 million in 2000
to $653 million in 2001. In recent years, foreign private
investment has focused mainly on hydropower and
tourism. In 2001, foreign investment was estimated at
$30 million, about the same level in 2000 but below the
levels in previous years when investment was often
above $100 million per year. The mining subsector
started to gain momentum. In 2001, the Government
signed several memorandums of understanding for
surveys and explorations of copper, potassium, zinc,
gold, and cement raw materials.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB, with the Government,
formulated its new country strategy and program (CSP)
in 2001 to guide its operations in the Lao PDR for the o
next 5 years. The core strategies for reducing poverty
are sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and good governance. The strategy
focuses on five operational priorities: rural development
and market linkages, human resource development,
sustainable environmental management, private sector
development, and regional integration. The Lao PDR is a
key player in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)
program, and the CSP explores various options for
maximizing the benefits of subregional cooperation.
ADB's interventions will focus primarily on the poor
northern provinces and along the East-West Corridor. A
partnership agreement on poverty reduction was signed
between the Government and ADB in
September 2001.

Policy dialogue: In 2001, policy
dialogue focused on fiscal management, financial sector reform, private
sector development, environment
management, and poverty monitoring.
A policy-based loan was processed in
2001 to help the Government take
into account environment and social
concerns in energy and transport
infrastructure development projects.
ADB also conducted a joint public
expenditure review with IMF and the
World Bank to ensure that public

1999 «= 2000 =. 2001

09/04/02, 12:09 AMexpenditures incorporate the Government's strategy for
reducing poverty. ADB also helped the Government
improve its public investment program, and its
monitoring of aid and poverty incidence.

Consistent with ADB’s Resident Mission Policy, the
Lao Resident Mission (LRM), established in 2000, has
become increasingly active in aid coordination and
project implementation. The Lao PDR Prime Minister and
the ADB President inaugurated the LRM in July 2001.
LRM led the annual country portfolio review mission in
2001. ADB has been an active member of the funding
agency community in the Lao PDR. In 2001, ADB worked
closely with the IMF and World Bank in support of
systemic reform in the financial sector.

Loans and technical assistance: In 2001, ADB
approved three loans totaling $65 million: Vientiane
Urban Infrastructure and Services Project, Second
Education Quality Improvement Project, and Environment and Social Program. ADB also approved 10 technical assistance grants totaling $5.2 million. Five are

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, the Lao PDR has received 52 loans, of which
19 were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards
totaled $50.9 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$718.1 million. The contract award ratio was 25.5%,
higher than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%. Disbursements during the year totaled $44.7 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to $660.3 million. The
disbursement ratio was 18.9%, lower than the ADB-wide
average of 20.5%.

The LRM assists in project administration and helps
executing agencies understand ADB procedures. The
LRM and the Committee for Planning and Cooperation
hold quarterly review meetings with national project
directors to monitor portfolio performance. In
November, a country portfolio review was undertaken
with the Government. The implementation status of the
2000 action plan was reviewed and additional measures
were agreed upon with the Government to improve
further the overall portfolio performance.

Malaysia

Economic performance

Being an open and trade-dependent economy, Malaysia
was affected by the global downturn in the electronics
industry and the US economic slowdown. Despite the
more difficult external environment, which worsened in
the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, growth of
the Malaysian economy remained positive at 0.4% in
2001. Pragmatic and flexible policies to strengthen the
economy, put in place since the Asian financial crisis,
have enabled the economy to weather the more
challenging external environment. In particular, the
increase in public spending by the Government and the
introduction of two stimulus packages targeted at
boosting consumption and investment—one in March,
and the other in September—totaling 7.3 billion
ringgit, helped cushion the adverse impact of the
weaker external sector on the domestic economy.
Hence, the deterioration of the manufacturing
subsector by 5.1%, largely due to weaker external
demand, was offset by positive growth in the domestic
sectors of the economy—in particular the services
sector, which expanded by 4.9%. The nation’s
macroeconomic fundamentals remained strong with
inflation subdued at below 2%, unemployment

Maldives

Economic performance

Economic performance in the Maldives was favorable
during the first 8 months of 2001, but came under
stress with recent adverse global developments, in
particular after the 11 September events. Tourism,

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy will
support poverty reduction by combining pro-poor
growth, social development, and good governance
initiatives. To foster pro-poor growth, ADB will assist
in regional development by providing basic infrastructure and capacity building; creating an enabling
environment for private sector development, including
financial sector and legal system reform; and
developing an information and communication
network in the atolls. To raise the level of social
development, ADB will provide assistance for
postsecondary education and skills development. To
support good governance, ADB will develop improved
information access in the public sector and build the
capacity of key public institutions for improving
management efficiency. ADB will also help the
Government facilitate private sector participation in
the economy with the eventual graduation of the
Maldives from a least-developed country status.

Marshall Islands

Economic performance

GDP growth in 2001 in the Marshall Islands was
estimated at 0.6%, declining from 0.7% in 2000. A small
rise in copra exports and the first full year of operations
of a tuna loin processing plant contributed to a 5.1%
increase in exports to an estimated $8 million, while
imports declined to a projected $60 million. This level of

 

use of trust funds. An important element is
improving accountability and financial
management of public funds and governance in
the public and private sectors.

growth and expanding access to essential services.
Special attention is to be given to addressing the
needs of women and equity issues in the outer
islands, and creating employment for vulnerable
groups.
¢ Improve the investment climate, thereby promoting
private sector and small business development.
Policy dialogue: The Government's commitment to
reform was demonstrated in 2000 when it met the
difficult conditions specified in the Public Sector Reform
Program, especially the reduction in the public sector
staff force by 30%. The Government remained under
pressure to recede from reform momentum, which
constrained progress. Also, the renewal of the Compact
of Free Association with the US was likely to affect the

trade deficit was due to the large
direct budget support under the US
Compact and other US federal
programs. The trade deficit in 2000
was 52.0% of GDP, a slight decline
from the 1999 deficit. Consumer
prices were generally stable over the
year, rising by an estimated 2.0%. A
recent increase in competition in
retail and wholesale activities, which
saw an increase in cheaper imports
from the US and the pressure of
trader margins, contributed to the low
inflation. The budget has been in
surplus in recent years. However, the
need to repay a high level of debt
arising from Compact-secured
government and state-owned
enterprise bond issues put a strain on
the fiscal position. Income from
fishing licenses provides the main
source of nontax revenue, approximately $3.0 million in FY2001 (ending
30 September).

long-term improvement in efficiency, effectiveness, and
accountability in the Government must start at the state
level. Capacity building is required. ADB technical
assistance will help build capacity at the state level. In
social sector reforms, emphasis will be on the outer
islands to help improve basic social services delivery,
consistent with ADB's poverty reduction strategy.
Increased allocation and better use of resources will be
important in expanding access to essential services. The
Basic Social Services Project provides the start in
improving health and education services delivery.
Subsequently, the needs of this sector will be addressed
through Compact funding, with ADB providing the
necessary aid coordination.

Policy dialogue: The Federated States of
Micronesia now faces serious challenges in adjusting to
an expected change in Compact funding. So far,
sustainable productive investment, critical to ensuring a
reasonable living standard for all citizens, has been
insufficient. Most citizens have been reached by the
public sector, resulting in an
unsustainable level of government
recurrent expenditure beyond 2001
and a dualistic society. Public
expenditure will have to be reduced
substantially to match current
domestic revenue.

Loans and technical

Economic performance

In 2001, Mongolia progressed in restoring macroeconomic stability. The budget deficit decreased from
7.5% of GDP in 2000 to 4.0% although the inflation
rate reached 11.8% from 8.3% the

previous year. Through extensive Mongolia
negotiations on macroeconomic GDP Growth
policy framework, the Government (percent)

and IMF agreed on a new restructuring program supported by the

Poverty Reduction and Growth 30.0
Facility (PRGF). Economic stability
created a sound policy environment 130
for the expanding private sector-led

Despite two consecutive severe
(15.0)

winters and the worsening terms of
trade, Mongolia has maintained a
moderate positive growth of 1.5% (30.0)
owing to the performance of
manufacturing and mining subsectors, which grew by 23.0% and

adverse climatic conditions,
agriculture sector output declined Oo 15

international reserves increased from $190 million in
2000 to $208 million in 2001, or equivalent to
14 weeks of imports. The national currency, the
togrog, remained stable.

Growing unemployment and a weak social safety
net remain the country’s prime concern. About 36.0%
of Mongolia’s population still lives below the official
poverty line. The Government started formulating a
comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
drawing on the framework of a partnership agreement
on poverty reduction (PAPR) with ADB, scheduled for
completion in September 2002.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for
Mongolia was reformulated in May 2000 in line with the
PAPR framework. The innovative approach focused on
poverty reduction by enhancing private sector potential.
Accordingly, ADB’s operations covered initiatives aimed
at bolstering the financial, agricultural, public, social,
and urban development sectors. The
transport sector—a potential
contributor to poverty reduction—has
also been targeted according to
ADB's operational needs and country
guidelines.

Policy dialogue: ADB President
Tadao Chino’s visit to Mongolia in
August 2001 highlighted policy
dialogue with the Government and
provided focus and direction for
further bilateral negotiations. ADB's
commitment remains strong in
providing assistance to public sector
reforms, promoting private sector-led
growth, and giving further support to
the privatization program in the
financial and infrastructure sectors.
ADB is actively working with the
Government to improve project

reducing bureaucratic hurdles and
reforming internal loan approval and
ratification procedures. The first
annual review of the PAPR took place
in 2001, leading the Government and
ADB to recognize that the country’s
transition to a market economy can
only be completed with a substantial
reduction in the number of people
living below the poverty line.

Further time-bound measures were agreed upon
with the Government during the country portfolio
review in September to expedite project start-up and
enhance institutional capacity to improve the overall
portfolio performance. Presentations were made to the
Government and executing agencies on ADB's project
performance rating system. With the opening of the
Mongolia Resident Mission, ADB is now in regular
contact with the Government, executing agencies, and
civil society, thus improving portfolio management.

growth and slower imports narrowed the trade deficit in
FY2001, compared with the previous year. Commodity
exports performed well and garment exports picked up.
Myanmar's trade regime was characterized by wide tariff
dispersion, and a variety of nontariff barriers were used
to compress import demand. Myanmar's international
reserve position remained fragile, with reserves
sufficient to cover about 1 month of imports. In FY1997,
of a total population of 46.4 million, the labor force
consisted of about 22.5 million. Agriculture was the
largest employer—accounting for 63.0% of the labor
force. About 30%-40% of state sector employees were
classified as casual labor.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB continues to monitor
economic developments in Myanmar. An operational
strategy will be formulated when appropriate.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans have
been provided to Myanmar since 1986 and no technical
assistance since 1987.

Project implementation: There are no ongoing
loans in Myanmar. However, Myanmar is involved in
ADB's regional cooperation initiative for the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS), participating in regional
meetings and workshops supported by ADB's regional
technical assistance. In November 2001, Myanmar

Nauru

Economic performance

It was not possible to obtain official estimates of the
latest macroeconomic indicators covering 2001.
Information on Nauru’s national account table for 2001
is not available. Nauru’s dominant major income source,
phosphate production, continues to decline in volume
and prices. The Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust
(NPRT), once the holder of overseas reserves valued
at over A$1 billion, had an estimated net worth of
only about A$150 million. The Government faced
serious cash constraints in 2001 and the draft 2002
budget indicated a deficit of A$40 million-50 million.
Nauru also faced the need to further reform its
offshore banking sector. An unforeseen development
toward the end of 2001 was the agreement between
the governments of Nauru and Australia that Nauru
would host over 1,000 asylum seekers transferred
from Australian waters, and Australia would provide
mainly in-kind budget support. This is expected to
give a temporary boost to the Nauru economy.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB has played a lead role in
helping the country recover from its financial difficulties
through a program loan in 1999. ADB will coordinate
closely with other funding agencies, especially the
Australian Agency for International Development, and
provide complementary assistance as necessary.

Policy dialogue: In 2001, policy dialogue was
conducted on measures to restore macroeconomic
stability and fiscal discipline, and to protect the
country’s dwindling economic assets. Although ADB
provided advice on these issues, limited progress has
been achieved in key reform areas.

Loans and technical assistance: In 2001, no
loans or technical assistance were approved.
Technical assistance implementation in 2001 included
fielding consultants, which has continued intermittently since 1999. Assistance was also provided for
appraising the condition and prospects of the Bank of
Nauru and giving options for restoring banking
services; providing advice and training in budget
design and preparation; and evaluating NPRT’s net
assets and assistance in planning and implementing
its transition from a predominantly property- to
financial assets-based portfolio.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1991, Nauru has received one program loan that was
still active at the end of 2001. No contract awards were
made during the year; cumulative contract awards
totaled $2.3 million. There were no disbursements
during the year; total disbursements remained at
$2.3 million.

Nepal

Economic performance

In FY2001, GDP growth slowed to 5.0% from 6.1% in
FY2000. This was mainly attributed to weaker agriculture sector performance compared with record high
growth in FY2000, sharp deceleration in manufacturing,
and a continued slump in tourism. Inflation remained at
2.4% in FY2001—the lowest in more than 20 years—
compared with 3.5% in FY2000. The budget deficit
widened to 4.2% of GDP in FY2001 from 3.3% in FY2000
due to a rise in expenditure mainly for security, a salary
increase for civil servants, and a voluntary early
retirement scheme. Growth in the dollar value of
merchandise exports sharply declined to 3.7% in FY2001,
compared with an expansion of 42.0% in FY2000 due to
a significant decline in exports of ready-made garments

09/04/02, 12:09 AMand woolen carpets. The dollar value
of imports declined by 1.0%, following
a recovery of 20.0% growth in
FY2000, reflecting a sharp deceleration in manufacturing. By the end of
FY2001, Nepal had about $1.0 billion
in foreign exchange reserves, enough
to cover around 7 months of imports.
The debt service ratio was a
manageable 3.9% of exports during
FY2001. Nepal was affected by the
global economic slowdown due to the
11 September events that worsened
the trade and investment of other
countries in the region. In particular,
Nepal's tourism and trade were
adversely affected. In the year ending
November 2001, tourist arrivals
declined by 17.0%, exports by 8.0%,
and imports by 3.5%.

country strategy and program update and the PAPR,
operational priorities were to generate employment and
increase rural incomes through broad-based, more rapid
economic growth; improve basic social services to
enhance human resource development; and promote
good governance.

Policy dialogue: Based on the operational
priorities, the policy dialogue with the Government
focused on civil, corporate, and financial governance

power sector reforms. ADB also assisted the Government in preparing its poverty reduction strategy and the
Tenth Five-Year Plan.

Loans, technical assistance, and grants: ADB
approved three loans totaling $95.6 million in 2001 for

portfolio review mission was fielded in August with
World Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. Measures to enhance portfolio performance were
formulated with the Government. Project directors and
other government representatives also attended a
project implementation and administration seminar in
Manila, aimed at further improving overall portfolio
performance in Nepal.

Pakistan

Economic performance

Economic growth in Pakistan in FY2001 decelerated to
2.6% primarily due to the impact of drought on
agriculture and hydroelectric power generation. The
drought caused a loss in national income estimated at
about 2.0%. Nonagriculture GDP grew by 4.3%, which

improvement from a reduced trade deficit and increased
workers’ remittances. Further slowdown in economic
growth in FY2001 and declining development expenditure resulted in higher unemployment.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: In 2001, ADB's operational
strategy was anchored on poverty reduction, increasing
economic growth, and providing assistance for
governance-related reforms. A significant amount
(78.0%) of ADB's assistance was in program lending.
While program loans finance the cost of adjustment and
complement the economic reform agenda to be pursued
under the 3-year $1.3 billion IMF-financed Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility, the counterpart rupees
were envisaged to be used for poverty reduction and
social sector development. ADB's 2001 loan program for
Pakistan was a record $957 million in the aftermath of

 

was significantly higher than in the previous year.
Agriculture sector output declined by
2.5%, with output of major crops

falling by 10.0%. Growth in large- Pakistan

accelerated to 8.4%—the highest (percent)

growth rate since the 1980s. While 1997 1998

for a majority of the constituent
subsectors of large-scale manufactur- 6.0

subsectors that recorded significant 30
capacity addition (oil refining, 0.0
automotive, and fertilizer), large-scale 8.0)
manufacturing output grew by 7.0% in (6.0)

FY2001. Investment as a percentage

of GDP continued to decline, reaching

a new low at 14.7% in FY2001. The decline largely
resulted from low private sector confidence, despite
improvement in Pakistan’s macroeconomic fundamentals. The major success during the year was a reduced
inflation rate of 4.4%, resulting largely from improved
macroeconomic and financial policy management. The
fiscal deficit in FY2001 was 5.3% of GDP—the lowest in
23 years. The deficit decreased because of stringent
control over public expenditure, particularly current
expenditure that was reduced by 1.5% of GDP.
Development expenditure also declined to only 2.9% of
GDP, a record low. In FY2001 exports increased by 7.4%,
to over $9.0 billion for the first time. Export volume
expanded by over 15.0%, with 8 out of 10 top export
items recording double-digit growth. The current
account deficit declined to 0.9% of GDP, with

mitigate the impact of the post11 September events on the Pakistan
economy was reiterated by ADB
President Tadao Chino, who visited
Pakistan in November 2001 and met
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf
and Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz.

Policy dialogue: In the context
of 2001 operations, policy dialogue
focused on agriculture sector reform,
designed to ensure a greater role for
the private sector in domestic trading
of major agriculture commodities,
gradual phasing out of administered
prices with market forces, and
enhancing food security and poverty
reduction. Another major initiative
was the Access to Justice Program loan, which
supported legal and judicial reforms, focusing on helping
the Government improve access to justice by strengthening the subordinate judiciary, supporting policy
reforms, and enhancing the judicial system to ensure
timely commercial adjudication and a mechanism for
enforcing contracts, thereby providing a greater comfort
for prospective international investors. Policy dialogue
also continued under the Energy Sector Restructuring
Program and the Trade, Export Promotion, and Industry
Program.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB approved
11 loans for 5 projects and programs in 2001 totaling
$956.8 million. These are for the urban sector development in the North-West Frontier Province, road sector
development (a program loan and two sector loans),

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, Pakistan has received 203 loans—including
21 private sector loans without government guarantee—
of which 59 were active at the end of 2001. Contract
awards totaled $418.9 million, bringing the cumulative
figure to $8.0 billion. The contract award ratio was
18.1%, higher than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%.
Disbursements during the year totaled $512.3 million,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $8.4 billion. The
disbursement ratio was 28.2%, higher than the ADBwide average of 20.5%.

The Pakistan Resident Mission initiated quarterly
provincial project review meetings in the four provinces
and held two review meetings at the federal level. To
enhance further project and portfolio performance, the
resident mission conducted two provincial level and one
federal level workshops on project management with
staff of executing agencies, line ministries, and other
government offices concerned. ADB also conducted a
country project implementation and administration
workshop for executing agency and line ministry staff.
Proactive project implementation has improved key
portfolio monitoring indicators and overall portfolio
performance.

Papua New Guinea

Economic performance

In 2001, real GDP in Papua New Guinea declined by
3.3%, led by a 9.0% drop in mining and quarrying. While
the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors grew by
0.9%, economic activity declined or remained subdued in
most other sectors. A fiscal deficit of 1.8% of GDP was
recorded in 2001. The Government reduced expenditure
in the second half of the year in response to a major
shortfall in tax revenue. External debt increased by 5.6%
in US dollar terms by the end of 2001. However, annual
average inflation fell from 15.6% in 2000 to 9.8% in
2001. This allowed easing of monetary policy by
reducing the kina facility rate to below 10.0% by end2001, with modest relief in commercial bank interest
rates. Broad money supply grew by about 10.0% in 2001.
Declining exports caused the current account surplus to
fall slightly to about $221 million. The overall balanceof-payments surplus also declined to about $106 million
from about $130 million in the previous year. Gross
international reserves reached $400 million or 5 months
of imports. The local currency continued to depreciate,
with the average rate against the US dollar falling by
about 20.0% in 2001 compared with the previous year.
Public sector reforms continued with increasing

ADB operations

Operational strategy: Poor
governance and inadequate public
sector management are the main
development problems. ADB helps the
Government strengthen public sector
financial management by improving
the machinery of financial and
general public sector management at
national and provincial levels,
concentrating management on output
and performance; and good
governance institutions by improving
systems and procedures and through
capacity building. Private sector
development is critical in reducing
poverty. ADB helps strengthen sector
policy and institutional frameworks;
improve factor productivity, especially
through skills development; and
enhance market access, especially by
rehabilitating and maintaining road
and water transport infrastructure.

$5.5 million grant, funded by the
Government of Australia, to develop
employment-oriented skills.

Project implementation: Since
joining ADB in 1971, Papua New
Guinea has received 55 loans, of
which 13 were active at the end of
2001. Contract awards totaled
$43.6 million, bringing the cumulative
figure to $570.4 million. The contract

While significant improvements

will help improve the management and governance of
social service delivery agencies, focusing in particular
on health, education, and public works. In the social
sectors, ADB will continue to be involved in developing
policies, promoting infrastructure investments, and
improving service delivery.

Policy dialogue: ADB's policy dialogue with the
Government has focused on improving governance and
strengthening public sector management for more
efficient and effective service delivery. Overall progress
in implementing the Government's structural reform
program, including public service reforms, has generally
been satisfactory despite very difficult economic
conditions. ADB has taken a lead role in working with
the Government, particularly in strengthening road
sector management. As a result, the Government is
changing the sector's institutional structure to increase
independence and accountability.

Loans and technical assistance: In 2001, two
loans totaling $75.9 million were approved for a public
service program and a nucleus agro-enterprise project.

Philippines

Economic performance

The GDP growth rate in the Philippines decelerated from
4.0% in 2000 to 3.4% in 2001, owing mainly to the
global economic slowdown, political disruptions, and
consequent weak investor confidence. All three major
economic sectors expanded during the year. The
agriculture, industry, and services sectors grew by 3.9%,
1.9%, and 4.3%, respectively. Slow

economic activity resulted in average

inflation for the year of 6.1%, well Philippines

within the government target of 6.0%- GDP Growth Rate, 1997-2001

7.0%. This was due mainly to (percent)

favorable supply-side factors, notably 1997 1998
lower prices for food and oil
products, and continued prudent
monetary policy. The fiscal deficit of
147 billion pesos in 2001 was 5.0
maintained close to the government
target of 145 billion pesos, because of
lower public expenditure. The overall 6.0)

balance of payments yielded a deficit (10.0)

of $1.5 billion in 2001. Nevertheless,

the current account remained in

surplus at $4.5 billion following the

surplus in the trade-in goods and income accounts.
Compared with the level in 2000, the current account
surplus in 2001 was lower by 47% due to the 16.2%
slowdown in merchandise exports. Despite the global
economic downturn and more cautious investing, direct
investments were $2.0 billion in 2001. Portfolio
investments likewise posted a net inflow of $297 million
due largely to the divestment by residents of their
holdings of foreign-issued debt securities in September.
Unemployment was recorded at 11.1% in 2001,
compared with 11.2% in 2000, resulting from high
population growth and low employment opportunities.

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy
supports the Government’s development priorities
elaborated in the Medium-Term Philippine Development
Plan and aligns with the country operational strategy—
revised as country strategy and program update in

87

October 2001—which aims to reduce poverty, promote
equity, improve social services delivery, protect the
environment, and promote good governance. The
strategy balances these priorities and emphasizes socioenvironmental development and poverty reduction.
Priority projects are basic education and health services;
urban services development, especially housing; rural
roads; rural development; natural resource and
environmental management; and enhancement of
nonbank financial governance. The Government and
ADB signed the Poverty Partnership Agreement in
October 2001.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue with the
Government included reforming the power sector and
privatizing the National Power Corporation; enhancing
basic urban services in Mindanao; supporting government reforms to improve governance
in the nonbank financial sector;
improving air quality under the Metro
Manila Air Quality Improvement
Development Program; and providing
1999 2000 2001 + assistance for government judiciary

and economic sector reforms.

Loans and technical
assistance: ADB approved two loans
in 2001 totaling $105 million for the
Mindanao Basic Urban Services
Sector and Nonbank Financial
Governance Program. Nine technical
assistance grants were approved in
2001 totaling $7.6 million. Six were
advisory assistance grants on
improving poverty monitoring

surveys, strengthening the independence of the judiciary,
capacity building for the Regulatory Office of the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System,
strengthening regulatory and market governance, rural
road development policy framework, and competition
policy for the electricity sector. Three were project
preparatory assistance for integrated coastal resource
management, microfinance for rural development, and
Metro Manila urban services for the poor.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, the Philippines has received 185 loans, of which
55 were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards
totaled $304.5 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$4.9 billion. The contract award ratio for 2001 was
21.0%, higher than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%.
Disbursements during the year totaled $321.8 million,

Policy dialogue was intensified on portfolio issues
through the quarterly portfolio review, jointly conducted
with the Government, World Bank, and Japan Bank for
International Cooperation, and ADB's annual country
portfolio review.

The country portfolio review mission in April
2001 emphasized to the Government the importance
of good governance as a basic principle in sound
portfolio management. Consultations that followed
focused on improving disbursement performance,
reducing underperforming projects, canceling surplus
funds, speeding up recruitment of consultants and
procurement of goods and civil works, and addressing
policy reform issues. Concrete steps taken during the
year included restructuring several project subcomponents, canceling $139 million of unutilized loan
surplus, and
increasing
contract awards
and disbursements.

Operational strategy: ADB's operational approach in
Samoa emphasizes promoting economic growth and
equitable social development by enhancing capacity for
sound economic management, and supporting financial
reform and privatization of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs); improving living standards and reducing income

the Government's privatization program, further
streamlining business processes by removing remaining
barriers and simplifying tariffs, improving access to
finance, and establishing a more efficient regulatory and
legal framework. Dialogue also included land reform
and ways to improve availability of land for economic
activities.

Loans and technical assistance: In 2001, ADB
approved one loan of $6 million for power sector
improvement. ADB also approved three advisory
technical assistance grants totaling $800,000 for
implementing SOE reforms, carrying out a household
income and expenditure survey for socioeconomic

central bank during the year. Broad money supply and
credit to the private sector declined by 12.5% and 21.5%,
respectively, reflecting the low demand for new credit
due to weak economic activity. The trade deficit
widened due to a sharp decline in exports, and the
current account recorded a deficit of 14.3% of GDP. At
end-2001, the official reserves were sufficient to cover
only about one month of imports.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: After suspension of operations
following a coup in 2000, ADB resumed limited
operations in 2001 to assist Solomon Islands in
restructuring basic infrastructure damaged by civil
unrest. The objectives of ADB's interim strategy for
Solomon Islands are to support the Government in
restoring essential facilities and services through the

Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation loan, postpone
the country programming exercise, and finish any
minor activities under ongoing or almost completed
technical assistance projects to facilitate project
continuity and closure. The strategy will be reviewed
in early 2002.

Policy dialogue: ADB has helped the Government rehabilitate basic infrastructure. It has also
highlighted the need to prioritize issues such as law
and order, good governance, and sound public
financial management. Moreover, ADB has been
concerned about the Government's delivery of basic
public services in light of the political and socioeconomic difficulties the country is facing. Overall, the
temporary suspension of country programming has
limited effective dialogue with the Government on a
medium-term assistance program.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans or

Sri Lanka

Economic performance

After achieving 6.0% growth in GDP in 2000, Sri Lanka
faced negative economic growth of 1.3% in 2001. The
decline was largely due to three factors: the global
economic slowdown, which reduced demand for
manufacturing exports; the ethnic conflict resulting in an
attack on Sri Lanka’s international airport that adversely
affected tourism and shipping; and poor weather,
reducing agriculture yields. The fiscal deficit was around
10.0% of GDP for the last 2 years. The national debt
rose, reaching more than 100% of GDP in 2001.
Consumer prices increased by 11.0% in 2001 from 1.2%
in 2000 despite the drop in world oil prices at the end of
the year. Inflation increased due to a rise in key
administered prices (particularly diesel and electricity)
and the 11.0% rupee depreciation, with poor weather
also generating high domestic food prices. Money
growth of 11.4%—mainly due to rising domestic deficit—
might have triggered inflationary pressures, given the
declines in real output. The dollar value of merchandise
exports fell by 12.8%, but was offset by the 18.4%
decline in merchandise imports, thereby improving the
merchandise trade balance position. Following the rupee
float, supported by an IMF Standby Arrangement, the
level of official reserves improved to about 2.7 months
of imports. The new Government's challenge is to
restore macroeconomic stability to provide an
environment conducive to long-term development.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB’s operational strategy was
formulated in 1999. It was further refined, reflecting the
Government's framework for poverty reduction and
ADB's poverty analysis, to incorporate poverty reduction
into ADB operations. The strategy is aimed at achieving
sustainable poverty reduction through broad-based, propoor growth to generate employment and increase rural
income; social development focusing on improving
education and increasing nutrition awareness;
promoting community-based natural resource management; good governance for greater accountability and
responsiveness to the needs of the poor; and reduced

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue with the
Government focused on reducing poverty, improving

public sector governance and
efficiency, and promoting private
sector growth. ADB continued the
policy dialogue on poverty reduction
through ADB's poverty analysis, highlevel forum, and the Government's
preparation for its poverty reduction
strategy. ADB worked with the
Government for policy and institutional reforms in the sectors where ADB
operations are focused, such as road,
power, port, environment and natural
resource management, and rural
finance. ADB also provided a program
for small and medium enterprise
(SME) sector development for
enhancing the business environment,
strengthening business capabilities,
and improving private sector access
to finance, particularly SMEs. The
program will have an integrated
strategy that will include policy
reforms and capacity building.

Loans and technical
assistance: ADB approved six loans
for four projects totaling $146
million in 2001 for Colombo Port’s
increased efficiency and expansion,
North East community restoration
and development, Southern Province
rural economic advancement, and
development of an SME sector
program (which includes a program

loan for SME development and two investment loans
for a business services support facility and a credit
line). ADB also approved nine technical assistance
grants totaling $4.1 million. Two were to prepare

In 2001, ADB approved an equity
investment of up to $360,000 in Sri
Lanka's first private sector housing
bank, which will provide loans to
low- and medium-income borrowers.

Project implementation: Since
joining ADB in 1966, Sri Lanka has
received 105 loans, of which
32 were active at the end of 2001.
Contract awards totaled $103.5 million, bringing the cumulative figure
to $1.9 billion. The contract award

totaled $103.5 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to
$1.8 billion. The disbursement ratio
was 15.1%, lower than the ADB-wide
average of 20.5%.

In January 2001, ADB conducted
a country project implementation
and administration seminar for
government officials and executing
agency personnel with focus on
improving project and portfolio
performance. The country portfolio
review in October 2001 identified
ways to enhance portfolio performance and project administration,
with an emphasis on procurement

rate slightly dropped to about 54% in 2001, compared
with 55.9% in the previous year. The services sector
posted a 2.6% growth during the year, while agriculture
sector growth dropped to 1.5%. On the demand side,
private consumption expenditure grew by 3.5% in 2001,
while the government consumption expenditure
increased slightly at 1.9% in 2001. Private investment
demand increased by 5.1%, while trade balance declined

2001. The unemployment rate during the same period at
3.4% was largely unchanged from the previous year
(3.6%), reflecting strengthened domestic demand. CPI
inflation remained almost unchanged at 1.6% in 2001.
For FY2001, the Government registered a budget deficit
of 136.1 billion baht or about 2.7% of GDP. In 2001, the
trade surplus narrowed to $2.5 billion as merchandise
exports contracted by 6.9% (in dollars). The decline in
exports was across the board, reflecting the impact of
the global economic slowdown and causing a substantial decline in current account surplus to $6.2 billion in
2001, from $9.3 billion in the previous year. Even with
the narrowing of the current account, estimated tourism
revenues recorded an increase of 3.6% in 2001. Gross
official reserves rose slightly to $33 billion at endDecember 2001 from the previous year.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: A new country strategy and
program (CSP) is being prepared. The CSP Update,
presented to ADB's Board of Directors in August 2001,
called for a reevaluation of ADB's strategy and program
in response to the constitutionally mandated steps
toward decentralization, and the objectives of the newly
formulated Ninth National Economic and Social
Development Plan (2002-2006). The CSP Update
observed that as a consequence of
the crisis, the incidence of poverty in
Thailand rose, and that serious longterm challenges, such as gaps in the
country’s competitiveness, remained.
In this context, the CSP Update noted
the importance of supporting inclusive
social development, promoting rural
development, and deepening the
competitiveness of Thailand's
economy. ADB's strategy in Thailand
will also continue to emphasize the
benefits of subregional economic
cooperation. ADB's ability to meet
Thailand's development objectives will

depend on an effective partnership with the Government. However, effective operations will also depend on
support ADB will receive from target communities.
ADB's strategy will complement and support initiatives
that have originated from within the Thai society itself.
Policy dialogue: Through technical assistance to
the National Economic and Social Development Board,
ADB supports poverty reduction strategies articulated in
the Ninth National Economic and Social Development
Plan. As part of ADB's strategy formulation process, a
participatory poverty study for Thailand is being
undertaken. ADB also helps strengthen governance in

Loans and technical assistance: No public sector
loans were approved in 2001. In October 2001,
Thailand's foreign currency borrowing ceiling was
$2.2 billion, the lowest ceiling in 8 years. The reduction
seemed, in part, to reflect concerns over the rapid
accumulation of public sector debt and, in particular,
foreign currency debt since the crisis in 1997. ADB
approved an equity investment of $25 million in a
private equity fund to help Thai companies recover from
the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998. Also in 2001,
ADB approved seven technical assistance grants worth
$2.7 million: one for preparing the North-Northeast Region
area development project, and six were advisory assistance
for a participatory assessment of poverty in Thailand, an
independent inspection of the Samut Prakarn wastewater
management project, developing an agriculture sector
strategy and policy, planning for sustainable urbanization, strengthening accountability mechanisms, and
supporting an international conference on Monetary
Outlook on East Asia in an Integrating World Economy.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, Thailand has received 83 loans, of which 10 were
active at the end of 2001. Contract awards totaled
$20 million, bringing the cumulative figure to $4.1 billion.
The contract award ratio was 6.4%, lower than the ADBwide average of 14.8%. Disbursements during the year
totaled $139.0 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $4.0 billion. The disbursement ratio was 26.5%,
higher than the ADB-wide average of 20.5%.

During the country portfolio review, the Government
agreed to promote implementation readiness for new
projects by assigning government counterpart staff to
work more closely with ADB missions. The Government
also agreed to consider allowing unutilized counterpart
funds to carry over to the following fiscal year to ensure
availability of project funding.

Tonga

Economic performance

Real GDP growth in Tonga slowed to 3.0% in FY2001
(ending 30 June)—largely due to subdued agriculture
sector growth and stagnant tourism, following the sharp
rise in the latter in the preceding year. Annual average
inflation rose 6.3% during the same period. This was
associated with a sharp rise in money supply and
domestic credit expansion by 26.5% and 31.3%,
respectively. Overall budget deficit increased to 2.6% of
GDP in FY2001, reflecting lower-than-expected revenues
and higher expenditures. The rise in the expenditure
reflected two payments of cost of living allowance to

09/04/02, 12:09 AMcivil servants in FY2001. Total official
external debt, including that of public
corporations, stood at 44.6% of GDP
at the end of FY2001. Exports
increased by 3.7%, compared with a
4.3% decline in imports in FY2001.
However, the current account deficit
increased to 8.2% of GDP due to
deterioration in service balance. The
overall balance of payments was also
in deficit, reducing the gross
international reserves in FY2001 to
$12 million, equivalent to about

2 months of imports. During FY2001,
the central bank devalued its currency
by about 19.0% against the US dollar.

standards for all Tongans. The public sector, including
financial and nonfinancial public enterprises, has a
dominant role in the Tongan economy. To encourage
private sector development as the basis of economic
growth, the demands of the public sector will be
curtailed by carrying out reforms of core government
departments and public enterprises. A strategy for
public sector reforms and its successful implementation will achieve several benefits such as reduced
government demand on financial and human
resources, thus leaving room for the private sector to
develop and grow; decreased current fiscal deficit by
improving public sector operational efficiency without
impacting on government services; improved

Turkmenistan

Economic performance

GDP in Turkmenistan grew by 20.5% during 2001.
Growth continued to be dependent on the industry
sector, with production growing by 26.4% over the same
period. Gas and oil production increased by 8.0% and
11.0%, respectively. The Government's importsubstituting industrialization policies also appear to
have been successful, with strong
growth in the textile and food
industries. In January-October 2001,

Turkmenistan

cotton processing rose by 15.0%, food (percent)
industry production by 35.0%, and 1997 1998
agriculture sector production by

22.0%. With the introduction of 300
relatively tighter monetary and fiscal

policies, the Central Bank of Be
Turkmenistan managed to hold

inflation to an average of 7.4% in 50
2000. In 2001, inflation was reduced

further to an average of 6.0%. (50)
Inflation partly remained low because a

of extensive subsidies on basic
consumer goods and utilities. The
state budget recorded a deficit of 1.2% of GDP for
January-October 2001. Revenue was 5.37 trillion manat
(M), 14.0% below the target for the period; and
expenditures at M5.66 trillion were 15.0% lower than
targeted. Of total expenditures, about 80.0% were
directed toward social and public services. Although the
budgetary position appears to be stable, many
expenditures remained off-budget, and the official
figures did not give a comprehensive picture of the
Government's overall financial position. Turkmenistan
maintained a positive trade balance in 2001, with a
trade surplus of $275 million. However, the trade
surplus was down by 62.0%, compared with 2000.
Import expenditure rose by 32.0% year-on-year (mostly
due to a substantial increase in capital good imports)
while exports registered a year-on-year rise of about 5%.
The current account recorded a small surplus equivalent
to about 0.1% of GDP in 2001.

ADB operations

Turkmenistan became ADB’s 59" member in
August 2000. An economic report and interim
operational strategy, which define ADB's initial
development cooperation activities in the country,
have been prepared and are under government
consideration.

Consistent with the Government's long-term
development objectives as described in its 2000-2010
Development Program and with ADB's objective to
reduce poverty, ADB's strategy will include three main
strategic objectives: enhancing human and social
development, promoting sustainable economic growth,
and promoting regional economic cooperation. Human
and social development will focus on improving basic
services, such as clean drinking water, sanitation, and
heating, especially for the rural poor; and maintaining
and upgrading the human resource
base. Sustainable growth will include
building capacity to improve public
sector management; enhancing
agriculture sector production; and
improving environmental management, primarily in terms of water
resource management to increase
efficiency and improve maintenance
of irrigation systems. Turkmenistan
can play a key role in restoring
security, stability, and economic
growth in Central Asia, due to its
unique geographic, cultural, and
political relations with its neighbors.
Several opportunities have been
identified for ADB to support Turkmenistan’s involvement in reconstructing and rehabilitating Afghanistan.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were
approved in 2001. ADB approved one technical
assistance grant in 2001 worth $150,000 for seminars on
ADB operational policies and procedures.

Tuvalu

Economic performance

Tuvalu’s economy continued to grow in 2001, expanding
at approximately 4.0%, compared with 3.0% in 2000.
Growth was led by the public sector, and the mining
and quarrying sector as a result of government and aidfunded projects. Annual average inflation fell from 5.3%
in 2000 to 1.8% in 2001 primarily because of a drop in
the prices of textiles, clothing, and other miscellaneous
items. Cash incomes have risen strongly with seafarer
remittances alone having more than doubled over the
last 4 years, reaching an estimated $2.6 million for
2001. However, significant wealth disparities exist
between the main atoll Funafuti and the outer islands.
Tuvalu relies heavily on income from fishing license
access fees (estimated at A$6.1 million in 2001), rent
from its international telecommunication dial-up code

income from the
Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) assets also contribute
substantially to foreign exchange earnings. A positive
effect of the Australian dollar depreciation is that the
US$-denominated revenue from fishing licenses and
domain fees are increasing. Over the past 5 years,
revenue from the TTF has contributed an average of
19.0% per annum to the Government's total recurrent
revenues but this revenue was smaller in 2001 due to
weakness in overseas financial markets. The actual
budget outcome for 2001 was an overall budget surplus
of A$2.5 million or 20.0% of GDP.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: ADB's operational strategy for
Tuvalu is to promote economic growth and poverty
reduction by supporting the development of the outer
islands, where the poor and the vulnerable groups are
concentrated. The main principles of ADB’s strategy call
for encouraging public sector reform, including
corporatizing government businesses; devolving
responsibility for island development to local governments; reorienting the economy toward private sectorled growth; improving economic infrastructure; and
developing human resources.

Policy dialogue: Ongoing dialogue with the
Government focuses on outer island decision making
and corporatizing government agencies. Also, discussions on the need to maintain the standards of Tuvalu’s
only higher educational institution, the Tuvalu Maritime
Training Institute, are under way.

Loans and technical assistance: No loans were
approved in 2001. One technical assistance grant
amounting to $300,000 was approved for a country
economic study and strategy development.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1993, Tuvalu has received one loan. Contract awards
totaled $1.2 million, bringing the cumulative total to

$4.0 million. The contract award ratio was 100%.
Disbursement during the year totaled $1.2 million,
bringing cumulative disbursements to $4.0 million. The
disbursement ratio was 95.8%, higher than the ADBwide average of 20.5%.

Uzbekistan

Economic performance

Uzbekistan’s economy continued to grow in 2001,
expanding at 4.5%, compared with 4.0% in 2000. While
growth in the industry sector remained strong, it was
hampered by a lack of investment owing to the
restrictive trade and foreign exchange regime. Despite

The 2001 budget target assumed a deficit of 57.5 billion
sum (1.5% of GDP). The overall budget deficit was
about 1.0% of GDP in 2001. The shortfall was financed
by central bank credits and proceeds from the sale of
state-owned enterprises. A slump in commodity prices
in 2001 reduced export revenue and forced the
Government to continue its policy of import compression and import substitution to prevent a rise in
financing requirements. A massive devaluation of the
sum also depressed imports. However, these policies
did not cancel out the current account deficit at 0.5%
of GDP in 2001 from a surplus equivalent to 0.8% of
GDP in 2000. External debt was estimated at $4.6
billion. Consumer price inflation was 26.6% in 2001,
according to official statistics, but the actual level

 

could be even higher. The partial unification of

foreign exchange rates and the rise in fuel prices and
public sector wages became the main drivers of
inflation over the last quarter of 2001. Registered
unemployment in 2001 was at the same level as at
the end of 1999—0.4% of the workforce. Actual
unemployment was higher because of underreporting.
Considerable hidden underemployment also existed.

ADB operations

Operational strategy: The central goal of ADB's
assistance to Uzbekistan is managing a smooth
transition to a market economy, while providing for
sustainable poverty reduction and raising living
standards. The strategy has two operational objectives:
to manage transition by supporting basic reforms and
minimizing the social costs of transition; and to enhance
growth potential by promoting regional cooperation,
investment in the rural sector, and direct support to the
private sector.

Policy dialogue: Policy dialogue with the
Government centered on reforms in education,
agriculture, and
urban infrastructure, and small
and medium
enterprise (SME)
development. In

reforming education governance; and protecting the
poor and vulnerable population groups. In agriculture,
the dialogue focused on farm debt restructuring,
abolishing joint responsibility, promoting producer
incentives, and encouraging private farming. In urban
infrastructure, dialogue was on institutional reforms and
decentralizing implementation, cost recovery, capacity
building, and raising the standards of urban infrastructure service delivery and maintenance. As a result of
ADB policy dialogue, SMEs will benefit from easier
foreign exchange availability.

Loans and technical assistance: ADB approved
two loans totaling $72 million in 2001 for the agricultural
development of Ak Altin and urban water supply
projects. ADB approved five advisory technical
assistance grants totaling $2.3 million in 2001 for pilot
testing rural savings and credit unions, institutional
support for sustainable agricultural development,
building research and analytical capability for structural
reforms, capacity building for urban water supply, and
comprehensive medium-term strategy for improving the
living standards of the people of Uzbekistan. ADB also
approved a $2.5 million grant-financed project for
supporting innovative poverty reduction activities in
Karakalpakstan, financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1995, Uzbekistan has received 10 loans, all of which
were active at the end of 2001. Contract awards totaled
$32.6 million, bringing the cumulative figure to
$133.2 million. The contract award ratio was 5.6%, lower
than the ADB-wide average of 14.8%. Disbursements
during the year totaled $40.1 million, bringing
cumulative disbursements to $119.0 million. The
disbursement ratio was 13.1%, lower than the ADB-wide
average of 20.5%.

A country portfolio review was held in June. The
2000 action plan was discussed with the Government
and further measures were agreed upon to expedite
project start-up and improve the overall portfolio
performance. To facilitate portfolio performance,
several projects were delegated to the Uzbekistan
Resident Mission for supervision.

Vanuatu

Economic performance

Real GDP in Vanuatu declined by 0.5% in 2001 after a
3.7% expansion in 2000. Much of the decline was
attributed to an estimated contraction of 14.9% in
agriculture, fishing, and forestry. Tourist arrivals before

09/04/02, 12:09 AMSeptember 2001 decreased due to the
weakening world economy and the
low value of the Australian dollar;
there was a sharp 14.0% drop in the
fourth quarter, which is largely
attributed to the 11 September
events. The weakening export sector
saw the trade balance deteriorate.
Combined with softening tourism, the
current account deficit grew to
around $4.7 million. However,

Viet Nam

Economic performance

GDP growth in Viet Nam in 2001 slowed to 5.8% from
6.1% in 2000, reflecting poor agriculture sector
performance and weakening external demand. The
agriculture sector's growth rate declined to 2.3% in 2001

due to a poor rice crop and low world prices for
agricultural goods. Industry sector growth in 2001
dropped slightly from the 2000 level to 9.7%, following
the weakening external demand for manufactured

exports, while services sector growth
was maintained. Inflation, as
measured by CPI, remained low in
2001. As of end-December, the
percentage change in the CPI was

attention to health and governance.

ADB supported policy dialogue in financial sector
development, corporate governance, public administration reform, power sector institutional arrangements
and tariff setting, and water resource management
through a National Water Resource Council. A
governance strategy for Viet Nam was finalized, and
ADB supported—with other multilateral and bilateral
funding agencies—the implementation of a joint Legal
Needs Assessment that will develop an action plan for
further legal reform in Viet Nam.

Loans and technical assistance: In 2001, ADB
approved seven loans for six projects totaling
$260.6 million in the fields of water resource management, water supply and sanitation, integrated livelihood
improvement, and road improvement. These loans also
include $17.5 million in two pioneering private sector
projects in social infrastructure. ADB also approved
10 technical assistance projects totaling $8.4 million.
Seven were advisory assistance for institutional support
to the Office of the Government, fishing port management, project financial management through decentralization, enhancing the resettlement legal framework and
institutional capacity, framework for microfinance
development, road map for power sector reform, and

capacity building for the central region's poverty
reduction efforts. Three project preparatory assistance
grants were for upper secondary education development,
urban development in the central region, and livelihood
improvement in the central highlands.

Project implementation: Since joining ADB in
1966, Viet Nam has received 50 loans, of which 34 were
active at the end of 2001. Contract awards totaled
$71.4 million, bringing the cumulative figure to $1.1 billion.
The contract award ratio was 7.8%, lower than the
ADB-wide average of 14.8%. Disbursements during the
year totaled $176.2 million, bringing cumulative
disbursements to $990.0 million. The disbursement ratio
was 17.0%, lower than the ADB-wide average of 20.5%.

The Viet Nam Resident Mission (VRM) and the
Government monitored the country portfolio performance
through monthly project implementation meetings. The
second joint country portfolio review by the Government,
ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and
World Bank was held in August. ADB's 2001 country
portfolio review with the Government was conducted in
October and an action plan for further improving overall
portfolio performance was prepared. The action plan
will be monitored through the monthly project
implementation meetings. VRM is playing an increasing
role in country programming and in the administration

 

of several loan and technical assistance projects.

09/04/02, 12:09 AMhe Asian Development Bank (ADB) responds to
the challenges of reducing poverty by ensuring
that its planning process integrates its strategic
agenda and operating principles with its
organizational capacity for the efficient delivery of
services. ADB regularly updates the strategic
agenda in which it plans country-specific
operations and reviews, and adjusts its policies in
the context of its own experience and the
emerging needs of its developing member
countries (DMCs). Operational work plans are
developed based on these strategies and policies.
ADB recognizes that the needs and priorities of
its DMCs will evolve, and it must respond to
these changes, as well as to changes in regional
and global conditions.

ADB's Long-Term Strategic Framework
(LTSF) 2001-2015 provides that response.
Approved in 2001, the LTSF sets the mission,
development objectives, and corporate agenda
and responds to the challenges of reducing
poverty. Specific objectives and targets are set out
in the 5-year Medium-Term Strategy 2001-2005,
also approved in 2001. To translate the strategy
into action, individual country strategy and
program (CSP) reports and a 3-year rolling

operational program are developed with each
DMC. The CSP is updated yearly in consultation
with the DMC concerned. These country-based

plans form the basis for ADB's overall 3-year
work program and budget framework, which in
turn provide the framework for the annual
administrative budget.

Following the major strategic reorientation in
2001 to meet the challenges confronting its DMCs
more efficiently, ADB undertook a comprehensive
review of its organizational structure and
operational business processes, both effective in
January 2002. For more on ADB's reorganization,
see http://www.adb.org/documents/others/
reorganization_2002/.

Economics and Development
Resource Center

The role of the Economics and Development
Resource Center (EDRC; upgraded to Economics
and Research Department effective 1 January
2002) is to help ADB achieve its corporate
objectives through knowledge generation and
dissemination activities. Externally, it aims to
strengthen DMCs' policy analysis and institutional

 

07/04/02, 11:40 AM

| | 06Strategic-3.p65capacity and enhance ADB's profile as a premier
development institution. Internally, it enhances the
knowledge base of ADB operations. EDRC's key
functions include policy research and country macroeconomic studies, economic and financial analysis,
maintenance of data support, and capacity-building
activities. In 2001, EDRC continued to focus its core
functions on policy and operations issues relating to
ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy and data requirements
for operationalizing the Strategy.

EDRC carried out several studies in 2001 on a range
of issues—policy, labor market, institutional and social
development, information and communication technology
(ICT), and approaches to poverty reduction. These
studies were disseminated through the Asia and Pacific
Forum on Poverty; the Third Asia Development Forum
conducted with the World Bank and United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific; the ADB-Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) Forum on Asian
Perspective: Technology and Poverty Reduction in Asia;
and the Conference on Poverty, Growth, and the Role of
Institutions in Developing Member Countries.

ADB's statistical database system was expanded to
include additional poverty, environment, and social
indicators to reflect progress being made in achieving
the targets of the Millennium Development Goals.

For more on the International Development Goals and the
Millennium Development Goals, see box on page 32. Also,
macroeconomic prudential indicators were added to the
database, thus enabling better monitoring of financial
sector developments.

EDRC studies also clarified the methodology and
measurement issues arising from operationalizing the
Poverty Reduction Strategy. Several implementation
guidelines were published for staff, including integrating
the poverty impact and risk analysis in project economic
analyses; a poverty impact assessment of policy-based
lending; and pro-poor growth measurement guidelines
for strengthening the financial management and
governance of ADB operations. Mapping and measuring
poverty and a diagnostic study of accounting and auditing
practices in selected DMCs were also undertaken. EDRC
worked with members of a technical working group
organized by multilateral development banks (MDBs) to
harmonize financial management and reporting practices
among themselves, with a view to minimizing transaction
costs to MDB borrowers.

Major capacity-building activities included in-house
staff training and external training for DMC officials on
project economic analysis and financial management
and governance. Working with the ADB Institute and the

| | 06Strategic-3.p65 103

Colombo Plan, ADB also provided capacity building in
workshops and seminars on taxation, international
finance, ICT strategies, and technology innovation and
transfers. Several technical assistance projects were
aimed at improving DMC census capability, data quality,
and national statistical systems.

EDRC strengthened ADB’s knowledge base with the
publication of the Asian Development Outlook 2001 and
its Update and Growth and Change in Asia and the
Pacific: Key Indicators 2001. For recent titles of ADB
publications, see page 264. For the first time in 31 years,
the latter included an analytical chapter on long-term
demographic and other socioeconomic trends in DMCs.
A new publication, Policy Briefs—based on papers or
notes prepared by ADB staff and resource persons—was
launched to provide concise nontechnical accounts of
policy issues of topical interest.

An annual event to discuss the medium-term global
and regional outlook—the Workshop on Asian Economic
Outlook—brought together scholars, policymakers,
private sector representatives, and officials from
multilateral institutions. Participants also examined the
implications of the 11 September terrorist attacks for
ADB's DMCs and the world economy, and the proliferation
of regional trade arrangements within and outside the
Asian and Pacific region. Other activities included
organizing the Distinguished Speakers’ Program, a
workshop in India to disseminate the findings of
ongoing studies on Asia’s international competitiveness,
and a workshop in Thailand on intergovernmental fiscal
transfers for equitable in-country growth.

EDRC and the ADB Institute coordinated their
efforts through regular consultations and by membership
of ADB's chief economist in the Institute’s Advisory
Council. In 2001, they jointly conducted four capacitybuilding activities: the Eleventh Tax Conference, the
Asia Development Forum, the Eleventh Seminar on
International Finance, and the Workshop on ICT
Strategies for Developing Asia. Staff also participated as
resource persons in a regional workshop on social
safety nets, workshops on developing corporate bond
markets in Asia, and other training programs organized
by the ADB Institute.

ADB Institute

The ADB Institute (the Institute)—located in Tokyo,
Japan—provides another avenue for ADB to better
understand the dynamics of development in Asia and
the Pacific, and helps formulate long-term strategies
for sustainable social and economic development in
the region.

 

07/04/02, 11:40 AMResearch activities at the Institute are focused on
examining the respective roles of markets, governments,
and institutions that best fit countries—with their diverse
historical and cultural settings—at different stages of
development. Research assesses the potential strengths
and weaknesses of different development paradigms as
a basis for postcrisis strategies for long-term development
and for capacity building and training.

Poverty studies have become an important part of
the Institute’s research program, and the last two
anniversary conferences focused squarely on measures
to reduce poverty. In 2001, research included
surveying the experiences of the “miracle” economies
in reducing poverty; assessing the impact of the
financial crisis on poverty in Indonesia; and studying
poverty in the western region of the People’s Republic
of China (PRC).

Under development paradigms, the Institute
conducted a survey of the current views on poverty in
the development literature and assessed the impact of
different types of growth on poverty reduction. The
Institute also analyzed the links between ICT and
poverty in Asia; examined the relationship between

@ public governance and poverty; and studied policy
failures in the name of poverty reduction.

Other areas of research included corporate
governance and international competitiveness. Under
corporate governance, the Republic of Korea was
studied as were state-owned enterprises in the PRC. On
product markets and competitiveness, work was
completed on operations of multinational firms,
including a study of the basic characteristics of skills
and organizational structure of software firms in India;
lessons from the research and development activities of
multinationals in Singapore; foreign direct investment of
Japanese firms in East Asia, including development of
technology platforms; and a comparative analysis of
international production networks between multinationals from Japan and the United States. In addition, a
study on trade competitiveness prior to the 1997 Asian
financial crisis was completed.

The Institute conducted research on designing a
new intermediate financial market structure in
postcrisis Asia and on the relationship between the
information quality of financial systems and economic
development. In addition, economic modeling of the
financial crisis in Indonesia was used to examine the
macroeconomic consequences of exchange rate
depreciation, high interest rate policy, and political
turmoil. The criteria used by global credit rating
agencies in assessing developing country borrowers
were critically analyzed. Work also started on banking

| | 06Strategic-3.p65 104

 

reforms in the PRC and on more effective alternative
means of resolving the problems of nonperforming
bank loans in the region.

In 2001, the Institute strengthened institutional
links it had developed in previous years. For example,
the Asian Policy Forum, established in December 1999
to bring together leading researchers from various
institutions in Asia, focused in 2001 on the problem of
developing new and balanced financial market
structures in postcrisis Asia, with an emphasis on the
corporate bond market. Policy recommendations were
discussed for the first time at ADB's 34" Annual
Meeting in May 2001. Dissemination seminars of the
final policies were conducted in the PRC and India and
during the ADB Institute’s Advisory Council meeting in
October.

The Institute's 4" anniversary conference in
December 2001 focused on quality of growth, governance, and social development in reducing poverty.
Papers were commissioned from leading international
scholars on development strategies and poverty
reduction and on trade liberalization and poverty
reduction. In addition, the Institute's staff and visiting
scholars produced papers for the conference on trade o
liberalization and poverty reduction, governance and
famine, financial issues and poverty, and policy options
for developing the western region of the PRC.

The research output of the Institute was published
and posted on-line. For recent titles of ADB Institute
publications, see page 266.

In 2001, the Institute completed 29 capacitybuilding and training activities with wide thematic
coverage, including rural and urban poverty reduction,
social protection, and pension funds; public and private
sector governance, public administration, and public
expenditure management; public-private partnerships
in the social sector; ICT strategies for developing
countries and the potential for partnerships in ICT and
education; and international finance and securities
market regulation. These competency-based training
programs benefited over 1,600 participants from 45
ADB members and achieved about 6,300 participantdays of training.

Resident and regional missions
and representative offices

ADB's field offices—resident missions, special and
extended missions, country office, regional mission, and
representative offices—support ADB's objective of
reducing poverty by strengthening its representation in
its regional and nonregional members.

07/04/02, 11:40 AMImplementing the Resident Mission Policy

In 2001, ADB continued to effectively implement its
Resident Mission Policy. Continuing the expansion called
for in the policy, ADB inaugurated a mission in the

Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and opened
an extended mission in Gujarat, India; a mission in
Mongolia; and a country office in the Philippines. The
functions of the missions were realigned and expanded,
with each taking a more active role in ADB's standard
functions. Progress was made in expanding contacts
with country stakeholders, coordinating with other
funding agencies, and disseminating information about
ADB operations. The missions continued work in
portfolio management, with some assuming more
responsibilities in 2001 in country programming, project
processing, and economic and sector work.

Significant increases in the amount of country
programming work being handled by the resident missions
were evident in Bangladesh, PRC, and Indonesia with each
preparing the 2001 country strategy and program (CSP)
updates. The PRC and Indonesia resident missions began
work on full CSPs. The India Resident Mission supported
expeditious processing of the Gujarat Earthquake
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project and also
processed the West Bengal Corridor Development Project
as one of the pilot efforts in project processing; the
Cambodia, Indonesia, and Viet Nam resident missions took
a prominent role in major ADB initiatives in governance.
The Sri Lanka Resident Mission processed an emergency
loan to rebuild communities directly affected by the
ongoing civil conflict. The Viet Nam Resident Mission
prepared a private sector assessment for Viet Nam. The
Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam resident missions
helped process an $8 million grant, to be financed through
the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, to help decrease the
impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region.

The resident missions assisted in public relations
and information dissemination in 2001 as well. Resident
mission staff in Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, and
Uzbekistan hosted visits by ADB President Tadao Chino;
the Bangladesh, PRC, India, Kazakhstan, Nepal,

Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan resident missions produced
regular newsletters; and several maintained web sites.

At the end of 2001, ADB had 14 resident missions,
one each in Bangladesh, Cambodia, PRC, India,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR,
Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and
Viet Nam; extended missions (nonpermanent representation) in Gujarat, India and Papua New Guinea; and a
Special Office in East Timor. ADB also began work on
establishing a Special Liaison Office in Kabul, Afghanistan.

Country office

ADB officially opened the Philippines Country Office
(PhCO) at ADB headquarters in March 2001. The new
office, with staff dedicated solely to operations in the
Philippines, strengthened client orientation by establishing a streamlined and coordinated communication
channel. Through PhCO, ADB is addressing urban
poverty in Metro Manila; helping the Government
develop the private sector to create jobs and boost
economic growth; providing technical assistance in policy
areas including governance, trade, and environment; and
assisting in capacity building at the national and local
government levels. The 2001 country portfolio review
mission, held in April, focused on improving disbursement
performance and addressing policy reform issues. In
October 2001, ADB and the Government signed a
partnership agreement on poverty reduction.

Regional mission

The South Pacific Regional Mission in Port Vila,
Vanuatu, works with eight ADB DMCs: Cook Islands,
Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. The mission interacts with
governments, civil societies, and the private sector;
engages in policy dialogue; and coordinates aid. In 2001,
the mission undertook country programming for the
Cook Islands and Vanuatu, processed several loan and
technical assistance projects, and administered

11 loan and 22 technical assistance projects, all
performing satisfactorily.

Representative offices

The representative offices in Europe, Japan, and North
America furthered ADB's interests in 2001 by increasing
ADB's visibility in its donor members; mobilizing
resources by promoting cofinancing with official and
commercial sources; and improving awareness of the
private sector through seminars and exhibits, leading
to increased investment in the region.

The European Representative Office (ERO), based in
Germany, organized a conference on Infrastructure and
Poverty Reduction in Asia with the Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau and arranged an ADB Day in cooperation
with the Regional Council of the Rhones-Alpes region in
Lyon. ERO also helped organize the Seventh ADB-OECD
Conference on Asian Perspectives on Technology and
Poverty Reduction in Asia and the Pacific.

The Japanese Representative Office (JRO)
coordinated with organizers of the Third Asia-Europe
Finance Ministers’ Meeting in Kobe in January, where
ADB President Tadao Chino delivered a keynote address

 

07/04/02, 11:40 AM| | 06Strategic-3.p65

entitled “Post-Crisis Economic Recovery in Asia.” To
further strengthen its relationship with nongovernment
organizations (NGOs) in Japan, JRO, in cooperation with
the World Bank and the Japanese Ministry of Finance,
arranged a review meeting on ADB's Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction and World Bank's Japan Social
Development Fund.

The North American Representative Office, covering
Canada and the US, played a key role in coordinating
with the US Government arrangements for the 34"
Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors in Honolulu,
Hawaii, and worked with the United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and other institutions in
coordinating recovery and reconstruction efforts of
post-conflict Afghanistan.

Information management

Several departments and offices help generate and
maintain ADB’s knowledge base.

The Office of External Relations (OER) facilitates
knowledge management and dissemination of ADB’s
operations to internal and external audiences. Efforts to
raise ADB's international profile continued in 2001 through
OER’s work in media relations, publications, web site
(http://www.adb.org), briefings, speech writing, speaking
engagements, photographic services, video production and
distribution, exhibits, and internal information flows.

ADB approved 62 new publications in 2001 and
continued to disseminate ADB documents as part of its
disclosure policy to 157 depository libraries and over
200 NGOs. For recent titles of ADB publications, see
page 264. ADB projects and activities were featured in
the newsmagazine ADB Review. Complementing print
and on-line information, ADB's work was also
documented through video and photographic services.
Internal communications were strengthened by the
quarterly Bank Forum, the Weekly Press Review, and the
Daily News Digest, and regular updates to the resident
missions and representative offices.

Within the Office of Administrative Services, the
Library, with its collection of 200,000 volumes,
continued as ADB's knowledge resource center for print
and electronic information. Educational institutions and
individual researchers from around the world regularly
used the Library's collections and services via the
Internet, telephone, facsimile inquiries, or in-person
visits. On-line services and access continued to be
enhanced in 2001. An upgraded on-line catalog of
library resources was made available to ADB staff at
headquarters, resident/regional missions, and representative offices. The Learning Resources Center (LRC) was

 

106

administratively and physically transferred to the Library
to provide unified access to materials and to assist ADB
staff in upgrading their skills. The LRC will facilitate the
transition to e-learning and distance-learning activities
within ADB and its projects.

ADB's Records Center continued to maintain a
records protection program to ensure that ADB's
operations will continue during emergencies, while the
Archives preserved and made available records of
permanent value to ADB's history.

The Office of Information Systems and Technology
completed a midterm review of its Information Systems
and Technology Strategy for 1998-2002 and began work
on a follow-on strategy to cover 2003 and beyond.
Implementation of the current strategy continued with
the installation of network and server upgrades to
improve network security, including network intrusion
detection capabilities. An integrated server management
system was acquired as part of a larger enterprise
network management system. Computer hardware and
software were procured and installed to provide
enhanced risk management capabilities for ADB's
investment and borrowing operations.

The INTEGRA project was launched in 1999 to
replace ADB's major computer systems with an
integrated, web-enabled environment. The standard
functionality of the new human resources and financial
applications systems was pilot-tested in 2001. The
off-the-shelf packages for these two modules were
further customized to gain the full benefits of streamlined, automated, and integrated business processes.
However, the standard commercial software could not be
customized to meet ADB's operational requirements. This
matter will be further addressed once the human resources
payroll and financial applications are implemented.

A multiyear replacement contract for microcomputers and associated peripheral equipment was initiated to
meet operational needs and keep pace with technology
changes. Extended-term facilities were set up to reduce
the costs and streamline the processes involved in
acquiring and managing personal computer software. A
basic web infrastructure enabled internal collaboration
and communication via the Intranet.

In support of the Resident Mission Policy, complete
information technology installations were provided to
two new resident missions. Telephone systems, servers,
and local area network equipment were upgraded,
and voice and data link capacity was increased in three
resident missions. Data links using virtual private
network technology were implemented in seven resident
missions and videoconferencing equipment was
installed in two others.

07/04/02, 11:40 AMince its last reorganization in 1995, the

Asian Development Bank (ADB) has faced

new challenges, expanded its mandate, and

taken on new and complex policy

initiatives, including the Poverty Reduction

Strategy in 1999. The Long-Term Strategic
Framework (LTSF) 2001-2015, approved in 2001,
consolidates those initiatives and experiences and charts
ADB's agenda for the next 15 years.

Consequently, ADB President Tadao Chino
appointed a steering committee, working group, and
secretariat to assess how best to implement the LTSF.
After consulting with the Board of Directors, stakeholders, and external advisors, the steering committee
recommended and the Board approved a reorganization
plan for ADB.

The new organizational structure will enhance
ADB's effectiveness in meeting the needs of its
developing member countries (DMCs) by strengthening
the relevance of strategic planning and resource
allocation and by ensuring that strong technical
knowledge and skills are spread across ADB. At the
heart of the new structure is a strong country and
subregional focus that will improve the quality of ADB's
assistance to individual DMCs, promote subregional

| | 07Institutional-3.p65. 107

 

cooperation, and, within ADB, strengthen the accountability for all services to the DMCs.

DMCs will be grouped into five geographically
contiguous areas: East and Central Asia, Mekong,
Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. These
departments replace the former projects and programs
departments. Each regional department will be
responsible for implementing ADB's strategic agenda in
the countries it covers. They will undertake a full range
of activities in their respective DMCs, beginning with the
country strategy and program process; extending to
planning, designing, and implementing projects; and
undertaking economic, thematic, and sector work. For
the most part, each regional department will consist of one
operations coordination division, four sector divisions
(infrastructure; agriculture, environment, and natural
resources; social sectors; and governance, finance, and
trade), and resident missions in the DMCs concerned. Each
DMC will have a country team, headed by a principal desk
officer at headquarters or the resident mission.

The reorganization will improve ADB's work in
other ways as well, such as enhancing the efficient
management of knowledge and resources.

The new Regional and Sustainable Development
Department (RSDD) will be responsible for maintaining

 

07/04/02, 11:41 AM

e| 07Institutional-3.p65.

quality and technical excellence across ADB and for
developing and monitoring policies and guidelines for all
thematic and sector work. RSDD will support regional
cooperation and strengthen ADB's role in linking the
region to global networks.

RSDD will also monitor ADB's compliance with its
own policies. An ADB-wide Knowledge Management
Committee will be established to oversee ADB's
program for knowledge products and monitor the
progress in delivering such products. ADB's Private
Sector Group has been strengthened and upgraded to a
department, reflecting ADB's increased emphasis on
private sector development.

The new organizational structure of ADB and the
accompanying changes in the business processes
essential for meeting the goals of the reorganization
became effective on 1 January 2002. For a chart of the
new Structure, see Appendix 6.

Human resource management,
training, and development

In 2001, human resource management programs focused
on attracting, retaining, and motivating staff, and on
developing and implementing human resource policies
to support ADB's goal of reducing poverty. In addition to
recruiting highly qualified professional

and support staff, staff members were redeployed to
help attain the desired skills mix and promote
professional development.

Also in 2001, ADB began a review of its gender
action program and outlined steps to integrate the
program into its strategic policies. The role of the
spouse liaison officer was expanded to include assisting
spouses of new professional staff in settling in Manila.
ADB continued to recognize staff for their meritorious
contribution to ADB’s operations through the Performance Recognition Program and for long-term
employment through the Service Awards.

In line with the Resident Mission Policy,
approved in February 2000, human resource issues in
the resident missions were identified and systems
were implemented to align practices of the resident
missions and the headquarters. Internal and external
recruitment of professional and support staff was
intensified to help each resident mission achieve its
functional requirement.

In the area of training, ADB focused on strengthening existing modules, developing new programs, and
exploring new ways of delivering training sessions.
Modules were added to the mission leadership program,

 

108

e

taking into consideration the widening role and
responsibility of a mission team. A mentoring component was added to the mission leadership program.
Videoconferencing enabled resident mission staff to take
part in orientation seminars. Staff participated in policy
and strategy awareness sessions and structured
technical training in sector and thematic areas,
including poverty analysis and reduction, governance,
economic analysis, resettlement, and microfinance.
Through seminars and general briefings, staff were
familiarized with the new business processes. ADB
continued to send staff to external learning events to
acquire technical skills not provided in-house. Several
staff attending the in-house Masters in Business
Administration program entered their final year.

ADB provided government officials, staff from
other international organizations, and graduate
students an opportunity to learn more about ADB
through the Orientation Program for DMC Officials,
Secondment Program, and the Internship Program,
respectively.

At the end of 2001, ADB had 2,163 staff from 47 of
its 59 members. The total comprised 763 professional
staff! and 1,400 support staff,? of which 295 staff? or
about 13.7% are located in the field offices. During the
year, there were 86 appointments and 55 departures
among professional staff, while 128 support staff joined
ADB and 53 left. The number of women professional
staff increased from 184 or 25.3% of total professional
staff at the end of 2000, to 198 or 26.1% at the end of
2001. For more about careers at ADB, see
http://www.adb.org/Employment.

Compensation

Consistent with ADB's market-driven compensation
system, a 4.3% increase in the professional staff salary
structure was approved (effective 1 January 2002). For
support staff salaries, the local salary survey for 2001
resulted in a 9.6% salary increase effective 1 January
2001 (the salary effectivity date was moved from 1 April
to 1 January to coincide with the fiscal year and the
annual performance evaluation).

Upon recommendation of the Pension Committee,
revisions to the Staff Retirement Plan were approved,
which enhanced the commuted lump sum and the
early retirement benefits. The review of the terms and
service conditions for professional staff in the field
offices continued in 2001 with further streamlining
of the implementation guidelines announced in
June 2001.

07/04/02, 11:41 AMAdministrative services

Security was tightened in 2001: additional security
equipment was installed and close cooperation between
ADB and the Philippine Government and foreign
embassies continued.

Anticipating the reorganization and continuing
efforts to cut costs, ADB further streamlined its business
processes. For example, more paper forms were
converted to electronic templates and the use of ADB's
Intranet was expanded. Shipping and marine insurance
policies and procedures were made more effective and,
as a result, several difficult insurance claims were
resolved satisfactorily. Improvements in business
processes also included prequalifying suppliers and
awarding contracts for procuring various information
technology products.

Inventory and procurement management improved
with enhancement of the new server-based software
system in ADB’s commissary. Commissary services
improved with the assumption of the new management
services contractor.

Budget

Actual internal administrative expenses (IAE) for 2001
amounted to $220.7 million, a saving of $6.2 million
against the original budget of $226.9 million. The
saving resulted mainly from the Philippine currency
depreciation; net saving realized in various operational
and administrative expenses; not using the 1% general
contingency; and effective budget monitoring,
including midyear review of work program and
budget allocations.

The IAE budget for 2002 of $240.0 million is the
first under the reorganized ADB. The budget was
formulated under the LTSF and the Medium-Term
Strategy, with the work programs based on ADB's
3-year rolling work plan outlined in the Work Program
and Budget Framework paper (2002-2004). ADB's 2002
budget is aimed principally at accelerating the translation
of its strategic agenda into tangible outcomes at the
country and subregional levels. Budgetary resources,
therefore, will be targeted primarily at the effective direct
delivery of quality products and services. The 2002
budget's volume growth was contained at 1.8%,
demonstrating ADB's continuing efforts toward strict
budgetary discipline. Major increments for 2002 include
30 new professional staff positions to enhance the
delivery capacity of frontline operations in headquarters
and resident missions, cater to fiduciary and other
requirements of the new London interbank offered rate

In addition to internal administrative expenses, the
2002 budget also includes an annual capital budget of
$4.0 million, mainly for improving infrastructure at ADB
headquarters, enhancing technology and automation
systems, and meeting the field offices’ regular capital
expenditure requirements. For details, see Appendix 9.

Audit and anticorruption

The Office of the General Auditor (OGA) conducts
periodic, independent, and objective appraisals of ADB
activities to ensure adequacy and effectiveness of controls
and to identify the means for improving economy and
efficiency in the use of resources in carrying out ADB's
development mission. OGA is also the focal point in
ADB's drive against corruption and in dealing with
alleged incidents of corruption or fraud in its projects or
by its staff. OGA reports directly to the President. The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews
OGA's activities.

Internal audits in 2001 led to recommendations for
better controlling and supervising building maintenance
work and contractors’ monthly billings; clearing all
outstanding audit recommendations in audited project
accounts in Bangladesh; preparing timely completion
reports and settling advances for project preparation
technical assistance; strengthening follow-up procedures
for loans with overdue payments; implementing
appropriate measures for controlling various administrative processes in the Nepal Resident Mission; and
strengthening control over mail delivery and communications costs. OGA also audited six consultants’
contracts in 2001 with the assistance of appointed
auditors. These audits further strengthened the control
procedures to ensure accurate and factual declaration of
information in the consultants’ financial proposals and
other documents submitted to ADB.

In 2001, OGA implemented measures to streamline
and standardize further various audit functions to
maximize the use of available resources in producing
value-added audit services. To promote interaction with

 

07/04/02, 11:41 AM| 07Institutional-3.p65.

other multilateral development banks (MDBs) and
comply with the requirements for professional practice
in internal auditing, OGA arranged to have internal
auditors from the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) conduct a peer review for
determining the extent to which OGA has implemented
best practices in its audit processes. The question of
carrying out peer reviews has been discussed with other
MDBs on a continuous basis, and OGA is likewise
prepared to conduct such peer review, as it did on EBRD
in 1998.

ADB's Anticorruption Unit (http://www.adb.org/
anticorruption), established in 1999, is the point of
contact for reporting allegations of fraud and corruption
among ADB-financed projects or its staff. To date, the
Anticorruption Unit has investigated more than 190
allegations of fraud and corruption, treating the sources
of allegations with utmost confidentiality and discretion.
In 2001, the Anticorruption Unit increased awareness of
the Anticorruption Policy and the Anticorruption Unit
through presentations, seminars, and publications.

OGA continued to audit project procurement-related
activities, helping prevent and detect corruption or
fraud. OGA also continued to strengthen its exchange of
information with Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) and
other MDBs through meetings, international conferences,
and the annual meeting of MDBs’ auditors general. OGA
has played an active role in helping upgrade the audit
capability of SAIs in DMCs. In 2001, OGA was involved
in training programs for the Asian Organization of

 

Notes

Supreme Audit Institutions and the South Pacific
Association of Supreme Audit Institutions, and
upgrading the audit capabilities of the Government of
the People’s Republic of China and government auditors
in three countries in Central Asia.

OGA continued to participate in the ongoing
implementation of the financial management and human
resource management information system, focusing on
security and control aspects in data conversion and
acceptance testing of the system; the preimplementation
activities of the Treasury Risk Management System to
ensure that security and control aspects are addressed;
fallback tests for the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT, an electronic
funds transfer system) and ADB’s mainframe facilities,
conducted in 2001 at the backup sites; and various
administrative procurements, providing comments and
observations to ensure compliance with procurement
guidelines.

OGA provided integrated assistance to ADB’s
external auditors in their continuing audit of ADB's
annual financial statements throughout the year, and in
certifying interim financial statements for ADB's various
bond offerings. In 2001, the external auditors made a
presentation on developments in International
Accounting Standards and the extent of use and
acceptance of these standards in selected DMCs. The
presentation, attended by various departments, also
provided an overview of developments in financial
reporting in these countries.

he Asian Development Bank (ADB) is an
international development finance institution
whose vision is to make the Asian and Pacific
region free of poverty. ADB was established in
1966 through the “Agreement Establishing the
Asian Development Bank” (the Charter), ratified by
31 countries to promote the social and economic
development of the region. ADB has 59 members
(as of 31 December 2001), of which 43 are in the
region. ADB is rated triple-A by Moody's and
Standard & Poors.

In pursuing its objectives, ADB provides
different forms of financial assistance to its
developing member countries (DMCs). The main
instruments are loans, technical assistance,
grants, guarantees, and equity investments, which
are met through various funding resources. Such
funding resources are ADB's ordinary capital
resources (OCR)—which are the main topic of this
Management's Discussion and Analysis—Special
Funds resources, and other funds. The Charter
requires that each funding resource be kept
separate from the other.

Ordinary capital resources

OCR come from three distinct sources: private
capital markets in the form of borrowings; paid-in
capital provided by government funds; and
accumulated retained income (reserves), which
provide a buffer for risk arising from operations.
Financial policies
The most important financial risk facing ADB as a
multilateral development bank (MDB) is country
credit risk. ADB has devised two policy instruments that provide the operational framework for
addressing this risk: the income and reserves
policy and the liquidity policy. The income and
reserves policy addresses the potential losses
caused by a major default by borrowers, while the
liquidity policy addresses the potential disruption
of access to capital markets, by the same default.
The review of the income and reserves
policy, undertaken by the Board of Directors in
1997, identified ADB’s decisive income indicators—the interest coverage ratio (ICR) and the
reserve:loan ratio (RLR). The ICR is the ratio of
net income to financial expenses plus a factor of
one. It measures the extent to which net income
can fall without jeopardizing ADB’s ability to
service its financial expenses from current

09/04/02, 2:17 PM| | O8MD8A-5.p65,

income. The review concluded that the minimum policy
level for the ICR should be about 1.31. The RLR is the
ratio of total reserves to the sum of outstanding loans,
equity investments, and guarantees. The RLR measures
the adequacy of ADB's earning base relative to its loan
assets. The policy maintains an RLR of about 25%.
In light of deteriorating creditworthiness of most
ADB borrowers resulting from the 1997 Asian financial
crisis, ADB reviewed its OCR loan charges in 1999. A
change in the structure of ADB's OCR loan charges was
recommended and approved by the Board, and became
effective on 1 January 2000. ADB's lending spread for all
outstanding pool-based loans was raised from 40 to
60 basis points. A front-end fee of 1% was introduced
for new loans, and a commitment fee of 0.75% was
adopted for new program loans.
To ensure the adequacy of its risk-bearing capacity,
ADB reviews its income outlook annually. Based on the
review, Management recommends to the Board the
portion of the previous year's actual net income for
allocation to reserves, to ensure that the level of reserves
is commensurate with the policy level. An increase in
loan charges is recommended if net income is deemed
inadequate, and a reduction in loan charges is
recommended if net income is deemed excessive.
ADB's existing liquidity policy requires that at the
end of the year, the liquidity level should not be less
than 40% of the undisbursed balance of loans to ensure
that operations will not suffer from any disruption in
ADB's access to capital markets due to loss of investor
confidence. Such disruption could arise as a result of
protracted arrears by one or more major borrowers. The
existing policy is based on a balance sheet concept, not
a cash flow concept. Accordingly, the policy is being
reviewed with a view to shifting the target level of
liquidity to a more dynamic one.
On 1 July 2001, ADB introduced London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan (LBL) products to meet
the needs of its public and private sector borrowers in
managing interest rate and exchange rate risks. The new
loans provide borrowers with
¢  achoice of currency and interest rate basis;
¢ — options to link the repayment schedules to actual
disbursements for financial intermediary borrowers;
¢ ability to change the original loan terms (currency
and interest rate basis) at any time during the life
of the loans; and

¢ — options to purchase a cap or collar on a floating
lending rate at any time during the life of the loans.

With the introduction of the LBL, the pool-based
multicurrency loans and market-based loans were no
longer offered. ADB will cease offering the pool-based

113

single-currency loan in United States (US) dollars by
1 July 2002.

Basis of financial reporting

Statutory reporting: ADB prepares its financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied in the US. Effective

1 January 2001, ADB adopted Financial Accounting
Standard (FAS) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” along with its
related amendments under FAS No. 138. These two
standards are collectively termed “FAS 133.”

As defined and required by FAS 133, ADB has
marked all derivative instruments to fair value and
reported in the balance sheet with changes in the fair
value recognized in current net income.

Under FAS 133, two options exist in accounting for
derivative instruments: hedge or non-hedge accounting.
In hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of certain
hedge instruments have to be reflected in current income,
while others have to be reflected in other comprehensive
income. In non-hedge accounting, all changes in the fair
value of hedge instruments need to be recognized as
current income. A preliminary assessment using FAS
133 hedge criteria indicates that most of ADB’s
derivative transactions are highly effective in hedging
underlying transactions and are appropriate for its
operations in achieving lower funding costs. At the
same time, however, ADB has also found that applying
FAS 133 hedge criteria is not entirely reflective of risk
management strategies within ADB. Compliance with the
hedge criteria would impose undue constraints on ADB's
future borrowing, loan, and hedge programs, and likely
detract from its focus of minimizing the cost of
borrowings. Therefore, ADB believes it is more important
to continue pursuing the objective of minimizing the
cost of borrowings rather than follow the accounting
definition of a qualifying hedge. The application of FAS
133 qualifying hedge criteria would not make fully
evident economic risks inherent in ADB’s financial
assets and liabilities. Accordingly, ADB chooses to adopt
the non-hedge accounting and recognizes changes in fair
value of derivative instruments in the period as part of
the net income.

Supplemental reporting: ADB manages its balance
sheet by selectively using derivatives to minimize the
interest rate and currency risks associated with its
financial assets and liabilities. It uses derivative
instruments to enhance asset/liability management of
individual positions and portfolios, and to reduce
borrowing costs. As certain financial instruments
(including all derivatives and certain investments) are

assets and liabilities, taking into consideration the
changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and credit
risks. Current value reflects the exit price for financial
instruments with liquid markets and accordingly is
similar in most respects to fair value. For financial
instruments with no market, current value reflects the
expected cash flow streams discounted with the
appropriate interest and exchange rates.

Loan portfolio: The majority of ADB loans are
made to or guaranteed by ADB members. ADB does not
sell its loans, believing that there is no comparable
market for them. The current value of loans incorporates

cash flow, including interest, to ADB. Estimated cash
flows from principal repayments, interest, and other
loan charges are discounted by the applicable market
yield curves for ADB’s funding cost, plus ADB's
lending spread.

The current value also includes ADB’s appropriate
credit risk assessment. To recognize the risk inherent in
these and other potential overdue payments, ADB has
adjusted the value of the loans through its loan loss
provisioning. ADB has never suffered a loss on its public
sector loans, with the exception of opportunity losses
resulting from the difference between the discounted
present value of expected payments for interest and

The positive adjustment of $1.6 billion (5.7%) to
ADB's loan balance—from the FAS 133-reported basis of
$29.1 billion to the current value basis of $30.7 billion—
reflects that the loans in the portfolio, on average, carry
a higher interest rate than the discount rate at which
ADB would currently originate similar loans.

Investments: Under both the reported and current
value bases, the investments held in ADB are carried
and reported at fair value. Fair value is based on market
quotations. In the case of instruments for which market
quotations are not readily available, the current value is
calculated using market-based methodologies.

Equity investments: Equity investments with readily
determinable fair values (i.e., market value) are reported
at fair value. Unlisted equity investments without
market value are reported at cost less allowance for
losses, which represent a fair approximation of the
current value.

Borrowings after swaps: The current value of
these liabilities includes the value of the debt securities
and the financial derivative instruments associated with
the borrowings portfolio. The current value is calculated
using market-based methodologies.

The increase of $1.5 billion—equivalent to 5.8% in
the value of the borrowings portfolio after swaps from
the FAS 133-reported basis of $25.6 billion to the current
value basis of $27.1 billion—represents the fact that the
average cost of the borrowings portfolio is higher than
the rate at which ADB could currently obtain funding.
For borrowings for 1991-2001, see chart on page 120.

Operating activities

In pursuing its objectives, ADB provides financial
assistance to its DMCs through loans, technical assistance,
guarantees, and equity investments to help meet their
development needs.

Loans: Until 30 June 2001, ADB’s three lending
windows for loans from OCR were the pool-based

LIBOR-Based Loan Products

On 1 July 2001, ADB introduced the London interbank
offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan (LBL) products, carrying
a floating lending rate that consists of 6-month LIBOR
and a spread fixed over the life of the loan. The LBL is
a timely response to borrowers’ demand for new ADB
financial loan products that can meet borrowers’ needs
to tailor the currency of the loan and the interest rate
basis to suit project needs and/or external debt risk
management strategies.

The LBL has market-based features, including a fixed
spread and pricing relative to standard market references
that provide a transparent basis for borrowers to compare
the terms of ADB loan products with those of other
lenders and to be amenable to ADB's efficient intermediation on the finest possible terms. With the new LBL
facility, a high degree of flexibility is given to borrowers
in terms of choice of currency and interest rate basis;
options to link repayment schedules to actual disbursements for financial intermediary borrowers; the ability
to change the original loan terms (currency and interest
rate basis) at any time during the life of the loans; and
options to purchase a cap or collar on a floating lending
rate at any time during the life of the loans.

The LBL terms are available for all new loans with
invitation to negotiate issued on or after 1 July 2001.
LBLs are also extended to borrowers that wish to convert
undisbursed amounts of presently effective pool-based
single-currency United States (US) dollar loans, if the
undisbursed balance constitutes at least 40% of the
original loan amount as of 30 June 2001. To become a
full-fledged LIBOR-based lender, however, ADB will retire
all its existing loan products. Since 1 July 2001, the existing
pool-based multicurrency and market-based lending
facilities have no longer been offered; while on 1 July
2002, pool-based single-currency US dollar loans will be
retired. Thus, effective 1 July 2002, ADB's loan product
menu will consist only of LBLs.

Loan currency: Borrowers may choose to denominate their LBLs in Euros, Japanese yen, or US dollars. The
currency selected by the borrower will be the loan
currency, i.e., the currency to be disbursed by ADB and
to be paid by the borrower for its debt service payments.

Interest rate basis: LBLs can be made on a floatingrate basis or on a fixed-rate basis, but initially all LBLs
will have a floating lending rate. In a floating-rate loan,
the lending rate is reset every 6 months on each interest
payment date, referred to also as the lending rate reset

117

date. The lending rate is the cost base rate plus a spread
(the fixed spread) that is fixed in the loan agreement.
The cost base is reset every 6 months, on either the 1*
or 15'" day of the month of a loan’s reset dates. The
fixed spread for public sector borrowers is equal to ADB’s
basic lending spread prevailing at the time of loan signing
(currently 60 basis points), regardless of the loan currency.
The spread for private sector borrowers reflects the credit
risk of the specific project and borrower.

Borrowers may direct ADB to automatically
implement a series of interest rate fixings either by period
or by amount.

Other loan charges: The current commitment
charge of 0.75% and front-end fee of 1% applied to poolbased loans also apply to public sector LBL products.
Other loan charges for private sector loans remain
unchanged.

Rebates and surcharges: Since the principle of
automatic cost pass-through pricing is maintained for
the LBLs, any actual sub-LIBOR funding cost margin will
be returned to public sector borrowers through a rebate.
For this purpose ADB will calculate twice a year (on
1 January and 1 July) its actual average funding cost
margin. A surcharge could arise if ADB’s funding cost is
above the 6-month LIBOR, which is unlikely unless ADB
experiences serious credit deterioration. Rebates or surcharges could also arise due to changes in ADB's basic
lending spread because of changes in the credit quality
of its entire loan portfolio.

Pricing of conversions: For all conversions and
interest rate caps and collars, ADB will pass on to
borrowers the rates or cost of the corresponding hedge
prevailing at the time of executing the conversion. In
addition, a transaction fee applies ranging from 0.0625%
to 0.125% of the principal amount involved. These fees
may change during the life of the loan. By 1 July 2002,
ADB will offer one set of loan products—LBL. Thereafter,
borrowers can focus on three key terms that are central
to external debt management strategy: currency, interest
rate basis, and amortization.

LBLs allow borrowers to tailor cash flows of their loans
to suit their project or overall debt management needs.
Therefore, borrowers should become familiar with the
features of the LBL products as early as possible in the project
cycle. Borrowers must consider the available options for the
loan terms during project preparation and analyze the
advantages and risks well before project appraisal.

multicurrency loan (PMCL) window, the pool-based
single-currency loan (PSCL) window in US dollars, and
the market-based loan (MBL) window. With the
introduction of the LBL products on 1 July 2001, the
PMCL and MBL were no longer offered; while on 1 July
2002, the PSCL in US dollars will be retired. The LBL
facility is a timely response to borrower demand for new
ADB financial loan products that suit project needs and
external debt risk management strategies. LBL products
give borrowers a high degree of flexibility and at the same
time provide low intermediation risk to ADB.

OCR loan approvals, disbursements, repayments,
and prepayments: In 2001, 30 OCR loans totaling
$4.0 billion were approved, compared with 39! OCR
loans totaling $4.1 billion approved in 2000. Of the
2001 amount, 91.2% of the loans went to India,
People’s Republic of China, Pakistan, Indonesia, and
Bangladesh. Disbursements in 2001 totaled $2.8 billion,
a decrease of 1.2% from $2.9 billion in 2000. Principal
repayments for the year were $1.2 billion, of which
$52.5 million represented prepayments on loans. In
2001, three loans were fully prepaid and one loan was
partially prepaid. On 31 December 2001, cumulative
loans outstanding after allowance for losses amounted
to $28.7 billion.

Status of loans: Three public sector OCR loans
(two to Myanmar and one to Nauru) and 12 private
sector loans were in nonaccrual status at the end of
2001. The total outstanding balances of these public and
private sector loans were $3.1 million and $75.4 million,
respectively. The combined total of $78.5 million
comprised 0.3% of the total OCR loans outstanding.

Lending rates: The lending rates for the PMCL and
PSCL US dollar loan windows are determined on the
basis of the previous semester's average cost of
borrowings plus a lending spread (60
basis points since 1 January 2000).
The MBL window provides singlecurrency loans in US dollars,
Japanese yen, or Swiss francs to

ADB's pool-based variable

lending rates for the first half of 0.5
2001 were 5.50% per annum for
multicurrency loans and 6.70% per 0

for multicurrency loans decreased to 5.21% per annum,
while the rate for US dollar loans remained at 6.70%
per annum.

The lending rates for MBLs are determined on the
basis of the 6-month LIBOR on 1 January and 1 July plus
a lending spread. The lending spread for MBL loans to
financial intermediaries in the public sector is the same
as that applicable for OCR pool-based public sector
loans. For private enterprises, the lending spread is
determined on a case-to-case basis to cover ADB's risk
exposure to particular borrowers and projects. See
Lending Rates table at right.

Four LBLs became effective in December 2001,
three in US dollars and one in Japanese yen. The lending
rates are determined on the basis of the 6-month LIBOR
by reference to each loan disbursement date, plus a
lending spread. The lending spread for public sector
loans is 60 basis points, while the spread for private
sector loans varies. The daily 6-month LIBOR for US
dollars and Japanese yen are shown in the chart below.

Technical assistance: ADB considers technical
assistance programs as an important part of ADB’s
overall operations in helping DMCs meet their
development objectives. From 1967 to 1992, technical
assistance expenses were charged to OCR as well as to
other technical assistance funding resources—Technical
Assistance Special Fund, Japan Special Fund, and other
trust/grant funds. In 2001, ADB's Board of Directors
approved the financing of high priority technical
assistance programs out of OCR current income within a
rolling 4-year financing framework. The amount of
financing required varies between years and will be
subject to the approval of the Board of Directors.

Guarantees: ADB provides guarantees as credit
enhancements for eligible projects to cover risks that

the private sector cannot easily absorb or manage on its
own. Reducing these risks can make a significant
difference in mobilizing debt funding for projects. ADB
has used its guarantee instruments successfully for
infrastructure projects, financial institutions, capital
markets, and trade finance. The guarantee instruments
are recognized as off-balance sheet financial instruments
in ADB's annual financial statements.

ADB offers two guarantee products—political risk
guarantees and partial credit guarantees—both designed
to mitigate risk exposure of commercial lenders and
capital market investors. These guarantees are not
issued on a stand-alone basis but are provided for
projects where ADB has direct participation. ADB can
cooperate with other multilateral, official, and private
sector entities in providing
its guarantee products.

Political risk guarantees: ADB's political risk
guarantee (PRG) program is designed to facilitate
cofinancing by providing lenders/capital market
investors of an ADB-assisted project with cover
against specifically defined political risks. Coverage is
available against any combination of the risks in the
nature of expropriation, currency inconvertibility or
nontransferability, political violence, and breach of
contract, and is available for loans and other debt
instruments, but not equity instruments. Equity instruments are ineligible for PRG coverage. Tenors are based
on the underlying project merits. All or part of outstanding
debt service obligations to a lender may be covered. The
cover may be for principal and/or interest payment
obligations. For private sector projects, ADB can issue a
PRG without a counterguarantee from the host
government. However, PRG exposure to a private sector
project without a counterguarantee from the host
government is subject to a maximum of $150 million or
50% of the project cost, whichever is lower. Fees,
payable in advance, are market-based and comprise a
guarantee fee, a front-end fee, and a standby fee. ADB's
PRG is callable when a guaranteed event has occurred and
resulted in debt service default to the guaranteed lender.

119

In 2001, ADB concluded three PRG transactions,
two of which were in the private sector—one each in
Bangladesh ($70 million) and Sri Lanka ($31 million) to
support power projects. In these, ADB's PRG covered
breach of contract to commercial cofinanciers. These
transactions were backed by the respective host country’s
counterguarantee. The third transaction was in the
public sector to promote and gain access to trade
finance by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
in Pakistan ($150 million). ADB’s PRG now allows
eligible banks to confirm offshore letters of credit issued
by select local banks from Pakistan.

Partial credit guarantees: The partial credit
guarantee (PCG) provides comprehensive cover
(commercial and political risks) for a specific portion of
the debt provided by cofinanciers. PCG cover is
particularly useful for projects in DMCs with restricted
access to financial markets, but which ADB considers
creditworthy and financially sound. Since the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, borrowers, project sponsors, cofinanciers,
and host governments have aimed to hedge currency
mismatch risks by using the revenue currency as the
borrowing currency. ADB’s PCGs can cover local
currency debt, including domestic bond issues or longterm loans from local financial institutions. For private
sector transactions not supported by a counterguarantee
from the host government, the exposure limit is
$75 million or 25% of the project cost, whichever is less.
Guarantee fees for private sector transactions are
determined by the market. Guarantee fees for transactions backed by a host government guarantee comprise
a standard counterguarantee fee of 40 basis points
(0.4%) per annum on the present value of the outstanding
guarantee obligation plus a front-end fee to cover ADB's
processing costs. Fees can be charged either to the
borrower or lender. One PCG project in the public sector
was approved in 2001 to support the SME Sector
Development Program in Sri Lanka.

ADB is committed to further develop the regional
bond markets by using its guarantee products. ADB's
guarantee instruments are reliable in catalyzing capital
flows to its DMCs by providing necessary credit
enhancements. ADB’s total exposure toward loan
guarantees is disclosed in Note E to the OCR Financial
Statements.

Private sector equity investments and loans: The
Charter allows ADB to use the OCR to make total equity
investments in private enterprises up to 10% of its
unimpaired paid-in capital with reserves and surplus,
exclusive of special reserve. As of 31 December 2001,
there were 61 companies in which ADB held equity
only, 23 in which it provided loans only, and

 

09/04/02, 2:17 PM| O8MD8A-5.p65,

21 companies where it provided both equity and loans.
The total equity portfolio for both outstanding and
undisbursed approved facilities amounted to $449.2 million, including $0.5 million relating to the Japan Special
Fund at year-end 2001. This represents about 3.5% as
against the 10% ceiling defined by the Charter.

At the end of 2001, the overall private sector
portfolio (equity investments and loans) was about
$1.2 billion, which is within the operational limit of
$1.5 billion set by the Board of Directors. As an interim
arrangement, pending the implementation of a more
objective capital allocation methodology, approvals of
private sector operations in excess of $1.5 billion are
allowed beginning in September 2001. It is also ADB's
policy to limit a single project exposure (aggregate
equity investment and loan) to the lesser of $75 million
or 25% of total project cost. In 2001, ADB approved
equity investments amounting to $30.4 million in three
projects. These were $0.4 million in NDB Housing Bank
Limited in Sri Lanka; $25 million in the Lombard Thailand
Intermediate Fund, LLC; and $5 million in the Mekong
Enterprise Fund, a regional project.

Equity

Total shareholders’ equity, after reclassifying the
notional maintenance value of $0.4 million as of

31 December 2000, grew from $10.4 billion as of

31 December 2000 to $10.9 billion as of 31 December
2001. This was primarily due to 2001 net income after
appropriation of guarantee fee to special reserve of
$862.0 million, offset by unfavorable translation
adjustments of $289.5 million, and unfavorable
movement in the exchange rates and notional
maintenance value of $174.7 million.

In addition to subscribed and paid-in capital, capital
backing in the form of callable capital can be called
only if required to meet ADB's obligations incurred on
borrowings or guarantees under the OCR. As of 31
December 2001, the callable shares subscribed
amounted to $40.6 billion.

Borrowings

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved a
borrowing program of $3.4 billion equivalent for

28 May 2001 to 30 April 2002. As in previous years,
implementing the borrowing program for 2001/2002
focused on the core objective of ensuring the
availability of long-term funds at the lowest cost
possible for ADB's lending operations. Accordingly, in
2001, ADB employed a selective bond issuance
funding strategy, concentrating mainly on private
placement transactions that offer cost-efficient

funding. Under this strategy, in July 2001 ADB
established a $20 billion Global Debt Issuance Facility
(GDIF) designed to increase its responsiveness to
opportunities in the private placement market.

The newly established GDIF allowed ADB to issue
bonds at short notice and in a currency, size, and
structure that matched investors’ needs. As a result, in
2001 ADB completed a total of 15 structured private
placement transactions under the GDIF, raising about
$700 million in long-term funds. Interest rate and
currency swaps allowed ADB to transform these
structured borrowings into plain “vanilla” liabilities on a
fully hedged basis. Aside from the private placement
transactions, ADB also raised about $500 million
through two public offerings in July 2001, bringing total
2001 medium- and long-term borrowings to about
$1.2 billion. First, ADB issued a 10-year A$500 million
bond in Australia’s domestic debt market; with a
10-year maturity, the issue became the longest maturity
deal launched by a supranational entity in that market.
Second, ADB reopened its existing 6.75%, $1.0 billion
global bond due 2007 in the amount of $250 million,
increasing the outstanding principal to $1.2 billion.

The average life of long-term borrowings undertaken in 2001 was about 6.2 years, compared with 5.6
years in 2000. As part of its market diversification
strategy, ADB borrowed in three currencies, with
Australian dollars accounting for about 41%, US dollars
38%, and Japanese yen 21%. After swaps, almost all the
2001 borrowings were converted into US dollar floatingrate liabilities. Aside from the medium- and long-term
borrowings, ADB also raised short-term funds totaling
$1.2 billion through Euro-commercial paper (ECP)
issuance. As of the end of 2001, only $400 million of
ECPs were outstanding. These ECPs will be refinanced
by long-term borrowings in 2002.

The remainder of the borrowing program for 2001/
2002, amounting to $2.2 billion, will be implemented

during January-April 2002. Aside from the private
placement strategy, ADB, in 2002, will focus on
maintaining its strong presence in key currency bond
markets through regular benchmark global bond issuance.

Liquidity portfolio management

The liquidity portfolio helps ensure the uninterrupted
availability of funds to meet loan disbursements, debt
servicing, and other cash requirements. It also contributes
to ADB's earning base.

The Investment Authority, which is approved by the
Board of Directors, governs liquid asset investments. Its
primary objective is to ensure the security and liquidity
of funds invested, as ADB seeks to maximize returns on
its liquidity portfolio investment.

ADB's investments are made in the same currencies
as received. In compliance with its Charter, ADB does
not convert currencies for investment. At present, liquid
investments are held in 18 currencies.

ADB's liquid assets are held in obligations of
governments and other official entities, time deposits,
and other unconditional obligations of banks and
financial institutions, and, to a limited extent, in
corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and assetbacked securities of high credit quality.

The liquid assets are held in three subportfolios—
core portfolio, operational cash portfolio, and cash
cushion portfolio—all of which have different risk
profiles and performance benchmarks. The average size of

the liquidity portfolios during 2000 and 2001 is presented in
the table above.

The core portfolio is funded by equity and invested
to ensure that the primary objective of a liquidity buffer
is met. Cash inflows and outflows are minimized to
achieve the core portfolio’s objective of maximizing the
total return relative to a defined risk tolerance level. The
portfolio performance is measured against external
benchmarks with an average duration of about 2 years.

The operational cash portfolio is designed to meet net
cash requirements over a 1-month period. It is funded by
equity and invested in short-term, highly liquid money
market instruments. The portfolio performance is
measured against short-term external benchmarks.

The cash cushion portfolio holds the proceeds of
ADB's borrowing transactions pending disbursements.
The portfolio is invested in short-term instruments and
its performance is measured against short-term external
benchmarks.

Risk management: Implementing the new
investment strategy substantially changed the treasury
risk management requirements of ADB's investment
portfolio, requiring new monitoring measures and
reporting systems. In 2001, ADB selected and began
installing an advanced treasury risk management
system, the software components of which will enable
the Risk Management Division to enhance the current
level of risk identification, measurement, and analysis.
New tools will be introduced to measure market and
credit risks, including various value-at-risk methodologies, stress-tests, and risk-adjusted performance and

attribution measures. The risk management system will
generate greater operational efficiency by introducing
“straight-through-processing,” linking the Treasurer's
Department's front, middle, and back offices. Software
implementation will be completed in late 2002.

In ADB's private sector operations, the Risk
Management Unit has two main functions: special assets
management to give special attention to the most
vulnerable private sector projects; and credit review
to evaluate and give an independent credit judgment,
separate from the dealing officer's judgment on
each project.

ADB is currently reviewing its ADB-wide risk
management.

Summary of financial performance and
allocation of net income

Income and expenses: Gross income decreased by
2.7%, from $2.3 billion in 2000 to $2.2 billion in 2001
because of a decrease in loan and other income. Of the
total gross income, $1.8 billion was generated by the
loan portfolio, $403.4 million by the investment portfolio,
and $21.6 million from other sources (see Selected
Financial Data on page 114).

Total operating expenses were $1.5 billion, down
by $152.3 million, or 9.1% from the previous year of
$1.7 billion. The reduction in expenses was because of a
$142.6 million decrease in interest and financial
expenses, a $33.5 million decrease in administrative
expenses,” a $3.9 million increase in the provision for
losses, and technical assistance financing for 2001 of
$19.9 million. The provision for losses was higher for
2001 ($9.8 million), compared with 2000 ($5.9 million)
primarily because of exceptional loss provisions
established during 2001 as a result of operational
difficulties in some investee companies and private
sector borrowers. The reduction in administrative
expenses resulted primarily from the offset of front-end
fees of $34.8 million earned in 2001. Total operating
expenses accounted for 68.0% of the gross income,
compared with 72.8% in 2000.

For the year ending 31 December 2001, the
reported net income was $863.3 million, compared with
$625.7 million in 2000. The increase of $237.6 million
(representing 38.0% increase) in net income is predominantly attributable to the following.

. Income of $147.5 million related to FAS 133
adjustments reflected the initial adoption of this
standard on 1 January 2001 and the year-to-date
marked to fair value of ADB's derivative
instruments. The FAS 133 adjustment is limited to

122

 

the change in value of derivative instruments as

opposed to all financial instruments.
¢ The remaining increase in income of $90.1 million

related primarily to a reduction in interest and
financial expenses, as well as administrative
expenses.

FAS 133 adjustments: Of the FAS 133 adjustment
of $147.5 million, $34.7 million reflected the initial
transition entry on adoption of FAS 133 and $153.5 million represented the change in the values of the
derivatives during the period. These amounts have been
offset by amortization of the FAS 133 transition
adjustments during 2001 of $40.7 million. The $153.5 million gain on derivatives arose predominantly because of
several US dollar interest rate swaps with fixed interest
receivable and floating interest payable. The significant
fall in US dollar interest rates during 2001 meant that
these derivatives gained significant value.

The adjustment to current value removes the
impact related to the adoption of FAS 133, as these
effects are already accounted for in the current value
adjustment.

Current value income: For 2001, net income was
$472.6 million under the current value basis, compared
with the pre-FAS 133 income of $715.8 million. The
decrease under the current value method was attributed
to the unfavorable currency translation adjustment for
the period, which outweighed the gain on investment
holding and the gain resulting from the downward
movement of interest rates.

Allocation of net income: During the year, in
accordance with the income and reserves policy
approved in 1997, ADB reviewed its income outlook and
allocation of 2000 net income. Based on the review, the
Board of Governors approved that the entire amount of
$625.7 million of the 2000 net income be allocated to
reserves. The Board of Directors approved that in 2001,
ADB be allowed to convert an equivalent amount of
$600 million of nondollar operating currencies into US
dollars; and that there should be no generalized change
in OCR loan charges.

Special Funds

ADB is authorized by its Charter to establish and
administer Special Funds. Special Funds being
administered as of 31 December 2001 were the Asian
Development Fund (ADF); the Technical Assistance
Special Fund (TASF); the Japan Special Fund (JSF),
including the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility
(ACCSF); and the ADB Institute Special Fund.

Asian Development Fund

The ADF is the concessional lending window of ADB
that provides loans to its DMCs with low per capita
gross national product and limited debt repayment
capacity. The governments of 27 donor members
(regional and nonregional) have contributed to the ADF,
which is the only multilateral source of concessional
assistance dedicated exclusively to the needs of Asia
and the Pacific. The ADF supports activities that
promote poverty reduction and improve quality of life
of ADB’s poorer DMCs. The ADF is, therefore, an
important instrument of multilateral cooperation for
achieving poverty reduction through equitable and
sustainable development in the poorest countries of Asia
and the Pacific.

ADF VIII: On completing their negotiations in
Okinawa, Japan, on 7 September 2000, donors
recommended a level of ADF operations for 2001-2004
of $5.65 billion. Of this, $2.79 billion will come from
new donor contributions, and an additional $0.12 billion
will be generated from the acceleration of encashments
in accordance with the schedule agreed by the donors.
The $2.74 billion balance will be met from the commitment authority derived from repayments of earlier loans.
In December 2000, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolution No. 276, which set out the replenishment
terms and conditions. ADF VIII became effective on

14 June 2001 when the total amount of Instruments of
Contribution deposited with ADB for unqualified
contributions reached an amount equivalent to
SDRI1,028,652,262 ($1,405,068,014 at the Resolution
exchange rates), thereby exceeding the trigger amount
for effectiveness, equal to 50% of all pledged
contributions (including the contribution of Hong
Kong, China, which was not reflected in the Resolution
table of contributions, and New Zealand's increased
contribution).

By the end of 2001, ADF VIII Instruments of
Contribution had been received from 16 donors, for a
total of $1,845,752,514.> Fourteen of those donors—
Australia; Austria; France; Hong Kong, China; Japan;
Republic of Korea; The Netherlands; New Zealand;
Norway; Singapore; Sweden; Switzerland; Turkey; and
United Kingdom—deposited untied Instruments of
Contribution. Canada and Taipei,China deposited
Instruments of Contribution containing a qualification,
as permitted by the Resolution, that all installment
payments except the first were subject to budgetary
appropriations. For details of amounts released for
operational commitment in 2001, see the column labeled
“Addition” in Table 31 in the Statistical Annex.

ADF VII: The sixth ADF replenishment (ADF VII)
was intended to cover 1997-2000. At the end of the
period, a few installment payments were still outstanding.
Italy and Australia paid their fourth installments, totaling
$48.70 million, in February 2001 and May 2001,
respectively. In March 2001, the US released $71.84 million as partial payment of its third installment. These
resources became part of the ADF VIII commitment
authority in 2001. Since the US paid only part of its third
installment and none of its fourth installment, four
donors—Austria, France, Germany, and Malaysia—
exercised their pro rata rights and did not release their
fourth installments for operational commitment. The
total amount withheld was $58.71 million.

ADF loan approvals, disbursements, and
repayments: In 2001, 46 ADF loans totaling $1.4 billion
were approved, compared with 49 ADF loans totaling
$1.6 billion approved in 2000. Of the 2001 amount,
about 56% went to Pakistan, Viet Nam, and Bangladesh,
in order of magnitude. Disbursements during 2001
totaled $1,024.3 million, a decrease of 9.8% from
$1,135.0 million in 2000. At the end of the year,
cumulative disbursements from ADF resources were
$17.6 billion. Loan repayments during the year
amounted to $219.3 million, and cumulative repayments
were $1.6 billion. As of 31 December 2001, ADF loans
outstanding amounted to $14.8 billion. The table at left
indicates the availability and use of ADF resources in 2001.

nonaccrual status at the end of 2001.
Total outstanding ADF loans to
Afghanistan amounted to $27.7 million, to Myanmar $414.4 million, and
to the private sector $5.2 million,
together comprising about 3.0% of the

Portfolio position: The ADF
investment portfolio amounted to
$2.6 billion at the end of 2001,
compared with $2.3 billion at the end
of 2000. About 15% of the portfolio
was invested in bank deposits, and
85% in floating and fixed income
securities. The financial rate of return
on ADF investments rose to 5.4% in
2001 from 5.2% in 2000.

Technical Assistance Special
Fund

JSF: Reducing Poverty in East Timor,
Educating Children in Viet Nam

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) continued to support ADB's efforts to reduce
poverty.

In East Timor, ADB’s first technical assistance—funded through the
JSF—will enhance the country's capacity to make more informed decisions
about its post-independence needs. A Memorandum of Understanding
between the East Timor Transitional Administration, ADB, World Bank
and the United Nations Development Programme for the design and
implementation of a joint poverty assessment was a first step in
developing a collaborative poverty reduction strategy for East Timor.
The poverty assessment included surveys at the household, village, and
community levels.

In Viet Nam, rural students, including ethnic minorities in remote areas,
will have better access to quality secondary education because of a $600,000
technical assistance grant provided by ADB using JSF monies. Vietnamese
Government officials, a representative of the Government of Japan, and
ADB staff signed a technical assistance agreement in September in Hanoi,
which cleared the way for preparing papers on key education issues,
including a detailed proposal for the Upper Secondary Education
Development Loan Project. At the signing ceremony, officials stressed the
importance of investing in education as a way to empower the poor and
reduce poverty, noting that education empowers the poor to boost their
incomes and leave the pain of poverty behind.

contribution, the uncommitted balance available for future

Review of activities: In April 2001, the Board of
Directors approved the reintroduction of the use of
ordinary capital resources (OCR) current income for
financing part of technical assistance operations. Thus,
no reallocation was made from the OCR surplus account
to the TASF. During the year, Pakistan made its 24'"
direct voluntary contribution to the TASF and India
made its 17", amounting to about $70,000 and $47,000,
respectively. These were made on a wholly untied basis.
At the end of 2001, total TASF resources amounted
to $911.0 million (see table). Of this, $829.7 million had
been committed, leaving an uncommitted balance of
$81.3 million. For details, see Table 32 in the Statistical Annex.
Operations and resource position: Technical
assistance committed (approved and effective) decreased
from $80.5 million in 2000 to $34.7 million in 2001, with
74 technical assistance projects effective during the year.
In 2001, $5.5 million ($13.4 million in 2000), representing
completed and canceled technical assistance projects, was
written back as a reduction in technical assistance for the
period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment
was eliminated. Revenue from investment increased from
$9.7 million in 2000 to $10.9 million in 2001, due to
favorable fair value changes. As a result of decreased

 

124

commitments decreased from $115.5 million in 2000 to
$81.3 million in 2001. In terms of technical assistance
approved during the year, the TASF contributed 40.8% of
funding for total technical assistance. For details, see Table
24 in the Statistical Annex.

At the end of 2001, TASF investments stood at
$185 million, down by $54 million from 2000. Other

Japan Special Fund

Review of activities: The technical assistance grants
funded by the JSF continued to support ADB operations
aimed at reducing poverty. In March 2001, the
Government of Japan contributed 3.7 billion yen

($30.9 million equivalent) as a regular contribution to
the JSF. As of 31 December 2001, Japan's cumulative
contribution to the JSF, since its inception in 1988,
totaled 94.3 billion yen (about $813.5 million equivalent),
comprising regular contributions of 76.3 billion yen and
supplementary contributions of 18.0 billion yen. In 2001,
ADB approved 96 technical assistance grants for JSF
funding totaling $53.8 million. The uncommitted balance
as of 31 December 2001 was $39.3 million. For details,
see Tables 24 and 33 in the Statistical Annex.

Sectoral activities: In 2001, the JSF financed 37%
of the total amount of technical assistance approved by
ADB, including 72% of the total amount of project
preparatory technical assistance approved during the
year. The breakdown of JSF approvals by sector is shown
in the table below.

Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility

Review of activities: The ACCSF was established in
March 1999 for a 3-year period as an independent
component of the JSF. The ACCSF is administered by ADB
and funded entirely by the Government of Japan as part of
its financial assistance under the New Miyazawa Initiative
to countries in the region most affected by the Asian
financial crisis: Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
Philippines, and Thailand. The ACCSF modalities comprise

interest payment assistance (IPA), technical assistance
grants, and guarantees. The ACCSF assistance must be
approved within the 3-year period after the ACCSF was
established (i.e., not beyond 23 March 2002).

At the end of 2001, Japan’s cumulative contributions
for the IPA and technical assistance components of the
ACCSF amounted to 27.5 billion yen ($241.0 million
equivalent). In 2001, ADB approved 16 technical
assistance grants for ACCSF funding amounting to
$16.1 million (see tables below). The uncommitted
balance of ACCSF funds for IPA and technical assistance
was $89.1 million as of 31 December 2001. For details,
see Tables 24 and 34 in the Statistical Annex.

ACCSF financing is targeted at activities that
support policy dialogue, human resource development,
institutional strengthening, and other relevant efforts
focusing on bank and corporate debt restructuring;
create or develop sound financial monitoring, supervision, and regulation; enhance public sector and
corporate governance; develop social safety nets; and
protect the environment.

The Government of Japan also deposited a
promissory note for 360.0 billion yen ($2.7 billion
equivalent) in the ACCSF custodian account, which may
be encashed to meet a call on any guarantees issued
under the ACCSF. Although opportunities for using

ADB Institute Special Fund

The costs for operating the ADB Institute are met from
the ADB Institute Special Fund (ADBISF), which is
administered by ADB in accordance with the Statute of
ADB Institute. Japan made its fifth and sixth contributions
in the aggregate amount of 2.2 billion yen (equivalent to
$18.5 million) in March and August 2001. For details, see
ADBISF-3 in Financial Statements.

As of 31 December 2001, cumulative commitments
amounted to 7.5 billion yen (equivalent to about
$61.5 million) excluding translation adjustments. Of total
contributions received, $52.8 million had been used as
of 31 December 2001, mainly for research and capacitybuilding activities, including organizing symposiums,
forums, and training; preparing research reports,
publications, and web sites; and associated administrative expenses.

As of 31 December 2001, the balance of net current
assets available for future projects and programs of ADB
Institute was about $8.7 million.

Other funds managed by ADB

In addition to the OCR and Special Fund resources, ADB
also manages and administers the funds for the Japan
Scholarship Program (JSP), Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction (FPR), Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology (JFICT), and channel financing
of grants provided by bilateral donors to support technical
assistance and soft components of loans. However, these
funds do not become part of ADB's own resources.

Japan Scholarship Program

The JSP was established in 1988 to provide an opportunity
for well-qualified citizens of DMCs to undertake
postgraduate studies in economics, management,
science and technology, and other development-related
fields at selected educational institutions in Asia and the
Pacific. The JSP is funded by the Government of Japan
and administered by ADB. Currently, 18 institutions in
10 countries participate in the JSP.

Between 1988 and 2001, the Government of Japan
contributed more than $46.1 million to the JSP. A total
of 1,334 scholarships were awarded to recipients from
34 member countries. Of these, 99 have already
completed their courses. Women received 389 scholar
 

126

ships. The number of new scholarships awarded
annually has grown from 49 in 1988 to 170 in 2001.

Channel financing arrangements

Official grant cofinancing plays a vital role in ADB
operations, particularly in view of the continuing
constraints on TASF and ADF resources. These grant
funds support ADB's technical assistance program and
finance soft components of its loan projects.

A majority of such grants are provided by bilateral
donors under channel financing arrangements (CFAs).
ADB acts as administrator of the funds and applies its
own guidelines and procedures in recruiting consultants,
procurement, disbursement, and project supervision.

Under a CFA, the donor enters into a comprehensive
agreement with ADB whereby the donor provides an
untied grant fund to be administered by ADB (but the
fund does not become part of ADB's own resources); the
donor indicates its preferred sectors and recipient
countries in the use of the fund; ADB regularly provides
the donor with a list and description of proposed
technical assistance projects that satisfy the donor's
preferences; and the donor and ADB agree on the
specific activities to be financed under the fund. Funds
provided under a CFA are transferred to an interestbearing account and may also be invested by ADB
pending disbursement. A donor is provided with regular
financial statements and progress reports on the use of
the fund. ADB is responsible for project preparation,
processing, and administration. CFAs may be replenished with additional funds at the donor's discretion.

The primary advantage of CFAs is that funding for
several individual technical assistance projects may be
provided under a single agreement. Accordingly, they
minimize the need for detailed negotiations on a caseby-case basis and foster administrative efficiency. The first
CFA was negotiated in 1980. Since then, ADB has entered
into CFAs with 14 bilateral donors: Australia, Belgium,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, The Netherlands,
New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom. To date, 151 technical assistance
grants have been financed under CFAs with a cumulative
amount of about $73.7 million.

In addition to the traditional type of CFA (which
may be used for several sectors), the processing of
thematic CFAs with bilateral agencies rose sharply in
2001 in such areas as renewable energy, climate
change, poverty reduction, governance, and water.
Several thematic CFAs are now being packaged as
umbrella facilities to allow more than one donor to
contribute. The traditional CFAs approved in 2001
include the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate

JSP: Helping Students Get a Quality Education

To Dinh Kho, a Vietnamese student at the Asian Institute of Technology,
credits the Japan Scholarship Program (JSP) for helping him get a good
education. He notes that because of the JSP he has been able “to acquire
more knowledge” that will benefit his country as well as his career. Because
of an increase in the budget, nearly 300 scholarship slots were available
in 2001, an increase of 20 over the number in 2000. The JSP continues to
attract many applicants and is considered by the designated institutions
as one of the most successful scholarship programs in Asia and the Pacific.

JFPR Projects Are Recognized for Their Innovation

Projects funded under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) have

been recognized by stakeholders in the following ways.

* During the signing ceremonies for the JFPR-funded On-Site Integrated
Urban Upgrading for Vulnerable Slum Communities in Payatas (Manila
dumpsite), Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and ADB
President Tadao Chino noted the importance of the JFPR in supporting
self-help activities.

* The Uzbekistan Government sought urgent assistance from the JFPR for
a project to reduce poverty in Khorezem in the Aral Sea basin after noting
the innovative JFPR project to create jobs and provide drinking water
in Karakalpakstan.

* A JFPR project on girl street children at risk of sexual abuse in Indonesia
received widespread international media attention.

* In the six countries that make up the Greater Mekong Subregion, the
JFPR-funded project Community Action for Prevention of HIV/AIDS
received strong support from governments, media, and the community,
particularly in Cambodia and Viet Nam.

¢ JFPR support for improving nutrition of poor children and mothers with
iodized salt and fortified wheat in Central Asia was welcomed by the
six participating countries, the private sector, and nongovernment organizations.

* Recognition of the JFPR as an innovative tool for fighting poverty in
Asia has spread through increased coverage by the international media
and has often been cited by ADB Directors.

Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction

In support of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy, the Government of Japan
established in May 2000 the JFPR with
an initial grant contribution of

10 billion yen (about $92.6 million). An
additional contribution from the
Government of Japan of 7.9 billion yen
(about $65 million) was announced in
early 2001. By 31 December 2001, ADB
had approved 13 JFPR projects
amounting to $31.5 million. In addition,
the Government of Japan has
preapproved 8 more projects totaling

projects include activities on nutrition
for poor children and mothers in
Central Asia, preventive measures
against HIV/AIDS in the Greater
Mekong Subregion, upgrading housing
facilities for two slum areas in the
Philippines, helping girl street children
at risk in Indonesia, participatory
watershed management for poverty
reduction along the Yellow River in
the People’s Republic of China,
livelihood improvement in connection
with a rural infrastructure loan in the
Philippines, income-generating
activities for the poor through small

water and employment generation. For details, see Table 35
in the Statistical Annex.

Characteristics and eligibility: The JFPR provides a
unique opportunity to pilot-test new approaches that
directly target the poor and can later be scaled up for
use in mainstream ADB operations. The JFPR also
provides more opportunities to work directly with
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and communitybased organizations in their efforts to reduce poverty.
The JFPR finances projects that directly target poverty
reduction and that have a strong relation and clear
conceptual link to the regular ADB-financed activities.

09/04/02, 2:17 PM| O8MD8A-5.p65,

It is also expected that JFPR projects will enhance the
quality and impact of ADB-financed projects that they
support. Priority is given to activities that have an
innovative and demonstrative character. Project proposals
must meet all of the following eligibility criteria. They
must directly target the poor; possess a clear conceptual
link to an ADB loan;* show sustainable impact on
poverty reduction; promote maximum community and
NGO involvement, including the possibility of disbursing
to NGOs directly as implementing agencies; demonstrate
an innovative approach to poverty reduction that is
operationally relevant for future ADB loans; and veer
from being a substitute for traditional ADB loan and
technical assistance, or for typical government financing.

Impact: The JFPR has opened the door for
innovative poverty-targeted approaches that can be
mainstreamed into the broader pipeline of ADB loans.
Because of its flexibility in the use of funds but insistence
that most funding should directly impact on the poor,
the JFPR provides opportunities to work with civil society
and show that the poor are bankable for ADB loans.
The strength of the JFPR is its implementation and
partnership on the ground and its direct target at poverty
in connection with ADB loans. Through this approach,
the poor, the governments, and ADB staff can see the
impact of the JFPR grant and its relevance to future loan
investments, and gain practical experience that could
not be facilitated through technical assistance alone. As
a result, some DMC governments have considered in
loan preparations the innovative poverty-focused features
that have been piloted under the JFPR. For example, in
Bangladesh, a JFPR project provides input for designing
a new water resource development loan; and in
Uzbekistan, discussions on JFPR projects have initiated
demand for a new ADB loan on drought-prone areas in
the Aral Sea basin. Another impact of the JFPR is its
close cooperation with NGOs and other funding agencies
such as in Indonesia with various local NGOs from
Yogjakarta; in the Philippines with Mindanao Coalition
of Development NGOs, Philippine Business for Social
Progress, and the Vincentian Missionaries; in Tajikistan
with the Aga Khan Foundation; and in Uzbekistan with
the United Nations Development Programme. Also, JFPR
projects opened new areas for ADB cooperation such as
in slum development, housing-related poverty, social

 

protection for disabled poor people, rural infrastructure
for livelihood improvement of the poor and watershedrelated poverty, and cooperation with the private sector
to improve nutrition for poor mothers and children.

Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology

The JFICT was established in July 2001 for a 3-year
period to harness the potential of information and
communication technology (ICT) and bridge the growing
digital divide in Asia and the Pacific. ADB will administer
the JFICT, which is financed with a contribution of
1,273.3 million yen (approximately $10.7 million) from
the Japanese Government.

In line with ADB’s strategic approach for ICT, the
JFICT-funded projects will have a strong relation to, and
enhance the effectiveness and impact of, ADB's Poverty
Reduction Strategy. The strategic approach recognizes
ADB's limited financial and human resources and
consists of three strategic thrusts: creating an enabling
environment, building human resources, and developing
ICT applications and information content.

The JFICT will finance on a pilot basis ICT-related
activities, including the purchase of ICT equipment and
services, software development, provision of technical
assistance, development of equity/fund investment
approaches, and other means. The JFICT will basically
cover activities to create and improve DMC environments for ICT development, such as policy initiatives for
developing ICT infrastructure and human resource
capacities; and to help establish a center for learning,
information, communication, and knowledge for
Asia and the Pacific.

The JFICT is a grant-financed trust fund whose
main goal is to assist DMCs in bridging the digital
divide, thereby reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.
Specifically, the JFICT will support ICT-related activities
in DMCs that can add substantive value to promote and
impact ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy and other
development objectives; encourage private sector
participation in ICT development and enhance its
capabilities in the region; and improve regional and
international cooperation, partnerships, and networking
to enhance local efforts at development through
appropriate ICT applications.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of income and
expenses, of cash flows, and of changes in capital and reserves present fairly, in all material
respects, in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development
Bank—Ordinary Capital Resources at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
® basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit ealso includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

As discussed in Note B, the Asian Development Bank—Ordinary Capital Resources adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities, as amended, effective 1 January 2001.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of loans and of borrowings as at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and of statement of subscriptions to capital stock and
voting power as at 31 December 2001 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and

to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and in our
opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND
LIMITATIONS ON LOANS, GUARANTEES,
AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), a multilateral development finance institution, was established in 1966 with its
headquarters in Manila, Philippines. ADB and its operations
are governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter). Its purpose is to foster economic development and co-operation in the Asian and Pacific
region and to contribute to the acceleration of the process
of economic development of the developing member countries (DMCs) in the region, collectively and individually.
With the adoption of its poverty reduction strategy at the
end of 1999, ADB made reducing poverty in the region its
main goal. ADB provides financial and technical assistance
(TA) for projects and programs which will contribute to
achieving this purpose.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is
an integral part of ADB’s operational activities. In addition,
ADB, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of donors, including
members, their agencies and other development institutions,
funds restricted for specific uses which include TA grants as
well as regional programs.

ADB’s ordinary operations comprise loans, equity
investments, and guarantees. In 2001, limited technical
assistance to member countries to support high priority TA
programsis included. It finances its ordinary operations through
borrowings, paid-in capital, and retained earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees, and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the total
amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and guarantees made by ADB shall not exceed the total of ADB’s
unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus,
exclusive of the special reserve. At 31 December 2001, the
total of such loans, equity investments, and guarantees
aggregated approximately 83.7% (80.7% - 2000) of the total
subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus as defined.
Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired paid-in
capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of the

144

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

special reserve. At 31 December 2001, such equity investments
represented approximately 3.5% (3.7% - 2000) of the paid-in
capital, reserves, and surplus, as defined.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter “in terms of United States dollars
of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the
1966 dollar) and the value of each share is defined as 10,000
1966 dollars. The capital stock had historically been translated into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit of
account) on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis
was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which
time the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect,
currencies no longer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending ADB's selection of the appropriate successor to the
1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued for purposes
of these financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United States dollars
as computed by the IMF, with each share valued at SDR10,000.

As of 31 December 2001, the value of the SDRin terms of
the current United States dollar was $1.25562 ($1.30291 2000) giving a value for each share of ADB’s capital equivalent
to $12,556.20 ($13,029.10 - 2000). However, ADB could decide
to fix the value of each share at $12,063.50 based on the 31
March 1978 par value of the United States dollar in terms of
gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the appli

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

cable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Income and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments other than those relating to maintenance of SDR capital values (see Notes | and J), are charged
or credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and
reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES’ as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Derivative Financial Instruments

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” SFAS No. 133 was further amended by SFAS
No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —- Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an
amendment of Statement 133.” The standards are herein
collectively referred to as FAS 133. FAS 133, is effective for
ADB on 1 January 2001. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument be recorded in the Balance Sheet as either an
asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in net income or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative
is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the
type of hedge transaction.

ADB uses derivative instruments for asset/ liability
management of individual positions and portfolios, as well as
for the reduction of transaction costs. In applying FAS 133 for
purposes of financial statement reporting, ADB has elected
not to define any qualifying hedging relationships. Rather, all
derivative instruments, as defined by FAS 133, have been
marked to fair value and all changes in the fair value have
been recognized in net income. ADB has elected not to define
any qualifying hedging relationships, not because economic
hedges do not exist, but rather because the application of FAS
133 hedging criteria does not make evident the impact of
economic risks inherent in ADB's financial assets and liabilities.

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
includes the difference between the carrying value and the

145

OCR-8

CONTINUED

fair value of the derivative instruments in the borrowings
portfolio on 31 December 2000 as well as loans that met
hedge criteria, offset by any gains or losses on those borrowings
and loans for which a fair value exposure was being hedged.
The net effect gave rise to a transition loss of $81,657,000, out
of which, a loss of $116,313,000 is reported in other
comprehensive income and a gain of $34,656,000 is reported
in net income. The allocation between net income and other
comprehensive income was based upon the hedging
relationships that existed before the initial application of this
statement.

Since ADB has not defined any qualifying hedging
relationships under this standard, the amount recorded in
other comprehensive income as part of the transition is being
reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in
which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of deposits
held by ADB other than derivative instruments are considered
by Management to be “Available for Sale” and are reported
at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL AND
RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive
income.” All derivative instruments are marked to market.
Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Time
deposits are classified as “Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost. Realized gains and losses are included in
income from investments and are measured by the difference between amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales.
With respect to futures, realized gain or loss is reported
based on daily settlement of the net cash margin.

Loans

ADB's loans are made to or guaranteed by members, with
the exception of loans to the private sector, and have
maturities ranging between 3 and 30 years. ADB requires its
borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies which it has disbursed.
It is the policy of ADB to place loans in nonaccrual status for
which principal, interest, or other charges are overdue by
six months. Interest and other charges on nonaccruing loans
are included in income only to the extent that payments

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

have been received by ADB. ADB follows a policy of not
taking part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to
public sector loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB
may agree to debt rescheduling only after alternative courses
of action have been exhausted.

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in arrears
for one year for public sector loans (unless there is clear and
convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration
of such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.
If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than the carrying
value of the loan, a valuation allowance is established with
a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.

ADB's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for loan losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans, and adverse
situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay.

ADB levies front-end fees on all new loans. Incremental
direct loan origination costs are offset against front-end fees
earned and, if material, the difference is deferred and amortized
over the life of the loans.

Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are reported at cost less probable losses
inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable.

The reserve against losses for equity investments is
established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of
potential losses for such investments. Equity securities with
readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from net income
and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.” ADB applies
the equity method of accounting to one investment where it
has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment
Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and,
except for land, depreciated over estimated useful lives on

a straight-line basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor
betterments are charged to expense.

146

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent liabilities at the end of the year and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The
actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, ADB considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s information have
been made to conform to the current year’s presentation
due to FAS 133.

Also, in prior years, notional amounts receivable and
payable required to maintain value of currency holdings were
classified as an asset and a liability, respectively. These amounts
have been reclassified in the Balance Sheet of 2001 as a
component of “CAPITAL AND RESERVE.” This reclassification
has no impact on the legal obligation of the members to
maintain value of their capital.

NOTE C—RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF CURRENCIES
AND DEMAND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i) of the Charter,
the use by ADB or by any recipient from ADB of certain
currencies may be restricted by members to payments for
goods or services produced and intended for use in their
territories. With respect to the currencies of 39 DMCs for
2001 (39 - 2000), cash in banks (due from banks) and demand
obligations totaling $51,919,000 ($54,221,000 - 2000) and
$217,926,000 ($233,767,000 - 2000), respectively, may be,
but are not currently so restricted.

In accordance with Article 24, paragraphs 2(i) and (ii) of
the Charter, two members have restricted the use by ADB or
by any recipient from ADB of their currencies to payments for
goods or services produced in their territories. Cash in banks

investments totaling $36,000 ($45,000 - 2000), $2,778,000
($2,966,000 - 2000) and $4,783,000 ($4,604,000 - 2000),
respectively, have been so restricted.

NOTE D—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations. Included in other securities as of 31
December 2001 were corporate bonds, asset/ mortgagebacked securities, and other obligations of banks amounting to $1,205,915,000 ($801,978,000 — 2000), $534,331,000
($269,991,000 — 2000) and $323,630,000 ($772,511,000 —
2000), respectively.

Exposure to interest rate risk may be adjusted within
defined bands to reflect changing market circumstances. These
adjustments are made through the purchase and sale of both
securities, financial futures, and options. To increase returns,
ADB may invest in securities denominated in currencies other
than the originating functional currencies and then enter into
covered forward foreign exchange agreements in order to
maintain its original mix of functional currency holdings.
Accordingly, the financial futures, options, and covered
forwards are held for risk management rather than for trading
purposes.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2001 and 2000 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

 

Currency 2001 2000

and $187,300,000, respectively (nil - 2000).

NOTE E—LOANS AND GUARANTEES
Loans

ADB does not currently sell its loans, nor does it believe
there is a comparable market for its loans. The estimated
fair value of all loans is based on the estimated cash flows
from principal repayments, interest, and other charges discounted at the applicable market yield curves for ADB’s
borrowing cost plus lending spread. The estimated fair value
of public sector loans is not affected by credit risks based on
ADB's experience with its borrowers. Allowance for loan
losses is made against private sector loans.

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of loans
outstanding at 31 December 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

Prior to 1 uly 1986, the lending rate of ADB was based on
a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which loans
carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the
entire life of the loans. Effective 1 uly 1986, ADB adopted a
multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In
addition, in July 1992, ADB introduced a pool-based variable
United States dollar lending rate system, and in November
1994, a market-based variable lending rate system was made
available to financial intermediaries in the public sector and
to the private sector borrowers. For loans to the private sector
borrowers, approximately 69% (66% - 2000) of the loans were
based on variable lending rates.

Since 1988, ADB has charged front-end fees for private
sector loans. Effective 1 January 2000, ADB levies front-end
fee of 1% for new public sector loans for which the loan
negotiations are completed after that date. In addition, the
lending spread applied to all outstanding pool-based OCR
public sector loans and new public sector market-based loans
has been increased from 0.4% to 0.6%. Also effective the same
date, a flat commitment fee of 0.75% is charged for new
program loans, while the progressive commitment fee of
0.75% is maintained for project loans.

of a similar amount, resulting in a reduction in administrative
expenses of this amount.

Commencing 1 uly 2001, ADB offered LIBOR-based loans
(LBLs) in any of the following currencies — Euro, Japanese
yen, or US dollar. The new LBL lending facility offers borrowers
the flexibility of (i) choice of currency and interest rate basis;

covered; and (ii) political risk guarantees, which provide coverage against well-defined sovereign risks. Guaranteed payments under partial credit guarantees are generally due 10 or
more years from the loan inception date. ADB’s political risk
guarantee is callable when a guaranteed event has occurred
and such an event has resulted in debt service default to the
guaranteed lender. The present value of the contingent future
payment obligations of all outstanding partial credit guarantees and the nominal value of political risk guaranteed obligation at 31 December 2001 and 2000 are used to calculate
ADB's lending limitation. None of these amounts were subject to call as of that date (nil - 31 December 2000). ADB
estimates that the present value of guarantees outstanding at
31 December 2001 approximates their fair value.

NOTE F—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB's investments in equity securities issued by private
enterprises located in DMCs include an $13,874,000
($12,511,000 — 2000) investment in the Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC) which is accounted for
on the equity method. The holding represents 30.3% of the
investee’s issued ordinary share capital and net assets. ADB
also holds 100% of AFIC issued convertible noncumulative
preference shares in the amount of $25,000,000 ($25,000,000
- 2000). In October 2001, ADB together with other financiers, renewed the revolving credit facility up to a maximum
aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of
$45,000,000 ($45,000,000 — 2000). ADB’s obligations amount
to $20,000,000, of which, at 31 December 2001, the outstanding loan is $4,444,000 ($4,000,000 - 2000). This amount
has been included in “LOANS OUTSTANDING?” (see Note E).

Unrealized gains on equity investments reported at market
value were $2,269,000 at 31 December 2001 ($3,003,000 2000) and were reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as
part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Approved equity investment facility that has not been
disbursed was $176,739,000 at 31 December 2001
($185,377,000 - 2000).

NOTE G—PROPERTY, FURNITURE, AND EQUIPMENT

In 1991, under the terms of an agreement with the Philippines
(Government), ADB returned the former headquarters
premises which had been provided by the Government. In
accordance with the agreement as supplemented by amemorandum of understanding, ADB was compensated
$22,657,000 for the return of these premises. The compensation isin lieu of being provided premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and amortized over the
estimated life of the new headquarters building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The amortization for the year
ended 31 December 2001 amounted to $567,000 ($567,000
— 2000) reducing depreciation expense for the new headquarters building from $4,414,000 ($4,700,000 - 2000) to
$3,847,000 ($4,133,000 - 2000). At 31 December 2001, the
unamortized deferred compensation balance (included in
“ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES - Miscellaneous”) was $16,473,000 ($17,040,000 - 2000). At 31 December 2001, accumulated depreciation for property,
furniture, and equipment was $82,614,000 ($78,898,000 2000).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAPS

ADB uses derivative financial instruments in connection
with its borrowing activities to diversify its funding sources
across public and private debt markets, currencies, and
instruments. Currency swaps are used to convert a currency

borrowed under advantageous terms into one of ADB's
major operational currencies, taking advantage of the
opportunities offered in different financial markets. Such
currency swaps enable ADB to raise operationally needed
currencies in a cost-efficient way and to maintain its borrowing presence in the major capital markets. Interest rate
swaps are used generally to reduce balance sheet interest
rate mismatches arising from lending operations.

ADB issues structured debt which includes embedded
currency and/or interest rate derivatives in order to decrease
its cost of borrowing. However, ADB enters into simultaneous
currency and/ or interest rate swaps to hedge fully against the
effects of such embedded derivatives.

ADB has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce such credit
risk, ADB only enters into long-term swap transactions with
counterparties eligible under ADB’s swap guidelines which
include a requirement that the counterparties have a credit
rating of double A or higher. ADB does not anticipate that any
of its counterparties will fail to perform their obligations
under such agreements.

The fair value of outstanding currency swap agreements,
interest rate swap agreements, and borrowings is determined
at the estimated amount that ADB would receive or pay to
terminate the agreements using a market-based valuation
model. The basis of valuation is the present value of expected
cash flows based on appropriate market data.

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement used by ADB, one party agrees to make periodic
payments based on a notional principal amount and an
interest rate that is fixed at the outset of the agreement. The
counterparty agrees to make floating rate payments based
on the same notional principal amount. The terms of ADB’s
interest rate swap agreements specifically match the terms
of particular borrowings. Prior to the adoption of FAS 133 in
2001, amounts receivable or payable under the terms of the
swap were accrued over the period to which the payment
relates and the related cost or income is included in “Interest and other financial expenses.”

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement,
one party agrees to make periodic payments in one currency
while the counterparty agrees to make periodic payments in
another currency. The payments may be fixed at the outset of
the agreement or vary based on interest rates. A receivable is
created for the currency swapped out, and a payable is created
for the currency swapped in. The terms of ADB’s currency
swap agreements specifically match the terms of particular
borrowings. Prior to the adoption of FAS 133 in 2001, swap
premiums and discounts were deferred and amortized over
the life of the underlying instruments. Such amortizations are
included in “Interest and other financial expenses.”

As of 31 December 2001 and 2000, the carrying amounts
(inclusive of accrued interest) and estimated fair values of
borrowings and swaps are as follows:

the currency of the subscribing member which may be convertible. In accordance with Article 6, paragraph 3 of the
Charter, ADB accepts nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing
demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion payable in
the currency of the member, provided such currency is not
required by ADB for the conduct of its operations. The
settlement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is not practicable to determine a fair value for
these receivables.

As of 31 December 2001, all matured installments
amounting to $3,049,555,000 ($3,111,859,000 - 2000) were
received except for $4,353,000 ($1,169,000 - 2000) from two
countries (two - 2000). Installments not due aggregating
$18,967,000 ($72,232,000 - 2000) are receivable as follows:

Year ending 31 December:
2002 $16,989,000 2003 $1,978,000

Payments in respect of capital subscription installments
in advance of due dates are shown in the Balance Sheet
(under “ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES’) as
“Advance payments on subscriptions” pending the
determination of the full value of such payments based on the
rate of exchange to be used by ADB as of the date on which
such payments are actually due.

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the
setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid
by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the
Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by
members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973 to be used as a part of the Special
Funds of ADB. The resources so set aside amounting to
$59,780,000 as of 31 December 2001 ($62,031,000 - 2000)
expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis of $1.25562
($1.30291 - 2000) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms of $1.20635
per 1966 dollar—see Note B), were allocated and transferred
to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second Amendment to the IMF Articles, ADB implemented maintenance of
value (MOV) in respect of holdings of member currencies in
terms of 1966 dollars, in accordance with the provisions of
Article 25 of the Charter and relevant resolutions of the
Board of Directors. Since then, settlement of MOV has been
put in abeyance.

Inasmuch as the valuation of ADB’s capital stock and the
basis of determining possible MOV obligations are still under
consideration, notional amounts have been calculated
provisionally as receivable from or payable to members in
order to maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of
the SDR. In view thereof, the notional MOV amounts of
receivables and payables are offset against one another and
shown as net notional amounts to maintain value of currency
holdings in the “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” portion of the
Balance Sheet. In 2000 and prior years, the notional MOV
amounts were shown as asset and liability in the Balance
Sheet. The timing of the establishment and settlement of such
amounts is uncertain and, accordingly, it is not practicable to
determine a fair value for such receivables and payables.

One country made an arrangement with ADB that has the
effect of continuing the settlement of their MOV obligation.
The “Amounts required to maintain value of currency holdings”
under “RECEIVABLE FROM MEMBERS’ represents the amount
receivable from changes in exchange rates of the member's
currency in relation to the United States dollar.

The net notional amounts as of 31 December 2001 consisted
of (a) the increase of $148,847,000 ($239,791,000 - 2000) in
amounts required to maintain the value of currency holdings
to the extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to
the increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the United
States dollar during the period from 1 April 1978 to 31 December
2001 and (b) the net decrease of $313,609,000 ($158,966,000 2000) in the value of such currency holdings in relation to the
United States dollar during the same period. In terms of
receivable from and payable to members, they are as follows:

2001 2000
Notional MOV Receivables $657,940,000 $677,808,000
Notional MOV Payables 195,484,000 279,051,000

Membership

As of 31 December 2001, ADB is owned by 59 member
countries, 43 countries from the region and 16 countries from
outside the region (see OCR~-7). There has been no subscription from new members in 2001 (Turkmenistan — 2000).

NOTE J—RESERVES
Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the Board
of Governors shall determine annually what part of the net
income shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves,
to surplus and what part, if any, shall be distributed to the
members. During 2001, $625,716,000 of the net income for
the year ended 31 December 2000 was allocated to the
Ordinary Reserve ($449,873,000 - 2000).

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note B) resulted in a net credit of $20,236,000
to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended 31 December
2001 ($27,738,000 - 2000). That credit is the decrease in the
value of the matured and paid capital subscriptions caused by
the change during the year in the value of the SDRin relation
to the United States dollar not allocated to members as notional
maintenance of value adjustments in accordance with
resolutions of the Board of Directors.

Special Reserve

The Special Reserve includes commissions on loans and
guarantee fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article 17
of the Charter. Special Reserve assets consist of term deposits
and government and government-guaranteed obligations and
are included under the heading “INVESTMENTS.” As the
amount of guarantee fees earned of $1,587,000 for 2001 covered the residual charge of $292,000 resulting from the guarantee refund made to Thailand in 1999, the amount of $1,295,000
was appropriated to Special Reserve for 2001 (nil — 2000).

Surplus

Surplus represents funds for future use to be determined by
the Board of Governors. During 2001, no amount ($80,000,000

154

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

— 2000) was allocated by the Board of Governors out of
Surplus to Technical Assistance Special Fund.

Comprehensive Income and Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income has two major components: net
income and other comprehensive income comprising gains
and losses affecting equity that, under generally accepted
accounting principles, are excluded from net income. Other
comprehensive income includes such items as the effects of
the implementation of FAS 133, unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale securities and listed equity investments,
and currency translation adjustments.

NOTE K—INCOME AND EXPENSES

Total income from loans for the year ended 31 December
2001 was $1,813,640,000 ($1,861,334,000 - 2000). The average yield on the loan portfolio during the year was 6.42%
(6.59% - 2000).

Total income from investments for the year ended 31
December 2001 was $403,436,000 ($399,862,000 - 2000). The
annualized rate of return on the average investments held
during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses,
was 5.91% (5.09% - 2000). If unrealized gains and losses were
included, the annualized rate of return would have been
6.18% (6.15% - 2000).

Income from other sources includes a share of the net
earnings of an equity investment of $1,478,000 ($667,000 2000) accounted for on the equity method. There were no
gains/ losses realized in 2001 (gains of $4,530,000 — 2000)
representing the difference between reacquisition price and
net carrying amount of borrowings extinguished prior to
maturity.

Dividends received for the year ended 31 December 2001
amounted to $13,229,000 ($11,354,000 - 2000).

Total interest expense incurred for the year ended 31
December 2001 amounted to $1,416,830,000 ($1,560,606,000
- 2000). Other financial expenses consist of amortization of
borrowings’ issuance costs and other expenses of $17,282,000
($16,139,000 - 2000).

Administrative expenses (other than those pertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations) for the

ordinary capital resources and the Asian Development Fund
according to the number of loans and equity investments
approved during the year. Of the total administrative expenses
of $223,313,000 ($203,389,000 - 2000), $129,481,000
($102,299,000 - 2000) was accordingly charged to the Asian
Development Fund. The balance of administrative expenses
after allocation was offset by front-end fee from new loans
for the year ended 31 December 2001 of $34,793,000
($8,531,000 — 2000) (see Notes B and E).

In April 2001, the Board of Directors approved financing
of technical assistance (TA) directly from current income and
outlined a 4-year financing framework for TA operations. The
full amount of TA commitments is to be charged to OCR
current income as “TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MEMBER
COUNTRIES’ in the year of commitment. As at 31 December
2001, the amount of TA commitments amounted to $19,962,000
out of which $209,000 had been disbursed.

For the year ended 31 December 2001, the provision for
losses totaled $9,838,000 ($4,994,000 for private sector loans
and $4,844,000 for equity investments). For the year ended 31
December 2000, the provision for losses totaled $5,910,000
($3,045,000 for private sector loans and $2,865,000 for equity
investments).

FAS 133 adjustment of $112,845,000 was made up of

NOTE M—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

ADB has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement
Plan (the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan,
shall, as a condition of service, become a participant from
the first day of service, provided that at such a date, the
employee has not reached the normal retirement age of 60.
The Plan applies also to members of the Board of Directors
who elect to join the Plan. Retirement benefits are based on
length of service and highest average remuneration during
two years of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated
and are not included in the accompanying Balance Sheet.
The costs of administering the Plan are absorbed by ADB,
except for fees paid to the investment managers and related
charges, including custodian fees, which are borne by the
Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make additional voluntary
contributions. ADB’s contribution is determined at a rate
sufficient to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not
covered by the participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

In 1993, ADB adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees’ medical insurance premiums. Under the plan, ADB is obligated
to pay 75% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums
for retirees, including retired members of the Board of
Directors, and their eligible dependents who elected to
participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.

@ The carrying amount for borrowings and swaps are inclusive of accrued interest.

Additional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced
in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the
amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
current transaction between willing parties, other than in a
forced or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amount.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using a market-based

158

valuation model. The basis of valuation is the expected cash
flows discounted at the applicable market yield curves or
appropriate market data.

NOTE O—OFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT RISK

ADB is a party to off-balance sheet financial instruments on
guarantees. Guarantees involve elements of credit risk which
are not reflected on the balance sheet. Credit risk represents
the maximum potential accounting loss due to possible
nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the
terms of the contract. The amount of credit risks on guaran

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Asian Development Bank

We have audited the accompanying special purpose statement of assets, liabilities and fund
balances of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund as of 31 December 2001
and 2000 and the related special purpose statements of revenues and expenses, of cash flows
and of changes in fund balances for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosure in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Notes B and D, the Board of Directors approved in May 2001 the adoption of
. special purpose financial statements for the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development
® Fund in 2001. With the adoption of the special purpose financial statements, loan loss provisioning policy has been eliminated. The financial statements for 2000 have been restated
accordingly. The accompanying financial statements are not intended to be a presentation in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances of Asian Development Bank—Asian
Development Fund at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the revenues and expenses and of cash
flows for the years then ended, on the basis explained in Notes B and D.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the special purpose
financial statements taken as a whole. The accompanying special purpose statements of loans
as at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and of resources as at 31 December 2001 are presented for
purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the special purpose financial
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audits of the special purpose financial statements and in our opinion is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the special purpose financial statements taken as a whole.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, Board of
Directors, management and members of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development
Fund. However, under the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Fund, this report is
included in the Annual Report of the Asian Development Bank and is therefore a matter of
public record and its distribution is not limited.

sector amounting to $8,836 ($9,839 - 2000).
Loans negotiated before 1 January 1983 were denominated in current United States dollars. Loans negotiated after that date are denominated in Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) for the purpose of commitment. The undisbursed portions of such SDR loans are translated into United States dollars at the applicable
exchange rates as of the end of a reporting period. Of the undisbursed balances, ADB has entered into irrevocable commitments to disburse various
amounts totaling $90,393 ($88,474 - 2000).

The accompanying notes are an integral part of these special purpose financial statements (ADF-7).

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established on 28
dune 1974 to more effectively carry out the special operations of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) by providing
resources on concessional terms which are made available
almost exclusively to the least developed borrowing countries.

The resources of ADF have been subsequently augmented
by seven replenishments, the most recent of which became
effective in June 2001 in a total amount equivalent to
$2,791,483,000 to cover the operational requirements for the
four-year period from January 2001. The last allocation from
the surplus account of ADB’s ordinary capital resources to
ADF in the amount of $230,000,000 was in 1997.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved the adoption
of the special purpose financial statements for ADF. With
the adoption of the special purpose financial statements,
loan loss provisioning has been eliminated.

Due to the nature and organization of ADF, these financial
statements have been prepared for the specific purpose of
reflecting the sources and applications of member subscriptions
and are not intended to be a presentation in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. These special
purpose financial statements have been prepared to comply
with Article IV, Section 4.01 of the Regulations of ADF.

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing member countries are functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United States
dollar, and the special purpose financial statements are
expressed in thousands of current US dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency, generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a
reporting period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period, generally at the appli
cable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates
in effect during the period. Translation adjustments relating
to set-aside resources (see Note G) are recorded as notional
amounts receivable from or payable to ordinary capital
resources. Other translation adjustments are charged or
credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and
reported in “FUND BALANCES” as part of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” Exchange gains or losses on
currency transactions among functional currencies are
included in revenue.

Investments

Allinvestment securities and negotiable certificate of deposits
held by ADF are considered by Management to be “Available
for Sale” and are reported at estimated fair value, with
unrealized gains and losses excluded from revenue and
reported in “FUND BALANCES” as part of “Accumulated
other comprehensive income.” Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost. Realized gains
and losses are included in revenue from investments and
are measured by the difference between amortized cost and
the net proceeds of sales.

Loans

It is the policy of ADF to place in nonaccrual status loans
made to eligible borrowing member countries if the principal or interest with respect to any such loans is overdue by
six months. Interest on nonaccruing loans is included in
revenue only to the extent that payments have actually been
received by ADF. ADB follows a policy of not taking part in
debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector
loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB may agree to
debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action
have been exhausted. When ADB decides that a particular
loan is no longer collectible, the entire amount will be
expensed during the period.

Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in the
financial statements as amounts committed from the date

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2001 and 2000

Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related
formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the
currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of special purpose financial statements
requires Management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
at the end of the year and the reported amounts of income
and expenses during the year. The actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Special Purpose Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the special purpose statement of cash
flows, ADF considers that its cash and cash equivalents are
limited to “DUE FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification and Restatement

Certain 2000 amounts have been restated to conform with
the 2001 presentation.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations. Included in other securities as of 31
December 2001 were corporate bonds and other obligations
of banks amounting to $805,044,000 ($229,400,000 - 2000)
and $392,692,000 ($369,669,000 — 2000), respectively.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2001 and 2000 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains
and losses, was 4.84% (5.01% - 2000). If unrealized gains and
losses were included, the annualized rate of return would
have been 5.35% (5.22% - 2000).

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS PROVISION
Loans

Prior to 1 January 1999, loans of ADF were extended to
eligible borrowing member countries, which bore a service
charge of 1% and required repayment over periods ranging
from 35 to 40 years. On 14 December 1998, the Board of
Directors approved an amendment to ADF loan terms, as
follows: (i) for loans to finance specific projects, the maturity was shortened to 32 years including an 8-year grace
period; (ii) for program loans to support sector development, the maturity was shortened to 24 years including an
8-year grace period; and (iii) all new loans bear a 1% interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5% during the
amortization period, with equal amortization. The new ADF
lending terms took effect on 1 January 1999 and apply only
to new loans for which formal loan negotiations were completed on or after 1 January 1999. ADF requires borrowers
to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the
value of the currencies disbursed.

The fair value of loans is determined using an entry value
method. Under this method, fair value is determined based
on the terms at which a similar loan would currently be made
by ADB to a similar borrower. For such loans, fair value
approximates the carrying amount. The estimated fair value
of loans is not affected by credit risks because the amount of
any such adjustment is not considered to have a material
effect based on ADB’s experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans
by country as of 31 December 2001 are shown in ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans
in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 2001 was $442,146,000
($491,216,000 - 2000) of which $69,994,000 ($55,693,000 2000) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in
$4,712,000 ($5,162,000 - 2000) not being recognized as income

171

ADF-7

CONTINUED

from loans for the year ended 31 December 2001. The
accumulated interest on these loans that was not recognized
as income as of 31 December 2001 would have totaled
$22,882,000 ($18,170,000 - 2000). The loans in nonaccrual
status as of 31 December 2001 were four loans made to
Afghanistan and 28 loans to Myanmar. (Four loans to
Afghanistan and 28 loans to Myanmar - 2000).

One private sector loan was in nonaccrual status as of 31
December 2001 (one — 2000). The principal outstanding at
that date was $5,234,000 ($6,015,000 — 2000). Loan in
nonaccrual status resulted in $57,000 ($122,000 — 2000) not
being recognized in income from private sector loans for the
year ended 31 December 2001.

Private sector loans outstanding as of 31 December 2001
were $8,836,000 ($9,839,000 - 2000), and there were no
undisbursed loan commitments (nil - 2000).

Loan Loss Provision

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved the elimination of ADF loan loss provisioning. For comparative purpose
to this year’s presentation, the amount of loans outstanding
as of 31 December 2000 has been restated with the amount
of the allowance for possible losses of $6,667,000 as of 31
December 2000. Correspondingly the balances of accumulated surplus and accumulated translation adjustment as of
31 December 2001 have been restated by $6,849,000 and
($182,000), respectively.

NOTE E—NOTES OF CONTRIBUTORS

Notes of contributors are nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions, encashable by ADB
at par upon demand.

ADB currently expects that the notes outstanding at 31
December 2001 will be encashed in varying amounts over a
nine-year period ending 31 December 2010.

The fair value of notes of contributors is determined using
an entry value method, whereby fair value is determined
based on the terms at which notes are currently being accepted
from contributors. On this basis, the fair value of outstanding
notes of contributors approximates their carrying amount.

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE F—ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses for 2001 included an administration charge from ordinary capital resources amounting to
$129,481,000 ($102,299,000 - 2000). The charge represents
an apportionment of all administrative expenses of ADB
(other than those pertaining directly to ordinary operations
and special operations), based on the number of loans and
equity investments approved during the year.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of
the Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in”
capital paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the convertible currency
portion paid by member countries pursuant to Article 6,
paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973, to be used
as a part of the Special Funds of ADB. The capital so set
aside was allocated and transferred from the ordinary capital resources to ADF as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4, paragraph
1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966
dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit of
account), on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time
the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer had par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB’s
selection of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the
Set-Aside Resources have been valued for purposes of the
accompanying financial statements in terms of the Special
Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United States

172

dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31 December 2001, the
value of the SDR in terms of the current United States dollar
was $1.25562 ($1.30291 - 2000). On this basis, Set-Aside
Resources amounted to $59,780,000 ($62,031,000 - 2000). If
the capital stock of ADB as of 31 December 2001 had been
valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources
would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE H—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND
ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE
INCOME

Comprehensive income has two major components: net
income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income include such items as unrealized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities and foreign currency
translation adjustments.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies and
assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective
judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction, or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The carrying amounts of ADF’s assets, liabilities, and
fund balances are considered to approximate fair values for
all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E
for discussions relating to investments, loans, and notes of
contributors.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of financial position and the related statements
of activities and changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—
Technical Assistance Special Fund at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the results of its
activities and changes in net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the
United States which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
® examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial estatements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The accompanying statement of resources as at 31 December
2001 and summary statement of technical assistance approved and effective for the year ended
31 December 2001 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts
of the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated
in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FU

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to
developing member countries of the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) and for regional technical assistance. TASF
resources consist of direct voluntary contributions by
members, allocations from the net income of ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the
basis of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

TASF reports contributed cash and other assets as restricted
support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit
the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction
expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose restriction
is accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets are
reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the
Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets as net
assets released from restrictions. There were no restricted
net assets at 31 December 2001 and 2000.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial
statements from the date contribution agreements become
effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted by
them to technical assistance (TA) projects/ programs with
specified procurement sources are classified as temporarily
restricted contributions. Those without any stipulations as to
specific use are accounted for as unrestricted contributions.

179

TASF-6

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements when the related project is approved and becomes
effective. Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in technical
assistance for the period and the corresponding undisbursed
commitment is eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands
of current United States dollars. As a matter of convenience,
the United States dollar is the functional and reporting currency
and is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies other
than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates of
exchange at the end of a reporting period. Contributions included
in the financial statements during the year are recognized at
applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of
commitment. Revenue and expense amounts in currencies other
than United States dollars are translated for each semimonthly
period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments are accounted for as exchange gains or
losses and are charged or credited to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year.
The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

Reclassification

Certain 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2001 presentation.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB
seeks the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are governed by the Investment Authority approved
by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its
Investment Authority to invest in investment instruments
which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily
government or government-guaranteed obligations and
corporate obligations.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2001 and 2000 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

Currency 2001 2000
Australian dollar $ 5,147,000 $ 5,113,000
Canadian dollar 132,725,000 129,910,000
Euro 10,078,000 18,528,000
Swiss franc 33,918,000 81,954,000
Others 3,085,000 3,264,000

Total $184,953,000 $238,769,000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 5.26% (5.18% - 2000).

NOTE D—FUNDING

Since inception in 1967, direct contributions have been
made by 29 member countries. In 1986 and 1992, the Board
of Governors, in authorizing a replenishment of the ADF,
provided for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate
amount equivalent to $72,000,000 and $140,000,000,
respectively, to be used for technical assistance to ADF
borrowing developing member countries and for regional
technical assistance.

180

In addition, an aggregate amount equivalent to
$501,000,000 had been allocated to TASF out of OCRin 1992
to 1995 and in 1998 to 2000.

Some of the direct contributions received were subject to
restricted procurement sources, while some were given on
condition that the technical assistance be made on a
reimbursable basis.

The total contributions received for the years ended 31
December 2001 and 2000 were without restrictions.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA
projects/ programs which are not yet disbursed as of the end
of the year. During 2001, an amount of $5,471,000
($13,390,000 - 2000) representing completed and canceled
TA projects has been written back as a reduction in technical assistance of the period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been eliminated. The fair value of
undisbursed commitments approximates the amounts
undisbursed because ADB expects that grants will be made
for all projects/ programs covered by the commitments. When
TA provided as a project preparatory grant leads to an ADB
loan, the amount of the grant exceeding $250,000 will be
refunded by the borrower through the loan proceeds under
the terms of that ADB loan. Refinanced amount of $346,000
($279,000 - 2000) was charged to such loans and credited to
revenue from other sources of the TASF during the year
ended 31 December 2001.

NOTE F—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

The carrying amounts of TASF’s assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B
and E for discussions with respect to investments and
undisbursed commitments, respectively.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of financial position and the related statements
of activities and changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects,
in terms of United States dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—.apan
Special Fund at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the results of its activities and changes in net
assets and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FU

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The .apan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) entered
into a financial arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make
an initial contribution and ADB became the administrator.
The purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries
(DMCs) of ADB restructure their economies and broaden the
scope of opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting
the recycling of funds to DMCs of ADB. While JSF resources
are used mainly to finance technical assistance (TA) operations, these resources may also be used for equity investment
operations in ADB’s DMCs. Under the agreement between
ADB and .apan, ADB may invest the proceeds of JSF pending
disbursement. The revenue from such investments, if retained
by ADB, may only be used to pay for direct and identifiable
costs incurred in the administration of JSF.

In March 1999, the Board approved the acceptance and
administration by ADB of a new facility, the Asian Currency
Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF) to assist Asian currency crisisaffected member countries (CAMCs). Funded by Japan, ACCSF
was established within JSF to assist in the economic recovery
of CAMCs through interest payment assistance (IPA) grants,
TA grants, and guarantees. ACCSF funds must be committed
within three years after the date the facility became effective.
Thereafter, the use of any residual funds, if and when the
purpose of ACCSF is considered to be fulfilled, shall be decided
in consultation between ADB and pan.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of JSF are presented on the basis
of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. ACCSF
funds are separately reported in the financial statements.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations
that limit the use of the donated assets. When the donor
restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose
restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets
are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the
Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets as “NET
ASSETS RELEASED FROM RESTRICTIONS.”

185

JSF-4

Investments

All investment securities held by JSF are reported at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally
represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements from the date indicated by .apan that funds are expected
to be made available. Contributions which are restricted by
the donor for specific TA projects/ programs or for IPA grants
are classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those
without any stipulation as to specific use are accounted for as
unrestricted contributions and reported as such.

Technical Assistance and Interest Payment Assistance

Technical assistance and interest payment assistance are
recognized in the financial statements when the related
project or assistance is approved and becomes effective.
Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount
is written back as a reduction in TA for the period and the
corresponding undisbursed commitment is eliminated,
accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen, while the
reporting currency is the United States dollar. The financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United
States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the year are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue
and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated for
each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange

at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions arise on
translation differences between the date a project/ program
is committed and the timing of disbursements. Exchange
gains or losses are charged or credited to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are
reported at fair value. The reserve against losses is established quarterly based on Management's evaluation of
potential losses on investments without readily determinable fair values.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of
the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses
during the year. The actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification

Certain 2000 amounts have been reclassified to conform
with the 2001 presentation.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments
are governed by the Investment Authority approved by the
Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment
Authority to invest in investment instruments which are obligations of a limited class of issuers, primarily government or
government-guaranteed obligations and corporate obligations.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio as
of 31 December 2001 and 2000 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

The annualized rates of return on the average investments
held under ACCSF and JSF funds during the year, based on the
portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month were
0.12% and 4.76%, respectively (0.18% and 6.42% - 2000).

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS
ADB used JSF resources to make an equity investment in

India in 1990. In May 2001, due to the unavailability of a
reliable market for the investment, ADB reported the

186

investment at its written down value of $105,000 ($338,000
— 2000).

NOTE E—OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Included in other assets and liabilities are interfund transfers between JSF and ACCSF. As at 31 December 2001, an
amount of $431,000 ($584,000 — 2000) was receivable from
ACCSF. The said amount is reflected as other assets under
JSF and other liabilities under ACCSF.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE F—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent TA projects/ programs and IPA grants
which have become effective but not yet disbursed. During
2001, an amount of $2,920,000 ($11,751,000 - 2000), representing completed and canceled TA projects, has been written back as a reduction in technical assistance for the period,
and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been
eliminated. The fair value of undisbursed commitments
approximates the amounts outstanding because JSF expects

187

JSF-4

that disbursements will substantially be made for all the
projects/ programs covered by the commitments.

NOTE G—UNCOMMITTED BALANCES

Uncommitted balances comprised of amounts which have
not been committed by ADB as at 31 December 2001. These
balances include TA projects/ programs that had been
approved but not yet become effective.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

Accumulated investment income net of accumulated
administrative expenses has been categorized as temporarily
restricted net assets because, under the terms of the agreement
between ADB and &pan, it may only be used for defraying of
the SF's administrative expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments
for technical assistance and interest payment assistance
satisfying the conditions specified by the donor and, in the
case of accumulated investment income, to defray the
administrative expenses of the Fund.

NOTE I—GUARANTEES

To assist in the economic recovery of CAMCs, a guarantee
facility is provided under ACCSF. In this connection, Japan
has made available a noninterest-bearing, nonnegotiable
note in the amount of ¥360 billion ($2.7 billion), encashable
by ADB at any time to meet any calls on the guarantee
facility. As of 31 December 2001, no guarantee has been
made.

NOTE J—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies and
assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective
judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The carrying amounts of JSF’s assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair
values for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B,
C, D, and F for discussions relating to investments, equity
investments, and undisbursed commitments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FU

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the
establishment of the Asian Development Bank Institute (the
Institute) in Tokyo, Japan as a subsidiary body of ADB. The
Institute commenced its operations upon the receipt of the
first funds from Japan on 24 March 1997, and it was inaugurated on 10 December 1997. The Institute’s funds may
consist of voluntary contributions, donations, and grants
from ADB member countries, nongovernment organizations, and foundations. The objectives of the Institute, as
defined under its Statute, are the identification of effective
development strategies and capacity improvement for sound
development management in developing member countries.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented on
the basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports donor’s contributions of cash and
other assets as unrestricted support as these are made available
to the Institute without conditions other than for the purposes
of pursuing the objectives of the Institute.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Institute are reported
at estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains
and losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Time deposits are classified as
“Held-to-Maturity” and are reported at cost.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial
statements from the date committed.

 

193

ADBISF-4

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing members are functional currencies. The reporting currency is the United States dollar
and the financial statements are expressed in thousands of
current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated
from the functional currency to the reporting currency at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Contributions included in the financial statements
during the period are translated at the applicable exchange
rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue
and expense amounts in currency other than the United
States dollar are translated for each semimonthly period at
the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each
period; such practice approximates the application of average rates in effect during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end
of the year and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Institute considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited
to “DUE FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of investments denominated in Japanese yen. As of 31 December
2001 and 2000, the estimated fair value of the investments
approximated cost or amortized cost. All such investments
are due within one year.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2001 and 2000

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month was 0.07% (0.12% - 2000).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. The Investment
Authority allows investment in higher-yielding investment
instruments, such as high-quality corporate bonds, mortgagebacked securities, and asset-backed securities. The main
investment management objective is to maintain security
and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks the
highest possible return on its investments.

NOTE D—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced
or liquidation sale.

The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term
approximates their carrying amounts.

The Institute's statement of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments.

NOTE E—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Institute participates in the contributory defined benefit
Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of ADB. Every member of

194

ANNUAL REPORT 2001

the professional staff, as defined under the Plan, shall, as a
condition of service, become a participant from the first day
of service, provided that at such a date, the staff has not
reached the normal retirement age of 60. Retirement benefits are based on length of service and highest average
remuneration during two years of eligible service. The Plan
assets are segregated and are not included in the statement
of financial position. The costs of administering the Plan are
absorbed by ADB, except for fees paid to the investment
managers and related charges, including custodian fees,
which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions.
The Institute’s contribution is determined at a rate sufficient
to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the
participants’ contributions.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

The Institute participates in the cost-sharing plan of ADB for
retirees medical insurance premiums of ADB. Under the
plan, the Institute is obligated to pay 75% of the Group
Medical Insurance Plan premiums for retirees and their eligible dependents who elect to participate. The cost-sharing
plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of
postretirement medical benefits.

b Net refers to cancellation and refund of unused loan amounts.
c The US dollar equivalent is in accordance with the exchange rate prevailing in ADB on 31 December 2001. The cumulative contracts awarded exceed the

net effective loan amounts due to the following reasons:

(i) for countries without active loans, the base contract amount of loans that were closed prior to computerization does not reflect the adjustment with

regard to procurement data, e.g. Afghanistan; and

(ii) for countries with active loans, the contract amount inputted is the percentage of ADB-financed portion and each contract amount was adjusted upon
completion of disbursement.
d Excludes private sector loans without government guarantee.

a Positive figures indicate deforestation rates while negative figures indicate reforestation rates.

Refers to all protected areas at least 1,000 hectares listed in categories I-V of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).

b
c Refers to carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing.
d

In previous year, data for GDP per unit of Energy Use were expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) $ per kg of oil equivalent (kgoe). Since there may be
problems associated with PPP, the major of which is that there is no price data collection since 1993, the indicator expressed in constant 1995 $ per kgoe

is deemed more appropriate.

e For Hong Kong, China figure for total forest refers to 1995, average rate of deforestation refers to 1990-1995, national protected areas refers to 1997.
f The number 0.0 means the magnitude is zero or is less than half of the unit employed and not known more precisely.

g Refers to percentage of population served by tap water.

basic votes and proportional votes. The basic votes of each member consist of such number of votes as results from the equal
distribution among all members of 20% of the aggregate sum of
the basic votes and proportional votes of all members. The number of proportional votes of each member is equal to the number
of shares of the capital stock of ADB held by that member.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was established in
1966 through a multilateral agreement ratified by 31
countries.! It has 60 members, as of 2 April 2002, of
which 43 are in Asia and the Pacific.

ADB has its headquarters in the Philippines, and
has 22 overseas offices, including resident missions in
Bangladesh, Cambodia, People’s Republic of China,
India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam; and a
country office in the Philippines. ADB also maintains a
regional mission for the South Pacific in Vanuatu,
extended missions in Gujarat, India and Papua New
Guinea, and a Special Office in East Timor. It has
representative offices for Europe (based in Frankfurt), for
Japan (Tokyo), and North America (Washington, DC).

A special liaison office in Kabul, Afghanistan is
being organized.

Objective: reduce poverty

ADB's vision is an Asian and Pacific region free of
poverty. Its mission is to help its developing member
countries (DMCs) reduce poverty and improve their
living conditions and quality of life. Its strategic agenda
includes sustainable economic growth, inclusive social
development, and governance for effective policies and
institutions. Three crosscutting themes broaden and
deepen the impact of the core areas of intervention—
promoting the role of the private sector in development,
supporting regional cooperation and integration for
development, and addressing environmental sustainability.

ADB's main instruments in providing help to its
DMCs are policy dialogues, loans, technical assistance,
grants, guarantees, and equity investments.

ADB offers a range of lending modalities and terms;
all loans involve conditionalities aimed at improving
development performance. About 72% of ADB's
cumulative lending comes from its ordinary capital
resources (OCR). These comprise paid-in capital,
reserves, funds raised through borrowings, and
accumulated retained income. In 2001, ADB introduced
LIBOR-based loan (LBL) products, with maturity ranges
from 15 to 25 years. Effective 1 July 2002, LBLs will be
the only choice for borrowers. OCR loans are
nonconcessional and are generally made to members
that have attained a somewhat higher level of
economic development.

ADB also provides loans from its Special Funds
resources. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) is a

Note

special window for loans on concessional terms to
members with low per capita gross national product and
weak debt-repayment capacity. The ADF is financed by
periodic voluntary contributions from donors.

Other Special Funds are the Technical Assistance
Special Fund; Japan Special Fund; and ADB Institute
Special Fund. Other funds managed by ADB are the
Japan Scholarship Program; Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction; Japan Fund for Information and
Communication Technology; and channel financing of
grants provided by bilateral donors to support technical
assistance and soft components of loans, including the
Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change,
Governance Cooperation Fund (initial contribution by
Canada), Danish Cooperation Fund on Renewable
Energy and Energy Efficiency in Rural Areas,
Cooperation Fund for the Formulation and
Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies
and Cooperation Fund on Water Sector (both with initial
contributions from The Netherlands), and United
Kingdom Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance
(Poverty-Focused) in India.

Technical assistance activities funded through
grants or loans help maximize ADB's development
impact. Most technical assistance grants are used for
preparing projects and supporting advisory activities in
areas such as law and policy reform, fiscal
strengthening, good governance, capacity building, and
natural resource management.

ADB has a triple-A rating and typically raises about
$4 billion-$5 billion a year from bond issues. It actively
mobilizes financial resources through its cofinancing
operations, tapping official, commercial, and export
credit sources.

ADB's assistance to governments creates an
enabling environment for private sector development.
ADB participates directly in financing private sector
projects to assist commercial investors and lenders.

Organizational structure

ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of
Governors, which meets annually and comprises one
representative from each member. The Governors elect
the 12 members of the Board of Directors, with each
Director appointing an Alternate. The President is
elected by the Board of Governors for a 5-year term
and is Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The
President, assisted by three Vice-Presidents, manages
the business of ADB.

 

1 The term “country,” as used in the context of ADB, refers to a member of ADB and does not imply any view on the part of ADB as

to the member's sovereignty or independent status.

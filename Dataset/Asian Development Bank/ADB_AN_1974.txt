oOECONOMIC BACKGROUND

Developing Member Countries of the Region
in 1974

In 1974, economic development in the region was
adversely affected by the important changes in the world
economy. A sharp increase in the price of oil, a slowdown in the economic growth of the industrially
advanced countries, a shortage of foodgrains and worldwide inflation combined to retarcl economic growth in
the Bank's developing member countries (DMCs). This
combination of circumstances, aggravated in several
countries by natural disasters, placed unprecedented
pressures on the region’s economy.

The impact of these changes on the developing
member countries of the Bank was uneven. However,
even though the economic situation in a few countries
improved, the rate of real economic growth in most
countties was much below the level achieved in 1973
(Table 1*). Generally, the countries able to benefit from
high commodity prices for certain of their natural resources fared better. The decline in growth rates was
more noticeable in the relatively more industrialized
countries among the Bank’s DMCs compared with their
own past performance. In the low income developing
rhember countries, per capita income remained stagnant
or actually declined. Even where the rate of economic
growth was reasonably satisfactory, the per capita income in these countries increased only marginaily due to
the increase in population.

The economic difficulties faced by many developing
member countries during the year can be seen clearly in
the increase in their trade deficits. Of the 24 developing
member countries of the Bank, 18 incurred trade deficits
and only 6 showed surpluses (Table 2). Although the
division was generally in line with past experience, the
magnitude of the deficits increased steeply in a number
of countries. Taking the deficit countries as a group,
the aggregate trade deficit rose from about $4.5 billion
in 1973 to about $12.3 billion in 1974. The balance of
trade imiproved only in seven countries, among which
the improvement made by Indonesia was by far the most
impressive.

Higher import prices contributed substantially to the
deteriorating trade situations of the developing member

37 to 43

countries. Of particular significance were the prices of
oil. foodgrains and fertilizers. For the DMCs as a whole,
the payment for oil imports increased by about $5.3
billion between 1973 and 1974, payments for foodgrains
tose by $1.1 billion and payments for fertilizers rose by
$1.2 billion over the same period. For the deficit
countries only, the figures are $4.9 billion for oil and
$1.4 billion for food and fertilizers combined (Table 3).

By global standards the amounts paid for oi! imports
by the DMCs were relatively small. However, in view of
their balance of payments difficulties the increase in
such payments posed a most serious problem. As a
percentage of the value of their cormbined merchandise
exports, the total oil payments for all non-oil-exporting
DMCs increased from about 8.5 per cent in 1973 to
nearly 20 per cent in 1974. And in terms of their combined GNP. this percentage is estinated to have increased from about 1.6 per cent in 1973 to 4 per cent
in 1874. This contrasts with 2 per cent for the
industrially advanced countries as a group in 1974.

The increase in foodgrain imports reflected the inadequacy of food production in the region. Most of the
developing member countries, not being self-sufficient
in foodgrains, depend on imports to varying degrees.
Even in 1973, a bumper year for the region, a food
shortage continued, due partly to a marked reduction in
stocks available to the region from the major exporting
countries of the world, and partly to a drop in production
in this region in 1972. The situation worsened.in 1974
by crop failures in the most densely-populated and the
traditional rice-exporting DMCs (Table 4). The continuing demand for foodgrain imports to meet normal
shortages, together with the additional demand due to
crop failures, pushed the price of foodgrains to record
levels. And these higher foodgrain prices contributed
significantly to the rise in the general price level and
aggravated balance of payments difficulties in the
affected countries.

Efforts to increase food production in the developing
rnember countries were hampered in 1974 by record
fertilizer prices reflecting a worldwide shortage. Thus
the DMCs, which depend on substantial imports of
fertilizers, were unable to meet their requirements
According to a Bank study which covered 17 developing
member countries, the consumption of fertilizers in those
countries increased at an annual rate of 15 per cent‘4

petween 1964 and 1973. Out of 5.5 million tons consumed in 1973. only about 3 million tons were from
domestic production. This gap is expected to increase in
the next few years.

While the increase in the prices of imports had a direct
impact on the balance of trade of the developing member
countries, it also limited the growth of GNP during the
year. Although the va/ue of imports increased sharply
during the year. it masked a slower growth, and in a few
cases actual declines, in the vo/ume of imports (Table 5).
Where these imports were largely capital goods, real
investment was slowed, consequently limiting growth.

Moreover, the higher prices of imported capital goods
and industrial raw materials directly increased the cost of
development projects and the increase in the prices of
imports in generat intensified inftationary pressures.
During 1974 the consumer price index in most DMCs
rose faster than in 1973 (Table 6). And in order to combat inflation, widespread resort was made to restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies.

The Bank’s developing member countries were also
adversely affected by the marked slowdown in the industrially advanced countries. As estimated by the
OECD, the average rate of growth in seven major industrial countries? for 1974 was a minus 0.25 per cent,
compared with growth rates of 5.8 and 6.5 per cent in
1972 and 1973 respectively. This was responsible, with
a lag, for a reduced demand for exports from the region.
It is estimated that the volume of global imports by the
entire OECD area increased by only 2 per cent in 1974,
as against 11 per cent in 1972 and 12.3 per cent in 1973.

As a result, the prices of several important primary
commodities — copper, copra, cotton, rubber, logs
and tin—which had risen towards the end of 1973 and
in the early part of 1974 began to fall in the latter half of
1974 (Table 7). Very preliminary evidence available for
commadity price movements in the first quarter of 1975
indicates that this general downward drift in the prices
of most important commodities is continuing. However,
the impact on the developing member countries of price
changes in primary commodities. was uneven because
some commodities remained in strong demand throughout 1974—sugar, palm oil, jute and, to a lesser extent,
rice.

- The economic slowdown in the industrially advanced
countries also reduced the demand for manufactures
exported by the developing member countries. Although
industrial production still accounts for a relatively small
portion of total output of the DMCs as a whole, the
share of manufactures in total merchandise exports of
many countries has been increasing rapidly since the
early 1960s and in several countries has reached a high
proportion, As the reduced demand for these products
eroded their prices these countries experienced both a
reduction in their terms of trade and a greater decline in
the rate of real growth than did the exporters of primary
commodities. *

In the recent past, the balance of international payments of the developing member countries was supported to a considerable extent by the inflow of long-term
Capital and transfers from the developed countries. This
inflow, together with short-term capital movements and

1 Canada. France. Federal Republic of Germany. izaly, Japan. United
Kingdor ang United States.

 

surpluses in the service accounts in: some countries,
helped them meet trade deficits and enabled them to
moderately increase their international reserves. In 1974,
despite the efforts made by the developed countries,
which also faced serious economic problems of their
own, it is estimated that the inflow of long-term capital
and transfers from the traditiona! sources to the region
was not mucn higher than the 1973 level of about $5.4
billion. This was clearly inadequate to meet the trade
deficits estimated at $12.3 billion. Although some new
facilities, such as the IMF oil facility and the UN Special.
Fund, were created to help mitigate these difficulties and
the oil-exporting countries extended financial essistance
to some of the affected countries in the region, some
developing member countries nad to resort to borrowing
at very high interest rates (Table 8).

International reserves in the developing member
countries, excluding !ndonesia, increased from about
$9.6 billion at the end of 1973 to about $11.4 billion at
the end of 1974; including Indonesia, the respective
figures are $10.4 billion and $12.9 billion. However,
in terms of average monthly imports, the reserves of ihe
non-oil-exporting DMCs decreased, on the whole, from
about 3.6 months in 1973 to 2.9 months in 1974. Moreover, since in several countries these increases were
accompanied by increased borrowing, their real significance has yet to be assessed.

The outstanding external public debt for ihe developing member countries as a whole increased from about
$31.6 billion in 1972 to $37.6 billion in 1973, and debt
service payments, from about $13.8 billion to $1.9 biltion.
The deot service ratio generally decreased in recent years
and especially in 1973, as a result of the increase in the
price and/or volume of their exports (Table 9). However,
in the light of the general decline in most export prices
beginning in the second half of 1974 and continuing
through the first quarter of 1975 and of the increased
volume of borrowings. the debt service ratio is likely
to rise for most countries. This will come at a time when
the balence of payments positions of most developing ..
member. countries are already severely constrained. This
further emphasizes the need to make larger financial
resources available to the region, especially on concessional terms for the most seriously affected and least
developed countries, in order to achieve a reasonable
rate of growth and:help them improve their ability to
export.

There was still another aspect to the economic problems faced by the developing member countries. In
their development plans, these countries have stressed
the importance of social development and formulated
strategies for reducing mass poverty. In several
countries, provision for social services including housing.
health care and education accounted for 15 to 20 per cent
of total ‘development expenditures. Countries in the
region whicn experience higher rates of growth and
attain a higher level of per capita income tend to allocate
higher percentages of government budgeis for social
services. However, inflationary pressures and the slowdown in economic growth in 1974 had a serious impact
on social progress in the developing member countries.

The low income groups in the uroan areas were
generaily hard hit by unemployment in manufacturing
industries, and they appeared to be in a more difficult
position than the low income groups in rural! areas.However, the rural poor also suffered in varying degrees
from the decline in prices and reduced production of
primary commodities. Even where the terms of trade
of the traditional rural sectors improved somewhat by
the high prices of certain commodities, such as rice and
sugar, the deep-rooted problems relating to land tenure
and the lack of effective marketing mechanisms in rural
areas reduced the benefits reaching the great majority of
the population.

The Bank's Effort

The pace of the Bank's operations was stepped up
substantially in 1974, Total lending during the year was
increased to a level 30 per cent higher than in the preceding year (or about 12 per cent in real terms}. Technical assistance. which is a vital part of the Bank's operations in several countries, was also increased sharply:
31 projects were approved at a total estimated cost of
$5.42 million! —more than double the cost of the 24
projects approved in 1973. In addition, new areas of
technical assistance were taken up, such as energy
policy and development planning.

The share of agriculture in the Bank's lending increased from 11.2 per cent in 1973 to 24.5 per cent in
1974 and was about double the average of the preceding
six years. Fertilizer needs received special attention: at
year-end two large projects involving other lenders were
in advanced stages of preparation. Several loans in
the power sector were made for projects utilizing
domestic energy resources. Rail transport was a new
sub-sector in the transport and communications sector
which received Bank assistance for easing constraints

1 Including $1.65 million financed by UNDP for four projects with the
Bank acting as Executing Agency.

(n moving basic commodities, especialiy food. Social
development continued to be given prominence: a project for the expansion of metropolitan water supply
attracted one of the largest loans in 1974.

The less developed countries, many of which were
especially affected by the developments in the world
economy over the past year, received a much larger share
than before of the Bank’s lending on concessional terms.
The share of concessional lending itself, in total lending,
increased from 28 per cent in 1973 to 32 per cent in 1974

Corresponding to the Bank's expanding role in the
development of the region, the need for major efforts at
resource mobilization becomes increasingly evident.
There were some positive achievements during the year
which were encouraging for the future, notably the
formal establishment on 28 June of the Asian Development Fund with a target of $525 million which provides the mechanism for organized replenishment of
resources for concessional lending. Another encouraging development was the tapping of new sources of
capital.

The Bank has to respond to the urgent development
tequirements of its developing member countries. For the
majority of these countries, the requirements include an
increasing production of food, for which higher fertilizer
production is essential, greater exploitation of domestic
energy resources and wider diversification of production
for export. At the same time. infrastructural needs cannot
be overlooked if the broad development effort is to
succeed.

There is certainly a challenge ahead. Nevertheless,
the determination and resilience shown by most developing countries in coping with the economic setbacks of
1974 offer encouragement and stimulus to the Bank to
play its due role’in furthering economic development in
the region.

OPERATIONS AND POLICIES

Lending Operations

In 1974, the Bank approved loans totalling $547.68
million, an increase of 30 per cent over the previous
year’s total of $421 48 million. Forty loans were approved for 39 projects’ in 14 countries. From its inception
to the end of 1974, the Bank had made 211 loans
totalling $1.923.71 million for 189 projects in 21
countries. Of these, 124 loans totalling $1,431.14
million? (74 per cent) were from ordinary capital
resources and 87 loans totalling $492.57 million
(26 per cent) from Special Funds

The total amount lent from Special Funds increased
both in absolute and relative terms. Concessional
lending amounted to $172.86 million in 1974 as against
$118.16 mitlion in 1973, a 46 per cent increase. The
share of Special Funds loans in total lending also increased to 32 per cent in 1974 from 28 per ceni in
1973. Bangladesn ($52.1 million) was tne largest
recipient of loans from Special Funds in 1974. Other
major recipients were Pakisten ($34.0 million), Republic of Viet-Nam ($20.4. million), and Burma
($16.3 million).

A feature of the Bank's lending in 1974 was the increased number of supplementary loans, made necessary
as a result of worldwide inflation. For instance, there
was en increase of about 40 per cent in tne cost of
civil engineering works as a resuit of increased steel,
cement and fuel prices fram mid-1973 to mid-1974.
While in many cases the cost overruns were financed
dy governments from their own or other external
resources, six suppiementary foans were made by the
Bank in 1974 for a total of $37.92 million, representing
about 7 per cent of the year's lending.

Exclusive of additional financing :o meet cost overruns, the average size of loan for new projects was
$15.0 million in 1974 compared with $8.1 million in
1973. This increase was attributable to higher costs,
the larger sizé of the projects assisted and the termination of the Special Funds Supplementation Scheme
Operated in 1973, under which certain projects were
financed with two loans, one from ordinary capital
resources and one from Special Funds.

The largest loan so far was made during the year
for the Manila Water Supply Project in the Philippines.
$51.3 million; the Sui-Karachi Gas Pipeline Project in
Pakistan received two loans totailing $53.17 million,
including a supplementary ioan of $23.51 million to
meet an anticipated cost overrun. The largest share in
tota! lending during 1974 was that of Pakistan (18.3
per cent), followed by Republic of. Korea (16.3 per
cent), Indonesia (14.3 per cent) and Malaysia (11.9
per cent). Over the period 1968-1974, the three main
recipients of Bank loans have been the Repubiic of Korea
(17.8 per cent). Philippines (12.6 per cent) and
Pakistar. (12.4 per cent).

At tne end of 1974, the total cost of projects for which
the Bank had provided direct financing was estimated
at about $3,413 million, of which Bank loans represented
approximately 47 per cent. In addition, the Bank financed indirectly, through national development banks.
projects estimated to cost $1,192 million, of which
the Bank's financing reoresented about 27 per ceni.

In 7974, the sectoral distribution in the Bank’s
lending reflected some of the priorities of the developing member countries arising out of the food and
energy crises and the widespread economic slowdown.LOANS APPROVED IN 1974 BY COUNTRY AND BY PROJECT

Compared with the 1973 sectoral distribution, the
1974 pattern reveals a sharp rise in the share of the
agriculture sector in total lending. The agriculture sector
includes forestry, fisheries, irrigation, integrated area
development, agro-industry and agricultural credit. The
sector received 14 loans totalling $134 miltion in 1974
compared with 10 loans totalling $47 million in 1973.
Area development schemes in the Imjin Aree in the
Republic of Korea and in the States of Pahang and
Sabah in’ Malaysia absorbed more than one-third
of the total lending for agriculture. Other areas of concentration in 1974 were irrigation. fisheries and agroindustry. Of the amount lent for agriculture in 1974,
about 52 per cent— $69.75 million—was financed
from Special Funds.

FE ae 1968-1973

Five loans totalling $76.56 million were made in the
power sector, including $47 million (in two loans) for the
Tarbela Hydropower Project in Pakistan. As Executing
Agency for the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), the Bank undertook to carry out an overall
Energy Policy Study for Bangladesh, which was preceded by an Inception Study.

For most of the developing member countries, 1974
was 4 transitional year with respect to planning in the
power sector. In the light of the energy crisis, governments had to re-examine investment priorities within the
sector and, in planning investments. to focus on projects
based on indigenous sources of power generation.
None of the new projects financed by the Bank in
the power sector in 1974 involved the use of imported ,
petroleum resources.

Five loans totalling $104.87 million were made for
industrial projects, which included the Sui-Karachi Gas
Pipeline Project in Pakistan ($29.66 million and a
supplementary joan of $23.57 million) and the Baturaja
Cement Project in Indonesia ($37 million).

Four industrial development banks in three countries
received Bank loans in the form of credit lines totalling
$82 million for relending for small and medium industrial
development projects. Two of these banks, the Korea
Development Bank and the Korea Development Finance
Corporation, are well-established institutions; the former
had received two Bank loans in earlier years. The
other two banks, the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin Sangstha
(BSRS} and the Industrial Development Bank of
Viet-Nam (IDBV), are comparatively new institutions.
Technical assistance from the Bank was given in
conjunction with the loan to BSRS and preceded the
loan to IDBV. .

Nine foans totalling: $81.51 million were made for
transport and communications, including $23 million
for the Bangladesh Railway Project, the first loan made
by the Bank in the rail transport sub-sector, |n addition,
eight technical assistance projects‘ were approved. A
considerable portion of the loan provided for the Pahang

1 Snelu¢ing one regional project.

to the transport requirements of the Project which are
being given prominence in the initial stage of this area
development scheme.

Three ioans totalling $68.8 million were made for
water supply projects in Indonesia, Laos and the
Philippines.

In the education sector, two technical assistance
projects— one for Indonesia and the other for the Republic of Viet-Nam—were approved. A proposed loan
for vocational education was at an advanced stage of

training centers for farmers and agricultural extension
officers will be established as a result of the training
component built into the projects in the agriculture
sector, as, for example? under the !mjin Area Development Program in the Republic of Korea. A typical
example of the Bank’s training and institution -strengthening activities in the industry sector is the technical
assistance extended to the Bangladesh Shilpa Rin

training its economic, financial and engineering staff
in various aspects of project appraisal and implementation.

Social Impact

An important objective in project formulation, and
indeed in project identification, is to ensure directly or
indirectly that, within the frarnework of economic
justification, the benefits of the Bank’s development
assistance are as widely spread as possible and the needs
of lower-income groups in particular are taken into
consideration.

In agricultural. development, for example. special
efforts have been made to design projects which wil!
benefit the rural poor. Integrated area development, as in
the Sabah Land Development Project. is one type of
investment which contributes to providing improved
employment and living conditions for the rura! population. In this Project. about 4.300 families from remote
and scattered rural areas and from over-populated
tegions lacking employment’ opportunities will be
brought into settlement schemes, where they will be
provided with housing. They will live in villages for
which schools, medical clinics, sports centers and other
infrastructure facilities will be constructed by the
Government. The objective is to provide the settlers
with gainful and secure employment. training in
Improved agricultural practices and, in due course,
the Opportunity to acquire landholdings of econornic
size.

in the other types of agricultural investment. special
attention has been given to the needs of small producers,
Particularly in tess developed areas, Lending to
Industrial development banks, which accounts for 16.9
per cen: of the Bank’s tota. lencing to date, has Deen a
valuable means of expanding empioyment opportunities.

Loan Administration

During the year, the loan administration function was
transferred from the Operations Department to the Projects Departments as part of the recrganization of these
Departments, designed to improve supervision of projects from the appraisal stage to project completion.
A Loan Administration Unit was created in Projects
Department Ii, primarily to undertake a continuing review of loan administration practices and procedures.

Thirty-six Ordinary and 21 Speciai Funds loens
became effective during the year, bringing the total
number of loans which have become effective to 160
as of the end of 1974; this figure is net of 27 loans for
which disbursemenis have been completed. Loan
cancellations in 1974 amounted to .$3.47 million, consisting of amounts not utilized at closing date and canceliation of portions of loans.

The award of procurement contracts in 1974 totalied
$356.1 rnillion, more than double the previous year's
figure of $176.1 million. Total disbursements in
1974 amounted to $187.5 million’ an increase of
$41 million over the 1973 figure. The relative percentages of cumulative contracts awarded and disbursements
to net total effective !oans were 50 per cent and 29 per
cent, respectively, by end-1974 as compared to 45 per
cent and 28 per cent in 1973, as shown in the table
on page 12.

Post-Evaluation

Ouring 1974, the Bank further strengthened its
activities in the post-evaluation of completed projects
A Program for Action was approved in August 1974 with
two main objectives: first, to determine whether
projects had achieved their intended objectives; and
second, to re-examine, in cooperation with the developing rember countries and the executing agencies
of the various projects, the objectives themselves and
the effectiveness of the means of achieving them.

The Program incorporated two categories of postevaluation. The first. in operation since 1973. entails
internal post-evaluation carried out by the Economic
Office, with the assistance, as necessary, of short-term
consultants; staff from operating departments participate
only in supplying background information as required.

During the year, the Economic Office completed
internal post-evaluation studies on an expressway

 

project. a development bank project and an irrigation
project. and the reports were circulated to the Board
of Directors, the borrowers and the executing agencies.
In addition, the field study for the post-evaluation of an
airport project was undertaken in late 1974.

The second category, which was introduced in 1974,
entails post-evaluation of selected projects by independent external agencies. The evaluating agency in
each case is to be chosen from among academic or
other non-profit organizations or institutions with
special knowledge of economic development in the
developing world. The first four projects for external
post-evaluation were selected in November.

Technical Assistance

The Bank was more active in technical assistance
in 1974 than in previous years, both in regard to
the number of projects approved and the cost involved. Thirty-one technical assistance projects (excluding regional activities*) were approved in 1974 at a
total cost of $5,419,800, compared with 24 projects in
1973 costing $2,597,300. Twenty-one commitments
were made for project preparation in 1974 and ten for
advisory services (including four given in conjunction
with Bank loans).

Fourteen countries shared in the technical assistance:
Bangladesh and Indonesia (five projects each), Philippines (four), Pakistan and Republic of Viet-Nam (three
each), British Solomon Islands and Tonga (two each),
and Afghanistan, Republic of Korea, Laos, Malaysia,
Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Western Samoa (one
each).

The sectors covered were agriculture {12 projects),
transport (seven), electric power and water supply

extended in 1974 or earlier. The loans totalled
$164,405,000, whereas the cost of the technical assistance involved was $1,255,500. Altogether, loans
totalling $378.628,000—including six toans totalling
$22.773,000 arising out of technical assistance which
was primarily advisory in nature—have resulted from
technical assistance costing $6,471,000.

Eighteen technical assistance projects were completed in 1974 bringing the total completed to date to
80. Forty-four of these entailed project preparation and,
of these, 33 had led to loans totalling $330.8 million
by the end of 1974. (Two more project preparation
technical assistance operations which were still in
progress had led to loans totalling $25 million.) Most
of the remaining 11 projects were expected to lead to
joans in 1976.

The 18 projects completed in 1974 comprised
12 for project preparation and 6 which were advisory
or operational in nature.

Regional Activities

As a regional development finance institution, one of
the important functions of the Bank is to promote
regional cooperation. Arising out of past regional
activities, the Report of the Asian Industrial Survey
for Regional Cooperation, for which the 8ank
made a contribution of $200,000 in 1971. was published
by the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) in 1974

The major preparatory work, initiated in 1973, for the
implementation of the Nam Ngum Hydropower
Project was completed in 1974. During the year, the
Bank continued to coordinate mobilization of financing
for the second phase of construction of the Nam Ngum
hydropower facilities in Laos. The Project has regional
significance: through sales of surplus power to Thailand,
Laos will be able to earn significant amounts of foreign

 

exchange. Under a loan to the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand, the Bank will finance the associated transmission facilities in Thailand to absorb the
additional power to be generated by the second phase
facilities at Nam Ngum

in June 1974, the Bank agreed to act as Administrator
of the Second Nam Ngum Development Fund. and to
waive all claims for the costs of its services as coordinator of Project execution, estimated at $750,000
The Fund Agreement became effective on 5 July 1974
All individual loan agreements entered into between
several Contributor Governments and Laos relating to
their respective contributions, as conternplated by the
Fund Agreement, had become effective by the end of
1974. Protocols to the Fund relating to additional
contributions by Australia and the Netherlands were
signed on 26 July and 20 September 1974 respectively.
bringing total contributions to the Fund to more than
$26 million.

Contributors to the Fund are: Australia, India, Japan.
Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United
States. Bilateral contributors to the Project are Canada
and Federal Republic of Germany. The Fund Agreement establishes the principles upon which the
Project will be executed under the supervision of the
Administrator (the Bank) and provides for the coordination of the parts of the Project to be financed out of the
Fund and out of bilateral loans.

Consultants began work in April 1974 under interim
financing arangements. Procurement for major contracts was being processed at year-end. The Project is
expected to be completed by late 1977. Preliminary
action to obtain additional financing by Contributor
Governments to meet an anticipated cost overrun, due
to inflation and price escalation, was initiated by the
Bank as Administrator.

A technical assistance grant of $30,000 was approved
for the Asian Productivity Organization's Fifth Project Feasibility Study Training Course, scheduled
to take place during January-March 1975 on similar
lines to the Third and Fourth Courses held
in 1973 and 1974 with assistance from the Bank.
The Fourth Course was held in the Philippines (Stage |)
and Japan (Stage Il) from 23 January to 12 March
and was attended by 30 participants from 10 developing
member countries of the Bank, and Iran and Japan. The
courses impart training to suitable personnel trom
development institutions, industrial promotion and
advisory agencies, and national productivity organizations in the preparation of project feasibility studies and
the assessment of the feasibility of development
projects.

The Bank continued to maintain close contact with
the Southeast Asian Agency for. Transport and
Communications Development (SEATAC) which
has been established in Kuala Lumpur and which
provides a permanent secretariat for the Coordinating
Committee of Senior Transport Officials of Southeast
Asian Countries (COORDCOM). SEATAC began operations in 1973 and is in the process of identifying transport projects of regional significance for consideration
by COORDCOM. The Bank, acting as Executing Agency
for UNDP, undertook to provide technical assistance to
SEATAC for the preparation of a three-year work program
based on a detailed examination of specific regionalgrojects. Tre resu.cing program wil! be fol.owec up :n

Lending and Operational Policies

A number of important policy decisicns were mace
in 1974 as part of a continued effort to cevelop operetional policies responsive to the neeas of the develooing
meme: counties. Such changes were made secessary
by ne tapidiy changing economic situation in 1974

Secided to edopt ¢ standardized set of ‘erms. In

of the less developed of its develosing member courties. Accordingly. ir contrast to the earlier practice
whereoy Specia! Funcs ioans were made on terms

Following this softening and standarcization of the

eligible countries seeking limited additional financing
from ordinary capital resources. ,

In deciding on the new criteria, recognition was
given to the importance of extending technical assistance in order to enhance the capacity of the less
developed countries to utilize external financing. The
criteria are subject to annual review.

Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency
Expenditures

Prior to mid-1974, the Bank had provided foreign
exchange loans to meet only the foreign exchange costs
of projects. including the import content of locally procured goods. In July 1974, it was decided to finance
in addition, in suitable cases,’a reasonable: proportion
of the total local currency expenditures of Bank
projects by lending foreign exchange for this purpose.
This decision has enabled the Bank to widen the scope
of its operations

in considering proposals for local expenditure financing, the primary emphasis is on country considerations,
taking into account, in particular, the country’s overall
balance of payments situation. including the current and
prospective availability and utilization of foreign exchange and the limitations on domestic resource mobilization. Priority for such financing will be given to the
member countries classified by the United Nations as
“least developed” or “‘rnost seriously affected’, and to
the war-affected member countries in Indochina.
Within countries eligible for such financing, preference
is to be given to projects with a relatively high local
currency component and high economic and social
benefits, in such fields as, for example. agriculture and
education.

in general, the Bank will be selective in making financing available for local expenditures and the countries
concerned will be expected to make reasonable efforts
themselves towards mobilization of resources for
development. For the time being, such financing will be
limited to a maximum of 5 per cent of the Bank's
annual lending from ordinary capital resources and 10 per
cent of its annual tending from Special Funds resources.
The “reasonable proportion” of local expenditure financing for a given project will be decided on the basis of
the circumstances of the individual country. the nature
of the project, the extent of other Bank financing in the
country and the annual ceiling on such lending as indicated above. Towards the end of 1974, the Bank
provided local cost financing on a limited scale for four
projects in two countries — Bangladesh and the Republic
of Viet-Nam.

Financing of Interest and Other Charges During
Construction

At the end of December 1973, out of 171 approved
loans, the’ Bank had financed the interest and other
charges during the project construction period for &
total of $44.5 million spread over 34 ioans.t| Such
financing was provided rather selectively. and predominantly in connection with loans from ordinary
capital resources. The objective in financing interest
and other charges is to provide a certain measure of

1, In 1974 such financing was approved in five loans and arnounted
to $12.0 million.

relief to the immediate debt-servicing burden of the
country concerned and to ease the strain on the project
entity during the construction period.

In mid-1974, the Bank's policy of financing interest
and other charges during construction was reviewed
and guidelines for future operations were forrnulated.,
Where borrowers so request. the Bank will be prepared
to provide such financing except in the following cases.

(a) where the balance of payments of the country
concerned shows a comfortable situation
(reflecting. inter alia, a fairly continuous overall
balance of payments surplus and relatively
low debt-service burden), although in special
cases this stipulation could be over-ridden to
meet the needs of the project entity:

(b) where, considering the current overall level and
future project possibilities of Bank financing in
the country concerned, the amount of interest
and other charges during construction requested to be financed in a project appears to
be unusually large; and

(c) ina line of credit to a development bank. since it
would not be possible to anticipate the periods
of construction of the various sub-projects
financed from the Bank credit and also the
amount of such financing that would come
from the local currency resources of the development bank.

Although there were some exceptions, the general
practice in the past was not to provide financing of
interest and other charges during construction in
Special Funds loans, partly because the resources
available for Special Operations were limited and
partly because there was already a high degree of
concessionality in Special Funds lending. Special

. Funds resources remain limited: furthermore the new

standardized terms have improved the concessionality
of Special Funds loans. Accordingly, it was decided
that. for the time being, the past practice would continue without exception.

Bank Operations in South Pacific Developing
Member Countries

Following a review of the strategy for Bank operations
in the less developed member countries in late 1972.
a more specific examination of policies and operations
in the developing member couniries in the South
Pacific was undertaken in the latter half of 1974.
The six developing member countries in the South Pacific
tegion, namely, British Solomon Islands, Fiji, Gilbert and
Ellice Islands, Papua New Guinea, Tonga. and Western
Samoa, have many similar features and problems, e.g
small-scale economic structures, geographical isolation
and dependence on one or two primary commodities.
It was appreciated that, in contributing to economic and
social development in these countries, the policies and
procedures of the Bank's operations would require some
adjustment and would have to be applied flexibly.

A primary need is to find ways of improving the
capacity of these countries to utilize developrnent
assistance. It was decided, therefore, that emphasis
would continue to be placed on technical assistance for
the formulation of national development plans, the
identification and preparation of priority projects, and the
strengthening or establishment of national developmentbanks. The possibility of a “package” approach to
lending in these countries, whereby a oar could de
extended to a suitable entity for financing a group of
small projects. would be explored, Some simpiification
of procedures end practices in the fields of loan processing and procurement arrangemen’s was also considered appropriate in the circumstances of these
countries. without, however, lowering tne Bank's
gstablished standarcs of loan processing or relaxing its
procurement requ.rements.

Interagency Cooperation

The events of 1974 highlighted the importance of
cooperative endeavors, as much between international
agencies as between countries. The Bank actively
sought new opportunities for applying its own skills
and resources in conjunction with the efforts of
developing member countries and others interested in
the development needs of its region. The importance of
the coordination of efforts was stressed at the Annual
Consultation between the Heads of the African Development Bank, tne. Inter-Arnerican Development
Bank and the Asian Development Bank held in Washington in September 1974. The three Presidents made
known their interest in the newly formed Development
Committee cf the World Bank and the IMF and in the
Speciai Programme of the United Nations concerned
with countries most seriously affected by the economic
crisis. In the areas of aid coordinatiar and technica:

ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES AND
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

A review of the Bank’s financial policies was
undertaken in 1974. This review derived particular
relevance from the increased requirements of the
Bank's developing member countries arising from
the international economic situation and the Bank's
growing efforts to meet these requirements, which
must entail increasing resort to the world’s capital
markets.

Liquidity

The liquidity policy of the Bank, adopted in 1972
and continued in 1973, was again reviewed in 1974.
tt was decided to simplify the liquidity formula and to
maintain liquid resources at a minimum level at year-end
equal to the next two years’ loan disbursements,
instead of two-thirds of the next three years’ disbursements. It was also considered desirable to
encash, in two equal annual instalments in 1975 and
1976, notes of non-regional members and Japan
relating to their original capital subscriptions. Furthermore, projections of the Bank’s lending program and
of its resources position confirmed the need for substantial borrowings.

Borrowing .

The high levels of interest rates which prevailed in
the international capital markets throughout the year
were not conducive to borrowing on the scale planned
Two borrowings were made in 1974, one in the Middle
East and one in Japan. and additional borrowings
were anticipated early in 1975.

In April the Bank made a bond issue in Kuwait,
which was the Bank's first borrowing in a Middle
East country. The issue was for an amount of Kuwaiti
Dinars 5 million {about $16.9 million) of 7-1/2 per
cent 10-year bonds at par and underwritten by the
Kuwait Investment Company as the manager and the
Nomura Securities Co. Ltd. as the co-manager. The
proceeds of the issue were paid to the Bank in two
equal instalments on 1 May and 1 November. Repayment of principal will be made in six annual instalments
commencing 1 May 1979.

The first borrowing from the Export-Import Bank of
Japan was also made in April in an amount of ¥7,500
million (about $25.24 million). The loan carries an

interest rate of 7-1/4 per cent and will mature after
16 years including a 4-year grace period. Under the
Agreement the Bank may draw upon the loan as needed
for disbursements. By the end of 1974, ¥4,500 million
had been drawn down and it was expected that the
balance would be drawn down before the end of
February 1975.

A further consequence of the high interest rates was
that the Bank could not secure any new participations
in 1974 by commercial banks and other institutions in
project loans made from the Bank's ordinary capital
resources. At the end of the year, aggregate loan
participations stood at $14.01 million for 26 project
loans; $10.24 million had been collected from participants to meet disbursement claims of borrowers and
$4.53 million had been repaid to participants in earlier
loans.

Lending Rate

As a result of the review of the financial policies of
the Bank, it was decided that the Bank's lending rate
for new loans from its ordinary capital resources should
be increased from 7-1/2 per cent to 8-1/4 per cent
per annum effective from 3 Septernber 1974 (both
rates include a commission of 1 per cent.)?

ln determining the interest rate, the primary consideration was to maintain a reasonable balance between
the needs of the Bank's developing member couniries
for assistance on the least onerous terms and the
necessity of sustaining the Bank's ability to borrow in
world capital markets.

The Bank's lending rate of 7-1/2 per cent had
remained unchanged from May 1970 (when the rate
was first increased from 6-7/8 per cent). despite’ the
upward trend of .interest rates in capital markets.
Through a blend of selective long-term borrowings
and short-term borrowings at low interest rates, it
had been possible for the Bank to maintain its average
cost of borrowings before mid-1974 at a level which
would sustain the lending rate of 7-1/2 per cent.
Considering recent trends in capital markets, the need

1 On 14 February 1975 this rate was further increased to 8-3/4 per
cent per annum and. for certain countries, to 9-1/2 per cent

to maintain a sound financial position and to facilitate
future borrowings. an increase in the lending rate was
considered unavoidable.

In respect of loans to national development banks
already approved as of 3 September 1974 which
carry the rate prevailing at the time the amount of
sub-loans is credited into the loan accounts, it was
decided that the new rate would apply subject to a
period of grace. For such loans, for which an application for approval of a sub-project or request for a
credit to the loan account was received by the Bank
together with necessary supporting documents on or
before 31 October 1974, the rate of 7-1/2 per cent
was applied.

The Bank's policy on commitment charge, which is
fixed at three-quarters of one per cent and is levied on
progressively increasing portions of the loan less the
amounts disbursed, remained unchanged.

Capital

The Bank’s authorized capital stock was
$3,365,716,500 on 31 December 1974. The subscribed
capital was then $2,770,274,203, having increased by
$45,419,077 during the year as a result of (i) subscription from a new member, Gilbert and Ellice
Islands, and {ii) additional subscriptions from Italy
and Norway to the capital increase authorized in 1971.
The Gilbert and Ellice Islands subscribed to 15 shares
valued at $180,952.

By the end of the year. 34 out of 41 members’ had
subscribed to the capital increase authorized by the
Board of Governors in Resolution No. 46 adopted in
November 1971. Subscriptions to the increase were
$1,466,402,870 at the end of 1974.

Extensions of the time for subscribing to the increase
in authorized capital stock were approved by the Board
of Governors under Resolution No. 76 adopted on 26
June 1974 and Resolution No. 78 adopted on 17
December 1974. Under Resolution No. 78, the closing
date for subscriptions is 30 June 1975.

Member Currencies

In terms of the decision taken on 31 August 1972,
the Bank has adopted the new exchange rates of the
currencies of 24 member countries for translation of
currencies in the accounts of the Bank and for the
purpose of maintenance of value of capital subscription.

During the year, action was taken for maintenance
of value settlements in regard to several currencies.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Loan disbursements from ordinary capital resources
in 1974 amounted to $160.3 million, taking the total
of such disbursements as of 31 December 1974 to
$399.3 million. Loan repayments during 1974 totalled
$12.65 million. of which $12.00 million was on loans
held by the Bank and $0.65 million on portions sold
to participants. Cumulative loan repayments totalled

1 Of the remaining seven, three new members absorbed the capital
increase in their initial subscription.

$26.55 million. of which $22.02 million was on loans
held by the Bank and $4.53 million on portions sold
to participants.

Investments

At the end of the year, the Bank’s investments —
held in 19 convertible currencies and in one nonconvertible currency — totalled the equivalent of $365.9
million. of which 27 per cent was held in government
securities and government-guaranteed obligations of
member countries and 73 per cent in time deposits
and certificates of deposit of banks in member countries
and with the Bank for International Settlements.

Of the total investments in government securities
and government-guaranteed obligations of members,
26 per cent was invested in securities maturing within
one year and 74 per cent in securities maturing after
one year. Of the total investments in time deposits and
certificates of deposits of banks in member countries
and with the Bank for International Settlements, 58
per cent was invested in deposits maturing within one
year and 42 per cent in deposits maturing after one
year,

Income and Expenses

Gross income for the year was $57,510,720. After
deducting $2,865,800 as commission appropriated to
the Special Reserve to meet the Bank's liabilities on
borrowings or guarantees, the unappropriated income
for the year was $54,654,920.

Administrative Expenses for the year were
$12,931,990, of which $4,267,000 was charged to
Special Funds as an Administration Charge to Special
Operations. Net Administrative Expenses attributable to
ordinary operations for 1974, therefore. were $8,664,990.

The cost of Services to Member Countries during
the year, excluding $1,523,007 charged to the Technical
Assistance Special Fund, was $171,269.

Financial expenses were $19,077,253.

Changes in the Value of Currencies resulted in a net
loss of $314,155.

Gross expenses for the year amounted to $28,227,667:
Net Income for the year was $26,427,253, as shown in
Appendix 1-1].

Accumulated Income and Ordinary Reserve

At the end of 1973, the Bank’s Ordinary Reserve
was $34,966,240 representing accumulated income
less charges on account of restatements of the Bank's
capital stock. At the Seventh Annual Meeting. the
Board of Governors allocated, pursuant to Article 40
of the Articles of Agreement, the net income of 1973
in the amount of $15,657,480, to the Ordinary Reserve,
thereby increasing the Ordinary Reserve to $50,623,720.
The net income for 1974 in the amount of $26,427,253
(see Section on Income and Expenses and Appendix
1-Il), is available for allocation by the Board of Governors.SPECIAL FUNDS

Asian Development Fund

A significant milestone in the evolution of the Bank's
Special Funds operations was reached in 1974. with
the coming into effect of the Asian Developmeni
Fund.

Tre Func is designed to provide a mechanism for
the systematic mobilization of resources for the Bank’s
concessional lending operations. and for the efficient
administration of these resources. Contributions to the
Fund are to be untied for procurement in a'l developing
member countries end in ali contributor countries. They
will be drawn upon, on a pro-rata basis, to finance
loans on concessional terms for the economic end
socia! development of the Bank’s deve'oping member
countries. The criteria for such loans, as approved
during the year. place special emphasis upon the
needs of the poorer and less developed member
countries.

The initial mobilization of resources jor the Asian
Development Fund was to occur in two stages, as
authorized by the Board of Governors’ Resolutions
No. 67 for the First Stage and No. 68 for the Second
Stage. Under Resoiution No. 67, commitments of
contributions from deveioped member countries of the
Bank were to become effective. end the Fund wes to
come into operation. when a@ tote! of at least $260
million in commitments had been reached under the
First Stage of the mobilization arrangements. The
iarget date for achievement of this objective was set
oy the Governors at 30 June 1974. In January,
nowever, it became clear that the United States would
not be in a dosition to make its ful! First Stage cortributicn by the target date, anc Resolution No. 67 was
modifieg oy the Governors to ocernit the Bank to
receive the United States contribution in two equal
instalments, of which oniy the first needed :o be
commited by 30 June 1974. At the same cime, the
minimum figure for effectiveness was reduced to $225
million

With the adoption in Aprl 1974 of Reguiations to
govern the Fund and the administration of its resources,
@ further preparatory step towards the estabiishreent
of the Asian Devetopment Fund was completed.
The Reguiations, which incorporate the basic principles
previously outlined by tne Board of Governors in

 

 

Republic of Viet-Nam: This rice land forms part of the 8,220 ha. of
irrigable land in the Mekong Delta which will benefit from the Bankassisted Tan An integrated Agricultural Project.

Resolution No. 62 and reflect aiso the procedures and
principles laid down in Resolution No. 67, and in the
Bank’s Articles of Agreement, were acopted on 18
April 1974. They were reviewed by ihe Board of
Governors at the Seventh Annual Meeting, and came
into e“fect upon the estebl:shmert of the Asien Development Fund.

By 28 June 1974, the Sank had received First Stage
Instruments of Contribution from Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan. Netherlands. New Zealand. Switzerland, United Kingdom and
United States, in @ totai amount exceeding $225
million. On that date, therefore, all the Instruments
became effective and the Asian Development Fund
was formally estabiisned. Later in 4974, Australia
and Norway also made their First Stage contributions
under Resolution No. 67.

As of 31 December 1974, the Bank was thus
administering Asian Development Fund contributions
trom 12 of its developed memboer countries, in a
total amount of approximately $245.9 milion, The
contributions are fisted in the table on page 32.
Three of the contriautors (Finlana. New Zealand and
United States) heve invoked the proviso in Resotution
No. 67 oermitting contrinutors uncer the First Stage, in
special cases, io tie their initial contridutions to the
Fund, a possibility which is not open in the case of
Second Stage contributions. Several contributors have
exercised the option extended in Resoiuton No. 67 to
credit towards their Asian Development Fund cortriSution amounts woicn they hac previously contributed
to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund efter 31 December
4972.

individuel cortributions uncer the initia, resource
mobilization avrengements are rade in national cur
   
 

rencies of the respective contrioutors. The amount
to be contributed is the ecuivalent of the United

  

States dollar emount authorized by Resolutions Nos.
67 and 68, at the rate of exchange prevailing when the
Resolutions were adopted in November 1973. As in

   

3132

the case of earlier contributions to the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund. no maintenance of value obtigations
attach to the contributed resources. Due to movements
in exchange rates, the total value of committed Asian
Development Fund First Stage contributions stood on
31 December 1974, in terms of current US dollars in
which the Bank's loan commitments are made, at
approximately $15 million less than the US dollar
amount envisaged for these contributions under Resolution No. 67.

it is important for the Bank that those members
who have already indicated their intention to participate
in the Asian Development Fund should make or complete their contributions under the First Stage as soon
as possible, and that arrangements should be made for
bringing the Second Stage into effect in good time. A
review of these matters was planned for the early
months of 1975. In addition, urgent attention would
have to be directed to the need for a replenishment of
the Fund, to enable the Bank to carry on its concessional
lending operations in 1976 and beyond.

Multi-Purpose Special Fund

The Bank continued in 1974 to administer resources
contributed in the past to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund, and to draw upon these resources to finance
concessional loans.) An earlier contribution from
Beigiura of 100 million Belgian Francs ($2.8 million)
became effective curing the year. The only new contribution made to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund in
1974 was an amount of $50 million from the United
States, which on 28 June 1974 was transferred to the
Asian Development Fund in partial satisfaction of the
United States’ commitment under the First Stage
resource mobilization arrangements described above.
Five other members—Finland, Japan, Netherlands.
Norway and Switzerland—aiso transferred the whole
or part of earlier Multi-Purpose Special Fund
contributions to the Asian Development Fund by
crediting the amounts towards their First Stage contributions to the Fund.

The net result was that, as of 31 December 1974,
the Bank was still administering in the Multi-Purpose
Special Fund resources totalling $257.6 million made
available by 10 developed member countries, as well
as resources of $57.4 million set aside by the Governors
frorn the paid-in capital of the Bank. The resource
position of the Multi-Purpose Special Fund at that
date is summarized in the table at right. It is the
Bank's objective in due course to arrange for the transfer
of all these resources to the Asian Developrnent Fund,
thus bringing to a successful conclusion the process of
rationalizing and streamlining the structure of the
Bank's Special Funds which was begun in 1972. It is
hoped that substantial progress towards this objective
can be achieved in 1975, and consultations have
already begun with concerned contributors towards
this end.

1 Resources of the Multi-Purpose Special Fund, like those of the
Asian Development Fund, are available to finance the Bank's concessional loans. However, Multi-Purpose Spectal Fund contributions
have been made on differing terms and conditions, while conwibutions te the Asian Development Fuad must be made on uniform
terms and conditions, except in certain special cases under the
First Stage where tying has been permitted.

Utilization

During 1974, the Bank provided loans from its
Special Funds resources for 19 projects in 12 developing
member countries, in a total amount of $172.86
million. Descriptions of these loans, which were
primarily in the sectors of power, transport and communications, and agriculture, appear elsewhere in this
Report? The total ammount committed in loans (excluding

prior to 21 March 1974 the Bank charges interest (including service fee of 3/4 of 1%) ranging from 1% per annum to 3% pers annum: such loans

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1974 and 31 December 1973

 

NOTE 1—
GENERAL

{a) Since 1967 the Bank has established Special Funds Resources
to finance the special operations of the Bank as provided in
Article 19 of the Articles af Agreement. Such Special Funds
Resources consist of a Technical Assistance Special Fund, an
Agricultural Special Fund and a Muiti-Purpose Special Fund.
(n 1973, the Bank's administration of the Agricultural Special
Fund was terminated upon repayment to the contributor or
taallocations of the contributions to the Multi-Purpose Special
Fund.

(b) In 1974 the Asian Development Fund was established. As permitted by the authorizing and subsequent resolutions of the
Board of Governors, several contributors have elected to have

. their contributions to the Multi-Purpose Special Fund made in
1973 and 1974 credited toward the amount of their contributions
to the Asian Development Fund, Accordingly, several contributions in the Multi-Purpose Special Fund have been transferred to
the Asian Development Fund.

(c} Since the Special Funds Rules and Regulations do not apply to the
Asian Developmant Fund, the accompanying financial statements
do not include the operations and activities of that Fund.

NOTE 2—

rates.

income and expense amounts in currencies other than United
States Dollars were translated for each quarter generally at the
rates of exchange which prevailed at the beginning of the quarter.
Translation adjustments relating to funds representing the unexpended balances of contributions were offset by increases or

decreases in the contribution accounts. Translation adjustments
relating to the capital set-aside pursuant to the provisions of

countries to be used by the Bank for financing technical assistance
activities. In most cases, the initial use of the contributions shall be for
the procurement of expert services and facilities from the contributing

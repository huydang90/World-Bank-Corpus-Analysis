ANNUAL REPORT

-- 1990The Asian Development Bank

The Asian Development Bank, a development finance
institution consisting of 49 member countries,* is engaged in
promoting the economic and social progress of its developing
member countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Bank started functioning in December 1966 with its
Headquarters in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by the
governments of 34 countries from the Asia-Pacific region and 15
countries from Europe and North America.

In 24 years of operations, the Bank has become a major
catalyst in promoting the development of the most populous and
fastest-growing region in the world today, The Bank's principal
functions are: (i) to make loans and equity investments for the
economic and social advancement of developing member
countries; (ii) to provide technical assistance for the preparation
and execution of development projects and prograrns and
advisory services; {iii} to promote investment of public and
private capital for development purposes; and (iv) to respond to
requests for assistance in coordinating development policies and
plans of member countries. In its operations, the Bank is also
required to give special attention to the needs of the smaller or
less developed countries and give priority to regional,
sub-regional and national projects and programs which will
contribute to the harmonious economic growth of the region as a
whole.

The financial resources of the Bank consist of ordinary
capital resources, comprising subscribed capital, reserves and
funds raised through borrowings; and Special Funds, comprising
contributions made by member countries, accumulated net
income and amounts previously set aside from the paid-in
capital. Loans from ordinary capital resources, which account for
66 per cent of cumulative Bank lending, are generally made to
member countries which have attained a somewhat higher level
of economic development. Loans from the Asian Development
Fund are made on highly concessional terms and almost
exclusively to the poorest borrowing countries.

The Bank has borrowed funds for its ordinary operations
from the capital markets of Europe, Japan, the Middle East and
United States. The Bank's callable capital, which at the end of

1

1990 accounted for nearly 88 per cent of its subscribed capital,
backs its borrowings in the capital markets.

The Bank's operations cover the entire spectrum of
economic development, with particular ernphasis on agriculture,
energy, capital market development, transport and
communications and social infrastructure. Most Bank financing
is designed to support specific projects. The Bank also provides
program, sector and multiproject loans.

The Bank actively pursues co-financing activities with official
as well as cornmercial and export credit sources. The Bank has
also entered into equity investment operations.

The Bank's highest policy-making cody is its Board of
Governors which meets annually. The direction of the Bank's
general operations:is the responsibility of the Board of Directors
— composed of 12 Directors (each with an Alternate) — eight
representing regional countries and four representing
non-regional countries. The Board of Governors conducts an
election for the Board of Directors every two years.

The President of the Bank is elected by the Board of
Governors for a term of five years, after which he may be
re-elected, The President is Chairman of the Board of Directors
and under its direction he conducts the business of the Bank. He
is responsible for the organization, appointment and dismissal of
officers and staff in accordance with regulations adopted by the
Board, in this he is assisted by the Vice-Presidents, who are
appointed by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of
the President.

The Bank has 27 departments and offices — including
Resident Offices in: (i) Dhaka, Bangladesh; (ii} Jakarta,
Indonesia; (iii) Islamabad, Pakistan; and (iv) Kathmandu, Nepal
and a Regional Office in Port Vila, Vanuatu — dealing with
various operational, financial, administrative and general
support functions. At the end of 1990, the Bank had 606
professional staff.

 

The term “country,” as used in the context of the Bank, refers to members of the
Bank and does not imply any view on the part of the Bank as to their sovereignty or
independent slatus. On 22 February 1991, the Mongolian People's Republic
joined the Bank as ils 50th member.

procurement.

The Board paid attention to the Bank’s operations in
the South Pacific and discussed the report of an ad hoc
working group established to analyze the issue. The report
responded to the concerns expressed by the Governors of
the South Pacific developing member countries (SPDMCs)
for strengthening the Bank’s South Pacific Regional Office
(SPRO) and encouraging greater coordination between external agencies and donors in order to serve the needs of
the SPDMCs more effectively.

The Board approved 63 public and private sector loans
totalling $3,972 million for 57 projects and 16 private sector

THE BANK IN 1990

THE BANK’S lending and investrnents during the year for
both public and private sectors amounted to $4,009 million,
a rise of 9 per cent from a year earlier. Of this, government
and govemment-guarenteed loans (including guaranteed
credit lines for onlending to the private sector) and direct
private sector loans totalled $3,972 million (up 10 per cent)
for 57 projects. Equity facilities, including underwriting commitments, in the private sector amounted to $37 million, a
decrease of 45 per cent.

The higher lending volume partly reflected a substantial
rise in lending to the Bank’s larger corrowers, namely, India,
Indonesia, Philippines and Sri Lanka, as well as an increase
in the average size of loans from $52 million in 1989 to
$63 million. It was also partly due to a threefold rise in
program loans to $820 million from $275 million a year
earlier. Program ioans accounted for about 21 per cent of
total Bank lending although the three-year moving average
share (1989-1991) of program lending is expected to be
about 13 per cent.

Of the total loans approved, $2,492 million was from
interest-bearing ordinary capital resources (OCR}, up
10 per cent, and $1,480 million from the concessional
Asian Development Fund (ADF), up 9 per cent.

ECONOMI

FOLLOWING a prolonged period of robust expansion that
began after the 1983-1982 recession, the world economy
appears to be heading for more moderate growth. During
the first half of 1990, there was an optimistic outlook for
the world economy, enhanced by new economic oppor‘tunities emerging in Eastern Europe and by the strong
growth wend in Western Europe resulting from changes in
preparation for a single market in 1992. However, this
optimism was tempered by the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in
‘August 1990. As a result, there was increased uncertainty
in the global economic‘environment, raising fears of a world
recession.

Economic slowdown in the industrialized countries and
a significant increase in oil prices in the second half reduced
growth in the developing world in 1990 to a level where per
capita income grew only marginally. However, average
economic growth in the Bank’s developing member
-countries (DMCs) remained well above that in other developing regions. Although most DMCs faced a less favorable
external environment and a marked upsurge in inflationary
pressures, the aggregate inflation rate, on average. declined
in, 1990 because of large falls in inflation in People’s
Republic of China (PRC). Some DMCs were particularly
affected by the Gulf crisis as they suffered large losses in
workers’ remittances from Kuwait and Iraq on top of higher
ot bills.

The International Setting

World economic growth in 1990 decelerated to about
2 per cent, about 1 per cent lower than the rate recorded in
1989. The slowdown continued a trend already observed in
1989 when several major industrialized economies, particularly in North America, entered a cyclical deceleration in
economic activity. The significantly higher oil prices during
the second haif and persistently high world interest rates
aggravated the global slowdown. Finally, the enormous
economic adjustment problems experienced in the USSR

and Eastern Europe as well as the stabilization programs

 

   

undertaken by several countries in Latin America led to
negative growth rates in those regions.

Besides these events, earlier hopes of a major
breakthrough in the Uruguay Round ivade negotiations by
December 1990 did not materialize. World trade over the
next two decades will be shaped largely by the Uruguay
Round and the extent of progress towards global free trade
will have very significant implications for the future of the
world economy. The negotiations, particularly on the
elimination of agricultural subsidies in developed countries
and the inclusion of textiles under the General Agreement

on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are of considerable significance
for DMCs. A move towards greater protectionism through
bilateral agreements and the creation of trade blocks would
be a major setback for the world economy in general and
for DMCs in particular, as their reliance on free trade for
their economic development is relatively more important.
The failure of the December concluding negotiations and
their postponement to early 1991 was thus a disappointment and a major source of concern.

Reflecting a general slowdown in world economic
growth and domestic demands, the volume of world trade
expanded by almost 6 per cent in 1990, against
7.3 per cent in 1989. import demand declined significantly
in North America and to some exteni in Asia, although it
remained rather buoyant in Western Europe, particularly in
Germany. These developments led to some narrowing of
major world current account imbalances. The terms of trade
for non-oil exporting developing countries deteriorated
markedly as US dollar-denominated export prices for nonfuel primary commodities fell by about 8 per cent. In spite
of some loosening of monetary conditions in Canada,
United States and a few Western European countries during
the second half of the year, the stance of monetary policies
in the world remained relatively restrictive, particularly in
Germany and Japan. Rising inflation also led many developing countries, including many DMCs, to tighten their

monetary policies. World interest rates thus remained relatively high. Such developments, combined with weaknesses
in some banking systems, added to the perceived fragility of
the global financial system, which was further unsettled by
large declines in stock market values around the world. The
specter of a world credit crunch, combined with a sharper
oil price shock, increased the possibility of a general recession in the world economy by the end of 1990.

Economic Situation in
Industrialized Countries

Average output growth for the industrialized countries
declined by nearly 1 per cent to 2.5 per cent. Reflecting
differences in cyclical positions manifested since mid-1988,
this slowdown, however, conceals a significant divergence
of experience. While Germany and Japan continued to grow
robustly, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom
and United States lagged, effectively entering recessions by
the end of the year. The decline in real output growth in the
latter countries was led by a marked slowdown in domestic
demand — both consumer demand and business investment.

US GDP growth wes about 1 per cent, a significant
reduction from 1989. The slowdown was characterized by
softer dornestic demand. The foreign sector made a smallbut positive contribution to growth, but this was insufficient
to compensate for reduced domestic expenditures.

In contrast, spurred by continuing buoyant consumer
and investment demand, Japan showed iittle signs of slowing
down, with GDP growing by 5,6 per cent, marginally higher
than in 1989. This growth occurred in spite of the tightening
of monetary policy and the increasing pressure on factor
markets.

Econornic growth in the European Community (EC)
economies continued to be robust, except for the United
Kingdom. For the EC as a whole, GDP expanded by
2.5 per cent, compared with 3.3 per cent in 1989. The
German economy” remained particularly strong, exceeding
its 1989 growth of nearly 4 per cent. Tax cuts in early 1990
led to a large increase in consurner spending while business
investment grew rapidly, partly in response to German
unification. The contribution to growth of Germany's external sector, however, fell by nearly 2 percentage points. In
other EC countries, economic growth slowed somewhat and
fluctuated between 1 and 4 per cenit.

Employment growth in the industrialized countries
slowed in line with changes in economic activity. In Australia,
Canada and New Zealand, the unemployment rate increased
throughout the year, while in the’ United States it started
rising during the second half. In contrast, the unemployment
rate continued to fall significantly in Germany and Japan,
where it stood at only about 2 per cent. For the EC countries
as a whole, unemployment was lower in 1990 than in 1989.
Tight factor markets in several countries and higher oil prices
significantly increased inflationary pressures in the industrialized countries. Consumer price inflation reached
4.8 per cent, aout half a percentage point higher than in
1989,

While the combined current account deficit of the
indusirialized countries increased from nearly $80 billion in
1989 to about $110 billion, the imbalances of the three
major industrialized countries somewhat narrowed. The US
deficit decreased as a result of exports substantially outpacing imports. In Germany, in part reflecting the effects of
unification, there was a marked growth in imports. In Japan,
in spite of a slower growth in imports and a faster growth in
exports, the current account surplus fell to under $50 billion.

Economic Situation in Developing Countries

Economic growth in developing countries decelerated
for the second consecutive year, reaching an average of
2.4 per cent or about one-third lower than the rate recorded
in 1989. With the exception of Asia, all developing regions
experienced negative per capita growth in both 1989 and
1990, The average, however, hides a variety of experiences.
While many countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia
registered sluggish growth over most of the 1980s, some
large developing economies, such as Brazil, the PRC, India
and Republic of Korea had grown at relatively rapid rates.

IMPACT OF THE GULF CRISIS ON THE BANK’S DMCs

THE POLITICAL crisis in the Gulf region following

Iraq’s 2 August 1990 invasion of Kuwait has severely ~

affected economic growth prospects in many of the
Bank's developing member countries (DMCs). While the
full impact of the crisis has yet to unfold, the countries
have been hit by higher international oil prices, the
disruption of trade with Kuwait and Iraq and the loss of
remittances from migrant Asian workers in the two
countries.

In 1990, about 75 per cent of the DMCs’ oil imports came from the Middle East, and DMCs which
depended more than others on Middle East oil because
of their geographical proximity to the region have been
particularly vulnerable, The oil price increase resulted in
a deterioration in the DMCs’ trade account during the
year, although some net oil exporting DMCs benefited
in the short run.

The direct impact of the loss of trade with lraq and
Kuwait was also significant. The DMCs, whose shipments to the two countries had amounted to $1.5 billion
in 1988, were believed to have suffered an export loss
of at least $600 million during 1990.

Also serious was the loss during the year of some
$600-750 million in foreign exchange remittances from
migrant workers*in the affected Middle Eastern
countries. Before the crisis broke out, there were about
600,000 Asian workers in Kuwait and Iraq. A large
number of them were later repatriated, considerably
reducing the inflow of remittances and adding to the
unemployment problem back home.

However, on an individual basis, the impact of the
crisis varied from country to country. Because of their
sound economic fundamentals and the absence of
serious macroeconomic imbalances, the newly in
In 1990, the performance of these economies was somewhat mixed. The implementation of a drastic stabilization
program in Brazil resulted in a negative growth of over
3 per cent. The ongoing austerity program in the PRC
reduced its GDP growth from the high levels of the eighties,
although its 1990 growth rate was marginally better than in
1989. India’s economy expanded but the growth still fell
below its potential. The economy of the Republic of Korea
recovered somewhat in 1990 due to strong domestic
demand, but its growth still fell short of the high rates of
1986-1988. In 1990, oilimporting developing countries
faced a sharp deterioration in their terms of trade as well as
a significant decline in the demand for their products in
industrialized countries. In addition, reduced export growth
and high interest rates added to the debt-service burdens of
the highly-indebted countries. Finally, faced with rising inflationary pressures and deteriorating external balances»most

dustrializing economies (NIEs) were in a much better
position than other DMCs to absorb the shock. Besides,
during the 1980s, the NIEs had significantly improved
their energy efficiency and reduced their dependence on
imported crude oil. For example, in Hong Kong, the
share of imported oil in totai primary energy supply went
down from 100 per cent in 1980 to 36 per cent in
1988. In Singapore, energy consumption per unit of
output dropped by 43 per cent over the same period.

Oil exporting DMCs, ¢.g., People’s Republic of
China (PRC}, Indonesia and Malaysia, benefited from
the surge in oil prices. However, much of their windfall
gains were offset by the indirect effects of the crisis, such
as a decline in exports because of a slowdown in the
world economy. In the case of the PRC, the loss of
remittances and construction contracts wrote off most
of the gains.

The South Asian countries and the Philippines were
particularly hard hit because of their close economic
relations with the Middle East. Their problems were
compounded by their big budget and current account
deficits and relatively high inflation rates and debt-service
ratios. The overall cost of the crisis to Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka, with sharply increased crude oil import bills,
decreased remittances and reduced export earnings, was
enormous:

The crisis is estimated to have lowered India's
export growth in 1990 by one or two percentage points
and inflated its oil bill by more than $1 billion. Pakistan
also suffered a significant negative impact of nearly
$1 billion, including rernittance and export losses and
additional oil import burden. These countries will need
substantial external assistance to avoid stagflation and
keep their balance of payments manageable.

developing countries had to further tighten their economic
policies, which in turn affected their 1990 growth performance.

In the developing world, except for Asia and Africa,
GDP growth declined in 1990. The developing countries of
the Middle East and Latin America experienced negative
growths of 2.6 and 1.2 per cent, respectively, against
3.7 per cent and 1 per cent in 1989. Debt-service payments
as a percentage of exporis of goods and services increased
markedly for both Africa and Latin America. In the latter
case, the rate increased to 37 per cent from 33 per cent in
1989,

in 1989, capital flows to developing countries had
amounted to an estimated $108 billion, a 4.5 per cent
increase over 1988. Official sources provided $66 billion,
half of which was on concessional terms. Private capital
flows reached around $41 billion. The exposure of officialcreditor agencies to developing countries’ debt problems has
thus increased significantly, and preliminary data show these
trends continued in 1990. Though rescheduling operations
increased, net long-term borrowing from official creditors
continued to expand rapidly. Estimates indicate an increase
of 45 per cent, about the same rate as in 1989,

The total outstanding external debt of the developing
world rose from $1,237 billion in 2989 to $1,303 billion in
1990. However, the continued growth of exports from
developing countries reduced the aggregate debt-to-exports
ratio from about 130 per cent in 1989 to about 124
-per.cent. The debt-service ratio remained more or less at the
-» .game level as in 1989,

“Overview of Developing
‘Member Countries

Despite the Gulf crisis, rising oil prices and economic
dowdoun in the industrialized countries, the Bank's DMCs
continued fo be the fastest growing region in the world. In
“spite of growth declines in a number of countries, the DMCs
“amdintained the 1989 average rate, partly because of higher
GDP growth in PRC. Other DMCs which fared better in
90 included the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, both of
which gained from increased domestic dernand. However,

Malaysia also benefited from its policy reforms, large inflows
of foreign investment and, to some extent, higher oil
prices.

The newly industrializing economies (NIEs) improved
on their 1989 performance, although only slightly, largely
due to a marked improvement in the economic growth of
the Republic of Korea. Southeast Asia experienced a siowdown due to a general deceleration in all the economies of
the sub-region, except for Malaysia. In South Asia, growth
declined, albeit marginally, due to a slowdown in the larger
economies of the sub-region. The PRC's higher GDP growth
was largely the result of a slight relaxation in austerity
policies. The economic performance of many of the Pacific
island DMCs (PIDMCs) was affected by the adverse international environment, natural disasters and the Gulf crisis.

Domestic demand emerged as:a critical factor in the
growth performance of many DMCs, particularly Indonesia,
Republic of Korea and Malaysia. Exports continued to be an
important determinant of growth, although the growth in
aggregate exports decelerated from about 12 per cent in
1989 to about 10 per cent. Performance between subregions varied. The NIEs had a2 per cenit fall in export
growth from the 10 per cent achieved in 1989, due to the
lackluster performance of Republic of Korea (with an increase of only about 4 per cent} and Taipei.China (less than
1 per cent). Singapore, with 14 per cent, recorded the

largest export growth among the NIEs, but this was not large
enough to offset the upsurge in its imports. The Southeast
Asian countries generally experienced an export slowdown,
in spite of double-digit growth rates, ranging from 12 to
18 per cent, for Thailand, Malaysia and indonesia. While
Indonesia's non-oil exports decelerated, total exports grew
by 12 per cent, principally due to higher oil shipments.
Exports improved in most countries of South Asia: India
showed a 15 per cent increase, while Bangladesh recorded
about 16 per cent, more than in 1989. The PRC’s exports
grew by 18 per cent against about 5 per cent in the year
before. Export revenues declined for most PIDMCs mainly
because of lower earnings from prirnary cornmodities.

By sector, agriculture recovered from its lackluster
performance in 1989 in a number of countries, including
the PRC and some South Asian countries, such as
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Favorable weather and, to some
extent, improved agricultural policies contributed to the
recovery. Industry, led by manufacturing, continued to be
buoyant, particularly in Indonesia and Republic of Korea.
However, infrastructure bottlenecks, civil strife and political
disputes, along with the Gulf crisis, affected industrial growth
in several South Asian countries and the Philippines.

Inflation remained under control in most DMCs and the
average inflation rate was 6.6 per cent. In the NIEs, inflation
was generally caused by large wage increases due to fight
domestic labor markets, strong domestic demand, as well as
higher oil prices. In Southeast Asia, infrastructure bottlenecks and relatively expansionary monetary policies were
contributory factors. The PRC's 3 pér cent inflation represented a significant iraprovement from the 16 per cent level
of 1989. The continuing austerity program was a major

factor.

The current account balance of the developing world
improved significantly in 1990, although still recording a
deficit for the year. The balance of the DMCs deteriorated
from a $1.7 billion surplus in 1989 to a $2.3 billion deficit.
Lower exports and a rapid increase in imports were to
blame. The external debt situation of the DMCs continued
to remain relatively comfortable compared with the situation
in other developing regions. The ratio of the DMCs’ outstanding external debt to exports of goods and services was
about 113 per cent in 1990, considerably lower than the
124 per cent for the entire developing world Sirnilarly, the
debt-service ratio for the DMCs was about 12 per cent,
compared with about 16 per cent for the developing world,although the debt situation of a number of poorer DMCs
caused concern.

The following paragraphs discuss economic developments in five DMC groups: NIEs, Southeast Asia, South
Asia, the PRC and PIDMCs.

Newly Industrializing Economies

Robust Growth Persists

Despite the slowdown in the world economy and ihe
impact of the Gulf crisis, the NIEs experienced robust growth
in 1990. For the NIEs as a whole, GDP growth improved
to 6.5 per cent from 6.2 per cent in 1989. The higher
growth resulted primarily from an improved performance of
Republic of Korea’s economy. which achieved an
8.5 per cent growth, more thar: 2 per cent above the previous year’s growth. At 2.3 per cent, Hong Kong's growth
was mainiained at the 1989 level. On the other hand, the
economies of Taipei.China and Singapore decelerated to
5.1 per cent and 8.3 per cent, respectively, from
7.6 per cent and 9.2 per cent a year ago.

The unexpectedly strong growth in the Republic of
Korea was propelled largeiy by increased domestic consumption, a construction boom and strong investment in
plants and equipment. However, the surge in consumption

“and investments resulted in a deterioration of the trade
balance and aggravated inflation. By contrast, Taipei,China
recorded lower growth raies in almost all sectors. The
slowdown was brought about by a significant deceleration in
manufacturing activity due mainly to lower exports, a sharp
decrease in private investment and an almost 75 per cent
drop in the stock market from its peak in February.
Singapore also experienced relatively slow growth in 1990.
While the manufacturing sector was still robust, the services
sector weakened somewhat owing to slower growth of
entrepét and domestic trade and a substantial slowdown in
the financial sector. Hong Kong's economy remained sluggish following two years of continued downtrend. It suffered
frorn slow economic growth in OECD countries as well as
in the PRC. While the labor market remained tight reflected in continuing increases in wages and shortages in
selected skills — consumption and investment demand
remained sluggish. probably as a result of the slump in the
world market and uncertainty about the ierritory’s economic
future.

Inflation has become a matter for increasing concern in
the NIEs. The group as a whole had a 7 per cent inflation
in 1990 compared with only 5.7 per ceni in 1989. Several
factors contributed to this inflationary pressure. First, tight
domestic labor market led to rapid wage increases. Second,
domestic demand remained particularly strong in Republic
of Korea, Singapore and Taipei.China. Finally, given the
NIEs' high dependence on oil, the sharp rise in oil prices
was translated into higher domestic prices. However, the
inflation rate in individual economies differed widely. Hong
Kong had a marginal decrease in inflation to 9.8 per cent

from 10.1 per cent in 1989. In Singapore and
aipei,China, inflation was slightly higher than in the previous year, In the Republic of Korea, a fast expansion in the
economy pushed prices upward by about 8.6 per cent, the
highest increase in recent years.

External Sector

Exports from the NiEs grew by less than 8 per cent,
lower than the 10 per cent growth achieved in 1989, while
import growth remained high at about 12 per cent. The
group lost some of its export competitiveness due to past
exchange rate appreciations. Rapid wage increases and slow
world demand (including from the US, its largest market) also
affected the group's export performance.

By country, Hong Kong’s domestic exports declined by
about 2 per cent in 1990, but re-exports were robust and
provided a major impetus to the export sector. Imports, on
the other hand, grew by 15 per cent, due mainly to the rapid
growth in re-exports, particularly those of PRC origin. In the
Republic of Korea, a sharp decline in export volume and an
upsurge in imports resulted in a sizeable trade deficit. However, a stronger Japanese yen in the second half of the year
helped to improve the competitiveness of exports from the
Republic of Korea and led to a partial export recovery.
Taipei,China’s trade surplus declined sharply, with exports
growing by less than 1 per cent and imports, backed by
strong domestic demand, expanding by 6 per cent.
Singapore's 14 per cent growth in exports was only slightly
above the 13.8 per cent growth recorded in 1989, but a
14 per cent surge in imports (nearly 1 per cent more than
a year ago) widened its trade deficit.

Reflecting a general deterioration in trade balances,
current accounts worsened for most NIEs. While Hong Kong
and Taipei,China had significant reductions in their current
account surpluses, Republic of Korea's current account
iumed to a deficit of $2.1 billion from a surplus of $5 billion
in 1989. The trend of capital outflows from the NIEs to other
Asian developing countries, particularly to Southeast Asia,
continued. There was a significant increase in such flows
from Taipei,China to the PRC. At the same time, private
capital flow to the NIEs also increased rapidly, particularly
to Singapore and Republic of Korea. Foreign exchange
reserves in the NIEs as a whole increased although at a
slower rate than in 1989.

Domestic Policies

While the NIEs had followed a generally tight monetary
policy during 1989, they slightly relaxed their control on
money supply in 1990 to counter the adverse effects of
economic slowdown and the Gulf crisis. In the Republic of
Korea, broad money grew by 21 per cent, against
£8 per cent a year ago. The expansion was aided also by
the lowering of effctive interest rates in non-banking sectors, housing loans to low-income families and subsidized
loans to the agriculture sector. In the first half of 1990,
money supply in Taipei,China remained tight. But the stock

market crash and the Gulf crisis gradually led the Government to loosen monetary policy. Deposit and lending rates
were lowered and a special fund was set up exclusively for

private enterprises with lower interest rate charges. Money” ~

supply in Hong Kong showed a moderate growth, although
the rate accelerated during the second half. In March, the
Exchange Fund Bills Program was passed into law to provide
the authorities in Hong Kong with an additional tool for
money market operation. Under this program, the Exchange Fund will operate more frequently to influence
interbank liquidity to ensure exchange’ rate stability under
the current link rate system.

Reflecting the general trend towards healthier government finances and the emphasis on long-term growth, fiscal
policy in the NIEs became more expansionary during 1990.
In Taipei,China, implementation of 14 large public development projects was speeded up, pushing infrastructure spending by 40 per cent for fiscal year 1990/91, In Hong Kong,
government consurnption expenditure rose by 6 per cent,
slightly higher than 5.8 per cent in 1989. The Government
has planned a HK$127 billion infrastructure development
project, which will lead to a large increase in public expenditures in the years to come, in spite of anticipated private
sector participation. In Singapore, spending on social
welfare, health and education has grown from 16 per cent
of total government expenditure in 1985/86 to 26 per cent
in 1990/91. However, the Government plans to gradually
reduce the public sector's share of GDP and employment.
Government expenditure also expanded substantially in the
Republic of Korea, owing partly to increased government
spending on infrastructure.

Diversification of export markets remained an important elernent of trade policies in the NIEs. While the share
of the US in their total exports fell, from an average of
40 per cent in 1986 to roughly one-third by 1990, Asia has
emerged as the NIEs’ single largest export market, account
_ing for over 40 per cent of their total exports in 1990.

European markets in both the EC and East Europe remain
the targets for the future.

In Taipei,China and Republic of Korea, import restrictions continued to ease with the dismantling of non-tariff
barriers and the gradual lowering of import tariffs.
Taipei,China cut tariffs on another 2,000 items in 1990
after having removed tariffs on over 4,700 items in 1989.
The average tariff rate thus dropped from about
6.3 per cent in 1989 to an estimated 5.8 per cent. The
Republic of Korea is moving in a similar direction, though
the implementation of the 1990 tariff reduction plan was
postponed by one year owing to a large deficit in the current
account. Under the current five-year plan, the average tariff _
rate is targeted to drop from 12.7 per cent in 1989 to
7.9 per cent in 1993.

The long-+un competitiveness of the NIEs will depend
critically on their success in restructuring their domestic
manufacturing séctors. The NIEs are now at varying stages
of relocating their relatively labor-intensive manufacturing
activities to lower-cost countries. In the process, they have
become a major source for direct foreign investment forSoutheast Asia. A considerable amount of manufacturing
activity has been relocated from Hong Kong and
Taipei,China to the southern provinces of the PRC in recent
years.

Economic policies in the NiEs are aimed at accelerating
the process of long-term structural change and influencing
the direction of investment. For Hong Kong and Singapore,
a transfer to a more service-oriented structure appears to be
the objective. Singapore undertook further initiatives in
1990 as part of its continuing effort to deepen and broaden
its financial market. It continued to offer attractive incentives
for multinational firms which have located their regional
head offices in the country. Hong Kong made further
adjustments in regulations governing the banking sector and
the financial market in order to reduce business risk. Both
Hong Kong and Singapore amended their immigration
policies in order to attract more skilled foreign workers and
professionals. On the other hand, manufacturing will remain
the mainstay of the economies of Republic of Korea and
Taipei,China, with their indusirial structure moving towards
more technology and skill-intensive activities. Both countries
continued fo ease the restrictions on, and offer more incentives to, foreign mvestmeni, especially in high technology
.and high value-added industries.

Southeast Asia

‘Relative Buoyancy

Overall economic growth in Southeast Asia during
1990 decelerated io some extent in line with the genera!
slowdown of the world economy. The sub-region’s average
GDP growth fell to a little above 7 per cent, compared with
just below 9 per cent in 1989, due mainly to slowdowns in
Lae PDR, Philippines and Viet Nam. Nevertheless,
economic performance remained strong in Indonesia,
“Malaysia and Thailand.

Thailand’s economy continued to be robust though
some slowdown in growth was experienced in 1990. GDP
expanded at a double-digit rate for the third consecutive
year, though the 10 per cent growth in 1990 was a drop
from the estimate of 12 per cent for 1989. Exports
decelerated significantly, largely because of lower earnings
from agricultural exports, especially rice and rubber. However, rising wages and employment led to a rapid growth in
Private consumption spending while the investment boom
was spurred by the implementation of a large number of
foreign investment projects approved in previous years.
Investment in construction and public infrastructure con
. tinued to move upward.

The Malaysian economy in 1990 posted one of its
highest growth rates in over a decade, with GDP expanding
by over 9 per cent. As in other East and Southeast Asian
countries, domestic demand was the main driving force. In
Particular, investment continued to grow apace as more
attention was given to infrastructure projects, while industrial
investment benefited from large inflows of foreign capital.

For the first half of the year, approved total investment was
already $2 billion greater than the total amount of $4.5 billion recorded for 1989. In the second half, increased oil
production, combined with higher oil prices, gave an added
push to economic growth.

In Indonesia, the GDP growth of 7 per cent was slightly
lower than in 1989, primarily because the agriculture sector
was affected by bad weather and crop diseases. Although
the demand for non-oil exports weakened, the manufacturing sector continued to be buoyed by strong domestic
demand and investment. Direct foreign investrnent also
remained a driving force, with first-half approvals of $5 billion already outstripping the full amount for 1989. Growth
remained robust in spite of a sharp monetary contraction
during the second half, aimed at reducing inflationary pressures.

In the Philippines, economic growth weakened considerably, with GDP expanding by less than 3 per cent, or less
than half the rate in 1989. A combination of factors,
including drought, power shortage, earthquake, an uncertain political environment, onerous debt-service payments
and rising interest rates, slowed growth during the first half
of the year. Furtherrnore, the economy has been hard hit by
the Gulf crisis. A deteriorating current account deficit, cornbined with a rapidly widening fiscal deficit, made the
Philippine economy particularly vulnerable to higher import
prices of oil and declining remittances from migrant workers
in the Middle East.

In Lao PDR, GDP growth declined marginally to about
9 per cent from nearly 11 per cent in 1989, when good
weather had influenced a robust paddy production. Although
the agriculture sector remained buoyant, industry grew at a
much slower pace,

Viet Nam's economic growth decelerated significantly
to 2.4 per cent from 5.5 per cent in 1989. This reflected
the poor showing of agriculture with only a 1 per cent
growth in output against over 6 per cent in the preceding
year. Adverse weather and a shortage of fertilizers were
responsible for the setback. After a 2 per cent decline in the
preceding year, the industrial sector recovered as earlier
reforms began to take effect.

Continuing a trend already observed in 19839, inflation
in Southeast Asia was generally on the rise. A combination
of fast growth and strong domestic demand for several
consecutive years, mounting infrastructure bottlenecks, and
relatively expansionary monetary policies during most of
1990 contributed to higher inflation. The pressure was
aggravated by rising wages and production costs associated
with higher energy prices.

In Indonesia, inflation accelerated because of rapid
monetary expansion and increases in domestic fuel prices.
A tightening of monetary policy during the second half of
the year kept the inflation rate at about 9 per cent. Substantial increases in domestic energy prices during the second
half caused inflation in the Philippines to soar. Excessive
public sector spending, the depreciation of the peso, and
domestic supply disruptions owing to natural calamities
pushed the inflation rate to about 15 per cent. In Thailand,

 

 

TOMATO growing is part of a private sector tomato paste
project in Thailand which the Bank assisted with @ loan
and equity inuestment.

higher food prices, steep increases in domestic fuel prices
after August and rapidly rising wages due to a tightening
labor market, particularly for skilled labor, pushed inflation
to about 6 per cent from 5.4 per cent in 1989. Inflation
remained at a relatively low 3 per cent in Malaysia (a slight
increase from 2.8 per cent in 1989), thanks to prudent
monetary and fiscal policies pursued by the Government. In
Lao PDR, improved monetary management brought down
the inflation rate from 68 per cent in 1989 to about
19 per cent in 1990. In the case of Viet Nam, inflation rose
to 90 per cent from 76 per cent in the previous year. Nonetheless, this represented a dramatic improvement from
earlier years when the inflation rate was above 300 per cent.

Slowdown in Exports

& slowdown in the growth of Southeast Asian exports
was quite noticeable in 1990. Thailand’s merchandise ex-ports.grew by 18 per cent, but this was a sharp deceleration
from the more than 25 per cent growth in 1989. Strong
domestic demand and higher oil prices led to 2 23 per cent
increase in merchandise imports, and the trade deficit
widened to an estimated $4.7 billion. The current account
deficit also increased to $4 billion fromm $2.5 billion in 1989.
Thailand has one of the largest current account deficits in
Asia, reaching about 5 per cent of GDP in 1990. However,
the external debt situation remained very comfortable.

Malaysia's exports increased by less than 16 per cent
as nor-oil exports slowed down. At the same time, imports
registered a 25 per cent surge as demand for capital goods
imports rose in line with increased investment demand. The
trade surplus of about $2.5 billion was significantly smaller
than. in 1989, and the current account deficit worsened
primarily as a result of a large increase in the deficit on the
services account. However, the level of externai debt
declined and the debt-service ratio improved.

‘In Indonesia, the growth rate of non-oil exports

‘ decelerated, although total exports rose by about

12 :per cent mainly as a result of higher oil shipments.
Imports, fueled by a strong demane for capital goods and
consumer durables, rose 17 per cent. Both the trade and
‘current account balances of Indonesia deteriorated in 1990.
Because of the rapid increase in imports, Indonesia's current

“account incurred a deficit of $2.4 billion, compared with a
deficit of $1.1 billion in the preceding year. While extemal

debt remained high at over $55 billion, the debt-service ratio
declined to 28.4 per cent due to a siowdown in the growth

“. .of external borrowing combined with a rapid increase in

exports.

in the Philippines, despite an almost 20 per cent
depreciation of the peso against the US dollar, export
growth was sluggish, partly because of supply constraints in
agriculture and industry. Merchandise exporis grew’ by almost 5 per cent, while merchandise imports expanded by
16 per cent. The current account deficit widened to about
$2:6 billion, or 5.6 per cent of GDP. The external debt
situation continued to be a cause for concern. Although the
level of external debt declined slightly to $28.2 billion, the
debt-service ratio increased to about 30 per cent.

Domestic Policies

Economic reforms continued to characterize domestic
policies in Southeast Asia in 1990. In Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines and Thailand, liberalization, deregulation and
privatization efforts appeared to intensify, albeit at varying
degrees. Financial deregulation and investment liberalization
made significant progress, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia
and Thailand, while in the Philippines attention was more
on fiscal and monetary policies. ‘In the newly emerging
market economies of Lao PDR and Viet Nam, some policy
reforms were also underway in the financial and industrial
sectors. Allin all, policy reforms helped, inno small measure,
in cushioning the impact of adverse external events, thus
allowing for the relative economic buoyancy of the
Southeast Asian countries.

In. Thailand, liberalization of the financial sector was
further intensified. Ceilings on fixed deposits were abolished
and permits to manage mutual funds were extended to other
institutions. Moreover, new financial instruments are being
considered to facilitate liquidity adjustments at lower cost.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance is planning to broaden
the base of direct taxes to correct the uneven distribution of
income and increase revenue.

In Malaysia, liberalization of investment, in addition to
high-class infrastructure, continued to attract a massive
inflow of foreign investment. The implementation of a
Privatization Master Plan, which identifies a total of 246
government-owned enterprises, began in mid-1990. Earlier
in the year, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. the main
source of capital for corporate investors, was delinked from
Singapore. which increased the average daily turnover to
about $70 million for the whole year from roughly $16 million in 1989. Finally, a bili to stimulate offshore activities
such as banking, trading and non-trading businesses, insurance and trust companies was presented to Parliament.

Indonesia achieved financia! deregulation to some extent through increasec competition and the lowering of
spreads during 1989 and early 1990 when liquidity was high
and deposit and lending rates were iow. This, however,
resulted in capital outflows to offshore banks ‘because of
compressed yield differential. Similarly, the Bank of
Indonesia's contractionary monetary policy in mid-1990
was countered by inflows and reflows from abroad. In
response to the dwindling resources of the public sector
since 1980, efforts are under way to develop the private
sector. The private sector is now allowed to invest in power
generation, water supply, roads and telecommunications,
activities which have traditionally been undertaken soiely by
the public sector.

In the Philippines, adverse externa! developments and
a series of natural disasters contributed significantly to slippages in fiscal management. Thus. the authorities had to
rely heavily on monetary instruments to control’ the imbalances in the economy. The public sector deficit continued
to swell! and interest rates soared beyond 30 per cent, especially in the jatter part of 1990. As part of fiscal reforms, the
Government began to reduce the fiscal deficit -by raising
additional revenues and cutting down expenditure. Growth
of base money was held in check and the reserve requirement was raised to 23 per cent to help contain inflationary
pressures and dampen speculation on the peso. Despite
earlier intervention, the Central Bank had to-allow the peso
to drastically depreciate to 28 pesos to the US dollar by late
October 1990. .

Lao PDR implemented some important financial
reforrns. Several new commercial banks were established
and a Central Banking Law defining the regulatory. supervisory and monetary policy authority of the’ Bank of
Lao PDR was passed. Other reforms to stimulate the private
sector and promote investment included laws covering
property and inheritance rights as well as those: governing
commercial contracts. Viet Nam initiated some indusirial
policy reforms including managerial and administrative

 

21revamps in state-run enterprises. Additionally, the Government has under consideration a number of important industrial sector and financial policy changes, including
opening of a stock market.

Efforts to intensify economic cooperation within the
ASEAN continued in 1990. Cooperation in several industrial areas was expanded through ASEAN industrial
complementation projects and ASEAN industrial joint ventures. In late 1990, the oil sharing scheme was reviewed and
given new impetus in view of the worsening Gulf crisis.
Finally, the idea to establish a larger economic bloc, that
includes East Asian countries as well, was discussed within
the ASEAN cormmunity.

South Asia
Mixed Performance

Most South Asian countries showed a mixed performance in 1990, with aggregate GDP growing by
4.6 per cent. While economic performance remained well
below potential, a general improvement in growth was noted
particularly in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. After a
series of devastating floods, cyclone and drought in the
preceding two years, Bangladesh recovered strongly enough
to record a 6.2 per cent growth, exceeding the
Government's target. This was mainly due to a strong
7.7 per cent growth in agriculture and an equally impressive
growth in industry. Aside from favorable weather, some of
the dynamism in agriculture was attributable to improved
policies, which helped expand irrigation and the supply of
inputs. In spite of a sluggish performance of the agriculture
sector, Pakistan's GDP grew by 5.3 per cent, marginally
higher than the 5 per cent growth in the previous year.
Industrial growth improved to over 6 per cent from about
5 per cent in 1989, primarily because of a substantial
recovery in the large-scale manufacturing sector. Better
weather and an improved law and order situation in most
parts of the country helped Sri Lanka’s economy to grow
5 per cent, a substantial improvement from the 2.3 per cent
growth achieved in 1989. For India, 1990 started with a
good monsoon and a good harvest, accompanied by accelerated industrial growth. Unfortunately, the momentum
was disrupted by the Gulf crisis, and the country ended up
with a more moderate GDP growth of 4.3 per cent. However, foodgrain production reached a new high of 176.5
rnillion tons. Although Nepal had a 3.2 per cent growth in
agricultural production, its economy was adversely affected
by temporary trade and transit disputes with India. A sluggish
2 per cent growth resulted in a deterioration in Nepal's real
per capita GDP. Myanmar achieved a growth rate of about
5 per cent on the strength of favorable performance by most
sectors of the economy. Mining led with a substantial
38 per cent growth. In Maldives, GDP recorded an impressive 10.8 per cent growth as a result of significant expansion
of the tourism and fishing sectors.

pose a major problem although its magnitude difiered. In
Bangladesh, an expansionary fiscal stance combined with a
depreciation of the currency pushed inflation to 8 per cent,
about 2 per cent over the 1982 levei. In India, high budget
deficits and domestic energy prices kepi inflatior. at a reletively high level. Inflation ir. Sri Lanka accelerated from
11.6 per cent in 1989 to almost 22 per cent due mainly to
2 reduction in government subsidies on food prices, the
lagged effect of devaluation of the currency and a sharp
increase in oil prices. Inflation in Nepal, about 9 per cent.
was attributable to a substantial wage increase, as well as to
a shortage of essential commodities due to the trade dispute
with India. In Pakistani. partly due to slack monetary policy.
injlation rose to avout 9 per cent from nearly 8 per cent in

1989

External Deficits Widen

On the externai front, both trade and current account
deficits generally widened in all South Asian countries, even
though exports improved. In the case of India, expor's

Health and Population Project which the Bank assisted

increased by about 15 per cent in 1990. reflecting the
beneficial effecis of trace and industrial liberalization policies
adopiec in recent years. However, this growth was lower
than in 1989, partly reflecting the Gulf crisis, 2 depressed
market for gems and jewelry and events in the USSR
Imports aiso increased by 14 per cent due to higher bills for
oil and fertilizers. The balance of payments was under
increasing pressure from the Gulf crisis, which imposed
additional burdens on the economy. Imports grew by about
11 per cent in Bangladesh, parily as a result of the
Governmeni’s policy of import liberalization. However, the
country’s terms of trade showed some improvement over
1989. due largely to higher prices of its exports. notably
ready-made garments, raw jute and jute goods, leather and
shrimp. Myanmar’s exports grew by about 32 per cent. with
agricultura: products and gems and jewelry being the maior
contributory factors. However, the trade gap widened as
imports grew by 40 per cent.

For Nepal. the impact of the trade impasse with India
was evident during the first quarter of 1990, when exports
to India were at a standstill. Nevertheless, the value of tota!

     

23exports for the whole year rose by about 12 per cent, a
substantial recovery from the decline in export earings
recorded in 1989. The value of imports, on the other hand,
increased by over | per cent, the same growth as in the
previous year.

At about 8 per cent, Pakistan’s export growth was
modest, affected mainly by an adverse movement in international prices, domestic political uncertainty and ethnic
violence in the large industrial and commercial cities. But the
Government was able to contain import growth ta less than
1 per cent, in spite of a sharp increase in petroleum prices
and heavy imports of wheat and sugar. The current account
balance, which had deteriorated in 1989 due to poor export
performance and a decline in workers’ remittances, improved somewhat in 1990. The deficit narrowed from
$1.9 billion to about $1.7 billion. Although Sri Lanka experienced a higher export growth due to rising agricultural
exports, its imports rose by more than 12 per cent, and its
current account deficit, at about 4.4 per cent of GDP,
remained (in relative terms) one of the largest in Asia. The
balance-of-payments position of Sri Lanka was very
adversely affected by the Gulf crisis, which reduced exports
and workers’ remittances, increased its oil bill and imposed
a heavy burden in terms of the cost of repatriating its workers
from the Gulf area. Maldives posted relatively sluggish
growth in both exports and imports and recorded a marginal
improvement in the current account balance.

Domestic Policies 
Reduction of budget deficits remained a major concern
for most South Asian countries. India took measures to
augment revenue and to reduce expenditure through
rigorous control of non-essential current spending. The
revenue measures included increases in indirect taxes on
various consumer items, a rise in oil prices, a surcharge on
corporate income tax and higher personal income taxes.
Bangladesh hiked customs duties, raised excise duties on
cigarettes, natural gas and banking services, and made an
upward adjustment in the prices of petroleum and items
produced by public enterprises. Pakistan expanded the
coverage of sales tax to include a wide range of domestic
and imported goods, withdrew several tax exemptions,

adjusted the prices of eleciricity, gas and fertilizers, and «

imposed a strict control on nondevelopment expenditure. in
Sri Lanka, the budget deficit as a percentage of GDP improved further as revenues increased. At the same time,
expenditure went down largely due to project implementation difficulties resulting from the civil unrest in the country,
Myanmar was able to expand revenues through a broadening of the tax base, increased cost recovery in respect of
public services and the introduction of a commercial tax with
a larger coverage than the earlier commodity and service
taxes it replaced. Maldives continued to pursue a conservative fiscal policy and posted a budget surplus.

In general, South Asian countries aimed af tighter
monetary policies to contain inflation. In India, broad money
supply grew by about 16 per cent against 19.8 per cent in

1989. A 17 per cent increase in broad money supply in
Bangladesh was consistent with the growth, price and external objectives of its economy. In Pakistan, money supply
grew 12.8 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in 1989, and
exceeded the origina! target of 10.8 per cent. Sri Lanka
tightened monetary policy by increasing the bank rate by
1 per cent to 15 per cent, and raising the interest rates of
the National Savings Bank and for the Treasury Bill auction
by 2 per cent in each case. Maldives tightened credit and
controlled money supply, which grew by about 13 per cent
against 18 per cent in 1989.

Despite their increasing current account deficits, most
South Asian countries continued to liberalize irnports and
pursue active exchange rate policies to deal with external
imbalances. Bangladesh removed a further 70 categories
from the controlled list of imports, reducing the number of
categories subject to quantitative bans or restrictions from
354 (28 per cent of the total) to 284 (23 per cent of the
total}. The exchange rate was depreciated to restore competitiveness. Pakistan introduced a number of trade
liberalization and tariff rationalization measures, including a
further reduction in the number of items in the negative and
restricted lists and a lowering of maximum tariffs in all
categories of goods.

Although Sri Lanka's tariff regime is one of the most
liberal in Asia, further reforms were introduced to strengthen
the systern. The quota system for garment export was
liberalized and the level and dispersion of effective protection
rates were further reduced. In Myanmar, foreign trade,
which was formerly the monopoly of the state, was opened
to the private and cooperative sectors. Accordingly, the
Government allowed the registration of exporters, importers
and business representatives engaging in foreign trade. The
country also permitted a few foreign enterprises under its
foreign investment law. Maldives continued its trade
liberalization effort — which was initiated with the removal of
import quotas in 1989 — pursued a flexible exchange rate
policy, and adopied a liberal framework to encourage
foreign investment.

Sri Lanka implemented a new industrial policy extending greater credit facilities and tax concessions to the private
sector, a policy which will provide a major stimulus to growth
in the manufacturing and service sectors in the coming years.
India announced new industrial and trade policies. Tariffs
were reduced on various capital goods used in export
production, export incentives were increased, and import
licensing restrictions were eased on several capital goods and
intermediate inputs. The new industrial policy, which is not
yet operative, considerably reduced restrictions on capacity
licensing and product mix, and allowed greater private sector
participation in power generation and steel manufactures.

In Bangladesh, major financial sector reforms were
introduced to improve efficiency, increase the flexibility of
the interest rate structure and reflect market forces to a
greater degree. These included fixing interest rates on
deposits to ensure positive returns to depositors, setting the
interest rate for priority sector lending at below shadow
market rates, abolishing the policy designating BangladeshBank to prescribe the credit ceiling for each bank, and
repiacing the sector-specific subsidize refinancing facility by
2 general rediscounting facility. India introduced jurther
financial sector reforms, notably a rationalization of the
administered interest rate structure.

People’s Republic of China

The PRC’s economic growtn rate improved io about
5 per cent from 4 per cent in 1989, although this fel! far
short of the almost double-digit annuai growth raies achieved
in the eighties. The austerity program since September
1988 and, to a lesser extent. the improved GNP growth
neiped fo ease inflationary pressures. The inflation rate, as
high as 16.3 per cent in 1989, decelerated to about
3 per cent, much iower than the origina: official iarget.
However. as a consequence of ihe Gulf crisis and United
Nations sanctions against Iraq. the PRC suffered a ioss of
about $2 billion.

The economic recovery was lec by agriculture, which,
helped by good weather, grew dy about 6.9 per cent to a

record grain output of over 420 million tons. The industrial
secior remained depressed, although output rose sharply in
tne last quarier of the year. anc the sectoral growth of
7.6 per cent representec a slight decline from 8.5 per cent
in 1989. However, ali enterprises were no* equally affected
by this slowdown. While state enterprises were the most
affected, township and viliage enterprises ‘ared a little oetter,
although their performance siili fel! shor: of their historical
trenc levels.

In the externai sector, there was a sharp turnarounc in
the trade balance from: the $5.6 billion deficiz in 1989. With
exports rising by 18 per cent and imports declining by
11 per cent. the trade balance registered a surpius of
$7.5 billion. Together with a small surplus in the services
account of 30.6 billion, the current account showed a
surplus of $8.4 billion in contrast to the deficit of $4.3 billion
in 1989. Severa: factors cortribuiec te the turnaround.
including a deliberate government effort to encourage exports and reduce imports, the eifect of the December 1989
devaluation. of the domesiic currency and continuing weak
domestic demand. While the current account posted a
surplus. foreign investment inflows were about the same

ilevel as in 1989. The PRC’s international reserves stood at
$26 billion at the end of the third quarter, equivalent to about
six months of imports. Total external debt reached $48 billion, of which about 20 per cent was short term, and the
debt-service ratio remained limited to about 9 per cent.

Domestic Policies

Encouraged by the success of the austerity program in
reducing inflation and curbing overheated industrial growth
in 1989, the Government introduced some relaxations
through changes in monetary, credit and income policies in
the second quarter. To encourage consumer spending,
deposit rates were lowered in April and again in August
1990. Similarly, to boost investment demand, interest rates
on enterprise loans were lowered and credit restrictions,
especially for investments in energy, transport and raw
materials, were eased. As a consequence, investments in
state enterprises, which had been cut back by 9.2 per cent
in 1989, increased by 7.3 per cent in the first three quarters
of the year. However, retail sales remained sluggish, although they started to rise in the last quarter. Because of this
sluggishness of final demand, industrial inventories continued to rise, leading to a decline in profits and taxes from
state-owned enterprises and an increase in their financial
losses. Indeed, the increased industrial output in the state
sector was achieved largely through infusions of credit,
which financed the accumulation of inventory.

Partly because of its success in controlling inflation and
partly because of the need to reduce food subsidies, the
Government allowed the prices of certain daily necessities
to increase and announced its intention to raise retail prices
of grain over the next five years. The prices of other
subsidized commodities, such as coal and petroleum, also
rose, Nevertheless, the Government remained cautious in its
approach to this problem in order to avoid inflationary
pressures. In response to concerns expressed at the end of
the year that credit expansion to revive industrial output had
been too rapid, the Government re-emphasized its intention
to restrict credit and continue the austerity program, even
at the cost of slightly lower growth. Whether inflation would
become a threat in the post-austerity period will depend, to
a large extent, on how far the Governrnent is prepared to
go in promoting general economic reform, including the
restructuring of loss-making enterprises.

In the external sector, reforms included an almost
10 per cent devaluation of the currency against the dollar in
November. The incentive for external trading organizations
to retain 80 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings was
extended nationwide. It was announced that export subsidies
would be discontinued in 1991. Imports were placed under
strict administrative controls. Future external trade reforms
are likely to be undertaken to meet the requirements of the
PRC's application for membership to the world trade body,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).

The PRC Government reiterated its commitment to its
policy of economic reforms and opening up to the outside
world.

External Environment Deteriorates

Natural calamities, low primary commodity prices and
high energy prices adversely affected the growth performance of most Pacific island DMCs (PIDMCs} in 1990.
Papua New Guinea continued io suffer from closure of the
Bougainville copper mine since May 1989. Output growth
from new mining projects were insufficient to keep valueadded in the mining sector from dropping sharpiy. Combined with sluggish growth in the agriculture sector, partly
resulting from a disruption of production in the North
Solomons Province, the mine closure resulted in a GDP
decline of about 1.6 per cent. Western Samoa was hit by
cyclones which damaged infrastructure and sharply reduced
coconut yields and copra production. As a result, GDP
declined by 3 per ceni. Tropical storms also hit Tonga’s
production of copra, bananas and vanilla and reduced its
economic growth to less than 1 per cent, down from almost
2 per cent in 1989. Kiribati, Vanuatu and Western Samoa
suffered in various degrees from falling prices of copra. while
all PIDMCs were adversely affected by higher impor: prices
of petroleum products during the second half of the year. In
Cook Islands and Kiribati, GDP growth was below the
average rates achieved during the 1970s and the 1980s.

Some PIDMCs, however, registered better performances. Fiji’s GDP rose by over 5 per cent, primarily because of an increase in tourist arrivals, improved garment
exports and higher earnings from sugar exports. Foreign
investment in tourist-related activities and better hotel occupancy rates provided some stimulus to the economy of
Vanuatu, which also continued to grow as a regional finan‘cai center. Its GDP increased by almost 5 per cent in 1990.
“Despite generally lower commodity prices, Solomon Islands
was able to grow by about 5 per cent, nearly 2 per cent

“lower than the growth rate achieved in 1989. Exports
remained robust as shipments of copra, timber and fish
products increased.

The rate of inflation in some PIDMCs rose in 1990,
primarily as a result of higher prices for imported petroleum
products. However, in some cases, these inflationary tendencies were offset by improved supply conditions in agriculture.
In Fiji, prices rose by about 8 per cent, somewhat higher than
‘in 1989. fueled by increased energy and transportation costs.
In Papua New Guinea, inflation increased to about 7 per cent
from 4.5 per cent as a result of devaluation of the Kina, new
tax revenue measures and higher petroleum prices. Despite
increased economic activity and higher import costs. inflation
in Vanuatu fell marginally to about 5 per cent as agricultural
supply conditions continued to improve. In Soiomon Islands,
inflation, which had reached 14 per cent in 1989, moderated
significantly during the first half of the year as a result of
improved domestic supply conditions. However, higher oil
Prices in the second half pushed the year-end inflation rate
to’ 7.5 per cent.

The export performance of most PIDMCs deteriorated
in 1990 as earnings from primary commodities such as

coconut products, coffee and palm oil, either remained
stagnant or fell. Western Samoa, which suffered from a
decrease in both copra prices and output volume, was
particularly hard hit. In Fiji, continued high prices for sugar,
its dominant export, more than offset a fall in the price of
gold. The continuing decline in the prices of major agricultural crops and sharply lower copper output had an adverse
impact on export earnings and the balance of payments of
Papua New Guinea. In Vanuatu and Solornon Islands,
increased price of cocoa, fish and beef products boosted
export earnings. An increase in tourism also helped the
current account balances of several countries, including
Vanuatu, Fiji and Cook Islands. However, lower export
prices and higher import bills hit the balances of most
PIDMCs and raised the need for increased resource flows.
Further, as export growth slowed, debt-service ratios increased from 1989 levels.

Domestic Policies

To cope with a deterioration in the external environand-te improve economic efficiency, PIDMCs undertook a number of policy measures. Papua New Guinea
undertook to restore macroeconomic stability and address
the structural weaknesses of its economy. The measures
included a 10 per cent devaluation of the Kina to achieve a
shift in relative prices in favor of traded goods, a cut in
government expenditure, wage restraint designed to reduce
costs in the non-mining sector of the economy and a more
restrictive monetary policy. In Vanuatu, where the government budgetary position continued to be rather precarious,
measures were being taken to restrain government spending. In addition, efforts to attract foreign investment in
tourism continued. In Solomon Islands, the imbalance between domestic savings and investment was sought to be
corrected by increasing the elasticity of the tax system,
widening the tax base and reducing public sector capital
expenditure. To contro! domestic liquidity, monetary policy
was tightened. In Fiji, efforts were continued to develop a
Tax Free Zone and to attract foreign investment. Investment
in tourism and related sectors was also actively promoted.
In Tonga, the Government took steps to privatize its
Commodities Board in an effort to increase exports of
primary products, particularly vegetables, copra and vanilla.
In Western Samoa, measures were taken to rehabilitate the
production of coconuts, which was severely affected by the
cyclone Ofa.

Outlook for 1991

The prospects for the world economy in 1991 remain
extremely uncertain. The probability of a world recession
increased substantially at the end of 1990 and a prolonged
conflict in the Gulf would almost certainly lead to a stagnation in world economic growth and to a relatively deep
recession for many industrialized and developirig couniries.

Although the oil market did not overreact at the outset
of the Gulf conflict, oil prices in 1991 are likely to remain
very volatile, thus affecting consumer and business confidence. If there is no major extension of the Gulf conflict,
the average price for 1991 as a whole is likely to be in the
$20-25 per barrel range, about the same as the average
1990 price. In 1992, an average price above $20 per barrel
is unlikely.

Another major risk facing the world economy relates to
the current fragility of the world banking system. In the
United States, rapid credit expansion by commercial banks
during most of the 1980s caused severe strains on the
banking system as economic activity slowed down at the end
of 1990. In Japan, a sharp fall in share prices has reduced
the capital base of banks and the banking system could be
in some difficulty should property prices fall rapidly. At the
same time, huge capital requirements in the USSR and
Eastern Europe, which became apparent in the closing
months of 1990, could very well lead to a serious worldwidecapital shortage should the level of world savings not increase substantially. The combination of a credit crunch by
the world banking system and sharply increased demand for
capital in the USSR and Eastern Europe could result, in the
absence of major adjustment measures, in continued high
real interest rates. which would further increase the risk of
recession. Assuming that the impact of the above risks will
remain: limited, world output is projected to expand in 1991
at a rate of 1-2 per cent.

Industrialized countries are forecast to grow at a significantly slower rate in 1991 as recessionary conditions in
North America persist for most of the year and the Japanese
economy slows down. The US economy could expand at a
rate between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent while growth in
Japan is estimated at 3-4 per cent. Domestic demand, particularly investment demand, is expected to remain weak for

most of 1991 in North America, while in Japan investment ©

will expand at less than half the rate recorded in 1990. By
contrast, investment expenditure in the EC wilt remain
stronger, thus sustaining relatively stable growth. Growth for
‘the EC as a whole is forecast at 2-2.5 per cent. Projections
for the developing countries show a return to relatively more
rapid growth in 1991, mainly as a result of an improved
economic outlook: for Latin America. Brazil, Mexico.
Argentina and Venezuela are projected to grow at significantly higher sates in 1991 than in 1990. For the
developing world, an average growth of 3-4 per cent is
estimated, about 1 per cent higher than in 1990.
"Growth in the volume of world trade is likely to siow
down slightly in 1991.as demand weakens in industrialized
countries and imports of non-oil producing developing
countries expand ata more moderate pace. Non-fuel commodity prices are expected to remain weak, thus leading io
a further deterioration in the terms of irade for non-oil
exports. Most of the impact of higher oil prices has already
been aosorbed in 1990; therefore, world inflation would fall
back slightly in 1991. In the stronger economies, such as
Japan and Germany, inflation is expected to be higher.
While sorne easing could occur in a few of the weaker
economies, monetary policy conditions will generally remain
tight. Interest rates, particularly in Japan and Europe, are
expected to remain relatively high
Given the prospect of a global slowdown, the GDP

growth of the NIEs as a whole might go further down to
about 6 per cent in 1991 from 6.5 per cent in 1990. In the
Republic of Korea, rising inflation and a worsening domestic climate might cause the GDP growth rate to fall to 7-7.5
per cent from 8.5 per cent in 1990. However, consumption
expenditure will remain strong and exports are expected to
show a moderate recovery. Singapore, suffering from labor
shortages and a generally unfavorable world market situation, will probably see about 6 per cent growth, about
2 per cent lower than in 1990. By contrast, Hong Kong and
Taipei,China are expected to do better. While a 3.5 per cent
growth is projected for Hong Kong, the impetus coming
mainiy from an expected rebound of the PRC economy,
Taipei,China is likely to end up with about 6 per cent growth
in 1991.

With the exception of Indonesia, where oil production
accounts for a comparatively large share of the economy,
growth in the Southeast Asian economies is expected to
decelerate in 1991, perhaps to an average aggregate rate
of 6-7 per cent. Lower international demand for its products
will be the main factor behind a growth siowdown in
Malaysia. In Thailand, lower export growth will combine
with sharply higher energy prices to dampen economic
growth. In the Philippines, sluggish exports — in, particular
to the US, its largest market - despite a sizeable depreciation
of the peso, and austerity measures to keep the balance of
payments manageable and the government deficit and inflation under control, will probably mean a further economic
siowdown in 1991. By contrast, despite its tight monetary
policy and a deceleration in the growth of non-oil exports,
Indonesia will continue to benefit from higher oil revenues
and foreign investment inflows. Indonesia's GDP is forecast
to grow by 7-8 per cent in 1991, against 7 per cent in
1990. Viet Nam and Lao PDR are projected to grow by.
about 4 and 8 per cent, respectively.

South Asia is vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather.
Assuming a normal monsoon, agricultural production should
continue at least along the trend level, given the improved
policies adopted in recent years. Similarly, policy reforms to
boost the efficiency of industries are likely to be further
strengthened. However, short-term prospects have been
somewhat clouded by the Gulf crisis, which, in varying
degrees, is likely to affect most couniries in the sub-region.
Higher oil bills, lost export revenues arising from the trade
embargo on Iraq and heavy losses on account of workers’
remittances will squeeze the balance of payments of most
South Asian countries. It is expected that the countries will
all require more externa! assistance to maintain their
development efforts at current levels. Inflation is expected
to accelerate into double digits, while the average GDP
growth is expected to decline to 4-5 per cent.

For the PRC, the projection is for 5-6 per cent GNP 
growth in 1991, about the same as in 1990. So far, the
Government has been reasonably successful in coping with
inflation. Given this favorable economic condition, any
further deepening of reforms and opening up of the
economy to the outside world would help ensure a more
efficient allocation of resources and provide the basis for
moderately high growth in the medium to long term.

Improved prospects for 1991 are anticipated for Tonga
and Western Samoa as they recover from severe damages
inflicted by tropical storms. The economic performance of
Papua New Guinea is also expected to improve as production increases from. new operations revitalize the mining
sector. The prospects for other PIOMCs will depend, to a
large extent, upon the external environment. If high oil
prices persist and prices for primary commodities remain
soft, as currently projected for the next two years, inflation
and extemal balances will continue to deteriorate. Tourism
prospects remain brignt for PIDMCs like Vanuatu and Fiji,
and this could help alleviate some of their balance-ofpayments difficulties. However, it is likely that the PIDMCs
will require increased foreign assistance.

EDUCATION
AND DEVELOPMENT

 

Role of Education in Development

THE BANK views education as both a basic need and a
human right. This is in line with the concept promulgated
by the United Nations General Assembly in 1970 which
described the six pillars for a better life as "education, health,
nutrition, housing, social welfare and to safeguard the environment.” Such a concept provides the conceptua! and
ethicai framework for education as a human capital investment.’ In the development process, education has two
distinct tasks. One is to summarize a culture and transmit a
shared heritage from one generation to the next. The other
is to promote knowledge and skills needed to improve the
quality of life.

People who do not have the fundamental skills of
literacy and numeracy are denied access to the knowledge
and skills needed to benefit from, and participate in, national
development. Nations which do noi have literate popula
“tions lack the foundation upon which economic, social and
“technological progress is built. Development depends on the

ability of a nation to acquire and apply knowledge and

technology and this ability can grow only from a solid
‘foundation of basic education and literacy.

There is a great deal of evidence to show that basic
education is highly correlated with social and economic

‘development and with poverty alleviation. Adults with a

broad basic education tend to have higher incomes. greater
agricultural productivity, more frequent employment in
urban areas, lower fertility and better health and nutrition
than those without. Educated adults are also more likely to
send their children to school, thus passing on education
Opportunities to the next generation. In addition, education
can play a major role in fostering a national culture and
consciousness by promoting common national languages,
ideologies and attitudes.

 

1 The view of education as a human capital investment limits the value of
education to its role as a produciion factor and focuses, thus, on the
development of skilled manpower needed for specific sectors of the
economy,

Education is a broad term which connotes a general
preparation for life. Basic education, which typically includes
early childhood, primary and lower secondary education, is
aimed at providing a foundation in literacy, basic knowledge
and general skills. Training, on the other hand, depends
largely on education since it is basic education that provides
the skills, knowledge and attitudes upon which training is
based. Increasing the ievel of education and training of the
labor force is a major challenge for developing couniries. If
the introduction of new and productive technologies is an
essentia! ingredient of development and if advanced education and training are required for introducing new technologies, then basic education is the foundation upon which
ail further education and training rests.

Education and Economic Development

There is often a high correlation between education and
economic growth and labor productivity. Research indicates
that, in almost all areas of the world, an increase in the
average level of schooling leads to an increase in GDP. This
effect is more pronounced in countries where the general
policy environment is favorable, such as in.many DMCs in
East Asia. For an individual, a broad-based education is a
crucial factor in determining his or her ability to secure
employment. Moreover, education targeted at the poor also
serves to improve the equity of income distribution. On the
individual level, increased education allows a worker to
improve the productivity of his primary asset, labor. For
those in the wage economy, increased productivity generally
translates into higher income. However, even for those
employed in the non-wage and informal economies, the
benefits to be derived from increased education are considerable. Educated farmers are more likely to adopt new
technologies associated with higher yields. Studies in
Indonesia, for example, show that agricultural productivity
is 9 per cent higher for farmers with four years of primary
education than for illiterate farmers. Even in the informal
sector, literacy and numeracy give the low-income individual
a greater range of opportunities.Education and Socia! Development

The benefits to be derived from education are especially
significant for women and children. For example, a one-year
increase in a mother’s education is associated with a
9 per cent decrease in the mortality rate of children under
five years of age. The children of better educated mothers
are healthier, due to improved sanitary practices and better
nutrition, Women with basic education are also more receptive to madern family planning practices, which not only
help to reduce overall fertility but, through encouragement
of lengthier birth-spacing and practices such as breastfeeding, also improve the health of both mothers and infants.
improved education also encourages women to participate
more in community development activities which often
provide increased income-earning opportunities. As better
educated mothers have better educated children, benefits are
passed on from one generation to the next.

Education is clearly linked to poverty alleviation since it
provides access to the benefits of modernizing society. The
poor are to be found mainly among remote rural communities, urban slum dwellers, marginalized ethnic or
minority groups of wornen. These are the same groups that
are the least likely fo be literate or healthy, to have access
to basic education or to the skills needed for productive and
entrepreneurial activity. Since poverty is closely linked to
environmental degradation, education is also likely to result
in an improved environment. Education can provide the
knowledge and strategiés fo preserve and restore the environment.

Issues in Education in the
Asia-Pacific Region

Education for All

Quantitative expansion of educational opportunities in
the region, during the past three decades, has been impressive in absolute terms. In particular, primary school enrollment has increased significantly and several DMCs have
reached the goal of universal primary education. Generalizations, however, about the status of literacy and basic education among the region's developing countries are deceptive
because they conceal major differences within the region —
differences which reflect economic status, investment in
education and population growth rates. Most countries of
East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific have achieved high
rates of literacy and primary education enrollment, but the
same cannot be said of several South and West Asian
countries where illiteracy persists on a large scale and where
many children ~ especially girls - do not attend school (see
table overleaf}. An estimated 659 million (75 per cent) of
the world’s 882 million illiterates live in Asia. While the
proportion of illiterates of the total population in the region
is decreasing, the absolute number is increasing and will
reach a projected 693 million by the year 2000 in addition
to an estimated 54 million children out of school. For the

region as a whole, about 19 out of every 100 children who
start primary school drop out before completing it, and in
South and West Asia the dropout rate rises to 32 out of every
100, indicating extensive inefficiencies. Many of these
dropouts will revert to illiteracy.

The statistics also conceal gender inequities, especially
in South Asia. The adult female literacy rate for the region
is 68 per cent, but this figure plummets to 26 per cent in
South and West Asia. Similarly, while 83 per cent of girls
are enrolled in primary school ona regional count, the figure
is 44 per cent in South and West Asia. Given the links
between education and lower fertility, better child health and
improved nutrition, the neglect of girls’ education leads to
enormous losses. Basic education for women is achievable,
but only if the political will exists to overcome social barriers
and provide the necessary financial resources (see box story
on opposite page).

The ongoing transition of labor markets toward industrialization and the increased use of technology-based
modes of production require a work force with an advanced
educational background, broad and flexible qualifications,
and the preparedness for repeated job changes. This
suggests that most’ young people need at least nine years of
general education, with special emphasis on basic sciences
and technology and including a broad pre-vocational
orientation. Hence, the provision of Education. for All will
remain the dominant task until the year 2000 and beyond
and in countries with low adult literacy rates and a significe
number of young people who have not completed prime
school, priority stiould be given to primary education and
adult literacy training (see box story at the end of this
chapter).

Quality and Internal Efficiency

The rapid expansion of education systems throughout
the region has often been at the expense of quality and
efficiency. Improving insiructional efficiency in terms of
lower dropout and repetition rates as well as raising learning
outcomes as measured by achievement test scores, are
therefore major policy concerns. A careful assessment is
needed to determine the optimal mix of policy measures and
resources under given circumstances. In some cases, more
funds will be needed, such as for teacher training, appropriate incentives or the provision of more textbooks. In
other cases, cheaper solutions could be found, for instance,
by using the shift system or by raising the student-teacher
ratio.

Relevance and External Efficiency

Most DMCs have focused on the labor market requiremenis of the modern sector in the expectation that the
successful development of this sector will make the economy
more competitive internationally. However, emphasizing
the modern sector leads to a neglect of the usually far more
extensive informal and traditional sectors and can increase
social tensions. Attention should also be paid to developThe Primary Education (Girls)
Sector‘Loan for Pakistan

AS A major step toward‘implementing its broader
education sector policy, the Bank approved in 1989
its first assistance ‘to primary education with the
Prirnary Education (Girls) Sector loan for ‘Pakistan.
Education for girls in Pakistan has-lagged behind that
provided for boys. It is estimated that only
20 per cent of femaies in Pakistan can read and
write, and .most of these are in the urban areas. In
some rural areas, the literacy rate for females is only
5 per cent. To support.the Governrnent in its program to encourage:more girls to enroll in school and
to improve the quality of education ‘for girls, the
Bank provided .a loan of $64.2-million: The funds

curricula which are relevant for a large portion of traditional
societies.

Structural Reform

Educational systems in the region share certain common problems. The most important include an overemphasis on the formal selection mechanism at the expense
of the integration of scholastic learning with practical application: littie and belated exposure to pre-vocational orientation; separated and relatively expensive
technical-vocational tracks; an under-emphasis on science
and technology-oriented programs in certain DMCs; and,
generally, a reluctance to supplement or replace conventional schooling by alternative modes of delivery, including
distance education, non-formal education ana enterprisebased training. Although different conditions prevail in the

 

DMCs. the common task over the next decade will be to
encourage and assist in structural reforms rather than to
stabilize and expand systems with evident impertections.
The main focus of such structural reforms would be to link
education more closely to labor and community life; to make
it more cost-effective, particularly the modes of technical and
vocational education; and to ensure a more equitable
provision of educational opportunities.

Educational Management and Planning

The expansion of forma: schooling in DMCs in the past
two decades has increased the need for more efficient
planning, administration and management of education. In
most cases, the growth of enrollments and facilities at
primary, secondary and tertiary levels has not been accompanied by a corresponding increase in qualified administrative and managerial staff. Educational planning continues to
focus on central goals and objectives at the expense of
regional and local requirements. Among tne main problem
areas affecting efficiency are administrative structures and
decision-making procedures, interdepartmenial management and planning capabilities, and management training.

Resource Allocation

Although the picture is uneven, the Bank’s DMCs have
raised more public resources for education than ‘other
developing regions of the world in terms of percentage of
GNP and per capita outlays. Despite this, the average. per
capita public expenditure for education is still only around
10 per cent of that of the Organisation for ‘Economic
Co-operation and Development countries. Since 1970,
public education expenditure as a percentage ‘of ‘GNP has
slowly risen. However, the decline in the share for education
of total government expenditure indicates an increasing
compeiition for limited public sector resources.

Investment in education shows high raies of social and
individual return, more so than investment in-most forms of
physical infrastructure. Studies show that primary education
yields the highest benefits, followec by secondary and tertiary education. However, as a result of budget constraints
and competing demands for resources, governments often
do not spend enough on education or they tend to emphasize investment in higher education at the expense of
basic education. Finally, community participation is a
resource that several countries have used to great advantage
to meet their requirements.

The Bank’s Role

The Bank’s approach to education since the early
1970s shows a trend of widening the operational scope from
a rather narrow human capital rationale, typified by an
almost exclusive emphasis on technical and vocational
education, to an approach that embraces the entire sector,
including primary, non-formal and environmentalBasic Education Indicators for Bank DMCs!

education. A landmark in this changing approach was a
review of the education sector, and the Bank’s role, carried
out in 1987-1988. This resulted in the adoption of sector
policies based on a broader view of education's role in
development and a more diversified role for the Bank, with
an emphasis on basic education. The new approach was
endorsed by the Board in March 1989.1 At the same time,

and to promote growth in the longer term.

The three years from 1988 to 1990 saw the Bank
increase its role in the education sector and significantly

1 The Asion Development Bank in the 1990s, Panel Report,
January 1989.change its pattern of lending and technical assistance. This
was reflected in the Bank’s approval of its first loans to
primary education (Bangladesh and Pakistan), general
secondary education (Philippines) and non-formal education
(Bangladesh) as wel! as its first technical assistance grants for
studies of non-formal education and environmental education (Philippines). The number of DMCs receiving assistance
for education expanded to include Lao PDR and Marshall
Islands. ! Average annual lending increased to $225.6 million during 1988-1990 from $81.3 million during 19781987.* while the annual number of technica! assistance
projects tripled. Regular sector work has been added to the
activities of the sector and major sector studies were undertaken in Lao PDR, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Contacts with
other agencies have been intensified and forma! annual
consultations with the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)} and the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) were introduced.

Several other new areas of assistance for human
resource development have been opened up in recent years,
including government manpower planning in Indonesia, Lao
PDR and Thailand. In 1990, the Bank, through a regional
technical assistance grant, joined UNESCO, the United
Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF}, the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and the World Bank as a co-sponsor of the World
Conference on Education for All. This was a major gathering
of educators from 155 countries to endorse a commitment
towards Education for ll by the year 2000. In addition, the
Bank is implementing a special program of short-term
overseas training for‘its smaller DMCs and administers a
graduate scholarship program in selecied developmentrelated disciplines which is funded by the Government of
Japan (under the latter about 180 scholarships have so far
‘been awarded). These two programs help address the critical
needs of the Bank's DMCs for professional and technical
manpower and supplement provisions often made under
Bank loans for the financing of overseas training.

‘Operational Priorities and Issues

The direction and emphasis on hurnan capital development in the DMCs are determined by the DMCs’ economic
conditions and industrialization strategies among other factors. For example, the rapidly expanding producers and
exporters of manufactured goods and information-based
hardware may choose to expand secondary and university
education and improve technical education. On tne other
hand, the low-income, less industrialized economies, as well

as subsistence agricultural economies, may put more emphasis on strengthening primary education. The Pacific
island DMCs, most of which are highly literate societies with
nearly universa: primary education and, in some cases, a
high percentage of youth enrolied in secondary schools, may
wish to focus on developing the secondary level and improving academic programs and specialized training for those
activities that demand more nighly-trained labor.

The scope of the Bank’s assistance activities is being
expanded towards subsectors not adequately covered by past
lending, especially towards basic education. Among the
other sectoral priorities are: improving and reforming
secondary education. including reforms in technical and
vocational education; rationalizing higher education and

assisted with a ioan of $26 million.36

strengthening alternative approaches such as distance
education programs; developing non-formal education as a
flexible low-cost alternative to formal education; and
strengthening institutional development and research
capabilities, including planning and management.

To implement its broader role, the Bank will become
increasingly engaged in policy discussions. The content and
structure of education in a country are, of course, determined by the political choices made with respect to values,
resources and priorities. Nevertheless, there are a number
of common principles, particularly with respect to equity,
efficiency and relevance that have an important bearing on
investment decisions in the sector.

The Bank's decision to emphasize basic education, and
to enlarge its support for human resource development,
raises the issue of the financing of local and operation and
maintenance costs. Local cost constitutes the major part of
any investment in basic education and the financing of a
large part of such cost is necessary and desirable if the Bank
is to play a meaningful role in this area, With respect to

    

Java, Indonesia, under the Agricultural Education Project which the

operation and maintenance cost financing, the basic principle is well established that ultimately such costs will have
to be met from domestic resources. In the short term,
however, countries often face difficulties in meeting the
operational cost, particularly when education systems expand rapidly. In selected instances, the Bank has responded
by providing financing for such costs, albeit on a declining
scale and for a limited period.

Many countries in the region face a trade-off between
quantitative expansion of their education system in order to
provide increased access and meet requirements of social
equity, and qualitative improvements to enhance the
relevance and efficiency of the existing system. This trade-off
has an important bearing on the focus and direction of Bank
assistance. The general approach has been that, in countries
with low rates of literacy and primary school enrollment,
considerations of access, and therefore quantitative expansion, prevail, while in countries where significant progress
has been made in providing basic education to all, quality
considerations assume greater importance. Judgments as to~.. "THERE are an estimated 882 million illiterate adults in

Public Sector Operations

Bank lending with government guarantees in 1990 was
made up of project, program and sector loans and credit
lines through development finance institutions (DFls) for

findustry and agriculture.

Public sector loans amounted to $3,893 million during
: the year, an increase of 10 per cent over 1989. Loans from
: OCR rose 11 per cent to $2,419 million, or 62 per cent of
} public sector lending, while ADF loans grew 9 per cent to
$1,474 million, or 38 per cent.

The growth in lending partly reflected a rise in the
average project size to $78 million from $69 million in
1989. Also, program loans, which provide quick-disbursing
financial resources, increased threefold to $820 million from
$275 million in the previous year.

Altogether, 56 public sector loans were approved for
50 projects in 18 DMCs. This compared with 58 loans for
51 projects in 15 DMCs a year earlier.

Four DMCs received loans exclusively financed from
OCR: India ($699 million), Thailand ($84 million), People’s
Republic of China ($50 million) and Malaysia ($15 million).

Three DMCs received. loans from both OCR and ADF:
indonesia ($923 million, comprising $793 million’ from
OCR and $130 million from ADF), Philippines ($683 million, comprising $448 million from OCR and $235 million
from ADF) and Pakistan ($705 million, comprising
$330 million from OCR and $375 million from ADF).

Eleven DMCs received jioans exclusively from ADF:
Bangladesh ($351 million), Sri Lanka ($195 million), Nepal
($121 million), Lao PDR ($28 million), Papua New Guinea
($19 million), Bhutan ($7 million), Cook Islands ($5 million),
Solomon Islands ($5 million), Tonga ($2.4 million), Kiribati
($1 million) and Western Samoa ($500,000).

By the end of 1990, the Bank's cumulative lending to
the public sector reached $32.3 billion for 937 projects in
29 DMCs, of which $21.3 billion was from OCR and
$11 billion from ADF.

Sectoral Review
Lending to the agriculture and agro-industry sector

crossed the billion dollar raark in 1990, when 19 loans
totalling $1,242 million were approved, an increase of52 per cent from 1989. The sector's share of Bank iending
rose to 31 per cent, from 23 per cent a year earlier. On a
cumulative basis, agriculture and agro-industry remained the
most important sector of Bank operations, accounting for
29 per cent of lending and 46 per cent of grant-financed
iecnnical assistance.

Introducing appropriate farming methods, improving
the physical environment, expanding income and employment opportunities for the poor, reducing subsidies, enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation and promoting
sustainable development remained the cornerstones of Bank
strategy for lending to agriculiure and agro-industry. Poverty
alleviation was an explicit objective, and provisions were
made in a number of projects to reach disadvantaged groups
like smallholders, iandless peasants and women.

During the year, the Bank's first project exclusively
targeting women as beneficiaries was approved for
Bangladesh: the Rural Women Employment Creation
Project designed to creaie non-farm employment opportunities for women in rural areas. Components to promote
women in development were also incorporated in projects

The need for higher food production to reduce
budgetary and baiance-of-payments difficulties and satisfy
domestic dernand led the Bank to support food crop
development programs in Bangladesh and Indonesia. The
prograra in Bangladesh is designed to increase rice and
wheat production through dry-season cropping techniques
aided by irrigation and reduce dependence on monsoon
cropping. The aim of the Indonesian program is to achieve
food security while diversifying the food crop production
base and increasing the sectoral value-added through
agro-processing.

Rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation facilities,
including operation and maintenance, are the objectives of
an integrated irrigation sector project in Indonesia and an
irrigation systems improvement project in the Philippines.
A similar project in Malaysia wil! provide for flood mitigation,
construction of drainage facilities and watershed
management.

three loans to Bangladesh, People’s Republic of China (PRC)
and Pakistan. The Bangladesh project will help improve the
efficiency and long-term viability of the agricultural and rural
credit system. The Joan to the PRC wilt help the Government
import equipment, materials and services to modernize and
set up small and medium-sized agricultural enterprises. The
agricultural credit project in Pakistan will help increase rural
incomes, sustain high rates of agricultural growth, diversify
crops and promote export-oriented agricultural production.

Integrated area development projects were approved
for Malaysia, Pakistan and Philippines. These projects support the governments’ development goals in the rural sector,
which include poverty alleviation, a broadening of ‘the
agricultural base, creation of rural employment, better access to social services, and regional development that is
balanced, equitable and environmentally sound.

Prograrn lending is an important feature of the Bank's
operations in the agriculture and agro-industry sector. in
1990, five loans totalling $615 million were approved for
four programs in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and
Pakistan, comprising almost 50 per cent of the total lending
to the sector. Being quick-disbursing and policy-oriented in
nature, program loans have facilitated policy reforms, in

stitutional strengthening and investment in high-priority
programs, while alleviating foreign exchange problems.

The Foodcrops Development Prograrn in Bangladesh
is designed to liberalize and deregulate the supply of minor
irrigation equipment and complementary inputs, assign a
greater role for the private sector in fertilizer distribution,
give farmers effective price support and rationalize the
foodgrain management policy. The Food Crops Sector
Program in Indonesia is aimed at enlarging private sector
participation in food production, trade and processing, and
at policy reforms to phase out agricultural subsidies, rationalize rice buffer stock and marketing operations and further
deregulate trade and investments in food crops.

In Pakistan, the Agriculture Program is aimed at
mobilizing more domestic resources for agriculture, increasing production and sustaining productivity. The base for
direct taxation in agriculture will be expanded, subsidies on
major agricultural inputs like fertilizer and irrigation water
will be gradually phased out, consumer subsidies on wheat
will be reduced, and the efficiency of public sector development expenditure will be enhanced. The objective of the
Nepal Forestry Sector Program is to reforest degraded
forests, initiate systematic management of natural forests,pTaiesteS RY

restore major watersheds, introduce habitat protection and
maintenance of nature reserves, establish biogas plants to
save fuelwood, and involve srnali farmers in the cultivation
and processing of medicinal and aromatic plants. The
Government's direct role in the production of fuelwood,
fodder and timber will be gradually reduced, the private
sector will be encouraged to assume a major role in reforestation programs and forest-based industries will be
rationalized. :
Complementing the program loans were eight technical
assistance grants totalling $2.1 million, designed to
strengthen sector institutions and streamline policies.
Altogether, 65 technical assistance grants totalling
§28 million were approved in this sector, covering such
fields as forestry, fishery and livestock sector master plans,
agro-processing and rurai enterprises, tariff structure for
agriculture, domestic resource mobilization, and the
strengthening of project benefit monitoring and evaluation.
The Bank continued to support agricultural research through
collaboration with regional and international centers.
Operations in the energy sector emphasized generation
of energy, improvement of distribution and iransmission
systems, cost minimization in energy supply, environmental
protection and the promotion of private investments. There
were two projects in Indonesia and Lao PDR designed to
harness hydro resources, one project in India envisaging the
use of indigenous coai resources, and another in the
Philippines based on imported coal. Transmission and distribution projects were approved for- Nepal. Pakistan,
Sri Lanka and Thailand to improve efficiency in energy
supply. In addition, the Bank supported diesel power
projects in Sclornon Islands and Western Samoa pending
implementation of hydropower projects. The development
of the oil and gas sectors in the DMCs continued to receive
atiention. Technical assistance grants were given for a
teview of the hydrocarbon sector in India and for completing
a feasibility study on gas transmission and distribution in
Pakistan.
The concern for environmental protection was reflected

.. in ali approved energy projects, especially in the hydro

projects for Indonesia and Lao PDR and the coal-fired
thermal projects in India and Philippines. The projects
incorporate specific measures for monitoring and mitigating
adverse environmental effects. Energy demand management was the aim of the WAPDA Eleventh Power loan to
Pakistan. The Bank's policy to encourage private sector
participation in the energy sector was reflected in a loan to
Calcutta Electric Supply Co. Ltd. in India, which foliowed
the Bank's participation in a BOT (build-operate-transfer)
project in the Philippines. Innovative measures such as BOT
and BOO (build-operate-own) are being encouraged in
Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand.

Government-guaranteed loans to the energy sector rose
to $1,032 million from $595 million in 1989. The sector's
share of public sector lending increased to 26 per cent from
17 per cent a year earlier.

Twenty-two technical assistance grants totalling
$10 million were approved for this sector to support in
tegrated energy and power system planning with an emphasis on cost minimization, cost recovery, tariff rationalization, institutional strengthening and energy conservation.

A loan of $8.4 million for the Industrial Center
Development Project in Papua New Guinea was made in the
industry and non-fuel minerals sector. In addition, six
technical assistance grants totalling $2.5 million were approved to strengthen public sector institutions, support
technoiogy development in small and medium-scale industries and recommend appropriate government policies
to assist in industrial development, adjustment and restructuring.

Government-guaranteed loans to the finance setior,
separately identified in 1990, amounted to $256 million,
against $705 million in 1989, They constituted
6.6 per cent of public sector loans and included loans to
DFis

Lending under government guarantee to the transport

addition, the Philippines also received two program loans
amounting to $100 million for this subsector, while a portion of the $100 million earthquake damage reconstruction
loan made to it will go to rebuild road infrastructure damaged
by the 16 duly 1990 earthquake.

The Bank continued to stress the importance of systematic road maintenance and approved 11 technical assistance grants to help introduce betier pavement management
and maintenance systems. India received three advisory
grants, including one to promote private sector participation
in expressway financing, construction and operation. Four
advisory grants were approved for the Philippines, one of
which was for better vehicular emission control planning in
Metro Manila. One regiona! grant was approved for a
feasibility study of the southern Mekong River crossing on
the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.

for the health and population subsector.

In the water supply and sanitation subsector, the Bank
approved four loans, including a blended loan, amounting
to $85 million, These included $46 million to the
Philippines: $22 million (from OCR and ADF} to augment
Metropolitan Cebu’s water system and $24 million to
provide safe and easily accessible drinking water to rural
communities in 180 municipalities in 15 island provinces.
The fourth loan of $39 million was to provide piped water to
about 150 small towns in selected provinces in Indonesia. In
addition, eight technical assistance grants amounting to $4
million were approved for this subsector.

The education subsector accounted for five loans
amounting to $291 million. Three of the projects — the Six
Universities Development and Rehabilitation Project and the
Agricultural Technology Schools Project in Indonesia, and
the Technical and Vocational Education and Training
Project in Bhutan ~ were intended to help improve the
quality and efficiency. of instruction and increase the
availability of professional and technical manpower. The two
other projects - the Primary Education Sector Project and
the Rural Training Project, both in Bangladesh ~ reflected
the Bank’s priorities in the education subsector for the
nineties.

Technical assistance grants totalling $6.2 million were
approved for 16 projects in this subsector. Under these
grants, project preparatory studies are to be undertaken in
Lao PDR and Sri Lanka, a review of secondary education is
to be made in Bangladesh and Nepal, a study of technical
education and industrial training is to be undertaken in
Malaysia, a school development master plan and a technical
education program are to be prepared in Pakistan, institutions are to be strengthened in Bangladesh and Bhutan,
environmental education in the Philippines is to be assessed,
and the operation and maintenance of Indonesia’s primary
and secondary schools and teacher training institutions are
to be improved.

A regional technical assistance grant of $600,000 was
approved for the second phase of a fellowship program

designed to enable Pacific island and other smaller DMCs
meet critical shortages in professional and skilled manpower. The first phase, under a $300,000 grant, had helped
34 feliows from 11 DMCs. Now in its third year of operations, the Japan-ADB Scholarship Program awarded 69
new scholarships to nationals of 14 DMCs for postgraduate
studies in development-related fields for the academic year
1990-1991, while 52 scholars saw their scholarships
renewed for a second or third year. The Program has
benefited 178 individuals at a cost of $3.66 million since
inception.

Tourism received technical assistance totalling
$440,000 to prepare projects im Nepal and Tonga and a
tourism master plan for Cook Islands.

Technical Assistance Operations

Technical assistance plays an increasingly important
role in the Bank's operations. It helps DMCs identify, design,

‘implement and operate development projects, and

strengthens their ability to formulate strategies, policies,
programs and plans.

In its technical assistance operations during the year,
the Bank laid special emphasis on areas like policy adjustments and reforms, studies in priority issues and measures,
institution building, human resource development,
technology transfer through training and the Bank’s role as
a regional development resource center. Twenty-four of the

total, about $826 million was from OCR and $543 million
from ADF, representing 34 per cent and 37 per cent,
respectively, of the OCR and ADF loans approved.

The Bank finances its technical assistance activities
through grants or loans or a combination of both. Funding
ior technical assistance grants comes from voluntary contributions to the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)
irom both developed and developing member countries,
allocations to the TASF from Asiar: Development Fund
(ADF V), income from OCR operations and grants from
multilateral and bilateral sources (under co-financing and
exclusive financing arrangements) such as the Japan Special
Fund (JSF). the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP}, the United Siates Agency for International
Development (USAID), the Finnish International Deveiopment Agency (FINNIDA) and the governments of France,
Norway and Switzerland. Technica! assistance joans are

In 1990. the Government of Japan contributed the
equivaient of $69.2 million (net of adjustments) to the JSF.
A supplementary amount of ¥600 million was also received
as part of the Government's third-year contribution for use
to enhance the Bank's environmeni-related activities.

During 1990, toial technicai assistance operations

1990 (for sectoral breakdown, see Statistical Annex}, an
increase of 12 per cent from 1989. Group A (low-income)
DMCs received 63 per cent of the country-specific grants
(compared with 68 per cent in 1989), with Bangladesh as
the major recipient. Group B (middle-income) DMCs
received 34 per cent (25 per cent in 1989), Indonesia being
the major recipient. Group C (higher-income) DMCs accounted for the remaining 3 per cent (7 per cent in 1989).

Of the loan-financed technical assistance of
$207 million, 98 per cent was provided for advisory and

Private Sector Activities

Overview

In its policy dialogue with DMCs, the Bank encourages
an environment conducive to the development of the private
sector, Through program loans, development finance loans,
“umbrella” credit lines and technical assistance, which provide the scope for policy dialogue, it assists DMC governments in developing their capita! markets and improving
their investment climate. Technical assistance has also been
given to help governments in their privatization efforts. At
the same time, the Bank finances projects in the private
sector both directly through equity investments and loans
without government guarantee and indirectly through credit
lines to local financial institutions (LFls). Following a review
of the Bank’s private sector activities, the Board approved
an increase in the existing ceiling of $375 million for private
sector investments without government guarantee to $1 billion up to the end of 1992.

Capital Market Development

Two Financial Sector Program loans were made to
Lao PDR ($25 million equivalent) and Sri Lanka ($80 million equivalent) to help develop their capital markets. The
loans were combined with technical assistance grants totalling $853,000 and $1.2 million, respectively. The loan to
Lao PDR and the associated technical assistance are intended to assist the Government in establishing and developing a sound and responsive banking system. Supported by
improved private sector legistation, this program is expected
to contribute to a shift of productive assets from the public
to the private sector. It is designed to: (i) improve the overall
policy environment for the finance sector through the introduction of market-oriented interest rates and more effective
monetary management mechanisms; (ii) strengthen existing

 

PRIVATE sector activity is reflected in this polyester

institutions and establish new ones; (iii) ntroduce new financial instruments; {iv) develop professional banking
standards; (v} improve the legal basis for the activities of
commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions; and
{vi) support the developmen of the private sector through
more efficient financial services and by reactivating privatization efforts.

The objective of the loan and technical assistance to
Sri Lanka is to support policy reforms and _ institutional
strengthening in the finance sector. The capacity of the
finance sector to mobilize domestic resources and allocate
them efficiently to the private sector is to be improved.
Capital markets, both for equities and for securitized debt,
will be developed in order to provide a mechanism for
entrepreneurs to raise long-term finance directly from
investors as an alternative to loan finance. It is also an
objective of the program to improve the efficiency of’

yesource mobilization and credit allocation through
measures which reduce financial intermediation costs and
rationalize the structure of interest rates. In order to accelerate the shift of productive assets from the public to the
private sector. the program envisages the privatization of
state-owned enterprises and involves practical guidance for
the privatization of the National Development Bank of
Sri Lanka.

In addition to the technical assistance grants given in
combination with the two program loans, the Bank approved 15 technical assistance projects totalling $3 million
in the area of capital market development and five technical
assistance projects totalling $1.7 million related to the
privatization of government-owned corporations in
Indonesia, Lao PDR and Tonga.

The Bank also made ten investments totalling $33 million (equity investments, equity underwriting and loans
without government guarantee) directly in various private
capital market institutions. Although, in many cases, the
Bank's own investments have been relatively modest, its
catalytic role has facilitated the start-up or expansion. of a
number of institutions. Examples include venture capital
companies in India and Pakistan, as weil as a regional
venture capital company for the Asia-Pacific region. Its
support for leasing operations, amounting to $22 million,
included $16 million for a previously ailing company in
Indonesia that now operates under a new management. In
all these cases, the Bank played’an active role in structuring
the companies. +

The Board approved the Pakistan Fund with the Bank
as a joint lead manager. Under this arrangement. the Bank
will make available 2 $5.4 million underwriting commitment
for the public issue of its shares. The Fund is designed to
channel risk capital from capital exporting countries to the
local equity market, thereby making Pakistan better known
among international investors. When launched, the Fund will
facilitate the transfer of fund management know-how
through the establishment of @ local fund management
company.

In three other minor investments, the Bank supported
the establishment or upgrading of development and merchant banks in Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka, in the
last case in combination with a technical assistance grani.

A 35 million regiona! investment was approved during
the year, bringing the cumulative total of regional investment
facilities (equity investmenis and underwriting) in the finance
sector to $77 million equivalent. These facilities represented
nearly 18 per cent of the total approved direct private sector
investments. Disbursements during the year amounted to
$12 million and the year-end regional portfolio stood at
$52 million in five investments.

Indirect Project Financing and Support of DFIs

The Bank has traditionally financed small and mediumscale enterprises in the private sector through credit lines to
development finance institutions (DFls), either guaranieed
by, or channeled through, DMC governments. Such lending

in 1990 amounted to $151 million in three credit lines. The
largest of the three was a $120 million line to the Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (}CICI) ~ the
second to [CIC] and fourth to DFls in india. The second credit
line of $30 million, available through five private commercial banks, was meant for small-scale and cottage industries
in Bangladesh. Two technical assistance grants totalling
$560,000 were approved to help strengthen institutions.
The third credit line of $1 million, combined with a
$234,000 technical assistance grant, will augment the
foreign currency resources of the Development Bank of
Kiribati for onlending to private enterprises in agriculture
and fisheries, trade and industry, and transport and services.

Apart from technical assistance associated with the DFI
loans, the Bank approved grants totalling $1.5 million to
strengthen DFls in Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands,’
Federated States of Micronesia, Sri Lanka, Vanuatu and
Western Samoa

Direct Project Financing

The Bank’s direct project financing in the private sector
is made through equity investments and ioans without
government guarantee in various combinations. Under its
Complementary Financing Scheme (CFS), the Bank also
arranges co-financing from other sources.

Out of the Bank's project financing of $116 million,
investments in financia! institutions and jeasing companies
amounted to about $33 million (28 per cent). The manufacturing sector accounted for about $17 million (15 per cent)
and infrastructure about $58 million (50 per cent}. The
remaining $8 million represented lines of equity.

The largest infrastructural investment was $40 million
($10 million in equity and $30 million in loan) in the
Bangkok Expressway Co. Ltd. Under a 30-year concession
agreement, the company wili build, finance and operate a
37-km rnulti-lane toll expressway in the Bangkok area as an
extension of the existing one. At the end of the concession
period, the project will be transferred to the Government.
One of developing Asia's most ambitious infrastructure
ventures undertaken by the private sector, with a total
project cost of over $1 billion, it is Thailand's first BOT
project and is aimed at reducing the severe traffic congestion
in the Thai capital, particularly in the central business district.

The Bank also approved an $18 million loan towards
a $92 million project of the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation to augment its transmission network. The aim of
the project is to alleviate the power shortage in and around
Calcutta. The ‘Goverment of India has accorded high
priority to the power sector and a new policy encourages
greater private participation in it.

In the manufacturing sector, the largest financing approved was for Avantex Mill Corporation in the Philippines:
an $8 million Bank loan and a $5 million complementary
loan. The company will set up a spinning mill to produce
high-quality yarn to meet the demand from export-oriented
textile and garment manufacturers. An investment package
of $6.4 million equivalent ($1.4 million in equity andADB PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS BY INDUSTRIAL SECTOR?

match the Bank’s equity investments, in effect doubling the
institutional equity capital available locally. Such agreements

were approved for LFis in Philippines, Sri Lanka and
Thailand for an aggregate amount of $8 million.

Bankwide Priorities

Poverty Alleviation

The Bank's increased concern with poverty alleviation
issues stems from the findings and recommendations of the
internal Task Force on the Bank’s Role in Poverty Alleviation
and the external panel. A comprehensive action plan has
been developed to ensure that the new policy components
are fully integrated with Bank operations. Poverty issues are
now considered systematically during country strategy and
operational programming exercises, and an increasing number of projects and programs are being aimed at meeting
specific poverty alleviation goals.

There are two elements in the present policy. In the first
place, special attention is paid to poverty alleviation issuespe it enka ener ce tin OM RIA

when forrnulating and implementing conventional projects.
Secondly, the need ior direct initiatives to reduce poverty is
recognized. The Bank is increasingly concerned with
developing projects to increase income and ernpioyment
opportunities for the poor and improve their access to basic
social services, such as education and health care. It supports
policy adjustments to involve the poor in the growth process.

Eighteen loans with components of poverty alleviation
were approved during the year. The agriculture and rural
development sectors accounted for 13 of them and the rest
related to social and physical infrastructure.

Three integrated area development projects - the
Second Palawan Integrated Area Development Project in
ithe Philippines, the Northern Terengganu Rural Develop
nent Project (Phase I} in Malaysia and the Barani Area

Development Project (Phase I!) in Pakisian - were designed
to meet the needs of disadvantaged rural cornmunities
besides increasing agricultural production and productivity.
Two program loans ~ the Forestry Sector Program in Nepal
and the Foodcrops Development Program in Bangladesh —
incorporated policy adjustments promoting sustainable rural

- .development. Two projects - the Third Small Farmers

Development Project in Nepal and the Rural Women
Employment Creation Project in Bangladesh ~ were specifi
cally designed to increase income and employment oppor
tunities for target beneficiaries while helping them to form
and strengthen self-help groups.

Thirty per cent of the loan to the Agricultural Bank of
China was allocatedsto support township and village
enterprises benefiting disadvantaged rural communities. The
majority of the Bank's agriculture and rural development
loans approved during the year were multipurpose in nature.
In varying degrees, they met more than one of the Bank's
special policy concerns, like poverty alleviation, environmental improvement, promotion of the role of women in
development, collaboration with NGOs and encouragement
of the private sector.

In the infrastructure sector, poverty alleviation objectives were reflected in the Second Island Provinces Rural
Water Supply Sector Project in the Philippines, the Second
IKK Water Supply Sector Project in Indonesia, a Special
Interventions Project in Papua New Guinea and three
projects in Bangladesh covering secondary towns urban
infrastructure, rural training and primary education.

The Bank also expanded its technical assistance operations to prepare, monitor and evaluate poverty alleviation
projects. Help was provided, for example, for preparing
projects to assist smallholders in Indonesia and Philippines
and to provide housing for low-income groups in Sri Lanka.

At the same time, the Bank further developed its °

economic and sector work as well as its resource center
activities to focus better on poverty alleviation issues. Technical assistance was provided for a seminar on Poverty
Alleviation through Agricultural Projects, which took place
in Bangladesh in October and was co-sponsored by the
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank. Approval was also given for a seminar on the Design and
Management of Sustainable Poverty Alleviation Projects in

South Asia and a regional seminar on the. Urban Poor and
Basic Infrastructure Services in Asia and the Pacific. The
ongoing technica! assistance study on Priority Issues and
Policy Measures to Alleviate Rural Poverty is expected to
make a major contribution in defining the scope of policy
adjustments to benefit the rural poor.

The Bank's experience indicates that special provisions
rnust often be made in designing and implementing poverty
alleviation projects to ensure that they are fully effective. It
is essential to identify target groups clearly, develop appropriate delivery mechanisms, encourage self-help, involve
beneficiaries in project development and implementation,
decentralize decision making wherever possible and undertake socioeconomic surveys as the basis for specifying,
monitoring and guiding project activities. The number of
proiecis and project components that meet the above requirements, either wholly or in part, is increasing.

An example of a successful poverty alleviation project
is provided by the NGO-Microcredit Project in the Philippines, approved in 1988. The disbursement of this loan is
running well ahead of schedule and the project is making a
significant impact in creating employment and increasing
incomes among the target groups (for details of the project,
see ‘Cooperation with NGOs’}. Follow-up surveys confirm
that, with few exceptions, the subloans have gone to support
microenterprises creating new job .and income opportunities. .

The Bank has upgraded the activities of its interdepartmental Poverty Alleviation Working Group. This
group has been given the responsibility of ensuring that
poverty alleviation issues are appropriately and systematically addressed during the Bank’s country programming
and loan processing activities.

Social Infrastructure

Economic gains attained in many of the DMCs have not
always made the basic human services available to the
majority of the population. The external panel’s report
highlighted the need for greater support for social infrastructure to both enhance the quality of life and promote
economic growth over the longer term. The Bank emphasizes the role of the social sectors in sustainable economic
development and takes account of environmental concerns
in designing social infrastructure projects.

Education: The Bank's new policy on education,
which is explained in the special theme chapter on ‘Education and Development.’ regards, in particular, the. provision
of primary and non-formal education as an important part
of its strategy to alleviate poverty and enhance the status of
women in society.

This policy is refiected in two basic education projects
in Bangladesh approved during the year. The, Primary
Education Sector Project supports the Government's universai primary education program and will seek, among-other
things, to provide better school facilities for girls, employ
more female teachers and take specific measures toURBAN development is a continuing goal. These new
houses were provided for low-income city dwellers in
Thailand under the Bank-financed Shelter Sector loan of
$38 million.

encourage parents to enrol and keep their daughters in
school. The Rural Training Project is designed to train the
landless rural poor in livelihood skills and make microcredit
available to them. Forty per cent of the project's target
beneficiaries are expected to be women.

Three other projects - the Six Universities Development and Rehabilitation Project and the Agricultural Technology Schools Project, both in Indonesia, and the Technical
and Vocational Education and Training Project in Bhutan were approved during the year to support human resource
development.

In addition, 21 regional technical assistance grants
totalling $6.27 million were approved for training programs
on the design and management of sustainable poverty
alleviation projects, environmental management audit, equi
ty investment analysis, project implementation management, procurement and community forestry, as well as for
co-sponsoring the World Conference on Education for All.
Grants totalling $4.5 million were given for institutional
strengthening in Bangladesh, Bhutan, indonesia, Pakistan,
Philippines and Thailand. Besides, many loan and technical
assistance projects in the agriculture, energy, water supply,
telecommunications and industry and non-fuel minerals sectors had education and training componenis.

Health and Population: The Bank's objectives with
regard to the health and population subsectors are to enable
DMCs to provide basic and adequate health services to all
their citizens and help them keep population growth and
fertility rates at levels most appropriate to their specific
conditions.

Health services in DMCs have suffered from a lack of
essential planning and a shortage of staff trained in management and administration. Recognizing these deficiencies and
pursuant to the recommendations of the external panel’s
report, a Health and Population Sector Paper is being
finalized. Taking into account the policy, institutional and
funding problems of the past, a new sector strategy has been
prepared.

Future Bank operations will increasingly emphasize
primary health care through preventive and promotive
programs, the technical as well as financial viability of health
referral networks and the need for adequate institutional
management support and planning. Technical assistance
grants approved during the year for Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea and Sri Lanka reflect various aspects of this policy.
The Bank feels that public authorities must increasingly focus
their attention on the preventive health care needs of the
poor, offen neglected under the curative and urban-biased
public health programs that have prevailed so far. A more
cost-effective, equitable and efficient allocation of health
resources for preventive programs is needed, while curative
programs could take greater advantage of cost recovery and
the services of private health providers. Public and private
services should coordinate to achieve a smooth functioning
of health referral networks. Such networks should be composed of progressively sophisticated service levels ranging
from preventive, community-based facilities to more advanced facilities with extensive in-patient capacity.

Urban Development: The Bank feels that, in discussing urban development issues, questions of poverty alleviation, environmental improvement, rural-urban linkages,
balanced industrial growth and inter-regional disparities
must not be overlooked. The objectives of growth and equity
are not necessarily at cross purposes in urban development
and can be reconciled through appropriately prepared
projects. This policy is reflected in the Secondary Towns
Infrastructure Development Project in Bangladesh.

Urban development, when appropriately packaged,
provides opportunities to determine investment priorities
with regard to shelter, roads, drainage, water supply, sanitation and other essential. urban services. The Bank will,carson nt se

therefore, favor assisting urban development on an integrated basis, where appropriate, although support for
individual subsectors, such as housing or water supply, will
continue. A new effort will be made for institution building
in respect of urban transportation, housing finance and
urban land management. Increased private sector participation in urban infrastructure and services will be advocated,
particularly in rail transit systems, urban expressways, solid
waste management and markets. Urban development
projects will also provide an opportunity to pay more attention to urban environmental improvement, which will be one
of the priority areas for lending. Since policies for urban
deveiopment in most DMCs are usually not well formulated,
the Bank will continue to help DMCs in this regard through
sector studies and policy discussions.

Water Supply and Sanitation: Bank's overall objective in regard to this subsector can be summarized as follows:
“improvement of human health and productivity and betterment of the living environment, through the provision of
sustainable and effectively used water and sanitation systems
to as many people as possible.” This overall objective is
teflected in the Second IKK Water Supply Sector Project in
Indonesia and Metropolitan Cebu Water Supply and Second
Island Provinces Rural Water Supply Sector Projects in the
Philippines. To attain this obiective, three actions are considered to be of crucial importance: (i) extra funds should be
mobilized from governments, donors and people benefiting
from new and improved services; (ii) the management of
water and sanitation services in rural and peri-urban areas
should be community-based; and (iii) resources and the en
 

ENVIRONMENTAL concerns are reflected

vironment should be properly managed in the face of rapid
urbanization

The Bank feels that the community should participate
in all phases of the development of water supply systems
from original planning through operation and maintenance.
Sector strategies must seek fo manage and mitigate the
impact of rapid urbanization. In promoting maximurn
efficiency in water use and water quality management, past
imbalances will have to be corrected between water supplies
ior domestic and industrial consumption on the one hand
and facilities for wastewater treatment and disposal on the
other. Protection and management of water resources will
need to be given high priority, with measures to reduce and
recycle waste.

Future Bank activities in this subsector will be in the
following areas: (i) preparation of comprehensive country
sector strategies; (ii) assistance for projects in rural and
peri-urban areas in addition to the urban sector; (iii) institutional development; {iv) pollution contro! and management
of water resources; and (v) regional activities to cover such
issues as megacities; rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of facilities; community involvement and sustainability.

Environmental and
Natural Resource Management

To ensure that economic development is environmentally sustainable and does not exploit natural wealth at the
expense of future needs, assistance to DMCs in

in this pine nursery in Indonesia being tended under the Forestry

Development Project which was assisted by a Bank loan of $28 million.

environmental and natural resource management has become a major concern for the Bank. Its environmental
policies and procedures were reviewed and expanded during
the year and an environmental action program tor the 1990s
was prepared.

In keeping with its expanded involvement in environmental activities, the Bank upgraded its Environment
Division in September to Office of the Environment.
Measures were taken to formalize and strengthen
environmental review procedures, integrate environmental
considerations in the programming exercise, broaden the
environmental dimensions of projects, increase support for
environrnent-oriented projects and expand environmental
training.

The environmental review of projects placed additional
ernphasis on biodiversity, environmental risk and population
considerations. To provide ample opportunity for environmental impact assessment, projects were required to be
reviewed two years ahead of the normal project processing
schedule. A system design study was completed for the
computerization of the Environment Monitoring Information Systern.

To assist country programming missions in developing
a pipeline of environmental projects, environment sector
reports were prepared for selected DMCs. A pragram cycle
was introduced so that environmental considerations could
be systematically integrated in country programming exercises.

Several technical assistance projects were approved
and administered during the year in Bangladesh, the PRC,
Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand and several Pacific
island DMCs. Many of these projects focused on human
resource development, particularly on environmental impact
assessment, and were aimed at strengthening the environmental management capabilities of DMC government officials.

In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on
Bank Operations in the South Pacific, a technical assistance
grant was approved to provide short in-country training in
environment subsectors, develop national environmental
management strategies and strengthen the capabilities of the
South Pacific Regional Environment Programme.

One important technical assistance was for a regional
project entitled, “Economic Policies for Sustainable Development: Implementing the Brundtland Commission’s Recommendations." Findings of this regional study covering
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan,
Philippines and Sri Lanka were presented at a MinisterialLevel Conference on Environment and Development in Asia
and the Pacific, held in Bangkok, which the Bank co-sponsored.

Several technical assistance projects were developed to
study global climatic changes. Associated technical assistance projects were designed to determine and mitigate
environmental impacts of different projects, particularly in
the energy, industry, minerals and roads sectors/subsectors.

The Bank strengthened its ties with bilateral and multilateral organizations dealing with environmental issues and

 

 

participated in several regional and international fora. The
Government of Japan provided a supplementary amount of
¥600 million as part of its third-year contribution to the
Japan Special Fund to support the Bank's environment
related technical assistance activities. Cooperation with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the field of
environment was sought in several Bank-financed projects.
A technical assistance project was developed to foster
more responsible natural resource management and conservation in selected rural communities with the assistance of
influential village-level volunteers.

The new environmental priorities and action program
initiated in 1990 will be vigorously promoted in 1991. The
traditional environmental impact assessment tools Will be
expanded and strengthened to include social impact
analysis, environmental risk assessment and biodiversity
impact evaluation. The use of other techniques, such as
geographic information systems and related remote sensing,
will be further developed to improve project design and
monitoring.

New areas such as pollution control in the industry and
power sectors, urban environmental development, tropical
forest ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation
will be the focus of environmental lending. Poverty alleviation projects having environmental implications will be
emphasized.

Technical assisiance will be aimed at building institutions involved in formulating and implementing environmental policies and programis and preparing potential
investment projects. In addition, sectoral economic policies
which protect and enhance the environment will be further
developed.

To implement the proposed action program, environment sector work and policy dialogue will be enhanced. The
Bank's environment specialists will continue to play a
catalytic role in project conceptualization. The action program will also require continued in-house and external
training for Bank staff.

 

Women in Development

One of the major objectives of the Bank’s policy on the
role of women in development (WID) is to fund projects
which enhance their status in society and quality of life by
providing education, employment and income opportunities.

During 1990, a number of projects incorporated concrete activities to achieve this objective. The Rural Women
Employment Creation Project in Bangladesh was the Bank’s
first project aimed at providing microcredit exchisively for
women. The project will involve collaboration with local
NGOs to mobilize women in rural areas and facilitate their
access to credit. Similarly, under the Third Small Farmers
Development Project in Nepal, funds are earmarked to
support viable agriculture and cottage industry subprojects
taken up by rural women.

Expanding women’s access to education and training is
another element of the Bank’s policy. Training women asegret 2eormnneet eee cereeeareertmeniaeneent: yew

WOMEN traders at the Jakarta Stock Exchange represent increased access in the financial sector by women. The

extension agents io work among women farmers is the
specific focus of the Second Baran: Area Development
Project ir. Pakistan. The Integrated Irrigation Sector Project
in Indonesia emphasizes the importance of training women
in the design and implementation of improved drainage
systems. In the Philippines, the Second Palawan Integrate
Area Development Project is designed to provide a training
center for women to take up remunerative activities. Women
are the specific target group under the Rura! Training Project
in Bangiadesh, which is to provide training in, and
microcredit for, livelihood activities.

The Agricultura} Technology School Project in
Indonesia will seek to enrol more women for vocational
training. A regional technica! assistance on Training to
Improve Employment and Management Skills of Women
provided more than 60.short training courses conducted by
grass roots NGOs in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and
Philippines.

A first step was taken to incorporate WID issues in
macro-level policy formulation and project planning when a
regional conference was held in December to discuss gender
issues in agriculture. Senior policymakers from 12 DMCs
attended. The conference recommended, among other
things. that the Bank help train trainers and institutionalize
gender issues in agricultural university curricula. The Bank
was also asked to identify and document the approaches and
methods different DMCs employ to reach women farmers.

Sector Program for Indonesia, assisted by Bank loans totalling $200 million, is aimed at developing the

At a national level, the Bank supported a series of seminars
in Malaysia to promote the awareness of women’s role in
rural development. Policy planners and extension workers
were trained in using gender anaiysis in project design and
impiernentation.

Work has begun under 2 regional technical assistance
grant to collect data to monitor changes in the welfare of
women and their participation in economic development.
Socioeconomic indicators on this subject will be published
as a supplement to the Key Indicators of Developing Asian
and Pacific Countries. An action program was approved
in the third quarter of 1990 and a Bankwide network system
was established to monitor and facilitate its implementation.

Cooperation with NGOs

The objective of the Bank’s cooperation with NGOs is
to enhance the participatory approach to development and
to improve the delivery of its assistance and services to target
groups, especially the poor and the disadvantaged in society.
Being involved at the grass roots level and being familiar with
the specific needs of the poor, NGOs could lend their special
expertise and experience to enhance the effectiveness of the
Bank's operations. In particular. the Bank has utilized environmental NGOs in view of their critical role in fostering
environmental! sustainability. Based or a positive response
received during the NGO Consultative Meeting in

 

53June 1989, dialogues with local, regional and international
NGOs are held regularly.

One qood example of the Bank's cooperation with
NGOs comes from the Philippines, where an NGOMicrocredit Project was approved in 1988, reflecting a new
approach on how to involve beneficiaries. The results of the
project have been encouraging, with 205 NGOs participating in it and some 13,000 individuals and self-help groups
having received financial and other forms of assistance. In
October 1990, the Bank sponsored a two-day seminar to
review the results of the project, which supported and
strengthened the Government's “Tulong sa Tao" (Help for
the People) Program. A technical assistance grant of
$98,000 was approved in August to examine the feasibility
of a second similar project.

The loan to Bangladesh for the Rural Women Employment Creation Project will support the Government's poverty alleviation program by creating sustainable non-farm
employment opportunities. Under the project, the Governrent will relend funds to the Bangladesh Krishi Bank, which
in turn will onlend to eligible borrowers and NGOs experienced in operating credit prograrns. NGOs will train
beneficiaries in the use of credit and in the skills necessary
to establish viable non-farm enterprises. A few experienced
NGOs will act as credit intermediaries.

Private Sector Support

During the past two decades, many Asian developing
economies have moved towards a greater role for the private
sector, moré market-based economic policies and less
government intervention in the economy. The movement
has generally been coupled with export-oriented industrialization, away from inward-looking or importsubstitution policies.

The move in favor of a greater private sector role
followed from changes that occurred in the international
economic environment during the 1970s and 1980s.
Economies with a relatively better developed private sector
were better placed to respond quickly to such changes.

A number of DMCs perceived that a greater reliance
on market forces, international competition and the freer
play of the price mechanism resulted in a more dynamic
economy and thereby contributed to a more efficient allocation of resources in line with comparative advantages. They
felt that inward-looking industrial development bred comparatively inefficient and internationally uncompetitive industries, and that excessive state intervention in industry had
an adverse impact on industrial development and economic
growth. Many DMCs have also increasingly focused on the
efficiency of capital markets as an instrument of financial
resource allocation and encouragement to private sector
investment. This has led to moves for a more rational interest
rate structure, a shift from guided credit allocation to market
determination, and the creation or enhancement of
securities markets. These changes have often required legislation and strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory
agencies involved,

‘

At the same time, because of budget constraints, certain
DMCs have opened io the private sector such areas as
power, urban transportation and large-scale manufacturing
of products like fertilizers and cement, traditionally reserved
for the public sector. In this policy transformation, some
governments have encouraged BOT or BOO types of infrastructure projects. A few DMC governments have perceived that professional, private management can result in
a more efficient operation and have initiated programs for
privatization. Privatization is often a complex procedure,
involving numerous policy and operational issues and financial options.

The basic objectives of the Bank's current private sector
program are to foster the development of an economic and
policy environment which will encourage private sector
growth throughout the region, thus speeding up economic
development. Complementing its traditional indirect financial assistance through DFI credit lines, the Bank now also
takes a more direct interest in the promotion and development of private enterprises through its equity and unguaranteed loan windows.

The Bank also acts as a catalyst for additional financing,
technology, management skills and market access through
the comfort it offers co-investors and co-lenders. The
catalytic role can take many forms. The Bank can bea source
of confidence, rather than funds; a link between domestic
and external entrepreneurs and financial intermediaries; or
a promoter of indigenous capital market institutions. In
addition, both the Bank's direct involvement in project
financing and its indirect lending to smaller enterprises give
it useful insights into the impediments and constraints under
which private enterprises operate in various countries. Such
insights provide valuable inputs for policy dialogue.

The Bank is ready to support governments with technical assistance and, if required, financing for privatization
exercises.

Co-Financing and Guarantee Operations

A total of 29 Bank-assisted loan projects and programs
were co-financed in 1990. In terms of financial volume,
contributions of co-financiers surpassed the billion dollar
mark for the second consecutive year to reach $1,257 million, almost the same level as in 1989.

The Bank's own lending to the co-financed projects
amounted to $2,024 million, an increase of 23 per cent
over the previous year. Of this, $1,537 million was approved in 1990. The rest represented projects approved in
earlier years for which co-financing was arranged in 1990.
This meant that about 39 per cent of 1990 loans involved
co-financing.

Official sources of co-financing contributed $957 million for 24 projects, down 4 per cent from 1989, and their
share of total co-financing stood at 76 per cent. Of this,
about $422 million was sourced from multilateral agencies
and $535 million from bilateral agencies. Co-financing from
commercial sources (commercial banks and insurance

thie pape

 

 

 

‘ariescompanies, as wel! as export credit sources) increased by
8 per cent tc $300 million for eight projects, or 24 per cent
of the total compared with 22 per cent a year earlier. Of the
commercial sources, co-financing with commercial banks
and insurance companies arnounted to $145 million for five
projects. an increase of 30 per cent over 1989. As of the
end of 1990, 314 Bank projects had involved co-financing
since Bank operations began in 1967, with co-financiers
providing a cumuiative total of about $9.6 billion and the
Bank $13.5 billion.

Co-financing from official sources accounted for more
than threequarters of the total co-financing, reflecting their
importance in official development assistance. The slight
decrease in their total contribution ir. 1990 was mainly due
to a decrease in bilateral co-financing. Muliilateral sources
increased their contribution from $344 million a year ago
to $422 million.

Commercial banks, concerned with the need to comply
with capital adequacy guidelines set by the Bank for Iniernational Setilements, continued to reduce sovereign risk
exposure, and pricing increased significantly over the last
nine to 12 months. While this has had a darnpening effect
on co-financing activities in the public sector, the Bank did
achieve an increase in the amount of cormmercial co-financing over the previous year. This was possible due mainly to
the growing acceptance by both borrowers and participating
co-tinanciers of the benefits of the Bank's Complementary
Financing Scheme (CFS) and guaranteé operations.

The Bank increased the use of its guarantee facility in
1990 by arranging commercial co-financing for projects in

‘Indonesia 
two of its DMCs under CFS. The first was for the Ramu Grid
Reinforcement Project in Papua New Guinea where Banque Indosuez participated in a 12-year complementary loan
of $10 million, with the Bank guaranteeing the principal due
in years eight through 12 plus the base interest cost on the
guaranteed maturities.

The second application of the guarantee involved the
largest co-financing arranged to date by the Bank and was
used to finance two power projects in India. This loan, with
a final maturity of 21 years arranged under CFS, was in two

ranches comprising a dollar tranche of $60 million with a
15-year final maiurity, including a five-year grace period,
and a yen tranche of ¥7.5 billion with a 21-year finat
maturity, including a 15-year grace period. The Bank
guarantee covered the principa! amount due in years 16
through 21. This was India’s first commercial co-financing
with the Bank.

Bank’s Role in Resource Transfers

The net transter of resources (loan disbursements minus
principa! payments and prepayments, payments of interest
and other charges plus equity investments) to DMCs
remained positive in 1990 and amounted to $1,471 million,
2 67 per cent increase from 1989. Of the total, $963 million was from ADF and $508 million was from OCR: The
fiow of OCR resources showed a positive net transfer for the
second consecutive year.

The increase in the Bank's net resource transfers wasLending and Operational Policies

DURING 1990, the Bank continued te: evolve Hs
lending and operational policies with a view to respond
better to the changing circumstances and needs of its
DMCs. The Board of Directors reviewed policies on
program lending, country strategies and private sector
operations.

The Bank's program lending policy was substantially revised in late 1987 to support mediurn-term sector
or subsector development programs covering a varying
mix of policy adjustments, institutional reforms and investment priorities, At that time, the Board required that
the revised policy be reviewed in two years’ time.

The review found that the special features of program lending have enabled the Bank’s operations to
acquire a wider scope than would have been possible
through project lending alone, and thereby to better
support economic development in DMCs, Through program lending, the Bank has begun to contribute to the
process of policy adjustment, which has been among the
principal factors behind the higher growth rates of many
Asian economies. The review concluded that the existing
policy had served the Bank and its DMCs well and no
revisions were called for.

The review noted that the most effective contribution the Bank could make to the process of policy reform
in its DMCs was to clarify sector issues through policy
studies. it suggested Greater recourse to sector analyses
in order to better underpin policy and institutional restructuring objectives. The importance of the role played by
governments in the preparation of reform programs was
recognized. The need for flexibility in determining the
coverage of positive procurement lists, to avoid delays in
the drawdown of loan proceeds, was stressed. The review

" due to higher loan disbursements and equity investments and

a marked decrease in amortization payments and prepayments. Total loan disbursements and equity investments
increased by 22 per cent to $2,774 million. Among the
factors responsible for this increase were (i) the DMCs’
continuing efforts to speed up project implementation and
carry out policy reforms; (ii) the role of the Bank’s
regional/resident offices in improving project administration
and implementation; (iii) greater use of imprest accounts, the
statement of expenditure mechanism and retroactive
financing to facilitate the flow of funds; and iv) a 49 per cent
increase in the disbursement of program loans from
$453 million in 1989 to $671 million.

The decline in amortization payments resulted mostly
from lower principal repayments for OCR loans due to
prepayments made by several DMCs (e.g., Republic of
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand) in previous years, and from
a more than 50 per cent fall in the volume of prepayments
from $368 million in 1989 to $155 million.

also suggested that the allocation of counternart funds
should be generally determined by the circumstances of
each case. The cap set on programm lending to limit it to
15 pet cent of total lending calculated as a three-year
moving average was retained.

Another lending modality was introduced for the first
time during the year, when the Bank approved a
$10.5 million Special Interventions Project loan for
Papua New Guinea. Part of a multidonor effort, the loan
is intended to help mitigate some of the possible social
costs of the Government's structural adjustment program
for the country’s economy. Projects to be implemented
with the loan, under the Government's Public Investment
Program, will have a strong poverty alleviation focus and
funds will be disbursed quickly to contain unemployment
or income reduction.

’ The Board reviewed the Bank’s private sector
operations, emphasizing the need for a flexible response
to the requiremenis of private enterprises depending on
the economic environment, government policies and
availability of project finance resources in each DMC,
The review concluded that, as an agent of change, the
Bank should focus on operations that have qualities of
demonstrability, catalytic function and policy dialogue.
Over time, increasing private sector operations could
require administrative and procedural changes. In order
fo examine the whole gamut of private sector lending,
including DFI lending, and to identify the ramifications of
such changes, the appointment of an internal task force
was approved. The Board also approved an increase in
the existing ceiling of $375 million for private sector
investments without government guarantee to $1 billion
up to the end of 1992.

The magnitude of transfers varied from country to
country. Five DMCs — Indonesia ($456 million), Pakistan
($310 million), Bangladesh ($279 million), India ($183 million) and Philippines ($163 million) — were the major
recipients of net positive resource transfers in 1990,
accounting for about 95 per cent of the total. However,
compared with the previous year, resource flows to
Bangladesh, the PRC, Nepal and Pakistan, though still
positive, fell due to either lower disbursements or higher
amortization, or a combination of both.

The PRC, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Philippines
received positive net transfers of OCR resources, while Fiji,
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taipei,China and
Thailand recorded negative flows. Thailand recorded the
largest single negative net transfer of $176 million, mainly
due to prepayments. Three newly industrializing economies
- Republic of Korea, Singapore and Taipei,China — have
been in the net repayment phase for several years.

The net transfer of ADF resources to low andSia SIEVE sini rc eee ai i a eet Nea bene OR aN ee

 

 

middle-income DMCs was positive except for a few cases.
Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka
were the biggest recipients of positive ADF transfers, in that
order. The Bank had inactive lending operations in
Afghanistan (since 1980) and Viet Nam (since 1975), which
explains the negative transfer to the former and no flows to
tne latter. Myanmar, a non-active borrower. experienced a
sharp decline.

Country Strategies

Country strategy studies are intended to provide broad
directions and the underlying basis for Bank operations in
the medium term. These studies reflect the Bank's thinking
on how best to contribuie to the development of the DMCs
and are based on the DMCs’ development plans and
priorities, growth constrainis, macro and sectoral policy
environments and the pasi experience of the Bank and other
donors with whom it coordinates. They also take into
account broad Bank concerns such as environmenial protection, poverty alleviation and the role of women in development.

In 1990, a new country strategy study was compieted
for India while revised studies for Indonesia and Pakistan
were circulated to the Board. Studies for Bhutan, the PRC,
Cook Isiands. Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga and
Vanuatu were in preparation. Work began on a revision of
the study for Malaysia. Ie will be completed in 1991 together
with studies for Lao PDR and the remaining Pacific island
DMCs. ‘

Policy Dialogue

Policy dialogue continued to be an important element
of the Bank’s country studies and operations, since an
appropriate framework of incentives and a generally conducive economic policy environment are necessary for efficient economic growth. Policy discussion takes place in the
context of financing particular projects and economic sectors using the sector and program loan modalities. Technical
assistance is often used as an instrument of such discussion.

During 1990, policy issues were discussed both in the
context of processing and implementing projects, particularly in the finance, agriculture, physical and social infrastructure and energy sectors, and in the broader context of
country programming activities. Attention was focused on
improving efficiency in resource mobilization, allocation and
use.

Program loans remained the Bank's major vehicle for
policy dialogue. Such loans are used to prepare mediumterm programs to improve sector performance through
policy adjustments, institution building and sound investments. Such loans address policy constraints and opportunities that are underlying and seciorwide in nature, and
provide a useful forum for policy interaction between the
Bank and its DMCs.

in 1990, the Bank approved seven program loans °

totaliing $820 miliion to improve policies in the agriculture,
finance and transport sectors in the recipient DMCs. In the
agriculture sector, the focus of the Food Crops Sector
Program loar to Indonesia was on a phase-out of input
subsidies, improved management of irrigation schemes, the
abolition of concessional credit, further deregulation of the
trade in food crops and improved land use planning and
utilization. Program loans to Nepal for the forestry sector
and to Pakistan and Bangladesh for agriculture were
designed to improve the policy environment, streamline
institutions, reduce subsidies, broaden the tax base, deregulate food trade and sirengthen support services. Improving
the efficiency of irrigation systems as well as of the power
and road transport sectors was the focus of dialogue in the
Philippines. .

The overall policy environment for the finance sector
in Lao PDR was improved through the introduction of more
effective monetary management mechanisms, banking
standards, financial instruments and the Government’s
privatization program. Rationalization of the interest rate
structure in support of privatization and the deveiopment of
the capital market were the key features of a financial sector
program joan to Sri Lanka. In the PIDMCs, policy dialogue
has generally been conducted within the framework of
processing projects, but the emphasis has increasingly
shifted to include broader economic and planning issues.

Sector ioans are an important adjunct of program and
project loans in the Bank's policy dialogue with DMCs.
Although sector loans are simiiar to project loans in that they
finance specific capital investments, they are also intended
to improve sector policies and strengthen institutions when
warranted. Such objectives were incorporated in six sector
loans totalling $441 million that the Bank approved in 1990
for irrigation, water supply, education, power and roads.

Bank Operations in the Pacific

At the 1989 Annual Meeting in Beijing, several Governors suggested that the Bank explore ways to better promote
the economic development of its PIDMCs, taking into account their unique characteristics and constraints, such as
small land area and population, limited resources,
dependence on a few primary export commodities and
geographical isolation, Accordingly, an internal Task Force
was formed to recommend ways to improve Bank operations in the region. The Task Force focused on PIDMCs with
the exceptions of Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated
States of Micronesia and Papua New Guinea.*

in its report submitted in October 1989, the Task Force
recommended that the Bank remain flexible and responsive
to the needs of the PIDMCs and proposed several measures
to improve project processing and implementation. It
proposed that the Bank undertake comprehensive manpower reviews to better define the education and training

develop the private sector and indigenous entrepreneurs.
Also suggested was a South Pacific Fund (SPF), administered
by the SPRO, to supplement existing funding sources and
to finance, among other things, longer-term line and advisory positions. These proposals are under consideration.
At a meeting following the Bank’s 1990 Annual Meeting in New Delhi, PIDMC Governors broadly endorsed the
Task Force's recommendations. It was agreed that such
special meetings of PIDMCs would be held annually.
Following discussion of the Task Force report in an
informal meeting of the Board of Directors in November
1989, an ad hoc Working Group, involving both Board
members and senior Bank staff, was established to review,
assess and prioritize the recommendations, and prepare a
clear statement of the Bank's role and mission in the Pacific
region. The Working Group submitted its report to Bank
management in September 1990, broadly supporting the
specific recommendations of the Task Force and recommending that substantial additional authority and responsibility be delegated to the SPRO.! The Board discussed the
repart informally in mid-November. The central issue of

documentation and procedures were regarded as important.
A discussion paper will be prepared to permit detailed
examination of the proposed SPF.

Disaster Rehabilitation

The Bank formalized a policy on rehabilitation
assistance in 1989 to be able to respond quickly to the
adverse effects of natural disasters which affect economic
development in its DMCs. When Western Samoa was struck
by a severe cyclone in the first four days of February 1990
and suffered widespread damage, the Bank responded
promptly to a request by the Government for emergency
assistance. It approved aloan of $500,000 under the Bank's
emergency rehabilitation scheme to help replace damaged
power generation units and a small-scale advisory technical
assistance grant to facilitate the implementation of the loan
A sum of $4.2 million from counterpart funds generated by
the first tranche of the Agriculture Development Prograrn

e earthquake of 16 July 1990. Subsequently, the Bank

provided a $100 million loan for the Earthquake-Damage Reconstruction Project.loan was reallocated to rehabilitate rural infrastructure
damaged by the typhoon.

On 16 July, an earthquake that registered 7.7 on the
Richter scale devasiated large areas of Luzon Island in the
Philippines, causing widespread Gamage to property and
infrastructure and considerable loss of life and injury. Ten
days later, the Bank approved a technical assistance grant
of $100,000 for a study to assess the cost of rebuilding the
damaged infrastructure. Based on the findings of this study,
the Bank, on 22 November, approved a ioan of $100 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance
2 part of the reconstruction of the damaged public infrastructure.

In 1990, the Bank implemented a technical assistance
grant for a regional study on disaster mitigation, based on
the assumption that the severe economic effects of natural
disasters can be mitigated if appropriate measures are taken.
A technical paper on disaster mitigation was prepared with
four country case studies drawn from Bangladesh, Nepal,
Philippines and the PIDMCs as a group. A regional seminar
on disaster management was held in Bangkok in October
1990. A Disaster Managers Handbook is being prepared.

EDRC Activities

During the year, the Economics and Development
Resource Center (EDRC) was involved in a number of
research initiatives og both macro and microeconomic
aspects of development. The topics of macroeconomic
research included trade in services in developing Asia;
urbanization and the environment, econometric modeling
and forecasting; exchange rate policies and financial sector
issues; the impact of the iniegration of the European
Economic Community on the Bank’s DMCs; and iniernational capital flow and external debt issues.

Microeconomic research addressed such sector and
project-related issues as rural credit delivery systems; disease
impact assessment; strategies and policies for structural
transformation; assessment of the impact of sector adjustments; economic analysis of water supply and road projects;
assessment of the foreign exchange and fiscal effects of
development projects; and estimation of the poverty alleviation impact of agricultural projects.

In addition to conducting in-house research, the EDRC
provides technical assistance to support regional and
country-specific research by governments and other research institutions. Topics addressed through technical
assistance studies included demographic-economic forecasting: alleviation of rural poverty; the relationships between governments, financial systems and economic
development; econornic reforms in selected developing
countries; socioeconomic indicators of women in development; and the impact of the Gulf crisis on DMCs.

The EDRC is also responsible for collecting and consolidating socioeconomic data on the Bank's DMCs and for
Tnaintaining and improving a Bankwide statistical data base.
During the year, the EDRC began work on a centralized,

computer-based statistical data bank for use by the Bank and
its member countries. In addition, the EDRC has seven
technical assistance projects in progress to help DMCs
improve and deveiop statistical systerns and services.

A part of the EDRC’s role as a development resource
center is to provide opportunities for policymakers and
experts from both within and outside the region to discuss
issues that are relevant and important to development.
Three such conferences were held during the year: the
Round Table on Development Strategies in January; the
Development Round Table on Management of Public
Enterprises and Privatization in August; and the Asian
Economic Outlook/World Project LINK Conference in
November.

The EDRC also conducted training seminars on
monetary and fiscal policies for senior government officials,
and administered the Bank's Secondment Scheme, providing mid-leve: DMC government officials with work experience within the Bank. Several important regional
conferences organized by other institutions were supported.
Two guest lectures by eminent economists were organized
under the Bank's Distinguished Speaker Series.

Publication of research results is an important part of
the EDRC research program. During the year, 17 new titles
were released (see list at the back of the book). The EDRC
also produces the Asian Development Outlook, an annual
report providing a broad view of economic progress in the
Bank's major DMCs and analyses of short and medium-term
economic prospects; Key Indicators of Developing Asian
and Pacific Countries, providing relevant social and
economic statistics for the Bank's DMCs; and the serniannual journal Asian Developmeni Review containing contributions from eminent persons.

Aid Coordination

In order.to ensure that scarce development resources
are used effectively, the Bank actively cooperated with
bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. The Twelfth ADBWorld Bank Coordination Meeiing was held in May 1990
in connection with the Bank's Twenty-Third Annual Meeting
in New Delhi. The President attended the Development
Committee Meeting and Heads of Multilateral Financial
institutions Meeting in Washington, D.C. in Septernber.

The Bank’s lending and technical assistance operations
continued to rely on the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) as an important source of grant assistance. Apart from_being represented at the UNDP Governing Council Meeting and Inter-Agency Consultative Meeting,
activities between the Bank and the UNDP were coordinated
through the UNDP Resident Offices.

Bank participation in various country and sectorspecific donor group meetings provided another opportunity
to discuss and coordinate economic and social developments, inciuding environmental strategies, in the DMCs.

Gulf Crisis and DMCs

The Gulf crisis resulting from Iraq's 2 August invasion
of Kuwait has generally had an adverse effect on the
budgetary and foreign exchange ‘situations of the oilimporting DMCs (see box in ‘Economic Developments’
chapter). In particular, six DMCs most affected by the crisis
- Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and
Sri Lanka - may require additional external assistance to
support their programs of short-term stabilization and
medium-term recovery. In December, the Board informally
considered possible Bank assistance to these countries.

Possible short-term measures might include: {i) the
utilization of loan savings in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka; (ii) the provision of special assistance to India
and Philippines; {iii} temporary increase in Bank share of
project costs in these DMCs to 90 per cent; (iv) financing
import of commodities. such as fertilizer, fuel inputs, etc., fo

sustain ongoing Bank projects as well as meeting shortfalls
in equipment irnports required for project implementation,
(v) accelerated disbursement through the imprest account
facility; (vi) supplementary finance for projects with cost
overruns; and (vii) support for resettlement of workers
returning from the Gulf area through co-financing of
possible World Bank projects.

in the medium term, the Bank might seek to assess the
impact of the Gulf crisis on its DMCs and, if needed, adapt
its lending strategies appropriately. This may require greater

‘emphasis on projects and programs that support energy

conservation, demand management and the development
of alternative energy sources.

Energy Policy

Traditionally, the Bank’s assistance to the DMCs’ energy sector has revolved around generation, transmission and
exploration activities. Increasingly, however, and particularly in response to events in the Gulf region since August
1990, the Bank emphasizes issues like diversification of
energy resources, demand management, improved efficiency in energy supply, use and conservation, and moreeffective energy planning. These will be the focus of the
Bank’s energy policy in the 1990s. At the same time, private
sector participation in the energy sector will be encouraged,
internal resource mobilization by public utilities to finance
expansion will be emphasized and comprehensive environmental protection measures will be incorporated in energy
development projects.

The policy of energy diversification is reflected in
projects to hamess renewable resources like hydro and
geothermal power, coal and natural gas. The operational
emphasis is on more efficient and least-cost planning, construction and running of energy systems. In addition to
improving the operaiion and maintenance of conventional
generating units, the Bank seeks to encourage the use of
energy-efficient technologies like gas-fired combined cycle
generation and cogeneration. Through technical assistance
grants. it will continue to support tariff studies, energy
conservation, effective pricing schemes, integrated energy
‘planning and the development of better energy statistics.

The Bank is also involved in various biomass production
programs in its DMCs to conserve fuelwood and has

- promoted the use of biogas as an energy alternative. It

emphasizes effective pricing policies for fuelwood and other
forms of alternative energy and assists the DMCs ‘in formulating pricing strategies in a manner that would rationalize
demand, taking into account economic, financial and social
considerations.

Strategic Planning

In order to sharpen its strategic focus and to increase
the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations, the Bank
has established an internal Task Force on strategic planning.
The Task Force will undertake a study covering the entire
planning cycle, the interrelationships between short,
medium and longer-term plans, the processes of strategy
formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation,
and the organizational set-up appropriate for operating a
strategic planning system. It will examine the Bank's existing
activities and strategic planning processes, assess the current
institutional arrangements and recommend suitable
improvements and changes for the establishment of a formal, integrated strategic planning framework.i

THE BANK continued in 1990 to develop country studies
with medium-term operational strategies for assistance
aimed at employing the Bank's resources in sectors and
activities which most fruitfully serve its developing member
countries (DMCs). The Bank also continued to discuss
major policy issues in policy dialogue with the DMCs.

Bangladesh

Operational Strategy: The Bank aims to enhance
economic growth through encouraging macro and sectoral
policy reforms, particularly in mobilizing domestic resources
and liberalizing the economy; improving productivity and
efficiency; strengthening institutions; and raising standards
of living. The Bank has diversified and expanded lending to
agriculture, energy and power, industry, transport and the
social sectors, and addressed poverty alleviation, women in
development and environmental concerns. Agriculture
remains the priority, with emphasis on increasing foodgrain
production through better flood control, drainage and infrastructure and improved input supply (including credit) and
pricing policies. In the energy sector, the Bank focuses on
developing indigenous energy resources, particularly natural
gas and coal. In industry, the Bank has played a role in the
divestment and autonomy of public enterprises, in improving
the financial viability of development finance institutions
(DFis) and in supporting the development of small-scale
industries. In the transport sector, the effort has been to
rehabilitate roads and bridges and increase the overall. efficiency of the transport system. Bank, lending includes
Projects to assist rural and disadvantaged groups through
credits, training and employment creation programs.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank discussed the
Government's medium-term adjustment program aimed at

mobilization (through tax reforms, enhanced cost recovery
and the reduction of subsidies) and the restructuring of public
expenditure to meet growing operational, maintenance and
investment needs.

The Bank coordinates with the World Bank and other
donors in formulating policy and institutional reforms in
agriculture and on issues in the power, transport, industry

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending
totalled $356 million in 1990 for one program loan, one
sector loan, two credit lines and four project loans, including
one to the private sector.

Three loans went to agriculture. A $125 million loan
and three technical assistance grants totalling $500,000
assisted the Foodcrops Development Program which supports government aims of raising rice and wheat production.
The program comprises a package of investments for the
foodcrops sector, supported by policy reforms and institutional measures. A $60 million loan was approved for the
Agriculture and Rural Credit Project which augments the
resources of public and private banks lending to the rural
sector and encourages policy and institutional reforms to
improve rural credit delivery and recovery. The Rural
Women Employment Creation Project, supported by an
$8 million loan, is designed to provide small loans to help
women set up non-farming self-employment activities

More than a third of 1990 lending went to the social
sector. The Primary Education Sector loan of $68.3 million
is planned to help develop formal and non-formal primary
schools, provide basic teaching aid packages, fellowships
and training, upgrade training institutes and disseminate
education on population and personal hygiene. The Second

$16.25 million, is the first Bank project in Bangladesh to
focus on poverty alleviation and supports a government
scheme to provide microcredit and training to generate
self-employment among the landless rural poor. The Small
and Cottage Industry Project provides a $30 million loan to
private commercial banks for onlending to private smallscale and cottage enterprises.

During the year, five loan projects were co-financed in
the amount of $137 million.

for Bangladesh as of end-1990, 46 had been closed and
47 were under administration. Six loans were waiting to

eebecome effective. Contracts worth $326 million were
awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative totai to
$1,893 milion, or 63, per cent of the net effective loan
-amount. Disbursements totalled $306 million, against $322
“million in 1989. This brought curnulative disbursements to
$1,698 million, or 56 per cent of the total net effective loan
amount.

The improvement in disbursements refiects the closer
attention paid by the Government and executing agencies
to project implementation.

work closely with the Government and its executing agencies. The information flow helped both sides take timely
corrective action.

Private Sector investment Management: One

People’s Republic of China

Operational Strategy: The economic reforms
adopted by the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 1979
produced rapid economic growth in the 1980s. The PRC’s
ambition to raise living standards further by doubling national output over the next ten years hinges on continuing
economic reforms, allocating scarce resources efficiently
and overcoming constraints in bottleneck sectors.

The Bank’s interim operational strategy is supportive
of the Government’s economic reform policies. lts program
will help eliminate infrastructure bottlenecks by improving
the efficiency of the basic sectors and supporting the
country’s broader goal of poverty alleviation in harmony
with the needs of environmental protection

The interim strategy takes into consideration the PRC's
size, development objectives and constraints; theGovernment’s borrowing policy in relation to the terms of
the Bank's loans from ordinary capita! resources; the-relatively modest level of Bank assistance available compared
with the country’s large requirements; and the programs of
other external agencies.

Policy Dialogue: Since it has been only recently
operational in the PRC, and limited in its involvement, the
Bank's efforts to induce policy changes have been confined
to the project level. Dialogue during project processing has
been aimed at securing managerial and financial autonomy
for several executing agencies and having prices of output
from various Bank projects determined on market principles. Discussion has also taken place on the Bank's technical assistance prograrn and has resulted in institutional
reforms in various agencies and enterprises.

Loans and Technical Assistance: The Bank approved in 1990 a $50 million loan to the Agricultural Bank
of China (ABC) for the import of equipment, materials and
services to modernize agro-industrial enterprises. The
project is also intended to improve the living conditions of
the rural poor, including those who earn $40 or less per
year.

This brought the Bank's cumulative lending to eight
loans totalling $506 million by end-1990.

During the year, the Bank also approved four technical
assistance grants totalling $1.8 million. One was associated
with the ABC loan and wili strengthen the ABC’s capability
in project lending and investment analysis. The other technical assistance grants were to develop an integrated rural
development strategy for selected provinces in southwest
China; to support a development economics training program for senior government officials; and to assist environmental impact assessment training.

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank's strategy is aimed
at mobilizing domestic resources, promoting exports, increasing private sector participation, enhancing existing
investments, meeting basic needs and alleviating poverty,
and developing human resources.

In agriculture, the Bank seeks increased productivity
and market-oriented pricing for agricultural input and output. The focus in the industry sector is on removing impediments to a strong exportled industrial growth and
eliminating non-tariff barriers and tariff anomalies. Improved
efficiency and enhanced competition continue to be sought
in the finance sector through the introduction of marketoriented interest rates and the strengthening of the domestic
capital market and of privately-owned financial institutions.
Privatization of government-owned financial institutions is
also being encouraged. The key objective in the energy
sector is to increase the supply of electricity and indigenous
oil and gas substantially to sustain economic growth and
encourage private sector involvement. The Bank’s efforts in
the social sector will be directed to reducing the general
weaknesses of concerned institutions and ensuring adequate
budget allocation of funds for development and recurrent
expenditures. Institutional development in all sectors will
continue to be the priority for advisory technical assistance.

Philippines

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational
strategy for the Philippines is focused on supporting poverty
alleviation and employment generation, particularly in the
rural areas. It also is cognizant of the need to redress the
wide disparities in incomes and quality of life between
different regions.

There are a number of considerations in implementing
the strategy. Existing physical infrastructure such as roads,
ports and communications should be rehabilitated and made
more efficient. Power generation and distribution need to be
expanded. In view of widespread poverty, social infrastructure, including high-priority projects in health, education,
water supply and sewerage, should be provided with more
assistance. Agricultural policy needs to be complemented by
balanced regional development. Environmental considerations need more attention. Policy-based program and sector
lending should be extended to support weak balance of
payments and the modalities for such lending should
facilitate policy and institutional reform.

Policy Dialogue: A wide range of policy issues was
discussed with the Government in 1990 during the processing of projects. Reforms proposed under the Road and
Road Transport Sector Program included improvements in
road maintenance policies, practices and financing, and the
deregulation of provincial transport fares. Dialogue during
processing -of the Irrigation Systems Improvement Project
resulted in arrangements being made for the rehabilitation
of watersheds, the provision of extension services and
production credit in project areas, and better operation and
maintenance of the systems. As in the case of other recent
Bank loans to the National Power Corporation, the Sixteenth Power (Masinloc Thermal Power} Project is aimed atieee

privatization efforts and the establishment of small-scale and
medium-scale agro-based industries in the private sector
through the Development Bank of Kiribati,

Policy Dialogue: {n the past, discussions had been
conducted within the framework of specific projects. in
1990, dialogue was focused more broadly on development
constraints. The Bank helped the Government address
problems of overpopulation on the main island of Tarawa
by promoting an integrated development plan for the Northern Line Islands, The organization and operation of public
enterprises and institutions have also been discussed to make
these more effective in using resources and fulfilling targets.

$1 million and two associated technical assistance grants
totalling $246,500 were approved for the Development
Bank of Kiribati (DBK). The DBK will use the funds to
finance private sector projects in agriculture and fisheries,
trade and industry, services and transport, and to increase
business activity in the outer islands. The technical assistance
will strengthen the DBK’s senior management and its institutional capability.

Marshall Islands, Republic of the

Operational Strategy: Since the Republic of the
Marshall Islands joined the Bank in April 1990, the Bank

has formulated a tentative operational strategy and identified
a pipeline of loan and technical assistance projects.

In line with the Government's Five-Year Development
Plan, the Bank's strategy is to help strengthen the country’s
self-reliance by developing its marine resources; upgrading
its human resources through education, manpower training
and family planning; encouraging the private sector so it can
become the engine of economic growth; and strengthening
institutions to improve efficiency in the public sector. The
Bank may also consider assistance for infrastructure to
support productive sectors.

Policy Dialogue: Policy dialogue is expected to cover
the important issues of domestic resource mobilization and
diversification of the economic base to reduce a high dependence on external assisiance. Technical assistance
provided by the Bank will be the basis for these discussions.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Two technical
assistance grants were provided during the year. One grant
of $100,000 is for the Fisheries Development Project and
another grant of $220,000 is for institutional strengthening
of the Marshall Islands Development Bank.

operational strategy. The Bank supports the Government's
Second National Development Plan (1990-1994), which
seeks to promote private sector activities in agriculture and
fisheries. it will also focus on human resource development
and on improving the efficiency of the public sector, especially in infrastructure and public utilities management,

non-mining sectors is the key to the long-term improvement
of living standards and the creation of employment opportunities for a rapidly-growing iabor force. The crisis at the
Bougainville copper mine highlighted the need, and
provided the opportunity, for the Governmeni to introduce
fundamental struciurai adjustments to accelerate the
development of the non-mining economy.

Policy Dialogue: The scope of policy dialogue nas
widened since the Bank adopted a lead role among donors
in many key sectors and has taken a more active roie in
donor coordination.

The Agriculture Sector Program approved in Decernber
1989 led in 1990 to reforms of agricultural taxation, price
stabilization funds and credit sysierns, investment laws and
the abolition of non-productive subsidies and grants. Discussions were held during the year on institutional reforms and
the need for balanced investment to encourage growth in
production, employment and incomes. The Bank has also
worked with the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture
Organization to provide a policy framework for sustainable
management of forest resources. Bank siudies in water
supply, urban development, highways, ports and health
sectors have sei the stage for further sectoral discussions.
The Bank has also discussed streamlining the Government’s

Tonga

Operational Strategy: The Bank supports Government efforts to bring about structural changes. A fundamentai weakness of the Tongan economy is the low ievel of
domestic savings and the meager flow of resources into
productive investments. Thus, a major Bank objective is to
increase domestic resource mobilization and reduce dependence on external assistance. Bank assistance is directed to
the service sector, especially tourism, and manufacturing;
agricultural diversification into higher-value crops for export
and domestic markets. and expansion of the domestic
fisheries industry; development of the private sector in all
economic activities and the promotion of an open, outwardlooking economy; infrastructure and institution building: and

In addition, the Bank sent out high-level country
projects review missions to discuss country and sectorspecific implernentation problems and remedial measures
with senior government officials. Such missions have
covered large borrowers such as Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia, Pakistan and Philippines. For more in-depth
assessment of project implementation, mid-term review
missions were recently introduced and will be carried out
more and more frequently to ensure that implementation
will be on schedule and project objectives achieved.

Project administration is also facilitated by the Bank's
resident offices in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan
and the South Pacific Regional Office in Vanuatu. These are
in areas where there are either significant numbers of Bank
projects or special problems with regard to project implementation.

The Bank also seeks to enhance the implementation
capabilities of executing agencies through seminars and
workshops. This activity continued in 1990, as detailed in
the accompanying table.

In addition, in-house seminars were conducted to enhance the skills of Bank staff dealing with project processing
and administration. This included a seminar for appraisal
mission leaders, a seminar on procurement operations and

The Bank continued the process of streamlining loan
administration procedures to facilitate and expedite project
implementation. The Bank’s Project Administration Instructions (PAls) were updated and improved. Management approved the dissemination of PAls to executing agencies to
enhance their understanding of Bank procedures. Work was
also started on the production of instructional video tapes
on project implementation management to increase the
effectiveness of seminars held for executing agency staff.

Business opportunities seminars were held during the
year for contractors, manufacturers, suppliers and consult
ants from the Bank's member countries. These were held in
Australia, Belgium, Canada, People’s Republic of China,
India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia,
New Zealand, Norway and United Kingdom. The seminars
advised potential bidders and consultants on how to prepare
bids and proposals. The Bank has a monthly publication,
renamed in 1990 as ADB Business Opportunities, which
enables contractors, manufacturers, suppliers and consultants to obtain information on proposed loans and technical
assistance.

There were informal discussions with the Board of
Directors on Bank procedures and practices relating fo
procurement and selection of consultants.

Contract Awards and
Consulting Services

Contract awards reached $2,737 million by the end of
1990, a 30 per cent increase over 1989. Of the total
awards, $1,777 million was from ordinary capital resources

(ADF). Cumulative contract awards amounted to
$17,667 million by end-1990.

Aithough consulting services form a small portion of

- total contract awards, they play a vital role in project

implementation. During the year, borrowers engaged 136
consulting firms and 32 individual consultants to help implement Bank-financed projects. Consulting services contracted in 1990 totalled $96 million, bringing the cumulative
amount to $948 million by end-1990 and accounting for
4 per cent of total cumulative loan contract value. In addition, the Bank employed 180 consulting firms and 324
individual consultants fo help implement technical assistance
projects. During 1990, the Bank approved 261 technical
assistance projects amounting to $302.6 million.

Six country seminars were organized during the year in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Philippines to help
develop domestic consultants’ capability and to familiarize
government officials with the use of consultants. An in-house
serninar was also held to guide Bank staff on procedures for
selecting consultants.

Loan Disbursements

Loan disbursements rose 23 per cent to $2,752 million
in 1990. Of this, OCR disbursements amounted to $1,689
million (up 25 per cent} and ADF disbursements $1,063
million (up 20 per cent).

Program loan disbursements, accounting for
24 per cent of total disbursements in 1990, amounted to
$671 million, a 49 per cent increase over 1989.

Project loan disbursements, making up 62 per cent of
the year's total disbursements, rose 11 per ceni to
$1,708 million, of which $281 militon were under loans to
development finance institutions.

Many factors contributed to the improvement in loan
disbursements: the DMCs’ continued efforts to speed up
project implementation and to carry out policy reforms,
supported by a fiexible Bank attitude; the Bank's continued
effort to enhance the project implementation capabilities of
executing agencies through missions and seminars; the use
of imprest accounts, the statement of expenditure
mechanism and retroactive financing to facilitate the tlow of
loan funds; and the role of quick-disbursing program loans.

Private Sector Investment Portfolio

The Board approved in 1990 private sector investments (equity and loans without government quarantee) and
underwritings totalling $116 million for 17 projects.

Cumulatively, by the end of 1990. the Board-approved
portfolio of investments (equity, loans without government
guarantee) and underwritings amounted to $440 million.
This included $181 million in equity investments and
$259 million in loans. In addition, complementary loans
amounted to $80 million.

The Bank focuses on private sector operations which
produce social and economic benefits such as employment
opportunities, improvement in management techniques,
technology transfer and foreign exchange savings. It also
prefers projects which have a catalytic effect in encouraging
other investments.

Excluding complementary loans, Pakistan accounted
for $62 million, or 29 per cent of the total portfolio, followed by the Philippines with $35 million (16 per cent),
India with $21 million (10 per cent) and Indonesia with
$22 million (10 per cent}. Investments in companies classified as regional in scope stood at $52 million (24 per ceni).

By sector, financial institutions, insurance and ieasing
companies made up the biggest component of the portfolio
with $100 million (47 per cent), reflecting high investment
approvals for, and generally quick disbursements in, this
category. The manufacturing sector accounted for $79 million (37 per cent) of the portfolio, with the chemicals subsecior weighing in heavily with $41 million, followed by
textiles with $19 million and fabricated metal products and
machinery with $17 million. Investments in infrastructure
projects (telecommunications, power generation) accounted
for $35 million (16 per cent}.

Disbursements totalied $106 million during 1990 and,
at the end of the year, were under way for 13 investments,
which accounted for $39 million or 18 per cent of the
portfolio. Disbursements had been completed for 43 investments, making up $161 million or 75 per cent of the
portfolio. Five investments have loans in the repayment
stage.

Of the invesiee cornpanies, 14 nad projects still under

implemeniation and for which the Bank had disbursed
$56 million (26 per cent}. Another 13 companies, accounting for investments of $47 million (22 per cent), were in
initia! operations, and 30 companies with Bank investments
of $111 million (52 per cent} had reached full-scale operations. These percentages are iypical for a portfolio which
still has some way to go before reaching maturity.

The dividend income from the Bank's equity investments is still modest, reflecting the fact that only a few of
the investee companies have been in operation long enough
to build up a record of profits that would permit a declaration
of dividends, Those which have reached this stage are mostly
financial institutions in which the Bank's stakes are small, In

total, dividends received during 1990 amounted to $1.1 mil
lion against $200,000 in 1989. One investment in a leasing
company in Pakistan was partially divested, which resulted
in a net gain of around $800,000.

Unlike equity investments, loans generate an agreed
income to the lender in the form of interest and other
charges. interest and fee income amounted to $5.7 million
during 1990, against $1.4 million in 1989. Of the Bank's
16 unguaranteed loans, for which disbursements had been
made, three carried pool-based variable interest rates, one
carried currency-specific floating interest rates, and 12 carried currency-specific fixed interest rates. The rates charged
to borrowers, therefore, vary in terms of currency, interest
rate, interest regime, charges other than interest and spread
Complementary loans all carry currency-specific floating
interest rates.

Following an evaluation of the total investment
portfolio, the Bank made a general provision of $1 million
in 1990 against possible losses. Total provision at year-end
stood at $2 million.

Project Benefit Monitoring
and Evaluation

Project benefit monitoring and evaluation (PBME) consists of preparing and analyzing benchmark information
about beneficiaries, monitoring project benefits and preparing studies to evaluate the benefits of completed projects.
The Bank’s approach to PBME has evolved in response to
important changes in the Bank's operations. PBME activities
have been adapted to the needs of program lending, the

=

 

 

eelincreased emphasis on poverty alleviation and lending for
protection of the environment.

A more seiective approach to the evaiuation of benefits
of completed projects has been introduced. Accordingly.
before a project is evaluated, its readiness for evaluation is
assessed, terms of reference are prepared and guidance is
provided to the organizations which conduct evaluations

In Nepal, local consultants are closely supervised by the
Department of lrrigation, the Internationa! Labour Organisation and the Bank in their evaluation of benefits from the
Hill Irrigation (Western Region) Project. When this study is
completed. it is hoped that the Department of Irrigation will
be abie to replicate these procedures to evaluate the benefits
of other completed irrigation projects. Similar activities have
been siarted or are contemplaied for other countries. The
benefits of the Sixth Road Project in Indonesia were
evaluated, using procedures that hac been developed by the
Bank.

In general, evaluations of the benefits of completed
projects are conducted by the concerned executing agency
or government department. However, the Bank may become directiy involved, through either its own staff or
consultants, if there are complex issues to examine. So far,
it has prepared one reconnaissance grade project benefit
evaluation study for an integrated area development project
in this way and the results of this study were used during the
preparation of a follow-on loan in the same area of the
country.

Procedures to monitor and evaluate the benefits of
sudloans provided through loans to developmen finance
institutions (DFls) were developed and tested through a
small-scale tecnnical assistance. This system is presently
being applied to several additional lines of credit to DFls and
plans have been made to train concerned DFI staff in
computer-based monitoring techniques.

|POST-EVALUATION

 

POST-EVALUATION of completed projects is an isnportant
tool the Bank uses to assess the effectiveness of its assistance
to its developing member countries (DMCs}, gain insights
into the formulation, implementation and operation of past
projects, and draw lessons for the Bank's operations in the
future. Results of post-evaluation thus form invaluable inputs
for the design and implementation of new projects. The
evaluation function is the responsibility of the PostEvaluation Office (PEO), which reports directly to the President. The Board's Audit Committee closely monitors the
activities of the Office and during 1990 reviewed 23 Project
Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), one Special Study
Report, one Impaci Evaluation (Re-evaluation) Report and
the Twelfth Annuai Review of Post-Evaluation Reports.

The growth over the years in the Bank's lending operations and an increase in the number of completed projects
required a prudent use of the PEO’s resources. In 1988, the
Bank switched from a policy of post-evaluating all completed
projects/programs to one of selective post-evaiuation. A
judicious formulation of selection criteria ensures that the
integrity of the Bank’s post-evaluation system is not compromised or jeopardized.

During 1990, 27 projects, including one program loan,
were assessed in depth and were covered by PPARs. The
PEO also undertook, for the first time, in-depth evaluations
of two technical assistance projects — a technical assistance
for project preparation in Indonesia and an advisory technical assistance project in Solomon Islands. In addition, the
PEO reviewed PCRs for eight projects in which accountability and lesson-iearning functions were adequately fulfilled
and no PPARs were considered necessary.

By the end of the year, the PEO had prepared 324
PPARs covering 340 projects in 23 countries and spanning
all major sectors and subsectors. They represented
88 per cent of the 386 completed projects for which PCRs
had been prepared as of December 1989.

The 27 projects evaluaied in 1990 covered
12 countries and 12 subsectors and had been approved
vetween 1977 and 1985. Eight. or 30 per cent, were
considered generally successful, compared with the long-run

average success rate of 63 per cent. Another eight were
assessed as partly successful, while the remaining 11 were
rated unsuccessful.

Several factors affected the year’s results. Under its
policy of selective evaluation, the PEO concentrates on
projects which have special problems to contend with and
lessons to offer, and the success rate in such cases tends to
be lower. Sector mix was another factor. There was a larger
proportion of agricultural projects/programs among the
cases evaluated during 1990 than in the year earlier and
agriculture projects are more complex and difficult to implement. In addition, a number of education and development
finance institution (DF]} projects evaluated were also found
to perform relatively poorly.

As in the past, the less-than-successful projecis were
often plagued by factors such as inadequate and inappropriate project design, institutional weaknesses, adverse
macro policy environment and changes in government
Policies,

Re-evaluation and Special Studies

In addition to preparing PPARs and reviewing PCRs,
the PEO also completed a re-evaluation of three projects
(one each in Indonesia, Pakistan and Papua New Guinea),
a special study on DFls in selected South Asian countries
and two special country studies for Papua New Guinea and
Western Samoa. Re-evaluation studies take a second look
at projects on the basis of a sufficiently long period of
operation to assess actual benefits and reassess their technical and economic viability.

The re-evaluation of the Baturaja Cement Project in
Indonesia confirmed the “partly successful” rating given
during its post-evaluation five years earlier. The project
suffered from operational problems and high energy consumption. The re-evaluation study suggested additional investments and technical upgrading to facilitate energy
conservation and full capacity utilization. It also called for
removat of price controls and market segmentation to put

the cement industry in line with other sectors of the
Indonesian economy.

The Pipri | and li Thermal Generation projects in
Pakistan were reconfirmed as “generally successful” in reevaluation. The projects’ operational performance was
found generally satisfactory except for sorne problems in the
treatment of cooling water. The financial performance of
the executing agency has suffered somewhat because of the
use of imported diesel oil in place of natural gas and because
account receivables continue to be heavy. The study suggested a review of the Government's general policy banning
the use of natural gas for power projects sel up after 1981,

Tarbela Dam in Northwest Frontier Province has been
greatly expanded with the help of Bank loans totalling
more than $400 million.

 

as well as the specific question of making available natural
gas for power generation at Pipri.

On re-evaluation, the benefits of the Hiritano Highway
Project in Papua New Guinea were found to be iess than
previously assessed, with an economic internal rate of return
of 8 per cent compared with 13 per cent at the stage of
post-evaluation. Delays in iraplementation had a significant
impact on the project in terms of cost overruns and foregone
benefits. Data limitations hindered re-evaluation of the
project. While fruit and vegetable production had apparently
increased as a result of the project, the volume of marketed
fresh food was well below appraisal expectations. Production constraints were thought to have limited the project's
development impact and the rapid growth in economic
activity anticipated at the time of project appraisal appeared,
in hindsight, to be overly optimistic. The report concluded
that project appraisal had not made a realistic assessment
of how transport cost savings would increase agricultural
output and whether government departments had an adequate capacity to promote agricultural development in the
areas served by the highway. The case highlighted the
importance of completing detailed engineering designs
before project approval, and emphasized that the
Government’s macroeconomic policies with regard to the
demand for transport should have been better evaluated.

A special study on DFis in selected South Asian
countries identified issues and lessons on the basis of previously completed PPARs and other post-evaluation reports
on DFls in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The study
noted that the operating conditions of DFis have become
more competitive in the recent past, mainly on account of
the entry of commercial banks in term financing. The DFls,
however, have been rather slow to initiate institutional
reforms needed to be in line with new trends in the market.
In addition, because of the poor performance of subprojects,
most of the DF is reviewed suffered from collection problems,
which in turn affected their financial performance. The study
revealed that some of the issues that affected DFI operations
are beyond the control of DFls, including the legal system
related to loan recovery procedures and government policies
which restrict the DFls’ ability to diversify into new fields such
as capital market activities. Thus, the study suggested that
the Bank continue and strengthen policy dialogue with
borrowers and DFis on broad sectoral issues, and develop
closer links between its operations in the DFI sector and its
economic and sector work.

Two other special studies reviewed and consolidated the
major findings of post-evaluation reports undertaken by the
Bank in Papua New Guinea and Western Samoa.

Feedback of Post-Evaluation Findings

In order to offer timely feedback, the PEO’s computerized Post-Evaluation Information System continues to
provide the Bank's operational departments with data and
analysis on post-evaluated projects/programs. This was
supplemented by the circulation of the Ninth Report of

Synopsis of Post-Evaluation Reports in January 1990 and
the Twelfth Review of Post-Evaiuation Reports in March.
Additionally, the PEO continues to review and comment on
draft Board documents as well as participate in loan
processing meetings.

In recent years, the PEO's feedback mechanism has
been further strengthened through the organization of feedback workshops, usually with selecied operational departments or groups of such departments. These workshops
disseminate and discuss the findings and lessons of past
post-evaluation reports and allow for an exchange of views
on the Bank’s current and future operations. During the
year, feedback workshops were organized for the highways
and roads, DFI and education subsectors.

 

Development of Evaluation
Capabilities in DMCs

The PEO is also entrusteé with the responsibility of
formuiating and initiating action to assist DMCs in deveioping and strengthening their own evaluation capabilities. A
beginning was made during the year witn the implementation of a technical assistance project to assist the Government of Papua New Guinea in providing on-the-job training
to evaluators and planners of its Department of Finance and
Planning and other concerned ministries and line departments. The project included establishing a computerized
intormation system for the storage and retrieval of ex-post
evaluation findings.A MACHINE company in the Republic of

Financial Policies

JN ACCORDANCE with the income policies approved by
the Board ir. 1987, the Bank ensures that its interest
coverage ratio (ICR), which measures the extent to which
the Bank's financial expenses are covered by its net income,
does not fall substantially below 1.25 in the iong run and
that its minirnum long-term reserves to outstanding loans
ratio (RLR) is within a range of 20 to 25 per cent. As of
31 December 1990, the ICR stood at 1.98 and the RLR at
38 per cent.

Variable Lending Rate

The Bank's pool-based variable lending rate, which is
adjusted on 1 January and 1 July each year, applies to all
ordinary operations loans approved after 30 June 1986 and
to nearly ali ordinary operations loans approved between
24 Septernber 1985 and 30 June 1986. The lending rate
is determined by adding a spread (currently 0.4 per cent per
annum) to the average cost of 2 pool of outstanding Bank
borrowings. From its initial level of 7.65 per cent per annum
set on 1 July 1986, the lending rate progressively declined
until 1 January 1990 when it was reduced from
6.37 per cent per annum to 6.33 per cent per annum. On
1 July it was increased to 6.36 per cent per annum.

Under the old lending rate system, which applied before
the variable lending rate system was introduced, rates were
fixed at the time of loan approvai for the entire life of the
loan. As of 31 December 1990, the variable lending rate
applied to $2,645.2 million of disbursed and outstanding
loans and to $5,485.2 million of undisbursed loans, representing about 36.09 per cent and 89,19 per cent of the
respective totals.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

 

Borrowings

In January 1990, the Board considered an indicative
borrowing program for the year of $1,200 million. By
mid-year, however, a number of factors had emerged which
indicated that the liquidity ratio at the end of the year could
be higher than previously expected. These factors included
postponement of the 1990 liability management activities
due to increased yen interest rates, unanticipated loan
prepayments and cancellations and indications that 1990
loan commitments would fall short of the projection made
at the beginning of the year. As a result, it was considered
appropriate to reduce the borrowing program for 1990 by
about 30 per cent. The Bank undertook five borrowings
during the year totalling $848.6 million. An extemal yenbond issue for ¥20 billion was launched in May in the
Eurobond market. Also in yen. the Bank launched a 5

which were swapped into yen and Swiss francs.

The average original life of the year's borrowings,
weighted by amount, was 10 years, compared to 9.8 years
in 1989. At the end of 1990, the remaining average life of
the Bank’s outstanding borrowings, weighted by the amount
of each borrowing, was 6.9 years The “after-swap” average
cost of the year's borrowings, weighted by arnount, was
7.16 per cent per annum compared with 5.24 per cent per
annum in 1989. This increase in borrowing costs was
reflected in the upturn in the variable lending rate referred
to aboveCapitalization

The capital stock is defined in the Bank's Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States collars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966. Since the coming into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (MF) on
i Aprit 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terrns
of gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate
successor to the 1966 dollar, the value of the Bank's capital
stock has been expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis
that each share has the value of SDR10,000. The mutual
obligations of each member and the Bank with respect to
maintenance of the value of currency holdings have also
been measured oy the same standard, but settlement of such
obligations has been held in abeyance. For purposes of the
financial statements, the SDR has been translated into
current United States doliars at ihe current rate as computed
oy the IMF. As of 31 December 1990, the rate was
$1.42266 per SDR. Further information on the: Bank's
current practice regarding valuation of capitai and maintenance of value is given in Notes A and F of the Notes io
Financiai Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources,
OCR-7.

In September 1988, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolutions No. 193, 194 and 195 authorizing special
increases in the capita! subscriptions of Japan, Sweden and
United States, ‘to take effect in accordance with the
provisions of those Resolutions. The Governors aso
adopted Resolution No. 192 authorizing an increase of
62,194 shares in the Bank's capital stock to be made
availabie for these speciai increases. As of
31 December 1990, Japan, Sweden and United States had
not subscribed to their entitlements.

In April, new membership subscriptions were received
from the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated
States of Micronesia.

At the end of 1990, the Bank's authorized capital stock
amounted to $23,938 million (SDR16,826.4 million). The
subscribed capital stock stood at $22,884 million
(SDR16,085.7 million).

Future Resource Requirements

In May 1986, the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 179 requesting the Board of Directors to undertake
a study of the Bank's future resource requirements for
financing its ordinary operations. The study will lead to the
formuiation of specific proposals for a further general capital
increase (GCI IV}. A report providing an updated review of
progress on the study was approved by the Board of Directors in March 1990 for submission to the Board of Governors. The report was considered by the Board of Governors
at the 23rd Annual Meeting. A working paper on the Bank's
ordinary capital resources operational program for
1991-1998 was under preparation as of year-end and was
expected to be considered by the Board of Directors around

increase in disbursed and outstanding loans.

The expenses of the Bank in 1990 totalled $595 million, a decrease of $6 million from the previous year. This

Replenishment of ADF and TASF (ADF V)

THE CURRENT Asian Development Fund (ADF) and Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) replenishment
(ADF V) was authorized by Governors’ Resolution No. 182
in October 1986. The replenishment, amounting to
$3.6 billion at the exchange rates specified in the Resolution, was intended to finance the Bank's concessional lending over the four-year period 1987-1990. Of the
replenishment total, $72 million was for allocation to the
TASF for technical assistance to poorer developing member
countries and for regional technical assistance.

The contributions of Canada and the United States are
qualified, whereby, as permitted by the Resolution, the
second, third and fourth instalments are subject to budgetary
appropriations. Under the ADF V “trigger” arrangements,
the availability for operational commitments of the second,
third and fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions is
subject to the availability of the first, second and remaining
two tranches, respectively. of the qualified contributions.
The fourth tranche will be released in proportion to the
extent that each qualified contribution has become available
for operational commitments beyond three-fourths of its
total amount. The arrangements for ADF V envisaged that
the second tranches of the unqualified contributions would
be released on 1 January 1988 and the third tranches on
1 January 1989.

By the end of 1989, Canada had obtained
appropriations for its first three instalments. The
United States had obtained appropriations for its first instalment and 93.38 per cent of its second instalment and had
made these resources available to the Bank.for operational

nd Japan Special Fund

  

commitments. As a result, in accordance with the provisions
of the Resolution, the first two tranches of all contributions
other than that of the United States had become available
in full, and their third tranches had become available to the
extent of 93.38 per cent. In November 1990. the
United States made available a further $124.4 million of its
contribution. Of this amount, $9.7 million was for the
remaining 6.62 per cent of the second tranche, and the
balance of $114.8 million was for about 78.58 per cent of
the third tranche. Accordingly, pursuant to the Resolution,
the 6.62 per cent balance of other donors’ third tranches
also became available for operational commitments.

ADF Financial Policies

In view of the past steady growth in the ADF accumulated surplus and accumulated loan repaymenis, the need
arose during 1990 for the Board of Directors to commence
a review of three related financial policy issues. The first issue
concermed the possibility of using ADF income and loan
repayments for loan disbursements. The use of these funds
for disbursements would result in ADF liquidity growing less
rapidly than in the past. The second issue concemed the
Bank's policy of deducting a provision for exchange rate
fluctuations from total uncommitted resources in determining the availability of ADF resources for loan commitments.
The provision, whose size was based largely on the amount
of the accumulated surplus and accumulated loan repayments, was growing strongly and becoming large. In reviewing the policy, the Board considered the possibility of
replacing it with a lending limitation policy under which the
lending limitation would be determined on the basis of the
amount and currency mix of undisbursed resources and
committed but undisbursed loans. The third issue concernedhe — TT co

110

the possibility of making available amounts of future ADF
investment income and loan repayments for loan commitments. The availability of these amoun f actual
receipt would increase ADF commitment authority and
enable ADF borrowers to benefit from this growing source

of funds at the earliest possible date.*

  

Future Resource Requirements

Since the period over which ADF V was intended to
finance the Bank's concessional lending was scheduled to
end on 31 December 1990, a meeting of ADF donor
countries was held in New Delhi at the time of the 23rd
Annual Meeting to consider the current ADF resource
position and the timeframe for the next ADF replenishment
(ADF Vi). ADF donors met in Washington, D.C., in September to discuss a number of issues relating to the replenishment, including the financial policy issues mentioned above
and such operational issues as poverty alleviation, environmental protection, health and population, and women in
development. They also agreed to hold a further meeting in
Tokyo in January 1991 for discussions on a number of
policy issues and for cormmencing consideration of the
replenishment itself.

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

At the beginning of 1990, the net resources available
for ADF loan commitments, after allowing for a provision
of $723 million for exchange rate fluctuations, iotalled
about $1,415 million. Releases of further amounts of
ADF ¥V contributions in November 1990 added about
$193 million to resources {at the exchange rates applicable
at the time of such releases), while net income for the year
added about $107 million. ADF loan approvals during the
year totalled $1,480 million fat the exchange rates applicable at the time of loan negotiation). After taking account
of repayments, cancellations and exchange rate adjustments, total uncommitted resources amounted to $1,163
million, During the year, the provision for exchange rate
fluctuations increased from $723 million to $951 million.
After deduction of this latter amount, the net resources
available for further loan commitments at the end of 1990
amounted to about $212 million.

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

Disbursements from ADF resources during 1990
totalled $1,063 million ($888 million in 1989}, bringing
cumulative disbursements at the end of the year to
$5,566 million. ADF joan repayments during the year

 

1 Policies on these three issues were approved by the Board on
31 January 1991.

2 A further $1,496 million was added to available ADF resources on
31 January 199] as a result of the financial policy changes approved by
the Board.

 

  

TECHNICIANS working at a refinery under the Bankassisted Industry Energy Conservation Program in the
People’s Republic of China.

amounted to $46 million, with cumulative repayments as of
end-1990 amounting to $253 million.

ADF Revenue and Expenses

For 1990, the excess of revenue over expenses {net
income) of ADF was $107 million, increasing accumulated
surplus to $513 million at the end of the year.

Income, consisting mainly of income from investments
and service fees on loans, amounted to $161 million while
expenses, consisting principally of administrative charges
paid to ordinary capital resources, amounted to $54 million.

At the end of 1990, the Bank’s investments of ADF
resources were denominated in 18 currencies and amounted

 

elMeet

to the equivalent of $903 million ($797 million at the end
of 1989). Of the total investments, 27 per cent (20 per cent
at the end of 1989) was held in securities issued or guaranteed by member governments. The balance was invested in
deposits and other bank instruments in member countries.
The realized rate of return on ADF investments over the year
was 10.40 per cent, compared with 9.89 per cent in 1989.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

As of 31 December, an aggregate amount of
$91,9 million had been set aside and allocated to the TASF
from ADF V contributions pursuant to Govemors’ Resolution No, 182. At the exchange rates specified in the Resolution, this amount was equivalent to $72 million. By the end
of 1990, $68.7 million had been utilized.

During the year, the PRC and Pakistan made direct
voluntary contributions to the TASF totalling the equivaleni
of $664,000. The PRC's contribution, its first, of $600,000
is fully untied and may be used to finance the costs of services
and facilities from al! member countries. The contribution of
Pakistan, its fourteenth and the equivalent of $64,000, can
only be used to finance the costs of services and facilities
from Pakistan and other DMCs. As of end-1990, direct
voluntary contributions to the TASF amounted to the
equivalent of $85.1 million. $83.7 million had been utilized.

Including income frem invesiments and other sources,
total unutilized TASF resources as of the end of 1990
amounted to the equivalent of $36.6 million.

Japan Special Fund

Since the establishment of the Japan Special Fund (JSF)
on 10 March 1988, the Govemment of Japan has committed over a three-year period a total of ¥21.07 billion
{equivalent to about $155.8 million), including supplementary amounts contributed for the second and third years. Of
this committed amount. ¥16.07 billion (equivalent to about
$118.8 million) had been received by 31 December 1990,
of which $25 million had been utilized for technical assistance operations and $1.6 million for one equity investment.

During 1990, Japan committed ¥8 billion (equivalent
to $58.52 million as of 31 December 1990) as its third-year
coniribution to the JSF. Of this, ¥3 billion had been received
by March 1990. In addition to its third-year contribution, in
1990 the Japanese Government contributed, and remitted,
¥661 million (equivalent to about $4.93 million) for training
projects on monetary and fiscal issues and for environmentrelated activities. A further ammount of ¥9.518 million
(equivalent to about $70,000) was received from the
Government during the year as an addition to its second-year
contribution of ¥7.9 billion (equivalent to about
$59.2 million).

In 1990, a total of $15.44 million was utilized for
technical assistance expenditures and $1.6 million for one
equity investment. From the investment income earned,
$586,000 was used to defray direct and identified administrative expenses during the year, as agreed upon with
the Government of Japan.

THE BOARD of Directors, acting on the recommendation
of the President, appointed Mr. William R. Thomson as
Vice-President responsible for the operational functions of
the Bank, with effect from 1 October 1990. Mr.. Thomson
succeeded Mr. S. Stanley Katz, who retired irom the Bank.

Prior to his appointment, Mr. Thomson was the US
Alternate Director on the Bank's Board of Directors. Previously, he had worked in various capacities in the US
Treasury Department for 16 years.

Staff

At the end of 1990, the Bank had a siaff of 1,668 from
40 of the 49 member countries: 606 professional staff and
1,062 supporting staff. During the year, there were 55 appointmenis and 53 terminations of professional staff, whiie
71 supporting staff joined the Bank and 69 left.

Five young professionals joined in 1990. They replaced
the 1988 intake who progressed to regular professional staff
positions. It is proposed to recruit the same number of young
professionals in 1991.

The draft of a Personnel Handbook codifying the
Bank's personnel policies and practices was completed and
was the subject of a series of Board discussions. Based on
the discussions, a Personnel Policy Statement was
developed, discussed and approved by the Board. The
Statement and the Handbook will be issued shortly and will
serve to improve the understanding and transparency of the
Bank's personnel policies, including in-house and external
Grievance redress procedures.

In recognition of the need to improve the representation of women on the Bank's professional staff, a policy
statement was adopted along with an action plan to promote
the recruitment and career development of women professionais in the Bank.

The Bank has continued to expand its career development activities for professional and supporting staff. The job

rotation plan for selected high-potential staff to broaden
their experience and prepare them for higher responsibilities
continued for the second year. A scheme io second younger
professionals to agencies in developing member countries
was implemented, the first secondment — to Nepal - being
arranged in October 1990 and the second one — to India scheduled for eariy 1991.

The Board approved an 8 per cent across-the-board
salary increase for supporting staff, effective 1 August. Dependency allowances of supporting staff were also increased. On 18 December, the Board also approved a
one-time special advance payment of one month’s salary to
the supporting staff in light of rising living costs in Manila.

The review of the professional staff salary policy and
structuré is continuing. Pending the outcome of this review,
the Board approved a 4.2 per cent genera: salary increase,
effective 1 August, and a special one-time lump sum payment (equivalent to 7.5 per cent of the professional staff
payroll as of 1 August 1990) to staff siationed at Headquarters in order to maintain the Bank's competitiveness in
recruiting and retaining high-quality international staff. The
Force Majeure Protection Program was improved in 1990
and a new Medical Evacuation Facility and Dependents Life
and Disability Insurance Plan were introduced. The education grant ceiling for children schooling outside the duty
station was also increased.

Organization

With effect from 1 August 1990, the loan and technical
assistance disbursement functions in the Controller's
Department were redefined primarily to combine interrelated functions, optimize the utilization of staff and realign
disbursement activities in line with the regionalized configuration in the operational departments. The technical
assistance and Trust Funds functions, which used to be under
the Administrative Expense Division (CTAE}, were merged
with the functions of the present Loans Division and then
split into Disbursement Divisions East ‘and West. The

113remaining functions of the former CTAE were assigned to
the new Administrative Expense Section

In duly 1990, the decision was taken to realign the
existing sectoral functions of the Infrastructure Department,
effective 1 January 1991. Accordingly, the functions pertaining to airports and highways and ports, railways and
telecommunications have been merged and regionalized
into Transport and Communications Divisions East and
West; the functions concerning water supply and sanitation
and urban development (including housing and tourism} have
been reorganized into Water Supply and Urban Development Divisions East and West; and the functions relating to

 

WORKER in the lignite-fuelled Mae Moh power station

in Thailand which the Bank has assisted with several
loans amounting to more than $300 million.

 

education, health and population have been restructured
into Education, Health and Population Divisions East and
West.

To strengthen its role and raise its profile in the environmental field, the Environment Division of the Infrastructure
Department was elevated to the Office of the Environment,
headed by a Chief and reporting directly to Vice-President
(Projects), effective 1 September 1990. A Private Sector
Section was created in the Office of the General Counsel to
take responsibility for all legal work relating to the Bank's
private-sector activities, effective 3 September 1990.

Following the recommendations of an Ad Hoc Working
Group on Bank Operations in the South Pacific, the Board
informally discussed expanding the role of the South Pacific
Regional Office and transferring to it both functions and
personnel.

In preparation for the Bank's move to the new headquarters building, the Office of Administrative Services was
reorganized with effect from 2 January 1991. The reorganization involves the redistribution of functions in terms
of their interrelatedness among sections of the General
Services Division and Support Services Division and the
creation of a Facilities Management Division, which will
absorb the present building maintenance functions and
incorporate functions arising from the eventual winding up
of the Special Projects Office.

Internal Audit

The Internal Audit Office (AO) reviews the adequacy
and effectiveness of controls, systems and procedures relating to financial, accounting, administrative, data processing
and loan and technical assistance operations. It provides an
independent and objective evaluation and identifies means
of improving the efficiency and economy of Bank activities
and the use of its resources. The AO reports fo the President, but its activities are also reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board.

in 1990, the IAO audited the financial and accounting
aspects of the resident offices in Indonesia and Pakistan and
reviewed certain audit-related issues of Joan operations in
the two countries. This was part of the IAO’s program to
undertake such reviews in all the Bank’s borrowing
countries. In coordination with the Bank's external auditors,
the [AO provided direct and integrated assistance, which
also included reviews of internal control questionnaires. The
Office also played an active role in auditing the contracts of
selected consultants. The results of the IAO’s audits and
recommendations were conveyed to management for information and to heads of departments and offices for necessary action.

The Board's Audit Committee expressed satisfaction
with the conduct of the JAO’s activities and with the implementation of its recommendations. This was reflected in
the responsiveness of the departments concerned, which
further improved the Bank's operations.PLANTING seedlings at Nueva Ecija. Philippines, is part
of the Forestry Sector Program which the Bank is
assisting with a $120 miflion loan

Computer and Office
Automation Program

The Office of Computer Services provides fuli-time
computing capability at the Bank's headquariers in Manila,
its resident offices in Bangladesh. Indonesia. Nepal and
Pakistan and the South Pacific Regiona! Office in Vanuaiu.
The Office also supports Bank-financed computer-reiated
projects in the Bank's developing member countries.

During 1990, the mainframe computer data communications network was expanded to provide on-line
mainframe access to 1,119 staff using 832 computer
workstations. An additional 305 IBM PS/2 microcomputers
and 187 HP laserjet and EPSON printers were installed.

Maior systems development work during the year included: integration of the Loan Financial Information System and Technical Assistance Information System to reduce
manual interaction ir. the processing of loan and technical
assistance disbursements; implementation of the Loan
Covenant Subsystem and the Project Administration

 

MEDICAL attention in Bangiadesh under the Heaith and
Family Planning Services Project which the Bank has
assisted with a ioan of $27.5 million

MOVE TO NEW HEADQUARTERS

The Bank was due to move to its new headquarters in Mandaiuyong, northeast Metro Manila,
in the first quarter of 1991. It had occupied its
previous premises in Roxas Boulevard for 19 years.

The move allows the Bank to centralize its
operations for the first time since 1980 in one
building rather than in six locations around Manila.

The new headquarters, on a six-hectare site.
consists of a nine-storey office biock and a twostorey facitity block. Apart from office space. the
ouilding provides for a library, training center, communications center, computer center, auditorium.
conference rooms. printing center, records center,
cafeieria and dining room, telephone exchange,
post office. commercial bank and staff recreational
facilities.Committee Note Subsystem under the Project Administration System; and development of facilities to monitor budget
commitments under the Bankwide Budget Monitoring and
Control System.

Other activities progressed generally in accordance with
the current three-year (1989-1991) Computer and Office
Automation Program approved by management and the
Board.

Budget

Internal Administrative Expenses for 1990 amounted
to $117.276 million against the original budget of
$120.052 million. The under-utilization of $2.776 million
is mainly due to savings arising from the non-use of

provisions related to the new headquarters building and the
lower-than-budgeted expenses for the Board of Directors,
staff salaries, relocation, consultant services and other administrative expenses, but partly offset by higher-thanbudgeted expenses for the Annual Meeting, staff benefits,
business travel and representation.

The Internal Administrative Expenses Budget for 1991,
as summarized in Appendix 1, is $135.280 million, representing an increase of $18.004 million over actual expenses
incurred in 1990, The increase is for: the full-year effect of
improvements in salaries and benefits; additional staff, consultant services, business travel and other overhead expenses
in support of the Bank’s operations; provisions for higher
expenses related to occupancy of the new headquarters
building; provisions for prospective price escalation; and
provision for general contingency.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ~ ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31: December 1990.and'31 December 1989

NOTE A- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencies. The
reporting currency is the United States doliar, and the
financial statements are expressed in thousands of current
United States dollars.

Valuation of Capital Stock

The capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the
Articles of Agreemeni Establishing the Bank (the Charter) “in
terms of United States dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1966" (the 1966 dollar) and the value of
“each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital
stock had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar (the Bank's unit of account} on the basis of its par
value in terms of gole. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the
rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar.
Since 1 Apri 1978, at'which time the Second Amendment to
the Articles of Agreement of the Internationa? Monetary Fund
(IMF} came into effect, currencies no longer have par values ini
terms of gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate
successor to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued
for purposes of these financial statements in terms of the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United
States dollars'as computed by the IMF, with each share valued
at SDR 10,000. :

As of 31 December 1990, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current ‘United States dollar was $1.42266 ($1.31416 —
1989) giving a value for each share of the Bank's capital
equivalent to. $14:226.60 ($13,141.60 ~ 1989). However,
the Bank could decide to fix the value of each share at
$12,063.50 based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the
United States dollar in terms of gold.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional
currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable
rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Income
and expense amounts are translated for each semi-monthly
period generally at the applicable rates of exchange at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments other than those relating to
maintenance of value of currency holdings (see Notes F and J),
are charged or credited to “Accurnulated iranslation
adjustments”. Exchange gains or losses on currency

CONTINUED

 

transactions among functional currencies are included in
income. Currency swaps made in connection with borrowings
are hedged by forward exchange commitments and,
accordingly, do not result in any net exchange gain or loss.

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized cost.
Gains and losses on sales of investmenis are measured by the
difference between average cost or arnortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales.

Loans

The Bank's loans have been made io or guaranteed dy
members or their governmenis, with the exception of loans to
the private sector, and have maturities ranging between 10 and 30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to. absorb
exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value.cf the
currencies which it has disbursed. The Bank has not stiffered
any loan losses to date and follows a policy of not taking part
in debt rescheduling agreements. It is the policy of the Bank to
place in non-accrual status all loans made to or guaranteed by
a member if principal, interest, or other charges-with respect
to any such joan are overdue by one year. Interest and other
charges on non-accruing loans are included in iricome. only to
the extent that paymenis have actualiy been received ‘by the
Bank.

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was. based
on a fixed lending rate system under which loans :carried
interest rates fixed at the time of ioan approval for the entire

life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, the Bank adopted:a ioe

poolbased variable lending rate system for those joats
approved on or after that date plus certain others at the”
option of the borrowers. :

For loans to the private sector, interest ‘is charged: at
negotiated rates.

Equity Investments

The Bank's equity investments are made in private enterprises *
jocated im developing member countries and include the
Bank's investment ir 1989 of $34,984,000 in Asian Eanes
and Investment Corporation Ltd. (FIC) |

Equity investments are reported at cost, net of allowance for
possible losses. Such allowance is determined annually based on management’s evaluation of potential losses in the equity
investments portfolio. :ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency
The currencies of contribuiing members are functional

and the financiai statements are expressed in thousands: of
current United States dollars. ,

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and amounts available for loan commitments
and advance payments on contributions are translated from
their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally
at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting
period. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each
semi-monthly period generally at the applicable rates of

exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice.

approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Translation adjustments relating to set-aside
resources (see Note F) are recorded as receivable from or
payable to Ordinary Capital Resources. Other translation
adjustments are charged or credited to "Accumulated

translation adjustments". Exchange gains or losses on currency
transactions among functional currencies are included in
revenue,

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized cost.

. Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the

difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales.

Loans>

Loans of the Fund are extended to eligible developing. member
countries, bear only a service charge and require repayment
over periods ranging from 35 to 40 years. The Fund requires
Borrowers to absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations
in the value of the currencies disbursed. The Fund has not
suffered any loan iosses to date and follows a policy of not
taking part in debt rescheduling agreements. It is the policy of

’ the Fund to place in non-accrual status all-loans made to
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States dollar, .

eligible developing member countries if principal. or ‘service
charges with respect to any such loan are overdue ‘by one
year. Service charges on non-accruing loans are included .in
income only to the extent that payments have actually been
received by the Fund.

Contributions

Contributions by member countries are included in. the
financial statements as amounts committed from the - date.
Instruments of Contribution are deposited and ~ related.
formalities are completed.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1990 and 31 December 1989

 

NOTE C - INVESTMENTS

As of 31 December 1990, the market value of investments
was $902,726,000 ($796,843,000 - 1989), including
investments not traded in the market {time deposits, etc.)
which were valued at their cost or amortized cost of
$768,165,000 ($601,637,000 - 1989). During the year
ended 31 December 1990, sales of investmenis resulted in a
“net loss of $21,000 ($53,000 - 1989). The annualized rate
of return on the average investments held during the year,
based on the portfolio held at the beginning and end of each
month, including realized gains and losses, was 10.40%
{9.89% - 1989}.

NOTE D - LOANS

Loans made to Viet Nam and Cambodia were placed in a
norraccrual status on 31 December 1990. The principal
outstanding at that date‘was $29,845,000 for Viet Nam of
which $5,196,000 was overdue and $1,303,000 for
Cambodia of which the entire amount was overdue. Placing
these loans in a non-accrual status resulied in a reduction in
revenue from loans for the year ended 31 December 1990 of
$3,411,000.

NOTE E ~ ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses include an administration charge
amounting to $54,307,000 ($44,975,000 - 1989). The
charge represents an apportionment. of ail administrative
expenses of the Bank (other than those appertaining directly
to ordinary operations and special operations} based on the
number of loans and equity investments approved for the
year.

NOTE F -.SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1 fi) of the
Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board of
Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the
unimpaired "paid-in" capital paid by members pursuani to
Article 6, paragraph 2 {a} and of the convertible currency
portion paid by members pursuant to Articlé 6; paragraph 2
{b) as of 28 April 1973, to be used as a part of the Special
Funds of the Bank. The capital so set aside was allocated and
transferred from the Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund
as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 "in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966 dollar).
Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar {the Bank’s unit
of account), on the basis of its par value in terms of gold.
From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this
basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came
into effect, currencies no longer have par values in terms of
gold. Pending the Bank’s selection of the appropriate
successor to the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has
been valued for purposes of the accornpanying financial
statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at
the value in current United States dollars as computed by the
IMF. As of 31 December 1990, the value of the SDR in terms
of the current United States dollar was $1.42266 ($1.31416
- 1989). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$67,732,000 ($62,567,000 - 1989). If the capital stock of
the Bank as of 31 December 1990 had been valued in terms
of $12,063.50 per share, Set-Aside Resources would have
been $57,434,000,Deloitte &

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 1990 and 31 December 1989

 

NOTE A - GENERAL

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when dapan and the Bank entered into a financial
arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an_ initial
contribution and the Bank became the administrator. Its
purpose is to help developing member countries of the Bank
restructure their economies and broaden the scope of
opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the
recycling of funds to developing member countries of the
Bank. The Bank may invest the proceeds of JSF pending
disbursement and use the income from such investments to
pay for direct and identifiable costs incurred in the
administration of JSF.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of JSF is the Japanese yen while the
reporting currency is the United States dollar. The financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United
States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities and unexpended balances are translated from
the functional currency to the reporting currency at the
applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Contributions committed have been translated at the
applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates received.
Revenue and expense amounts in Japanese yen are translated
for each semi-monthly periad at the applicable rates of
exchange at the beginning of each period; such practice
approximates the application of average rates in effect during
the period. Exchange gains or losses on currency transactions
between the Japanese yen and other currencies are charged
or credited to operations.

Investments

Investment securities are reported at cost or amortized cost.
Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the

difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales.

Equity Investments
Equity investments are reported at cost.
Contributions

Contributions by dapan are included in the financial
statements as amounts committed from the date indicated by

_ Japan that funds are expected to be made available,

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS".

Restatement of Certain Amounts

Certain 1989 amounts have been restated to conform to
1990 classifications.

was  $103,919,000 ($80,941,000 — 1989), including

which were valued at their cost or amortized cost of
$36,825,000 ($80,941,000 - 1989). The annualized rate of
return on the average investments held during the year, based
on the portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month
was 7.68% (5.32% ~ 1989),

NOTE D - SERVICES TO MEMBER COUNTRIES

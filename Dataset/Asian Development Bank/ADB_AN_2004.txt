Printed in Singapore.MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Of the many momentous events of 2004, the most tragic
was the massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean in the final
week of the year. The toll in lost lives and property was
staggering and will never be fully recorded. Overnight more
than 2 million were added to the 1.9 billion poor in the
region who live on less than $2 a day. Although our best
efforts can never compensate the survivors for their pain,
suffering, and loss of beloved family members and
friends, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and its

partners are determined to replace devastation and

 

despair with hope and confidence in the future while
continuing to pursue our vision of freeing all of Asia and
the Pacific from poverty.

Immediately following the disaster, ADB and its partners, the
World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the United
Nations, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation,
sent teams of experts to assess the extent of damage and to
develop plans for rehabilitation and reconstruction. ADB’s
financial contribution was initially set at $325 million. InASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

the months following the tsunami, ADB substantially
increased its financial commitment and continued to
work with its partners to address recovery needs in India,
Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka. ADB established the
Asian Tsunami Fund comprising $600 million in grant
resources for reconstruction efforts and identified a further
$175 million in funding from ongoing projects and
programs.

The challenges facing ADB and its partners in these
tsunami-affected countries are unprecedented. It is not
simply a question of replacing infrastructure. Restoring the
livelihoods of some of the world’s poorest will be an equally
complex task.

ADB’s response to the tsunami was guided by the new
Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Approved in 2004,
it emphasizes that rehabilitation after disasters involves
more than infrastructure and stresses that capacity building
and institutional strength to address disasters both before
and after they occur must be central to ADB’s assistance.

The tsunami response served to demonstrate ADB’s capacity
to act swiftly and effectively in times of crisis. This was also
evident in our response to the avian flu outbreak in
partnership with the World Health Organization, the Food
and Agriculture Organization and other agencies and in our
proactive approach to post-conflict reconstruction activities
in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste.

Several initiatives adopted in 2004 will allow ADB to
continue to enhance its development effectiveness. ADB
refined its poverty reduction strategy to achieve greater
results. Integral to this is ADB’s commitment to managing
for development results. The reform agenda inaugurated in
2004 is grounded in the managing for development results
framework and commits ADB to key reform initiatives to
reinforce its capabilities to help its developing member
countries achieve results.

The year also saw notable progress in other areas. The new
accountability mechanism became fully operational, and the
Operations Evaluation Department began reporting directly

to the Board of Directors. The successful replenishment of
the Asian Development Fund provided $7 billion in
concessional resources to assist the poorest developing
member countries reduce poverty over the next 4 years.

Other achievements of note included the adoption of the
knowledge management framework, the approval of a new
information systems and technology strategy, the review and
revision of several other major strategies, the development
of a public communications policy, and the approval of a
new human resource strategy.

These and many other initiatives help ensure that ADB is an
effective, dynamic development partner that is better able to
assist its developing members meet the challenges of an
ever-changing world. With the support and commitment of
the staff and that of all our members and partners, it is my
privilege to continue ADB’s work in support of peace and
prosperity for all in Asia and the Pacific.

As the development community works to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015 (see page 49),
it focuses on performance, development effectiveness, and the
need for management strategies to improve products, services,
results, and impact—that is, managing for development results
(MfDR). This is crucial in Asia and the Pacific where more than
half the world’s poor reside and where the effects of the
devastating tsunami in December are only beginning to be felt
and addressed. In 2004, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
therefore dedicated itself to improving the management of its

resources and the impact of its operations.

In November of 1999, ADB adopted a poverty reduction
strategy (PRS) that comprised three pillars—pro-poor,
sustainable economic growth; inclusive social development; and
good governance. A review of the PRS that began at the end
of 2003 concluded that the pillars are still relevant but
recommended that country support be more closely aligned
with national poverty reduction strategies, that monitoring
poverty should be more comprehensive, and that monitoring
performance should shift to MfDR in developing member
countries (DMCs) and should be closely linked to the MDGs.

As a result, all new country strategies and programs (CSPs) will
have a results framework that includes monitoring and that
links the constraints to poverty reduction identified in country
poverty assessments with the proposed program, desired
outcomes, and expected outputs with indicators for each
relevant pillar, sector, and thematic priority. To complement the
results framework, links between project outputs and sector
outcomes will be emphasized in sector road maps. The CSP for

Nepal prepared in 2004 was the first to follow the new format.

Recommended management reforms include (i) establishing an
MfDR unit; (ii) developing strategic and operational processes/
procedures for MfDR; (iii) mainstreaming MfDR throughout
ADB; (iv) improving human resource management systems and
processes and implementing the new human resource (HR)
strategy; (v) aligning operational policies, strategies, and
approaches with the PRS review and the Long-Term Strategic
Framework 2001-2015 (LTSF); and (vi) making capacity
development a thematic priority. In line with the overall MfDR
framework, a comprehensive, results-oriented monitoring and
evaluation system will be established at the project, sector and

thematic, country, and institutional levels.

To support adding capacity development as a thematic priority,

the knowledge management framework adopted in June aims

to put ADB’s considerable knowledge into a readily usable
form that is easily accessible to anyone who can log onto its
website. An extensive capital investment in information systems
and technology (information systems and technology strategy
for 2004-2009) will facilitate implementation.

To remain relevant in a region that is rapidly changing and to
achieve greater development impact, ADB adopted a reform
agenda on 14 June 2004 guided by the LTSF and the PRS
review. In fact, the internal changes and realignment outlined
in the review are the core of the agenda. It is subtitled,
“Development Effectiveness: Achieving Results Together.” The
agenda specifies 19 interrelated initiatives that will enhance
ADB's capability to manage its resources and activities to
ensure its products and services contribute to desired

development outcomes (see box on page 4).

Progress in 2004 was encouraging. Three initiatives were
completed: strengthening performance-based allocations,
establishing a results management unit, and conducting the
independent assessment of the 2002 reorganization of ADB.
Twelve of the remaining 16 will be completed in 2005, and the
rest will be implemented over the next 3 years pending the
allocation of appropriate financial resources and staff. In
addition, the new HR strategy was approved; its

implementation is crucial to the success of the reform agenda.

NEW AND REVISED POLICIES
AND PROCEDURES

To meet the needs of ADB’s development partners, the Board of
Directors approved several policy, financial, and administrative

papers in 2004 and reviewed a number of others.

In June, ADB approved a comprehensive disaster and emergency
assistance policy that will provide rehabilitation and
reconstruction assistance as well as assist DMCs with prevention
of, preparation for, and mitigation of the impact of future
disasters. It was developed after extensive consultations with
specialized agencies, civil society, nongovernment organizations,
and DMC governments. The integrated policy framework

(i) focuses on protective strategies; (ii) adopts a systematic
approach to disaster management including natural and manmade disasters and the aftermath of conflicts; (iii) mainstreams
disaster risk management as an integral part of development;
(iv) strengthens partnerships among development and specialized
organizations to improve the effectiveness of emergency aid as

no single agency can provide all the resources needed to cope2004 IN REVIEW: BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

 

 

PROFILE

The Asian Development Bank was established in 1966 through
a multilateral agreement ratified by 31 members. ADB's
current membership totals 63 of which 45 are in Asia and the
Pacific. ADB has its headquarters in the Philippines and offices
worldwide including resident missions in Afghanistan,
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, People’s Republic of China,
India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New
Guinea, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Viet
Nam. ADB also maintains a country office in the Philippines; a
regional mission for the South Pacific in Vanuatu; and a special
office in Timor-Leste. It has representative offices for Europe in
Frankfurt, Germany; for Japan in Tokyo; and for North America
in Washington, DC, United States. There is a subregional office
for the Pacific in Suva, Fiji Islands and a liaison and coordination
office for the Pacific in Sydney, Australia.

ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific free of poverty with better
living conditions and quality of life for all its inhabitants. The
strategic agenda focuses on pro-poor, sustainable economic
growth; inclusive social development; and governance for
effective policies and institutions with thematic priorities of
capacity development, environmental sustainability, gender and
development, private sector development, and regional
cooperation and integration (for more on ADB, see
www.adb.org).

 

with disasters; (v) uses resources more efficiently and effectively
to better support pre- and postdisaster activities; (vi) improves
organizational arrangements within ADB for planning,
implementing, and communicating effectively on disaster and
emergency assistance; and (vii) highlights that rehabilitation
involves more than replacing and upgrading infrastructure. The
policy further states that efforts will be made to decrease the
time required to approve rehabilitation projects so assistance will
be timely and effective. In line with the policy, immediately
following the tsunami disaster on 26 December, ADB created an

interdepartmental task force to coordinate rapid assistance.

Also in June, ADB approved Toward E-Development in Asia
and the Pacific: A Strategic Approach for Information and
Communication Technology (ISTS Il) to provide information
systems that support ADB’s core business activities, deliver the
knowledge management framework, institutionalize the partnership between ADB operations and information technology

(IT), and develop IT services that are secure and reliable. ISTS I

was formulated with guidance from the IT Steering Committee
chaired by the ADB Vice-President for finance and
administration. The committee monitored the development of
the strategy and determined priorities and sought input from

various stakeholders, including the Board of Directors.

To realize the recommendations made in the PRS review and to
effectively implement the reform agenda and the knowledge
management framework, in September ADB approved the HR
strategy. The goals are (i) to improve working and hiring
conditions and opportunities for career development for staff
at headquarters and in resident missions; (ii) to establish an
effective system to manage and reward performance; (iii) to
strengthen leadership and accountability; and (iv) to improve

channels of communication.

The Board of Directors endorsed in November Responding to
the Priorities of the Poor 2005-2009: A Pacific Strategy for the
Asian Development Bank. The strategy is unique at ADB in
that it covers all operations of the Pacific department. The
strategy adopted the two principal priorities of the poor as
identified in participatory assessments of hardship and poverty:
opportunities for cash incomes and improved access to basic
social services. Strategic objectives and key result areas are
consistent with ADB’s PRS and its commitment to the MDGs.
The focus is on improving the environment for the private
sector, reducing costs and inefficiencies in the economy,
providing basic social services, and achieving good governance.

ADB also reviewed its 1994 policy on confidentiality and
disclosure of information and its 1994 information policy and
strategy and prepared a new policy on public communications
in 2004. Under the new policy, which will be reviewed by the
Board of Directors in 2005, ADB will make more information
about its operations publicly available. In addition to updating
practices of disclosing and sharing information so that they
will be better suited to global communications, the policy
reinforces ADB’s standing as an accountable, transparent
public institution that actively seeks to share its considerable
knowledge. ADB’s stakeholders from the public, private, and
nonprofit sectors as well as its Board of Directors,
Management, and staff actively participated in writing the
policy through extensive consultations throughout the year.
Staff discussed the policy with the public in Bangalore; Beijing;
Bishkek; Dhaka; Hanoi; Jakarta; London; New Delhi; Ottawa;
Suva; Sydney; Tokyo; and Washington, DC in addition to
meeting with advocacy nongovernment organizations on several

occasions at ADB headquarters.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

The Board of Directors reviewed an information paper on the
implementation of the 2001 water policy which showed
encouraging progress in improving water services, conservation,
participation, and governance. Modest progress was made in
introducing integrated water resource management and in
improving regional cooperation, and limited progress was made
in promoting a national focus on water sector reforms.
Exemplary or good practice in implementing the water policy
was shown in 54% of water loans but in only 20% of technical
assistance projects. A comprehensive review of policy

implementation will be conducted in 2005.

Internal Initiatives
ADB’s focus on results and greater emphasis on impact and

outcomes were evident in several of its internal initiatives.

A change in the reporting structure for the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED) to allow for greater
independence of the evaluation function took effect in 2004
when OED began reporting directly to the Board of Directors
through the Development Effectiveness Committee (see
www.adb.org/OED/).

The accountability mechanism adopted at the end of 2003
became operational in 2004. The aim is to improve
development effectiveness, project quality, and transparency in
operations. Its two functions—consultation and compliance
review—provide for problem solving and for reporting alleged

violations of ADB policies and procedures, respectively.

The knowledge management framework adopted in June lays

out five specific outputs for the next 4 years.

© The organizational culture of ADB will be more supportive
of knowledge sharing. Staff will be empowered and
encouraged to fully participate in implementing the
framework.

© Knowledge products and services will be managed more
effectively.

© Business processes and information technology will be
updated. A special committee will work to improve access to
information repositories, storage processes, and systems to
make data searches less cumbersome. Another initiative is
mapping expertise within ADB through a skill and
knowledge database of staff and expanded consultant
profiles. Tapping the knowledge of experienced colleagues
will promote efficiency and add value to ADB operations.

¢ ADB staff will share knowledge through well-functioning
“communities of practice.”

© Knowledge sharing with external stakeholders and other

parties will be expanded.

A new sector and thematic classification system took effect on
1 July. Classifying loans, projects, and technical assistance by
sector and theme is important for tracking allocations of
resources and the purpose and impact of operations. The
classification ADB used before July 2004 was established in
1984 and was out of date. In June an interdepartmental
working group updated the list to reflect the PRS and the
LTSF. More than 2,000 loans and 5,300 technical assistance

 

THE REFORM AGENDA

Together, the following 19 initiatives will
enhance ADB's capability to manage its
resources and activities to ensure its
products and services contribute to
desired outcomes. Three were completed
in 2004, 12 will be achieved in 2005, and
4 will be implemented over the next

3 years. The Reform Coordination
Committee established on 23 July 2004
coordinates implementation, monitors
progress, and communicates with staff
and stakeholders.

activities approved since 1966 were then reclassified. The
revised definitions of themes and sectors are broadly consistent
with those used by the United Nations and the World Bank

and enable comparison of resource allocation patterns.

The Business Continuity Management Steering Committee in
conjunction with the Office of Administrative Services set up an
in-country facility to minimize disruption to business operations
and to reduce its impact. Continuity plans covering all
operations will be developed and tested in 2005. The plans will
guide operations from the initial declaration of a disaster or
crisis through recovery and restoration of processes and
systems. Establishing an offshore recovery facility will be

evaluated.

DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIPS

ADB continued to provide support for global partnerships to
(i) enhance joint efforts with agencies such as the United
Nations, other international finance institutions, and bilateral
donors; (ii) contribute to global forums; and (iii) take part in
combined efforts to develop indicators and other monitoring

and evaluation instruments.

For more effective operations, ADB continued to delegate
responsibility to the field with the opening of new resident
missions in Baku, Azerbaijan and Bangkok, Thailand; a
subregional office in Suva, Fiji Islands; and the establishment
of a liaison and coordination office for the Pacific in Sydney,

Australia.

During the Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX negotiations in
2003-2004, ADB outlined a systematic approach to implementing MfDR at the country and institutional levels and as part
of a global partnership. This will mean greater selectivity, a
stronger orientation toward results, better alignment with DMC
priorities and systems, and greater cooperation with other
agencies. Donors endorsed an ADF IX program of $7 billion for
1 January 2005-31 December 2008 plus additional amounts
for financing foregone interest on grants. This is significantly
higher than the $5.65 billion agreed during ADF VIII.

A cooperation fund in support of MfDR was established in July
2004 with an initial grant from Canada complemented by a
contribution from the Netherlands. The fund totals about

$1.7 million and will be used to pilot small-scale DMC
initiatives that promote results-based approaches and

techniques in public sector management.

Indicative of its active engagement in regional and international
issues was ADB’s support for and participation in the following.
e ADB cosponsored two MfDR regional workshops: one in
Bangkok with Japan and a second in Bishkek with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
United Kingdom’s Department for International

evelopment.

© ADB chaired the Multilateral Development Bank Working

with the World Health Organization and the United Nations
Environment Programme with participation of key
institutions from the 10 members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), People’s Republic of China
PRC), Japan, Republic of Korea, and Mongolia.

¢ ADB established the Japan Fund for Public Policy Training
(JFPPT) in March 2004 as a trust fund to enhance capacity
building for public policy management in DMCs. The JFPPT

 

rogram will focus on regional economies in transition. The
aim is to arrange partnerships with local academic entities
and to acquire assistance from world-class public policy
institutions to jointly develop and conduct high quality
training programs, primarily in local languages. The training
program curricula should cover a wide range of public policy
issues for government officials, including analytical skills in
planning and implementing public economic policy. The
Asian Development Bank Institute (ADB Institute) was
designated to administer the JFPPT program. Viet Nam was
selected for pilot activities. On 30 March 2004, Japan made
an initial contribution to the trust fund in the amount of
905 million yen ($8.58 million). In 2004, the JFPPT unit
conducted two demonstration courses, entered into
agreements with local institutions in Viet Nam, and began
establishing a training facility in Hanoi.

© ADB established a trust fund to strengthen assistance to its
DMCs in fighting money laundering and the financing of
terrorism. The Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and
Financial Security Initiative was set up through initial
contributions by the governments of Australia, Japan, and
United States. The fund will support technical assistance to
enhance port security (including airports, cargo ports, and
containers) and to combat money laundering and financing
of terrorism in developing countries.

growing sovereign and corporate bond markets in the region.

Supported by ADB and financed by the Government of
Japan, AsianBondsOnline is part of the ASEAN+3 Asian

mature bond markets in the region.

© ADB joined the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) in adopting a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS
in a report entitled “Asia-Pacific’s Opportunity: Investing to
Avert an HIV/AIDS Crisis.” The report suggests that if
prompt action is not taken, by the end of the decade
10 million more people could be infected with HIV, and the
economic costs of the virus could have risen to $17.5 billion
annually. The result would be millions more people thrown
into poverty. ADB has already earmarked $140 million from
its ADF as grant money for combating HIV.

¢ ADB and the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) signed a
revised memorandum of understanding in May that follows
up on commitments they made at the Monterrey conference
and Johannesburg summit to achieve the MDGs. The new,
results-oriented agreement emphasizes regional cooperation,
capacity development, protecting the environment, and
poverty reduction.

© In response to the rapidly increasing number of road
accidents, ASEAN and ADB initiated a regional road safety
program with input and participation from a wide range of
public and private sector stakeholders. The 10 members each
prepared 5-year national road safety action plans and will

implement them cooperatively. They also prepared a regional

road safety strategy and action plan to monitor

implementation of the national plans, to develop capacity,

and to provide training.

GOVERNING STRUCTURE

ADB's highest policy-making body is its Board of Governors
which comprises one representative from each ADB member. The
Governors meet annually and elect the 12 members of the Board
of Directors who serve 2-year terms. Each Director appoints an
Alternate. The President is elected by the Board of Governors for
a 5-year term and serves as Chairperson of the Board of
Directors. The President manages ADB assisted by four VicePresidents and a Managing Director General. (For a current list

of Governors and Directors, see appendixes 2 and 3.)

In August, ADB President Tadao Chino tendered his resignation.
During his 6 years as President, Mr. Chino initiated and
oversaw the adoption and implementation of policies and
initiatives that will guide ADB's operations for many years to
come. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its
overarching goal. Based on this strategy, negotiations to
replenish the Asian Development Fund (ADF VIII) were
successfully completed in 2000. That same year, ADB adopted a
private sector development strategy aimed at fueling economic
growth and creating more jobs. In 2001, ADB achieved another
historic milestone with the adoption of its long-term strategic
framework to guide directions and operations and to help its
DMCs and the region achieve the MDGs by 2015. The
reorganization of ADB in 2002, together with its resident
mission policy, provided an effective institutional response to
these objectives bringing ADB closer to its DMCs. The2004 IN REVIEW: BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

 

successful completion of ADF IX negotiations in 2004 led to
ADB’s reform agenda which provides another framework for

enhancing development effectiveness.

In November 2004, the Board of Governors unanimously
elected Haruhiko Kuroda as ADB President to take office in
February 2005. He was Special Advisor to the Cabinet of the
Japanese Prime Minister and Japan's former Vice Minister of

Finance for International Affairs.

The Board of Directors met formally on 43 occasions and held
30 informal meetings in 2004 including briefings, discussion
seminars, and presentations. In their informal meetings, the
Directors examined a range of issues, including regional
cooperation, private sector development, gender action

programs, and knowledge management.

Board Committees
For membership of the Board of Directors standing committees

and working committee, see Appendix 4.

Audit Committee

The committee identified and reviewed a range of issues within
its mandate representing a broad cross section of ADB
operations and activities. These included ADB Institute and
private sector operations focusing on internal controls,
financial reporting, and internal and external audits. The
decline in ordinary capital resources (OCR) net income due to

loan prepayments was a concern.

The audit recommendation implementation report and the
report of the independent auditors enabled the committee to
monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of controls, including
backup procedures, as part of the business continuity plan.
Among other controls reviewed were measures taken to ensure
accountability, cost-effectiveness, and authorization for mission
travel. The committee also continued to monitor the
implementation of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 133
and parallel reporting for derivative instruments in cooperation
with multilateral development banks (MDBs) and independent
auditors. Of particular significance was the need to assign fair
values and to report embedded derivatives separately in
compliance with FAS 133 and generally accepted accounting

principles in the United States.

The committee oversaw the selection of outside auditors for
2005-2008 which entailed evaluating financial and technical

proposals. PriceWaterhouseCoopers was reappointed.

The offices of the Auditor General, the Secretary, and the
General Counsel and the committee reviewed the Audit
Committee's terms of reference. In line with the priorities in
other MDBs and with the reform agenda, the committee
supported institution-wide coordination of risk management by
establishing a focal point in a neutral department reporting to

Management to be implemented early in 2005.

The committee also reviewed and endorsed the 2004 work

program of the Office of the Auditor General (OAG), the audit
recommendation implementation report, and the annual report
of the Anticorruption Unit' of OAG with particular focus on staff

accused of fraud and sanctions against firms and individuals.

Budget Review Committee

Prior to 2004, the committee met once a year to review the
annual budget proposal and once or twice a year to review
special topics such as capital expenditure programs. To involve
the committee more extensively in the budget, it met quarterly,
attended a series of meetings in November reviewing the
proposed budget, and met on an ad hoc basis to review and
discuss issues with significant cost and budget implications.
Another new procedure was the committee’s review of the draft
budget in November. Previously, members received the budget
after it had been finalized. This change required early
completion of the work program and budget framework and of

budget preparation.

As the new accountability mechanism and OED now closely
support functions of the Board of Directors, the committee
decided that their expenses should be presented as subcategories of the budget for the Board of Directors rather than
as operational expenses. The committee also agreed that
expenses in the three subcategories would not be fungible: any

cost overruns can be met only from general contingencies.

Three special meetings were held to discuss the proposed
information systems and technology strategy and capital
expenditure requirements for 2004-2009. The deliberations
facilitated the Board of Directors’ approval of the strategy and
investment proposal. In September, the committee reviewed the
2004 midyear budget review and recommended adopting a
phased approach in implementing some form of activity-based
costing. The committee also recommended approval of
proposed 2005 budgets for internal administrative expenses and
capital expenditures. The committee was updated on OCR and
was informed that changes in loan terms and charges made to

improve the competitiveness and marketability of ADB’sASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

The committee reviewed the ADB Institute’s work program and
the proposed budget of $14.4 million and met with the dean
and the chief economist and representatives from the Regional
Economic Monitoring Unit. The increase in resources allocated
to capacity building and training was noted, and the need for
further coordination among ADB’s three research arms was
stressed. The committee recommended approval of the ADB

Institute’s proposed 2005 budget.

Inspection Committee

An inspection of the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project
(Stage Ill) in Pakistan, previously authorized by the Board of
Directors, commenced in December 2003 when a panel of four
was drawn from the roster of experts. The panel submitted a
draft report in April 2004 that was forwarded to Management,
the relevant ADB Director, and the requesters for comment.
Management contested a number of the panel’s findings. The
panel's final report was submitted to the inspection committee
in June 2004. It held that ADB had breached a number of
operational policies and procedures in the planning/
implementation of the project and made recommendations,
including one to bring the project back into compliance. The
committee consulted Management and the relevant Director
and prepared a report for the Board that outlined the process
that had been followed, reported the views various parties had
expressed to it about the panel’s recommendations, and
forwarded the panel’s report to the Board with a
recommendation? for approval. The committee further

recommended that the Compliance Review Panel should

 

monitor the implementation of the Board's decision under the
new Accountability Mechanism. The Board accepted this
recommendation in August 2004. The inspection committee

then ceased to operate.

Compliance Review Committee

The Board of Directors approved the new accountability
mechanism in May 2003; it replaced the previous inspection
function. The former inspection committee was restructured as
the Board Compliance Review Committee (BCRC) when the
mechanism took effect in December 2003 though the
inspection committee continued to meet in 2004 to resolve an
inspection that began in 2003. BCRC clears the Compliance
Review Panel's proposed terms of reference and time frame for
conducting compliance reviews and reviews the panel's draft

reports on implementing remedial actions approved by the2004 IN REVIEW: BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

 

Board before they are finalized by the Panel. The Office of
the Compliance Review Panel acts as the secretariat to
BCRC. BCRC met twice in 2004, once in March to review
and approve operating procedures, and once in July to
approve the report on its first 6 months of operation (to

become its annual report).

Development Effectiveness Committee

To enhance its independence and effectiveness, in 2004 OED
began reporting directly to the Board of Directors through the
Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC). OED now is fully
responsible for the content and recommendations in its reports.
Management’s role changed from approving to responding to
recommendations made in evaluations, and the Board of
Directors, through DEC, is directly responsible for the quality
and independence of evaluations and for monitoring

Management action on recommendations.

In its new role, DEC supervised the selection of a director
general for OED and with the President nominated a candidate
for Board approval. For the first time, the committee reviewed
OED’s work program in a 3-year time frame (2005-2007). DEC
submitted OED’s 2005 budget for Board approval and

encouraged OED to gradually increase and broaden its studies.

DEC discussed more country and sector OED evaluations (see
box at right) in 2004 than in previous years, commended the
increase in content in OED’s two annual reports, and identified
lessons for sustaining successful performance and for improving
development effectiveness. The annual report to the Board of
Directors included assessments of actions taken on committee
recommendations for 2002-2003, the annual report on loan
and technical assistance for 2003, and the annual review of
evaluation activities in 2003. Evaluations of ADB operations in

2004 were judged to be both satisfactory and efficient.

The positive 5-year trend in the performance of public sector
loans continued with the proportion of projects at risk in
2002-2003 significantly lower than that in 1999-2001 though
there was also room for improvement. The committee recommended (i) pilot-testing annual reporting of an aggregate,
results-based measure of the portfolio’s performance;

(ii) gaining a better understanding of reduced net resource
transfers; (iii) setting mandatory project readiness criteria to
reduce delays; (iv) specifying measures of effectiveness in
private sector operations; (v) accelerating delegation to resident
missions; (vi) allowing more flexibility in budget and staff

reallocation to increase supervision of projects at risk; and

(vii) making project implementation schedules more realistic.
The committee once again recommended that Management
specify a concrete action plan for improving oversight of the
technical assistance portfolio, including adopting a more
strategic, results-based approach to resource allocation, and
placed high priority on recommendations made in OED’s
annual review to make technical assistance evaluations more
discriminating and results-based so that lessons can be applied
more effectively. Lessons from countries and sectors should be
incorporated into new CSPs and sector strategies, and lessons
from policy evaluations should be considered in policy reviews.
In the future, annual reviews of evaluations should have a

thematic focus.

Working Group on the Annual Report for 2004

The Board Working Group worked closely with Management
and staff and set the general direction for the 2004 annual
report. This year’s report demonstrates how ADB is optimizing
its resources and improving its institutional effectiveness
through the reform agenda, how it is applying its policies, how
it is assisting its DMCs to achieve the MDGs, and how it is

moving the poverty reduction agenda forward.

37™ ANNUAL MEETING

At the 37" annual meeting on Jeju Island, Republic of Korea
from 15 to 17 May 2004, ADB’s Board of Governors welcomed
the establishment of a results-based management unit,
stressed the need to focus on implementing the action plan for
managing for development results, and requested that resultsbased country strategies be aligned with national poverty
reduction strategies. In addition the Governors did the
following:

* pointed to the region's extensive physical and social
infrastructure needs for sustainable economic growth and
encouraged ADB to work closely with governments and the
private sector to meet these needs;

* stressed that ADB's private sector operations need to be
closely aligned with country strategies and programs and
requested ADB to support small and medium-sized
enterprises and address critical financial issues such as
money laundering and remittances;

* requested ADB to provide continued support for regional
cooperation in trade and investment and for improving
financial intermediation while appreciating ADB's current
efforts to issue local currency bonds and its use of partial
credit guarantees;

* emphasized the key role of education in mobilizing the
productive potential of the poor, noted the importance of
narrowing the digital divide to reduce income inequality, and
requested more support to develop the knowledge-based
economy;

* welcomed ADB's initiatives to improve its development
effectiveness;

* expressed satisfaction with the ADF IX replenishment and
requested ADB to pursue efficient and effective use of these
resources as well as other prudent efforts to mobilize
internal resources into the ADF.

The annual meeting was attended by around 2,500 participants,
including representatives from multilateral and bilateral
institutions, members of the global financial community, and civil
society. The 38" annual meeting will be held in Istanbul, Turkey.

 

FINANCING OPERATIONS

Funding

The main instruments for providing help to ADB’s DMCs are
policy dialogue, loans, technical assistance, grants, guarantees,
and equity investments (see pages 11-15). ADB offers a range of

modalities and terms for loans aimed at improving performance.

About 76.5% of cumulative lending comes from OCR from
three distinct sources: private placements and capital markets
in the form of borrowing, paid-in capital provided by
shareholders, and accumulated retained income (reserves) that

provides a buffer for risks.

Loans are also provided from Special Funds. The ADF offers
loans on concessional terms to members with low per capita
gross national product and weak debt-repayment capacity. It is
the only MDB concessional fund dedicated exclusively to
economic and social development in the region. The ADF is
financed by periodic, voluntary contributions from donors. A
major constraint in 2003 was the level of available resources for
concessional lending and technical assistance, a situation that
might potentially jeopardize ADB’s ability to deliver its program.
Donor members met on four occasions from October 2003 to
May 2004 to replenish the fund and endorsed an ADF IX
program of $7 billion for 1 January 2005-31 December 2008
plus additional amounts for financing foregone interest on
grants. This is significantly higher than the $5.7 billion agreed
during ADF VIII. Donors pledged new, shared contributions of
$3.2 billion plus additional, voluntary contributions; $3.7 billion
will be provided from internal resources. ADF IX grants will
assist countries making the transition from conflict to peace and
stability, will help combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious
diseases, and will support priority technical assistance. ADF IX
includes a first-ever contribution from the PRC and renewed
support from Malaysia.

Other Special Funds are the Technical Assistance Special Fund,
the Japan Special Fund, and the ADB Institute Special Fund.
ADB also manages and administers additional funds: the Japan
Scholarship Program, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction,
and the Japan Fund for Information and Communication
Technology. It also channels grants provided by bilateral donors
to support technical assistance and soft components of loans.
In recent years, thematic trust funds focusing on gender and
development, governance, poverty reduction, water, energy, and
the environment were established to support technical

assistance operations and selected components of loan projects.

Technical assistance funded through grants or loans helps
maximize ADB’s development impact. Most technical assistance
grants are used for preparing projects and supporting advisory
activities in areas such as law and policy reform, strengthening
fiscal policies and procedures, good governance, capacity

building, and natural resource management.2004 IN REVIEW: BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ REPORT

 

ADB has a triple-A credit rating’ and actively mobilizes
financial resources through its cofinancing operations,
tapping official, commercial, and export credit sources.
Assistance to its DMCs creates an enabling environment for
private sector development. ADB also directly finances
private sector projects to assist commercial investors and
lenders. (For more on ADB financial management, see
www.adb.org/About/fnncemgt.asp.)

Financial Resources

Authorized capital stock amounted to $54.2 billion, and
subscribed capital stood at $54.2 billion. ADB raised long-term
funds totaling about $1.6 billion, of which $1.0 billion were
raised through a global public offering. Gross income
amounted to $1.4 billion, $1.0 billion of which were generated
from the loan portfolio, $297.3 million from the investment
portfolio, and $39.4 million from other sources of which

$29.7 million came from equity investment operations

($10.5 million from dividends and $30.4 million from gains
realized on the sale of equity investments offset by

$11.2 million in other income that included ADB’s share of
losses in net income of the Asian Finance and Investment
Corporation Ltd.). ADB’s Special Funds are the ADF with 2004
committed resources amounting to $1.1 billion, the Technical
Assistance Special Fund of $56.4 million, the Japan Special
Fund totaling $28.6 million, and the ADB Institute Special
Fund of $13.1 million.

Loans
Total lending approved in 2004 for public and private sectors
amounted to $5.3 billion for 80 loans to 64 projects. This was

lower than 2003 lending because of decreased lending to
Bangladesh, PRC, India, and Pakistan. The average loan size
in 2004 was $66.0 million, compared with $72.0 million in
2003. Twenty DMCs and one regional project received loans.
A total of $3.6 billion was disbursed. Of this, $2.4 billion
(68%) were for public sector project loans. The rest was for
public sector program and sector loans, and private sector

loans.

Of the total lending, loans with government guarantees were
over $4.9 billion for 58 projects comprising $3.7 billion for
27 loans from OCR and $1.2 billion for 47 loans from the
concessional ADF. Fourteen were policy-based programs
amounting to $1.1 billion representing 23% of total public
sector lending. Of program lending, $815.0 million for 7 loans
or 73% of the total came from OCR and $306.4 million for
9 loans or 27% from the ADF. Policy-based programs support
DMC efforts to improve policy, institutional, and investment
environments and to help meet short-term adjustment costs.
Lending to the private sector without government guarantee
using OCR amounted to $346.9 million.

The largest DMC borrowers in 2004 were the PRC and India
receiving $1.3 billion or 24% each of the total. Other top
borrowers were Pakistan ($709 million or 13%) and the
Philippines ($446 million or 8%). The transport and
communications sector received the largest share of lending
at $2,030.9 million (38%) followed by energy $761.8 million
(14%), and law, economic management, and public policy
$584.4 million (11%) (see tables 1—5 in the Statistical

Technical Assistance

A total of 323 technical assistance grants amounting to
about $196.6 million was approved in 2004. Of those, $46.2
million were for project preparation; $108.1 million were for
advisory purposes; and $42.3 million were for regional
activities such as conferences, research, studies, and training.
Of the total amount for technical assistance, $79.9 million
were from the Technical Assistance Special Fund,

$39.5 million were from the Japan Special Fund, and the
remaining $77.2 million came from other multilateral and
bilateral sources. The largest recipient of country-specific
technical assistance (excluding regional technical assistance)
was Pakistan at $28.9 million (15%), followed by Indonesia,
PRC, and Afghanistan.

Excluding regional technical assistance, the sector distribution
was as follows: law, economic management, and public policy

Cofinancing and Guarantee Operations
ADB’s active coordination with its development and financing
partners and continuing proactive approach to cofinancing
assisted its DMCs in obtaining additional financial resources
from bilateral and multilateral funding agencies, as well as
from commercial sources. Maximizing the development impact
of its assistance programs by identifying cofinancing
opportunities that directly complement ADB projects has been
the cornerstone of ADB's cofinancing and guarantee
operations. In achieving this objective, ADB continued to
involve its DMCs in identifying the best financing solutions for
public and private sector projects and programs, specifically the

use of its credit enchancement products (see www.adb. org/

cofinancing/).

As part of its efforts to diversify cofinancing sources and to
foster financial partnerships, ADB participated in several
international forums such as the Coordination Group of
Arab, Islamic, and Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ (OPEC) Development Institutions; the Round Table
on Trust Funds and Cofinancing of the Inter-American
Development Bank; and the Berne Union General Meeting.
New product initiatives included the Trade Facilitation
Program, in which ADB entered into risk-sharing agreements
with commercial banks to help promote international trade
in the region. The program involved 51 leading international
and regional cofinancing banks that were designated as

“founding partners.”

Cofinancing and guarantee operations in 2004 amounted to
about $2.4 billion. This represented approximately 46% of
ADB's total lending of $5.3 billion. Thirty-three loan projects
in 14 DMCs received cofinancing. The PRC received the largest
amount ($1.0 billion), primarily from its domestic financial
institutions, followed by India at $811.0 million, and Viet Nam
at $298.0 million (see Table 6 in the Statistical Annex).

Since 1970, cofinancing and guarantee operations have
mobilized a cumulative total of $43.0 billion providing
additional resources for 669 ADB-assisted loan projects and
programs. The cumulative total comprises $23.4 billion from
official sources and $19.6 billion from commercial sources. The
energy sector accounted for $18.2 billion or 42% followed by
transport and communications ($10.3 billion or 24%), industry
and trade ($3.7 billion or 9%), multisector ($3.2 billion or 4%),
and other sectors ($7.7 billion or 21%).

Resource Transfers

The net transfer of resources to ADB from its DMCs decreased
to $2.1 billion in 2004, compared with $5.3 billion in 2003.
There was a net inflow of $2.6 billion ($6.0 billion in 2003) to
ADB from OCR borrowers/investors, mainly from prepayments
of $2.8 billion in 2004 ($5.9 billion in 2003) of OCR poolbased loans. However, net transfers from ADB to ADF
borrowers decreased from $640.8 million in 2003 to $468.5
million in 2004 (see tables 26 and 27 in the Statistical Annex).

Loan disbursements in 2004 totaled $3.6 billion comprising
92.9% of the target for the year. Of the total, OCR
disbursements were $2.5 billion or 70% and ADF disbursements
were $1.1 billion or 30% (see tables 7, 8, and 14 in the

Statistical Annex).

Loan service payments reached $5.6 billion in 2004, compared
with $9.1 billion in 2003. The decrease was mainly because of
lower prepayments ($2.8 billion in 2004). In 2004, the four
largest net resource transfers from ADB were to Viet Nam,
Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Uzbekistan (see tables 26 and 27 in

the Statistical Annex).

Private Sector Operations

ADB ended 2004 with a total of about $807.2 million in
approved assistance in the private sector. This represents a 49%
increase over 2003 assistance of $542.7 million. The approved
interventions comprise 12 equity investments of $185.0 million,
loans of $346.9 million for six projects, a partial credit
guarantee of $65.3 million, a political risk guarantee of

$10.0 million, and a cross-currency swap with the Philippines
of up to $200.0 million (see tables 9-12 in the Statistical
Annex). ADB’s proposed loan and equity investment will
mobilize funding from other sources leveraging ADB’s own
funds by 5.08 times.

Since ADB’s first private sector investment in 1983, it has
approved 175 projects with a cumulative amount of $4.3 billion

cumulative equity and loan approvals of $2.8 billion have
catalyzed a total of $23.4 billion in funding for private sector
projects leveraging ADB’s investments by a ratio of 7.3 times.
Cumulative disbursements for equity investments and loans

amounted to $1.8 billion.

As of 31 December 2004, the overall private sector exposure
amounted to $1.5 billion and consisted of $485.3 million in
equity investment, loans of $654.7 million, and guarantees of
$322.9 million. The bulk of ADB’s private sector exposure is
infrastructure projects with a total of $746.9 million in
exposure, followed by investment funds and financial
institutions at $582.1 million, with the balance accounted for

by other sectors at $133.9 million.

The outstanding private sector exposures are interventions
largely to India (16.7%), Sri Lanka (14.3%), Bangladesh
(13.4%), PRC (10.6%), and Thailand (10.4%). Regional projects
account for roughly 13.2% of total exposure.

During the year, ADB actively sought the full and partial
divestments of equity shareholdings in 21 project companies,
freeing up $18.2 million of capital for new investments. Loan
repayments, including prepayments, amounted to $82.2 million
at the end of the year. Total disbursements during the year

amounted to $151.1 million.

As a matter of good risk management, ADB sets aside a general
provision of 8% of the total outstanding healthy portfolio,
excluding projects with specific provisions and investments that
are marked-to-market. The general provision as of 31 December
2004 was approximately $44.5 million with the total specific

THE CHANGING FACE
OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY

Building Financial Systems for the Poor

 

THE CHALLENGE

Despite significant progress in poverty reduction in the last
decade, Asia is still home to a majority of the world’s poor. If
the $1-a-day poverty yardstick is used, it is estimated that over
690 million poor people live in the region. This constitutes
approximately 138 million households. If the yardstick of $2 a
day is used, about 1.9 billion in some 380 million households
are poor according to the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB)
recent estimates.' The tsunami disaster in South and Southeast
Asia in December 2004 may have increased the number of poor

by at least another 2 million.

Microfinance is an effective development tool for poverty
reduction for the simple reason that financial services enable
poor and low-income households to take advantage of
economic opportunities, to build assets, and to reduce their
vulnerability to external shocks that adversely affect their living
standards. It is now recognized that precisely because they do
not have much money, poor and low-income households need
financial services even more than other households do. The
stark reality is, however, that over 200 million poor and low
income households in Asia may not have access to services asSPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

 

country studies by ADB and others indicate that the
microfinance outreach of formal and semiformal institutions is
very limited. ADB's vision is a region free of poverty; excluding
the majority of the population from access to financial services
is not at all consistent with this vision. Expanding access to
financial services is critical for eliminating poverty and for

realizing the Millennium Development Goals.

Recent estimates by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor
(CGAP) indicate that microfinance institutions in Asia have
about 41 million loan accounts and 98 million deposit
accounts.” In addition, alternative financial institutions (AFls)
with a social mission such as postal savings banks, rural
development banks, and cooperatives also provide microfinance
services although it is difficult to estimate the number of poor
households they serve. Most of these providers do not, however,
offer the broader range of services such as money transfers,
insurance, and payment services that poor people demand.
Financial services cannot function in isolation as a magic bullet
to lift people out of poverty, but the close relationship between
financial services and poverty reduction provides strong
justification for putting financial systems for the poor at the
center of the development agenda. It is for this reason that

CGAP is working to build such systems (see box at right).

The microfinance industry has been evolving over the last

3 decades. In the early 1980s, it was dominated by
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) that experimented with
innovative programs and attempted to address what they
perceived as the failure of markets and governments to provide
financial services for the poor. They were heavily dependent on
external grant funding. In fact, ADB’s first microfinance
project supported NGO microfinance institutions in the
Philippines. Some of these NGO operations became flagship
programs. Grameen Bank in Bangladesh is perhaps the best
known, and BRAC has become a giant in the industry not only
in Bangladesh but also globally.’ Their impressive results
generated a great deal of interest in microfinance in the

broader development community.

Despite the successes of these and similar institutions, the
majority of the poor is still compelled to rely on informal
sources of finance or on self-finance neither of which allows
them to take full advantage of economic opportunities. High
rates of interest on credit in informal markets—often in excess
of 120% per annum—cripple incentives to invest in productive
activities, and self-finance does not allow poor households to

take advantage of new technology. Closing this wide gap

between the massive potential demand for and the supply of
institutional financial services for the poor on a sustainable

basis is the central challenge of developing financial services.

Like most other funding agencies, ADB has supported
microfinance for many years. From 1988 to 1999, ADB
approved 14 microfinance projects totaling $260.10 million,
13 projects with microfinance components valued at about
$106.79 million, and 45 technical assistance projects for about
$24.42 million. Recognizing that the industry landscape has
changed over the years, ADB began to formulate a
microfinance development strategy in 1999 that was approved
in May 2000 (see box on the next page). The strategy provides
a consistent and comprehensive framework and guides ADB’s

microfinance operations including policy dialogue with

 

THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP
TO ASSIST THE POOR

The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) is a
consortium of 27 multilateral and bilateral development
agencies and 2 private development agencies working together
to build financial systems for the poor people in developing
countries. CGAP’s vision is a world where poor people are
considered legitimate clients of their countries’ financial
systems. To achieve its vision, CGAP provides public and private
development agencies, financial service providers, and
governments a range of services that includes advice, standards
and good practices, training, and knowledge. Because of its
unique structure and focus on building sustainable financial
systems for the poor, CGAP has become an important platform
for generating global consensus on standards and good
practices and serves as a resource center and advisory group
for the microfinance community around the world.

CGAP has been working to develop a wide variety of financial
institutions with a broad range of demand-driven financial
services, to improve financial transparency, to enhance the
policy and regulatory framework, and to improve donor
effectiveness. The Microfinance Donor Peer Reviews launched
in 2002 were a major initiative to improve donor procedures,
practices, and systems.

CGAP has a comprehensive website (www.cgap.org) to
communicate with the global microfinance community and
member agencies. ADB has been a member of CGAP since its
inception in 1995. In 2001, ADB provided regional technical
assistance to extend CGAP’s poverty outreach initiatives and has
played an active role in the peer reviews.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

developing member countries. It also articulates to stakeholders
ADB’s firm determination to support sustainable microfinance

in the region.

After the strategy was adopted, ADB’s assistance shifted from
providing support for narrowly defined microcredit projects to
building financial systems for the poor. From 2000 to 2004,

10 microfinance loan projects totaling $350.80 million and

16 projects with microfinance components of about

$131.02 million were approved. ADB also provided financial
assistance to 7 governments to prepare microfinance projects
and for 21 advisory technical assistance projects for capacity
building at various levels in 12 countries. The tsunami disaster
further reinforced the need for an inclusive financial system
that responds to the demands of the low-income segments of
the population. In addition to its heavy death toll, the tsunami
destroyed the livelihoods of over 300,000 households, and poor
households were the hardest hit. Restoring these livelihoods will
necessitate an innovative combination of grant assistance and
special financial service schemes tailor-made to meet the needs

of the survivors.

Global perspectives on microfinance are changing. Even the
meaning of the term “microfinance” has altered. According to
CGAP,’ as recently as a few years ago, it meant, “... a credit
methodology that employs effective collateral substitutes to
deliver and recover short-term, working capital loans to
microentrepreneurs.” Today, the term encompasses a broad
spectrum of financial services that includes not only microcredit
but also savings, insurance, and money transfers. Perspectives
on the target group for microfinance have also expanded in
recent years to include low-income men, women, and children

and the poorest of the poor. The inclusion of the last group

seems to have been influenced by the increasing recognition of
the link between microfinance and achieving the Millennium
Development Goals. Another significant change is that
microfinance services are no longer considered a niche market
activity that should be confined largely to the development
community and carried out solely by specialized microfinance
institutions. Today, it is believed that if microfinance is to
achieve its full potential, it must be fully integrated into a
developing country’s financial system with access to vast
amounts of human, physical, and financial resources and

management know-how.

A paradigm shift toward market-based approaches to poverty
reduction is also taking place. In the larger business world, a
growing number of established companies including some
multinational corporations has achieved impressive results in
reaching the poor in innovative ways with their products and
services.’ This reaffirms the feasibility of large-scale commercial
microfinance and strengthens private sector interest.

Today’s microfinance industry reflects the efforts of
stakeholders to address the issue of financial services for the
poor as effectively as possible. Macro changes in the policy
environment and in financial infrastructure include legal,
regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. Micro changes include
industry composition, products and services, delivery
mechanisms, the potential market, and how the market is
served. The region’s microfinance industry has seen at least five
important changes in recent years: (i) central banks have more
actively promoted microfinance in many countries, (ii) the
diversity of service providers has increased significantly,

(iii) operations have become more diverse, (iv) target markets

have become broader, and (v) the level of commercialization

 

MICROFINANCE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK

Once almost exclusively the domain of
donors and experimental credit projects,
institutional microfinance has evolved
over the years into an industry with
prospects for sustainable services and
significant opportunities for expansion.
ADB formulated its microfinance
development strategy to harness this
potential. The goal is to ensure
permanent access to institutional
financial services for a majority of poor
and low-income households and their

microenterprises. The strategy focuses on

(i) creating a policy environment
conducive to microfinance,

(ii) developing financial infrastructure,

(iii) building viable institutions,

(iv) supporting pro-poor innovations,

(v) supporting social intermediation.

The strategy was formulated in
consultation with more than 500
representatives of central banks,

in the public and private sectors,
cooperatives, nongovernment
organizations, universities, and
representatives of other funding
agencies. In addition, views were
obtained from external experts and
organizations such as the World Bank,
the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor,
and a number of bilateral aid agencies
(see www.adb.org/Documents/Policies/
Microfinance).

ministries of finance, commercial banksSPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

has increased. ADB has played a key role in reinforcing some
of these changes through its direct assistance for microfinance
operations, its policy dialogue with stakeholders, its sector
work, and its knowledge generation and sharing.

THE ROLE OF CENTRAL BANKS
IN MICROFINANCE

Central banks have a potentially major role to play in
developing sustainable microfinance, but until recently many in
the region were not harnessing this potential. Instead they
provided highly concessional refinancing facilities for
microcredit operations of state-owned financial institutions
thus undermining incentives for sustainable microfinance.
Recognizing their important role and the potentially adverse
consequences of inappropriate interventions, in 1999 ADB
published a study on the microfinance activities of 12 central
banks® that, along with ADB’s policy dialogue, had a
significant impact on the evolution of their roles in
microfinance. Many central banks have since begun to play the
more appropriate role of building financial infrastructure for
microfinance. This new role has elevated the status of
microfinance in financial sectors, has increased the space for
private sector participation, and has helped integrate

microfinance into the broader financial system.

Developing legal and regulatory frameworks to facilitate
sustainable microfinance has become an important task of
many central banks in the region. Cambodia recently
introduced regulations for licensing and supervising NGOs as

microfinance institutions. Nepal followed a somewhat similar

path and introduced a legal framework that facilitated private
sector entry into microfinance, and Pakistan introduced a legal
framework for microfinance institutions (see box on next page)
that resulted in two new, specialized microfinance institutions.
The Kyrgyz Republic enacted the Law on Microfinance
Organizations that assigns the responsibility for regulating and
supervising microfinance institutions to the National Bank of
Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan introduced a law on
microfinance organizations that regulates different types of
service providers and helps to develop the industry. Sri Lanka
drafted the Rural Finance Sector Development Act that is
expected to provide a legal, regulatory, and supervisory
framework for rural financial institutions and microfinance
institutions that are not covered by the country’s banking law.
The State Bank of Viet Nam is formulating a framework for
microfinance, and Azerbaijan has prepared a draft legal and
regulatory framework for microfinance institutions that is
expected to be enacted into law in 2005. In 2000, the Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas declared microfinance as its flagship
program for reducing poverty and improved the policy and
regulatory environment for microfinance through nine circular
instructions one of which allowed the establishment of
microfinance-oriented banks. It has also incorporated
microfinance into the basic rural and thrift banking courses
that it conducts, has carried out regional advocacy programs in
10 cities to disseminate the message of sustainable
microfinance, and has played a key role in developing standard
performance indicators for microfinance institutions. ADB
played a major role through policy dialogue in these countries

to bring about these improvements.

PAKISTAN’S MICROFINANCE ORDINANCE

In 2000 when ADB approved the Microfinance Sector
Development Program for Pakistan, the country’s financial
system was barely serving poor and low-income households
despite the fact that the potential market consisted of over

6.3 million households by conservative estimates. Commercial
banks were not involved beyond experimental credit projects,
and financial institutions engaged in development work
excluded the poor who had no assets. There was no legal
framework for specialized microfinance banks though
nongovernment organizations were making a concerted effort
to provide microcredit in selected areas on a small scale. The
poor were compelled to rely on informal markets. It was clear
that a proper legal framework was needed for formal financial
services for the poor.

It is in this context that the Government of Pakistan with ADB
assistance formulated the Microfinance Institutions Ordinance of
2001. It allows the establishment of regulated microfinance
institutions at three levels—district, provincial, and national—to
integrate microfinance into the broader financial system and to
create possibilities for institutional diversity. The ordinance
assigns the State Bank of Pakistan authority for licensing,
regulating, and supervising microfinance institutions.

Two microfinance banks with licenses to operate nationally have
been established since the introduction of the ordinance, and a
group of potential investors has completed a market assessment
for establishing a microfinance bank to serve the urban poor.
Also, the state bank has begun to play a more proactive role to
develop a comprehensive system and the capacity to regulate
and supervise microfinance institutions effectively.

 

These efforts bring most microfinance institutions that accept
public deposits under legal, regulatory, and supervisory systems.
Whether they will actually produce financially sound
institutions remains to be seen and will depend largely on the
effectiveness of the regulatory and supervisory authorities. ADB
has provided technical assistance for capacity building to a

number of central banks and will continue that assistance.

INCREASED DIVERSITY OF

SERVICE PROVIDERS

The poor are a highly heterogeneous group with diverse
livelihoods, needs, and potential, and their requirements for
financial services change in response to life cycle events, new
opportunities, and external shocks. For example, the demand for

financial services has completely changed for poor households

that survived the tsunami disaster. The industry must, therefore,

be dynamic and must comprise a range of institutions.

A few years ago, there was little institutional diversity in the
microfinance industry in most Asian countries. Formal financial
institutions were only minor service providers in the microcredit
market with the exception of Bangladesh and Indonesia. In
Bangladesh, Grameen Bank operated side by side with NGOs,
while in Indonesia, Unit Desas of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI)
was the major supplier of microfinance services along with
many People’s Credit Banks (Bank Perkreditan Rakyat). Perum
Pegadaian, a state-owned pawn company, also provided
microcredit to many low-income households. NGOs were the
dominant suppliers of microcredit in Cambodia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Philippines, and a number of Central Asian republics
though there even NGOs were reaching only a very small
number of low-income households. Many believed that
provision of financial services to the poor could only be done
by entrepreneurs with a social mission. The idea of commercial

microfinance had not taken root.

This picture of microfinance is changing for a variety of
reasons. Among them are the following: (i) the transformation
of NGOs into regulated financial institutions in some countries
and their subsequent rapid growth (see box at right); (ii) the
entry of small existing banks into the industry and the
expansion of their microfinance operations; (iii) the entry of
new microfinance banks; (iv) the increased role of cooperatives
including credit unions; (v) the increasing role of established,
conventional commercial banks; (vi) the rapid growth of selfhelp groups in microfinance especially in India; and (vii) the

entry of nonfinancial institutions.

In recent years, small banks have begun to penetrate the
microfinance industry in several countries. In the 1990s, only a
few rural banks were involved in microfinance in the
Philippines, but by the end of 2004 with assistance from ADB
and other funding agencies over 175 had entered the industry
and were reaching over 500,000 poor households. Their share
was over 40% of the total market served by microfinance
institutions in the country. In Indonesia, people’s credit banks
have been making a concerted effort to expand their
operations to cover poor and low-income households.’ The
cooperative rural banks in Sri Lanka have also evidently
increased their role in microfinance services in recent years.®
In a few Asian countries, new microfinance banks and nonbanking financial institutions have appeared. In Azerbaijan, a

specialized microfinance bank was established recently. In theSPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

 

THE TRANSFORMATION OF
NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS
INTO REGULATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

regulated financial institutions has added an element of
diversity to the microfinance industry. This process started when

Microempresa (PRODEM) became BancoSol in Bolivia in
February 1992. Between September 1997 and the end of 2004,
a total of 16 transformations were reported in Cambodia, India,
Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Philippines. Although the
number is small, the overall influence on the industry is great.
In some countries, transformed institutions have performed
much better than conventional banks both in terms of outreach
and profitability, and many of these institutions have become
flagship microfinance institutions. They have improved their
governance and risk management, and most have begun to
offer a broader range of services including deposit facilities and
money transfers. To finance their growth, they tap capital from a
range of sources including socially responsible investors and in
a few cases the private sector and the International Finance
Corporation. Some people expressed fears that transformed
NGOs would move away from serving the poor; however, a
2004 study published by ADB—Micro Success Story?
Transformation of Nongovernment Organizations into Regulated
Financial Institutions—concluded that transformation has not
only integrated the microfinance industry into the broader
financial system, but also in most cases it has had a positive
effect on both the breadth and depth of their outreach. Virtually,
all transformed institutions in Asia are now serving a larger
number of poor households than they did previously.

 

Philippines, the Micro Enterprise Bank was established in
October 2001 to serve poor and low-income households in
Mindanao. Khushhali Bank in Pakistan is another newcomer to
the industry and an interesting public-private partnership. It
was established in August 2000 with a paid-up capital of

$30 million subscribed by 12 domestic private sector
commercial banks, 2 foreign commercial banks, and 2 stateowned commercial banks.° Timor-Leste established the
Instituigéo de Microfinancgas de Timor-Leste as a regulated
nonbank financial institution with assistance provided by ADB's
Microfinance Development Project. The institution has filled a
vacuum in the microfinance industry in this new nation (see
box at right). Papua New Guinea also established a new
microfinance bank in 2004 with ADB support. The First
Microfinance Bank of Tajikistan began operations in July 2004
as the country’s first full-service microfinance bank.

Afghanistan also established a new microfinance bank in 2003.

NEW MICROFINANCE INSTITUTION
IN TIMOR-LESTE

The civil unrest of 1999 displaced half the population of TimorLeste, destroyed homes and infrastructure, and increased the
incidence of poverty to 80%. On 25 October 1999, the United
Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor was
established to ensure stability and to restore the civil service,
police, and judiciary. Donors pledged money to the Trust Fund
for East Timor (TFET) to finance the reconstruction of the
country. ADB was given the responsibility of managing TFET
microfinance interventions. In the financial sector, donors
recognized the vacuum created by the departure of all
Indonesian banks and the lack of other service providers,
particularly to serve poor households. To address this problem,
ADB extended its assistance. Technical assistance was provided
to create sustainable policies and a regulatory framework and
to study the feasibility of establishing a microfinance bank.

The Instituicdo de Microfinancas de Timor-Leste (IMFTL) was
created as a regulated, quasi-banking institution in May 2002
with capital from TFET. It operates with three branches under
the supervision of the Banking and Payments Authority which
acts as the central bank. IMFTL has experienced rapid growth in
business, especially in mobilizing savings. At the end of 2004,
IMFTL had 2,694 active loan accounts, a total loan portfolio of
$907,000, and client deposits of $873,000 in 8,627 deposit
accounts.

This infant bank operates in one of the most difficult
environments for microfinance and is thus confronted with
severe problems. Although it has established credibility within
the community as a trustworthy institution, IMFTL needs to
strengthen its internal controls, improve staff skills and
management, and bring in strategic partners as shareholders to
improve governance. The breadth and depth of IMFTL's outreach
remain limited; it is in the process of addressing these issues.
IMFTL was rated by a microfinance rating agency in February
2004 and appraised by an external team of experts from the
Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and Oikocredit, an
international, socially responsible investor in microfinance, to
determine suitability for possible equity investments by external
parties. In the meantime, ADB is continuing its support to build
the capacity of IMFTL to improve its internal controls and
sustainability and to extend its outreach to the poor.

 

In most Asian countries, cooperatives were originally established
to serve poor and low-income households, but they gradually
dropped the poor and focused on the nonpoor. With support

from ADB and other funding agencies, many cooperatives haveASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

recently begun to make headway in the sustainable provision of
microfinance services. A case in point is the growing
involvement of credit unions in the microfinance industry in the
Philippines. In the Kyrgyz Republic (see box below) and Viet
Nam, ADB assisted in the development of credit unions and
expanded their outreach to the low-income population, and in
Sri Lanka, the Rural Finance Sector Development Project
focuses on improving the microfinance operations of the

cooperative rural banks.

The rapid growth of self-help groups and their operations since
early 2000 has also contributed to the changing landscape of
the microfinance industry. Although this development is
primarily confined to India where they are now the dominant
microfinance model, because of their vast numbers they have
made a difference in the regional industry in a broader sense.
At the end of March 2004, they numbered 942,000. A typical

self-help group has 15-25 members and operates on the

principle of revolving members’ savings. External finance is also
provided to expand their credit operations.'° About 70% are
concentrated in three southern states: Andhra Pradesh, Tamil
Nadu, and Karnataka. Andhra Pradesh alone accounts for 47%
of the national total with 439,000 self-help groups, including
5.4 million women.

The increasing involvement of conventional, private,
commercial banks has reinforced the changes in the
microfinance industry in the region and is gradually
breaking down the walls between microfinance and the
formal financial sector. With few exceptions, before 2000 in
the banking sector only state-owned commercial banks were
involved in microfinance through directed credit and other
mainly subsidized programs. While some of these banks
continue their operations, private sector commercial banks
are becoming increasingly involved by extending their

deposit services to tap the potential of low-income

 

DEVELOPING A SAVINGS AND CREDIT UNION SYSTEM IN THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC

When the Kyrgyz Republic became a
member of ADB in 1994, the country’s
financial landscape was bleak. The stateowned agricultural bank, Agroprom, had
inherited a large portfolio of
nonperforming loans from the dissolving
state farm sector and was shutting down.
Newly formed commercial banks
provided only the most rudimentary
services. Microfinance was virtually
unknown outside the capital Bishkek
where some nongovernment
organizations were beginning to
experiment with microlending.

ADB supported the establishment of three
pilot savings and credit unions (SCUs) in
1996. Building on this experience, ADB's
Rural Financial Institutions Project set out
in 1997 to create a network of
community-based, member-owned
financial institutions that would serve all
rural areas with the support of a central
institution. This was an ambitious—and
largely unprecedented—undertaking. The
project is a good example of donor
coordination. ADB provided funds mainly
for onlending while the Government of

Germany funded capacity building of
SCUs through grants.

There were 303 licensed SCUs operating
in the Kyrgyz Republic as of July 2004,
with 27,181 active members. SCUs are in
every region of the country and together
account for a substantial amount of total
credit to agriculture and agribusiness.
They are microlenders: the average loan
size is Som19,241, or about $450. The
average number of members per SCU is
93, and the average asset size is

Som1.5 million (about $34,300). The
SCUs had an outstanding loan portfolio
(net) of $9.4 million. Their return on
assets was 8.9%.

The project has confronted a number of
challenges some of which arose from the
unique conditions of a country in transition
to a market economy. Many of the other
challenges faced by the project were
similar to difficulties that have occurred in
the development of credit unions in other
countries. Supervision is a key area of
concern. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic has now assumed responsibility

for supervising the SCUs and is
harmonizing this effort with its growing
supervisory role over microfinance
institutions. Initially the national bank
adopted a very conservative attitude
toward the SCUs accepting deposits. This
stance was understandable in light of the
fragility of the country’s financial system
but was softened beginning in 2003 when
the first group of 10 SCUs was allowed to
accept deposits on a pilot basis. With
assistance from Germany, the pilot will be
expanded in 2005.

The SCUs have also grown stronger since
1996 and now have more capital,
experience, and loyal member bases
upon which to build. The key challenge
is to develop more financial products and
services, starting with deposit and
payment services. At the same time, it is
important to further develop and

integrate the network which means
developing effective liquidity
management. In addition, SCU managers
and staff must continue to enhance their
technical skills, to promote transparency,
and to strengthen governance.SPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

households, although commercial banks do not generate

data to support this assertion.

More importantly, private commercial banks have increased
their direct involvement in financing microfinance institutions
in a number of countries. ABN-AMRO started microfinance
operations in India in September 2003. ICICI Bank, also in
India, figures prominently in this new trend not only because of
its increasing volume of transactions with microfinance
institutions but also because of its innovative approaches to
increasing its participation in this market. With the help of the
Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai, ICICI Bank built
India’s first rural automatic teller machine to serve microsavers
in remote areas (see box below) with a view to reaching the
poor for profit. This augurs well for expanding the outreach of

microfinance services for the poor.

Private banks in other countries have also increased their

penetration in the microfinance market. Planters Bank in the

 

AN AUTOMATIC TELLER MACHINE FOR THE
MASSES IN RURAL AREAS OF INDIA

ICICI Bank, India’s largest private commercial bank, uses
traditional automatic teller machines (ATMs) to deliver its
financial services to the rich and the middle class, mostly in
urban areas. ATMs are not, however, suitable for serving poor
and low-income people in remote rural areas who are the
majority of the 1 billion plus population. First, ATMs involve high
capital and maintenance costs. Second, and more importantly,
they use crisp notes of larger denominations and so cannot
process the small denominations and worn notes that are the
main currency in Indian villages.

With the help of the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai
and others, ICICI Bank built a user-friendly, market-compatible,
low-cost village ATM from home-made parts and programming.
The estimated cost is about $800. The machine can survive the
extreme weather conditions and power outages that are
common features of rural areas and uses fingerprint scanning
to identify savers who are illiterate or who are reluctant or
unable to use a personal identification number.

The rural ATM is being pilot-tested. Depending on the results,
ICICI Bank expects to use it to mobilize savings and to provide
deposit facilities to millions of poor families and, of course, to
improve its bottom line.

Philippines played the lead role in establishing the Micro
Enterprise Bank in Mindanao and was the major shareholder
with 40% of the capital in October 2001. Hatton National
Bank and Seylan Bank in Sri Lanka are gradually increasing
their microfinance operations. In Mongolia, the formerly stateowned now privately owned agricultural bank (commonly
known as_ Khan Bank) is the main player in the microfinance
market with branches in more than 390 locations. In Nepal, a
number of private commercial banks have invested in
microfinance institutions that were formerly NGOs. These
developments indicate the growing involvement of the private

sector in microfinance.

AFls in Asia and the Pacific also reach poor clients. In the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), some 35,000 rural credit
cooperatives (RCCs) are mobilizing deposits despite their high
level of nonperforming loans and other operational problems.
Their borrowers and depositors include some of the country’s
poorest people. The post office savings banks in a number of
Asian countries—Bangladesh, PRC, India, and Sri Lanka—play a
major role" in providing much needed, safe deposit services
while in others pawn companies provide microcredit services.
This is certainly the case in Indonesia. Perum Pegadaian, a
state-owned pawn company with a long history, provides
services throughout the country to a wide range of clients
through its 774 branches and 13 regional offices. In 2003, it
provided over $1.0 billion in 21 million loans and was the
major supplier of microcredit in terms of the number of clients
served.'? The large infrastructure of these institutions,
particularly the large number of service outlets in rural and
remote areas, offers potential for scaling up services. Funding
agencies and governments need to pay specific attention to
harnessing this potential. With this in mind, ADB is focusing
attention on AFls. It is collaborating with the Government of
the PRC to reform RCCs and is assisting the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic to reform the Agriculture Promotion
Bank. ADB will pay increasing attention to AFls in other
countries in the future in its efforts to diversify service
providers and to harness the potential of these institutions to

scale up microfinance services.

Nonfinancial institutions are also gradually making inroads
into the microfinance industry in Asia. Although this is not yet
a significant phenomenon, their entry is obviously adding more
diversity and development potential. Events in the mobile phone
industry in the Philippines illustrate this potential well and may
just be the beginning of a trend that is likely to gather
momentum in the near future. A new, text-based remittanceASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

service is now offered by one of the country’s leading mobile
telecommunications companies. The service, which started in
August 2004, is reportedly the first of its kind in the world. It
allows overseas Filipino workers to file their remittances with
the company’s partners in 17 countries. Recipients can collect
their money in the Philippines at any company office or
partner, including some pawnshops and gas stations. The
G-cash program of another major cell phone company in the
Philippines also facilitates international remittances and the
low-cost transfer of funds within the country. These programs
illustrate innovative ways of applying information and
communication technology to reach poor and low-income
households with quality financial services. Such applications
have the potential to fundamentally transform the region’s

microfinance industry and rapidly scale up services.

INCREASED DIVERSITY OF OPERATIONS

Until the late 1990s, the microfinance industry in many Asian
countries was unimodal: microfinance institutions were largely
supply driven providing mainly short-term working capital loans
for income-generating activities as this was considered to be the
primary mechanism for helping the poor. Most firms in the
industry also used the group-liability and group-lending
methodology and other approaches” tested, adopted, and
popularized by the Grameen Bank. In most cases, initial loan
amounts and subsequent increases for group members were fixed
and were applied uniformly to all borrowers (one-size-fits-all
approach). Clients were required to save fixed amounts on a
weekly basis and could not access the funds until they had

repaid their loans and formally discontinued their membership.

Many microfinance institutions have since changed their
product and service menus. Some have adjusted repayment
schedules and loan sizes to align them better with the
requirements of their target markets. Others have expanded
their product lines. The Grameen Bank itself fundamentally
changed its 20-year-old model of financial services (which its
pioneer, Professor Yunus, now calls the Grameen Classic System)
in August 2002 and shifted to a new system known as
Grameen II. Grameen discarded the group-liability system; now
each member’s loan is secured against her word. Grameen also
did away with the staggered loan disbursement system
(members of one group can now borrow at the same time) and
drastically changed its standard products to better attract and
retain clients. The new approach offers, among other things,
flexible loan arrangements for terms of 3 months to 3 years and

variable repayment schedules to avoid seasonal difficulties.

Grameen has also introduced new savings products. Although
some fixed savings deposits are still compulsory, the weekly
savings facility has been opened up to enable members to
deposit and withdraw at will. More significant is the new
contractual savings account called the Grameen Pension Scheme
with 5- or 10-year terms for members. According to MicroCredit Ratings International, Ltd.,'* a specialized microfinance
rating agency based in India, several leading microfinance
institutions in that country have also started to move away from
the Grameen Classic System. As a result, they are more
innovative and are now providing individual loans in addition to

group loans and plan to increase individual loans in the future.

Many microfinance institutions have either changed repayment
schedules or have introduced new products with relatively
flexible schedules. Some microfinance institutions offer monthly
or quarterly repayment schedules for agricultural loans based
on requests from members. Many institutions have recently
adjusted the terms of their loans and are deviating from the
classic system’s pre-fixed initial loan size and uniform
subsequent loan increments. Subject to a specified ceiling, in
many cases loan sizes are flexible partly in response to high
client dropout rates. They are also increasingly expanding their
product lines which has increased their value to poor and lowincome households. Housing finance in particular has started to
figure prominently in the expanding product line. ADB has
supported a number of microfinance institutions in Indonesia
and the Philippines to extend housing loans to poor and low
income households (see box at right).

Most NGOs that were transformed into regulated financial
institutions have also introduced new saving products in recent
years and are now mobilizing savings not just from their
borrowers in the target market but from a much broader
market that includes higher income households. Many have
made impressive progress. The story of the Association of
Cambodian Local Economic Development Agencies (ACLEDA)
Bank’s savings mobilization is perhaps the most interesting (see
graph at right). ACLEDA Bank had only 3,826 deposit accounts
with a total outstanding deposit amount of $2.0 million at the
end of 2001; however, at the end of December 2004, it had
57,091 deposit accounts with $31.6 million in outstanding
deposits. Although some large companies and higher income
households are among the depositors, most users of this service
are small savers. BRI units increased their deposit accounts
from $25.8 million at the end of 2000 to $29.9 million at the
end of 2003, and their deposit volume increased from $1.98
billion to $3.24 billion during this period.SPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

 

ADB EXTENDS THE BOUNDS OF
MICROFINANCE: INITIATIVES IN HOUSING

In most developing countries, the poor have no access to
housing finance from formal financial institutions. In the
Philippines, official data indicate that more than 40% of urban
families (over 10 million people) live in makeshift dwellings in
informal settlements where safe water, good sanitation, and
drainage systems are grossly inadequate. Some 91 million
people live in Indonesian cities; the government currently
estimates a shortfall of 6 million houses for poor families.

ADB's Philippines Development of Poor Urban Communities
Sector Project and the Indonesian Neighborhood Upgrading and
Shelter Sector Project work with local governments and
nongovernment organizations to ensure appropriate, affordable
plots are available and that financial and microfinance
institutions provide funds to purchase them.

The projects reflect the differences in the structure and capacity
of the two governments, the sophistication of participating
NGOs, and the capital market. In the Philippines, capital
markets are more accepting of relationships between the
formal and informal sectors, so it has been possible to enhance
standard urban microfinance risk mitigation measures by
linking microfinance institutions working with the project to the
established partial cash flow guarantee of the Home Guaranty
Corporation. In Indonesia, such an approach would have been
too ambitious; the loans provided do not have collateral and are
shorter term. In the Philippines, the microfinance shelter
provision component will benefit over 20,000 poor urban
households while in Indonesia, 180,000 households in a
minimum of 30 urban local government areas will benefit.

 

ACLEDA BANK DEPOSIT MOBILIZATION
2001-2004

(position at end of each year)

Another aspect of the changing market is the increase since the
late 1990s in other products and services such as money
transfers, remittances, and micro-insurance. For example, the
volume of domestic money transfers of ACLEDA Bank increased
from $7.1 million in 2001 to $28.1 million in 2002 and

$68.5 million in 2003. The number of transactions increased
from about 6,000 in 2002 to nearly 18,000 in 2003. In January
2004 with a commercial banking license, ACLEDA Bank
introduced a direct international fund transfer service.'® To
enter the remittance market, some institutions have established
partnerships with commercial banks and other established
service providers while others are exploring ways to leverage
remittances to provide medium-term loans for their clients.
ADB and a number of other funding agencies are formulating
programs to support these initiatives. ADB completed a study
on remittances of overseas workers from the Philippines'® to
identify how to improve the flow of remittances and to
maximize their development impact. The study indicates that
microfinance institutions can enhance the ability of recipients
to leverage their funds. In December 2004, ADB approved a
regional technical assistance project for Southeast Asia to
identify factors in the policy, regulatory, and institutional
frameworks that have an impact on remittance flows and to
propose country and regional action plans to increase flows

and to channel them through the formal banking system.

Micro-insurance has also recently been added to the product
lines of many Asian microfinance institutions.’ Until the 1990s,
the main purpose of insurance was to protect the microfinance
institutions themselves. Now some have established specialized

institutions to provide micro-insurance. A number of otherASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

microfinance institutions have established partnerships or
agency arrangements with established insurance companies.
However, given the complexity of developing sustainable
insurance services for the poor, funding agencies have to
provide considerable assistance for capacity building. To assist
these agencies, CGAP’s Working Group on Micro-insurance has

recently produced a set of preliminary donor guidelines.'®

BROADER TARGET MARKETS

The Asian microfinance industry, perhaps with the exception of
Indonesia, has traditionally focused on providing microcredit to
rural women below and just above the poverty line unlike the

Latin American industry which has focused on microenterprises.
Recently, however, the target group in Asia has been changing,

and the range of clients has become much broader.

Many of the leading Asian microfinance institutions have noted
the importance of serving microenterprises in addition to their
traditional clients. This appears to have been prompted by at
least two factors. First, they seem to have realized that
handing over their mature clients to established, conventional
financial institutions does not make good business sense,
particularly in an increasingly competitive and commercial
market. Second, they seem to have recognized the benefits that
these enterprises can generate to the poor in terms of
employment, hence the link between microenterprise lending
and poverty reduction. Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise
Development Services in Sri Lanka and Tulay sa

Pag-unlad, Inc. in the Philippines, two microfinance NGOs with
which ADB has been working, have introduced a loan product
to serve microenterprises with a view to creating new

employment opportunities.

As was pointed out earlier, the target microfinance market is
changing to include the poorest. This development is
encouraging for ADB because it has supported the broadening
of microfinance services since the mid-1990s. Recent
developments are most visible in Bangladesh. BRAC has
continued its innovative, 16-year-old income generation for
vulnerable group development program for the poorest but in
January 2001 introduced a new program—Challenging the
Frontiers of Poverty Reduction: Targeting the Ultra Poor (see
box at right). BRAC’s Addressing New Vulnerabilities program
that started in July 2002 also illustrates how the target
markets of microfinance institutions are expanding. This

program focuses on women retrenched from the garment

industry who are vulnerable to exploitation. The program
expects to retrain these women—about 200,000—before inviting
them to join the urban groups of its rural development
program. Of the first batch of 1,300 who completed training,

about 70% have joined.

Broadening the target group is not limited to the asset side of
the balance sheets of these institutions: it is spreading to the
liability side as well. Many microfinance institutions with legal
charters to provide deposit services have begun to include the
nonpoor by offering deposit products, particularly term deposits
with higher minimum requirements, to improve their roles as
financial intermediaries and to diversify their sources of
financing. This is similar to the deposit mobilization
approaches followed by many Latin American microfinance
institutions since the mid-1990s. The Asian microfinance
institutions that are expanding their domains in this manner
include ACLEDA Bank in Cambodia, Xac Bank and Khan Bank
in Mongolia, and the First Microfinance Bank in Pakistan. By
expanding resource mobilization through public, voluntary

deposits, these institutions reduce their reliance on donor funds.

 

TARGETING THE ULTRA POOR PROGRAM

Using improved tools, BRAC’s Targeting the Ultra Poor (TUP)
program in Bangladesh begins by actively seeking out the
very poorest women. It then offers them a special investment
program in the form of a grant of productive assets worth
about $120 and a subsistence allowance (called a stipend) of
about 300 taka (approximately $6) a month for 18 months.
Participants open a special savings account and are invited to
save and withdraw at will, but are encouraged to build a
savings balance big enough to help them reinvest in
productive activities. The special investment program is only
one of four special programs that are simultaneously
available to participants. The others are training courses on
how to exploit assets, on health care, and on social
development. The microfinance element in all this is small—
just the savings facility—but BRAC’s goal is to graduate
women from both income generation for vulnerable group
development and TUP into membership in their standard
microfinance scheme.

COMMERCIALIZATION

The potential market for microfinance is large and the demand
for the scarce resources of funding agencies is great. ADB and
others cannot, therefore, individually or collectively supply all
the resources needed for scaling up services. Based on this
simple fact, ADB’s microfinance development strategy
emphasizes the need to commercialize the industry. In 2000,
ADB initiated a regional study on commercialization to
improve its understanding of the process as well as its
challenges, implications, and prospects.'°

The study indicated a significant increase in the commercialization of the microfinance industry in a variety of ways in
most countries. The policy environment has improved in general
in many countries since the 1990s. The legal framework has also
improved. The supervision and regulation of microfinance
institutions that accept deposits have attracted greater
attention, and more countries are making efforts to reform and
improve the performance, regulation, and supervision of
cooperatives. In addition, various support institutions have
expanded in the region. The establishment and expansion of
microfinance-focused credit rating institutions is a major change
in the support structure. Micro-Credit Ratings International, Ltd.
made 170 ratings of 123 microfinance institutions in South Asia
between September 1998 and June 2003. Of those, 86 were
rated once, 28 twice, 8 three times, and 1 four times. This

clearly shows that the industry is commercializing.

The PRC is the only large country in the region where the
microfinance industry has not yet shown signs of development,
but some significant policy changes have recently been
introduced. A pilot project aimed at consolidating RCC
management is proceeding in eight provinces, and interest rate
caps—a major policy barrier for the growth of microfinance—
have been relaxed. In August 2004 based on the results of the
pilot, the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking
Regulatory Commission announced full-scale implementation of
the reform package for RCCs in 21 provinces. ADB is
supporting sustainable development of RCCs in underdeveloped
areas of Guizhou Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region through technical assistance. These measures are likely

to gradually change the landscape of the industry in the PRC.

A small group of microfinance institutions in the region has
already achieved financial sustainability and has shown that
financial services can be provided to poor and low-income
households profitably. This group includes large NGOs like
BRAC and the Association for Social Advancement (ASA) in

Bangladesh, regulated banks like ACLEDA in Cambodia, nonbank financial institutions like Share Microfin Ltd. in India,
and AMRET in Cambodia. These institutions are making a

difference and giving a new face to the industry.

A growing number of microfinance institutions are

e adopting a professional, business-like approach to their
operations and becoming more market oriented and
demand driven;

e reporting profits and impressive returns on equity and
assets;

e — increasing their financial sustainability through concerted
efforts;

¢ using commercial sources of funds to finance their growth,
reducing their reliance on subsidized funds, and even
contributing to government tax revenue;

¢ — operating as for-profit, formal institutions but with a
clear social mission to serve the poor and low-income
groups.”°

Empirical evidence from a range of countries in the region
indicates that commercialization helps the poor in a variety of
ways (see box next page). Microfinance institutions see
commercialization and their social mission as compatible rather
than as mutually exclusive. The demands from the larger
funding community, especially CGAP, to improve governance
and transparency and efficiency have also contributed to this
process in no small measure.

Growing competition in some markets is driving
commercialization. The increasing polarization of NGOs, their
consolidation, and their desire to increase individual
institutional market share have a bearing on the way they
provide services. These institutions are also driven by a
persistent desire to improve their brand names and, in some
cases, their global reputations. They are adopting professional
approaches to their operations and expanding their services in
the manner of established private sector companies. They are
improving their governance, risk management, transparency,
and disclosure policies. Above all, they have developed and
conveyed to their investors, clients, and potential clients that
they have clear growth strategies. This together with the better
organizational capability that they have built through
experience and investment in human resource development is
helping them to grow rapidly. Some have placed independent
directors on their boards while others have included directors
with banking and accounting experience. Thus, governing

boards now have a better balance between social developmentASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

and financial management and banking skills. They are also
adopting improved accounting practices such as loan
classification and making adequate provisions for loan losses
and are introducing loan write-offs and income recognition
policies. More importantly, they have opened their books to
external audits by reputable firms. Many also have websites
that provide detailed information on their operations to the

public.?"

Microfinance institutions are also paying more attention to the
expense side of their income statements than before. In the
1990s, the widely held assumption was that access was more
important than cost to the clients, hence cost-recovery interest
rates could be charged. However, the increased empowerment
and improved financial literacy of clients, growing competition
in some markets, and concerns that many microfinance
institutions are passing on their inefficiencies to clients in terms
of higher interest rates on credit are driving these microfinance
institutions to contain operating costs. Recent improvements in
operating efficiency have been driven mainly by these factors

and less by improvements in the scale of operations.

The small group of flagship institutions that are financially
sustainable is moving to commercial sources of funding, paying
more attention to the liabilities in their balance sheets, and
changing the structure of their liabilities. Transformed NGOs
have attracted equity investments from multilateral agencies
and public development banks. Flagship NGOs have also
increased their retained earnings and other reserves in recent
years enabling them to reduce their reliance on grants and
subsidized funds. A new breed of debt and equity suppliers that
operates on a commercial or semicommercial basis is now in
business in the market actively seeking clients. These suppliers
provide unsecured loans based on the finances of microfinance
institutions. A few microfinance institutions have already
started borrowing short- and medium-term funds from these
sources.” To support the development of this trend, ADB made
an equity investment in 2004 in ShoreCap International, an
investment fund targeting financially viable and growth
oriented microfinance institutions.

Microfinance institutions are also increasingly borrowing from

commercial banks which include a range of institutions from

 

DOES COMMERCIALIZATION HURT THE POOR?

ADB, the Consultative Group to Assist the
Poor, and many other funding agencies
have advocated the commercialization of
microfinance, but there is no consensus
on this in the broader microfinance
community. Many promoters and
practitioners have expressed fears that
commercialization would shift
microfinance institutions away from the
poor, but it appears that such fears are
not well supported by empirical
evidence.

In general, if commercialization is to hurt
the poor it has to move microfinance
institutions away from serving poor
clients, or result in poor quality products
and services for them, or increase the
prices of their products and services.
Commercialization of microfinance does
not necessarily lead to any of these
outcomes. First, commercialization
increases the ability of microfinance
institutions to obtain funds from both

semicommercial and commercial
sources. Microfinance institutions that
build their capital over time through
commercial approaches have a greater
ability to leverage funds in the market.
More importantly, commercial
approaches ensure that microfinance
institutions become the more robust,
permanent institutions that poor people
need. Moreover, the efficiency gained
by commercializing enables them to
offer competitive prices and better
quality products and services to their
clients.

Empirical evidence shows that
commercialization helps the poor. The
Association for Social Advancement
(ASA) in Bangladesh has a commercial
approach to its operations and is one of
the most efficient microfinance
institutions in the world. It has a strong
capital base, and its outreach grew from
1.08 million active borrowers at the end

of 1999 to 2.77 million at the end of
2004. The average outstanding loan of
ASA was only $75 at the end of 2004.
Similarly, Share Microfin Ltd. in India
increased its active borrowers from about
15,000 in March 1999 to 437,000 at the
end of 2004 at which time the average
outstanding loan was only $83. AMRET
(formerly EMT) uses commercial
approaches and now serves over 100,000
clients. At the end of 2003, its average
outstanding loan was $61. With its
commercial approach, Unit Desas of
Bank Rakyat Indonesia expanded its
deposit services substantially to over

29 million rural deposit accounts at the
end of 2004. In all these cases, the
number of poor clients served increased
dramatically. In addition, commercial
institutions are not only providing
services to more poor clients than most
noncommercial institutions, they are also
providing a wider scope of services of
better quality.SPECIAL THEME—THE CHANGING FACE OF THE MICROFINANCE INDUSTRY: BUILDING FINANCIAL SYSTEMS FOR THE POOR

 

state-owned to domestic medium-sized private to large private
sector. ICICI Bank and Samruddhi, a rapidly growing but still
small-scale microfinance institution in Andra Pradesh, India
finalized the first microfinance securitization deal in November
2003. In January 2004, Share Microfin Ltd. sold a portfolio of
42,500 loans from its books to ICICI Bank for $4.2 million. ICICI
Bank, ABN-AMRO, and Citibank in India; Planters Bank in the
Philippines; and Mongolia’s Khan Bank, for example, are not in
the microfinance market for altruistic reasons. They have
recognized the business opportunities there and have sought to
take advantage of them.” Although their involvement is
motivated by profit, the operations of these banks in effect lead
to the improvement of services for poor and low-income
households. More importantly, they have the infrastructure,
resources, and capability to scale up services relatively quickly
and to manage growth more efficiently and effectively than

most of the specialized microfinance institutions.

MEETING FUTURE CHALLENGES

The once almost exclusively donor-dependent Asian
microfinance industry has evolved to become an industry with a
diverse set of institutions offering an increasingly wide range of
products and services, not just microcredit. However in most
countries, the industry is led by a small group of niche market
microfinance institutions that vary in vision, strategy, character,
operational style, and qualities. Most of them are flagship
institutions in their respective countries while some are global
success stories. The rapid growth of their operations is leading
to increasing polarization; some of them are already market
leaders and others are on the way to consolidating their
positions. This group includes not only regulated banking
institutions but also regulated nonbank financial institutions
and NGOs. They operate like most other established, profitseeking, private companies but with a social mission to serve
the poor. This group will continue to grow leaving behind the
institutions with lackluster performances and a lack of drive to
achieve scale and sustainability. Not only their efficiency but
also their greater access to semicommercial and commercial
sources of funds will fuel their rapid growth. The operations of
these institutions will reinforce the integration of microfinance

into the broader financial system.

Although potentially sustainable and already sustainable small
microfinance institutions need support to expand their
operations, it is unlikely that they will provide the scale of
financial services necessary for the poor in countries such as the

PRC and India. If microfinance services are to be relatively

quickly scaled up on a sustainable basis in countries with large
potential markets, established private sector financial
institutions with large infrastructure need to be encouraged to
enter the market. For this to occur, financial systems must be
more competitive to drive such institutions to look at the
bottom of the market pyramid as a potential source of profit.
ICICI] Bank’s entry into microfinance has set an example in
India. However, in countries with large unserved and

underserved markets, many such banks must enter, not just one.

At the same time, it may also be essential to look at the
opportunities presented by AFIs with extensive branch networks
and to take action to reform and restructure them to provide
financial services for the poor. The transformation of Unit
Desas of BRI and of the state-owned Agricultural Bank of
Mongolia deserves more attention in this respect. In both cases,
reforms enabled rapid scaling-up of services on a profitable
basis. It is also necessary to unleash the untapped potential of
national savings banks and postal savings institutions in a

similar manner.

Although the changes that are taking place in the industry as a
whole seem to point to brighter prospects for financial systems
for the poor, all stakeholders have to work hard to ensure that
poor and low-income households have permanent access to
financial services. Governments have a critical and constructive
role to play. Experience shows that financial services for the
poor are sustainable and expand rapidly when governments
develop sound policy and legal frameworks, ensure macroeconomic stability, and encourage competition in financial
markets instead of directly providing financial services to target

groups.

Governments can make a significant contribution to developing
financial services for the poor by maintaining macroeconomic
stability. Nothing is more harmful for microfinance than high
inflation. Consistently low inflation rates help the microfinance
industry to achieve high growth rates; high inflation rates
erode the capital of microfinance institutions and retard their
growth. Governments should allow the private sector and NGOs
to play a dynamic role in microfinance. An effective way to do
this is to avoid direct service provision by government agencies
and interest rate caps that reduce the attractiveness of
microfinance to the private sector. Governments should improve
legal and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector
investment in microfinance institutions and to ensure
institutional diversity in microfinance markets and should also

make sure that agencies responsible for supervising financialASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

institutions are capable of doing so. Furthermore, it is
important that governments increase investments in rural
infrastructure and improve law and order to reduce both the
risks and transaction costs of providing financial services.
Currently most institutional microfinance is confined to areas

with relatively better facilities.

Finance ministries, central banks, and other government
institutions need to recognize that services for poor and lowincome households are an integral part of the financial system.

country is unacceptable. Inclusive financial systems should be a
central goal of every developing member country government
of ADB. Giving prominence to this goal and working toward it
will help governments to end financial exclusion, reduce
poverty, and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
However, the most powerful forces that may lead to a quantum
jump in the scale of financial services for the poor will most
likely come from the technological changes that reduce risk
and transaction costs and from market liberalization and

product and process innovations that increase competition in

ADB made significant progress in 2004 in its efforts to
maximize the effectiveness of its products, services, outcomes,
operations, and resources. The recommendations in the review
of the poverty reduction strategy (PRS) were instrumental in
formulating the Reform Agenda adopted in June that sets out
19 interrelated initiatives that together will make ADB more
responsive, accountable, and effective. Mainstreaming
managing for development results (MfDR) throughout ADB
operations is a high priority. The accountability mechanism
adopted at the end of 2003 became fully operational and
provides a venue and process for people or groups who perceive
themselves as adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects or
who allege noncompliance with ADB policies and procedures to

voice their grievances and seek redress.

The knowledge management framework set out a structure and
time frame for making ADB an effective knowledge bank as
well as a development bank. To that end, capacity development
was added as a fifth thematic priority. To enhance ADB’s
credibility and to achieve greater development impact, the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) began reporting to
the Board of Directors through the Development Effectiveness
Committee (DEQ), and for the first time, the Board appointed
the Director General of OED on the recommendation of the

committee and the President.

The President approved the new human resource (HR) strategy
following external independent studies, internal assessments,
and consultations with the Board of Directors, Management,
and staff. The new strategy supports ADB’s Long-Term Strategic
Framework 2001-2015 (LTSF), PRS, MfDR, the knowledge
management framework, and the new information systems and
technology strategy (ISTS Il) (see box on page 36). It identifies

20 actions some of which are ready for implementation.

The Board of Directors approved two major special capital
budget projects to improve security and renovate headquarters.
The security projects—including application of shatter-resistant
film, protection of outside air intake for the air-conditioning
system, and fencing—started in mid-2004 and are expected to
be completed in 2006.

The Business Continuity Management Working Group led by
the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) and assisted by
external consultants began work on a strategy to mitigate risks
to business operations and to reduce their impact by timely
responses to disruptions in procedures. The review of new

business processes completed in the first half of 2004 made

recommendations for improving efficiency and quality assurance.
ADB also continued to form and strengthen partnerships with
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and with other

multilateral development banks (MDBs) and agencies.

MANAGING FOR DEVELOPMENT RESULTS
uring the last 5 years, the development community has shifted
its emphasis toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). A series of multilateral forums have helped focus
this agenda. Key events included the International Conference on
Financing for Development (Monterrey, 2002), the High-Level
Forum on Harmonization (Rome, 2003), and the Second
nternational Roundtable on MfDR (Marrakech, 2004).

in Marrakech, the heads of MDBs and the chairman of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’sDevelopment Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) affirmed their
commitment to fostering a global partnership on MfDR. They

ledged to implement this commitment by aligning cooperation

 

rograms with desired results and strengthening country
monitoring and evaluation systems to track progress and assess
outcomes. The commitments made by development partners in

these important forums have improved alignment of

 

PERFORMANCE-BASED ALLOCATION OF
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND RESOURCES

Management's recommendations for strengthening the policy
on the performance-based allocation of Asian Development
Fund (ADF) resources were approved by the Board of Directors
in December 2004. These recommendations were based on an
extensive review of lessons learned in implementing the policy
from 2001 to 2004 and on the experiences of other multilateral
development banks. The revised policy will strengthen the link
between country performance and the allocation of ADF
resources, will elevate the role that governance plays in
evaluating performance, and will require close engagement
with borrowing countries. Shifting the allocation of ADF
resources to a biennial cycle and providing greater operational
flexibility in the timing of the use of ADF resources will ensure a
better alignment of performance-based allocations with other
business processes, particularly country programming. The
revised policy will guide the allocation of resources from 2005
onward and now includes explicit eligibility and assessment
criteria for allocations for postconflict countries and subregional
projects. The policy also provides for limited allocations for
poorly performing countries to be judged on a case-by-case
basis.PART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

development assistance with developing countries’ strategies,
supported harmonization of donor policies and procedures, and

clarified best practices in delivering development assistance.

During the Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX negotiations
(2003-2004), ADB committed itself to an MfDR framework
consisting of three pillars: MfDR at the country level, MfDR at
the institutional level, and MfDR in the context of global
partnership. The ultimate goal of MfDR is to ensure the
continued relevance and effectiveness of ADB as a development
institution committed to reducing poverty in Asia and the
Pacific.

MfDR at the Country Level

Country ownership and capacity to manage for results are of
primary importance for the success of the ADB MfDR agenda.
At the country level, ADB’s efforts have focused primarily on
capacity development and introduction of new tools and
processes to better define, measure, and monitor results “on the
ground.”

e An important dimension relating to the capacity of
developing member countries (DMCs) is the development of
their own MfDR agenda. Awareness raising and
“demonstration of success” through focused technical
assistance have been the preferred approaches to MfDR
capacity development. Two regional technical assistance
projects introduced MfDR techniques into sector agencies in
specific DMCs. ADB also provided technical assistance to
help build domestic statistical capacity for data collection,
reporting, and monitoring of development results.

© MfDR is an important new area for active collaboration
among various ADB departments and the ADB Institute. A
development management course for DMC executives was
designed in this framework. ADB also collaborated with the
Asian Institute of Management on a seminar series on
results-based management.

¢ A cooperation fund in support of MfDR, with contributions
from the governments of Canada and the Netherlands, was
established in July 2004 to support pilot DMC initiatives
aimed at promoting the adoption of results-based

approaches and techniques in public sector management.

Mf£DR at the Institutional Level
The institutional pillar encompasses a variety of internal efforts
to streamline and enhance the results orientation of ADB’s

management systems and business processes.

Some major initiatives undertaken as part of ADB’s reform
agenda reflect its increased results orientation, including the
new HR strategy and the staff performance development
plan, the knowledge management framework, and
institutional reporting mechanisms under the enhanced PRS.
A critical short-term priority is to enhance the results
orientation of ADB’s budgeting and planning instruments
and processes. The preparation of ADB’s next medium-term
strategy will provide an opportunity to advance in this area.
As an initial and important step of MfDR implementation,
ADB created the Results Management Unit (SPRU) within the
Strategy and Policy Department to effectively lead the effort
to introduce improved systems, procedures, and techniques
for better measuring, monitoring, and managing for
development results in ADB and among DMCs.

ADB is preparing results-oriented country strategies and
programs (CSPs) in selected pilot countries. The increased
results orientation of CSPs encompasses mechanisms to
ensure (i) alignment with DMC priorities and systems,

(ii) prioritization and selectivity of ADB interventions, and
(iii) measurement of ADB’s contribution to relevant country
outcomes. Notably, ADB’s first results-based CSP pilot in
Nepal was endorsed in 2004 by the Board of Directors.
Further pilots are being prepared or planned for Bangladesh,
Fiji Islands, Indonesia, Philippines, and Viet Nam. ADB is
also preparing results-based regional cooperation strategies
and programs.

An enhanced project performance management system
developed in 2004 emphasizes more systematic use of logical
frameworks and provides a results-oriented approach to
project management. It includes specific measures to improve
the design and the use of logical frameworks as a basis for
both quality at entry assessment during project preparation
and results management and performance assessment during
project implementation.

SPRU conducted extended consultations with development
partners on various aspects of ADB’s MfDR agenda, with an
emphasis on achieving country-level results. SPRU also
worked with other units throughout ADB to increase results
orientation in its corporate strategies and policies, strengthen
knowledge management, and establish support mechanisms
for a learning culture.

The Results Matter newsletter and the MfDR websites were
established as vehicles to facilitate knowledge acquisition
and sharing among ADB staff and to promote the MfDR
agenda internally.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

Participation in Global Partnership

At the global level, ADB supports the participation of its DMCs

in international events on MfDR and participates in

international alliances and partnerships on MfDR to acquire,
adapt, and disseminate knowledge on results and development
effectiveness for the benefit of its DMCs.

e ADB cosponsored the Second International Roundtable on
Managing for Development Results in Marrakech in
February, leading to the endorsement of the MfDR Core
Principles and Action Plan.

¢ ADB was also heavily involved in the preparations for the
Second High-Level Forum on Harmonization, Alignment, and
Results (to be convened in 2005). In this context, ADB
organized and cosponsored the two preparatory regional
workshops in Bangkok (cosponsored with the Government of
Japan) and Bishkek (cosponsored with the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development and the United
Kingdom’s Department for International Development). The
workshops stimulated discussion and the sharing of best
practices among DMCs on harmonization, alignment, and
MfDR.

¢ ADB holds the inaugural chair of the MDB Working Group
on MfDR and also cochairs the OECD-DAC Joint Venture on
MfDR.

e ADB actively promotes the harmonization of operational
policies and procedures among its development partners and
the coordination of support to its DMCs to help them
manage for development results.

ACCOUNTABILITY

Accountability Mechanism

ADB’s new accountability mechanism was approved in May
2003 and became effective on 12 December of that year. It
replaced the Inspection Function. The aim was to improve
development effectiveness, project quality, and transparency in
operations. Its two functions—consultation and compliance
review—provide for problem solving and for investigating

alleged violations of ADB’s policies and procedures, respectively.

People who are directly, materially, and adversely affected by
an ADB-assisted project in the course of its formulation,
processing, or implementation can file a complaint with the
Office of the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF) headed by the
Special Project Facilitator (SPF) who reports directly to the
President of ADB. This initiates the consultation function of the

mechanism, the goal of which is to seek agreement among all

parties involved on solutions to the problems identified in the
complaint. After determining whether a complaint is eligible
for consultation, OSPF provides a venue and process for
problem solving that can include fact-finding reviews,
meetings, roundtable discussions, stakeholder consultations, and
other means appropriate to the situation. Consultations are
successful when remedial actions are agreed. The SPF is
responsible for monitoring and reporting implementation of
any agreement. The SPF’s functions do not supplant the project
administration and problem-solving functions of the operations
departments and will not interfere in the internal matters of a
DMC.

In 2004, the OSPF finalized its operational procedures and
established office procedures, systems, and a website
(www.adb.org/spf). OSPF met with a wide range of civil society
groups and government representatives at headquarters and in
Australia, Germany, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the Pacific, and
Sri Lanka to create awareness on the consultation phase and
to discuss stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities in dealing with

complaints.

OSPF received three complaints: (i) Melamchi Water Supply
project (MWSP) in Nepal on 3 May 2004, (ii) Southern
Transport Development project (STDP) in Sri Lanka on 9 June
2004, and (iii) Sixth Road Project in the Philippines on

27 September 2004. Both the MWSP and STDP complaints
were declared eligible. The complaint on the Sixth Road Project
was ineligible. The review and assessment of MWSP was
completed. SPF arranged with the executing agency to attend
to the grievances of the complainants; however, they withdrew
from the consultation phase and filed for compliance review on
8 October 2004. SPF then closed the consultation phase. After
review and assessment and agreement on a course of action of
the parties involved, the STDP complaint is in an intensive phase
of conflict resolution/problem solving with an independent
facilitator. The complainants have also filed for compliance

review as allowed under the accountability mechanism.

The Compliance Review Panel (CRP), supported by the Office of
the Compliance Review Panel (OCRP), carries out the
compliance review phase. It is a three-member independent
body that investigates whether any harm suffered by people in
a project area was caused by a violation of ADB policies and
procedures. CRP reports directly to the Board of Directors
except for two matters when it reports through the Board
Compliance Review Committee, a standing Board committee

that clears its terms of reference and time frame and reviewsPART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

its draft monitoring reports before they are finalized by the
panel. CRP determines whether a request is eligible and with the
Board's authorization carries out an investigation. If there is any
violation of ADB’s policies and procedures, CRP recommends

remedial actions to the Board to ensure compliance.

In August 2004, the Board of Directors mandated CRP to
monitor the implementation of remedial actions for the
Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project (Stage III) in Pakistan
approved by the Board of Directors under the inspection
function. In addition to annual reporting under this Board
mandate, CRP provides the Board of Directors with progress
reports on implementation. In December 2004, CRP carried out
eligibility review missions for the STDP and MWSP requests; it
determined that the STDP request was eligible but that the
MWSP request was not. The Board of Directors authorized the
CRP to carry out a compliance review of the STDP request in

January 2005.

CRP finalized its operating procedures in 2004 after inviting
comments from interested parties. CRP members, OCRP, and
OSPF attended the Meeting of Accountability Mechanisms in
May 2004 hosted by the World Bank and agreed that ADB
would host the second meeting in Manila in April 2005. A
separate database of consultants was created to assist CRP.
Information dissemination and outreach activities included
translating the accountability mechanism information brochure
into Bahasa Indonesia, Bangla, Chinese, Hindi, Khmer, Lao,
Nepali, Russian, Sinhala, Pilipino, Tamil, and Urdu and
translating the CRP’s operating procedures into Bahasa
Indonesia, Chinese, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Russian, Sinhala,
Tamil, and Urdu. The OCRP developed and launched an
independent CRP website (www.compliance.adb.org) to ensure
transparency in its operations, including making reports,

publications, and information materials accessible to the public.

Audit and Anticorruption

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) conducts periodic,
independent, and objective appraisals of ADB activities to
ensure that internal controls are adequate and effective and to
improve economy and efficiency in the use of resources. OAG
also addresses alleged incidents of corruption or fraud in ADB
projects or by its staff. OAG reports directly to the President;
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews OAG’s

activities.

OAG undertook 20 audits in 2004 that resulted in

recommendations for strengthening internal controls and for

improving effectiveness and efficiency, in regard to (i) project
contract awards/commitments and disbursements, (ii) staff
retirement fund bond issues, (iii) investment decisions,

(iv) interregional technical assistance projects, and (v) financial
and administrative operations of resident missions (RMs) and a
representative office. Information technology (IT) audits
recommended (i) modifying system setups, redefining system
authorities, and activating alerts and audit trails; (ii) comprehensive testing of systems under development; and (iii) setting
priorities for the systems to be recovered in case of disaster.

OAG also reviewed eight randomly selected consultants’
contracts, a function previously conducted by the external
auditors, to confirm the authenticity of documentation
submitted during negotiations. These audits resulted in recovery
of overpayments and led to strengthening ADB's internal
control procedures. ADB took the initiative of reviewing and
adopting best practices as recommended by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of the United States Congress, even though ADB is not

required to comply with provisions therein.

OAG assisted PricewaterhouseCoopers, ADB’s external auditors,
in its audit of ADB’s annual financial statements including the
review of selected transactions on loan disbursements, investments, borrowings, and administrative expenses. OAG also
rovided administrative support in processing management
representation letters related to the audit and bond offerings.
The selection of ADB’s external auditors for fiscal year 20052008 was coordinated by OAG and followed the prescribed
rocedure for inviting and reviewing technical and financial
roposals of accounting firms of international reputation (four
accounting firms were invited; however, only two submitted
roposals). PricewaterhouseCoopers was again appointed for

4 years.

 

The Anticorruption Unit (the Integrity Division effective

1 January 2005) is the contact point for reporting allegations
of fraud and corruption in ADB projects or among its staff
members. In 2004, the unit opened 99 investigations for a total
of 463 investigations since the adoption of the Anticorruption
Policy in 1998. ADB reprimanded 2 firms and declared 59 firms
and 66 individuals ineligible to participate in ADB-financed
activities. A cumulative total of 108 firms and 116 individuals
was declared ineligible through 2004, but 20 firms and

14 individuals upon expiration of their sanction periods and

The Anticorruption Unit conducted procurement audits of two
road projects, one each in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and
increased awareness of the Anticorruption Policy and its
functions through presentations, workshops, publications, and a
series of presentations to all staff members on ADB’s principles

of behavior and conduct.

OAG completed a technical assistance project for strengthening
the training capability of the Asian Organisation of Supreme
Audit Institutions. This project produced regional guidelines on
fraud and corruption and 25 new training specialists in DMCs.
In addition, a workshop in the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) on public debt and one in Papua New Guinea on ADB
requirements on submission of audited project accounts and
financial statements were conducted, including a module on
fraud awareness and anticorruption. OAG publishes an annual
report on its anticorruption activities, which is posted on its

website, www.adb.org/anticorruption.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

ADB has accumulated extensive knowledge in its nearly

4 decades of development work in Asia and the Pacific and

recognizes the importance of this institutional asset. The LTSF

2001-2015 spells out ADB’s commitment to become a learning

institution and a primary source of development knowledge in

the region drawing upon resources, skills, and expertise both

inside and outside the organization; learning quickly from its

own experiences and those of its partners; and sharing

knowledge with those partners, with DMCs, and with ADB

staff to effectively solve development challenges. To realize this

commitment, ADB adopted a knowledge management

framework in June that specifies five goals to achieve in the

next 4 years.

¢ The organizational culture of ADB will support knowledge
sharing. Staff will be empowered and encouraged to fully
participate in implementing the framework with assistance
from the new HR strategy, training, and improved IT
infrastructure and services.

© Knowledge products and services will be managed more
effectively to ensure their quality and timely dissemination.
ADB will take a more strategic approach to planning and
delivering to DMCs its knowledge services and products that
are generated from its own studies, through its lending
operations, and through staff participation in conferences
and seminars.

© Business processes and IT will be updated. Improved storage

processes and systems will make data searches less

cumbersome. Another initiative is mapping expertise within
ADB through a skills and knowledge database of staff and
enhanced consultant profiles. Tapping the knowledge of
experienced colleagues will promote efficiency and add value
to all ADB operations.

© ADB staff will actively share knowledge through
communities of practice i.e., professional networks that act
as think tanks and provide advice in sector or thematic
areas. IT tools were introduced in November to support this
knowledge exchange.

© Knowledge sharing with external stakeholders and other
parties will be expanded. ADB will proactively strengthen
partnerships with like-minded organizations and networks to

exchange ideas, insights, and lessons learned.

A knowledge management center was established to implement
the framework. ADB also joined the Most Admired Knowledge
Enterprises (MAKE) network. Progress in implementing the
framework will be closely monitored, assessed, and published in
MAKE reports.

Asian Development Bank Institute

It is the Institute’s policy to respond positively to requests for
assistance and cooperation from stakeholders wherever possible.
In considering requests, priority is given to work that fits into
the four strategic themes of the Institute’s 3-year rolling work

plan: poverty reduction, regional cooperation, private sector

 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND
TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY 2004-2009

The vision of ADB for its information technology (IT) services is
to provide access to knowledge and information any time, any
place, in support of ADB's goals. The objectives of the
information systems and technology strategy for 2004-2009
which was approved by the Board of Directors in June, are to
(i) provide information systems that support ADB's core
business activities, (ii) deliver a knowledge management
framework, (iii) institutionalize the partnership between ADB
operations and IT, and (iv) develop IT services that are secure
and reliable. To ensure that these objectives are met, an
internal business sponsor will be required for each IT project,
every IT investment will be based on the outcome of a business
process review and proper justification, and systems will be
developed with due regard to the public communications policy.
The capital expenditure budget includes funds for information
systems development, technology infrastructure, and IT
governance.PART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

development, and governance. In addition, the Institute is
working to strengthen its capacity to use information and
communication technology (ICT) (such as Internet outreach,
virtual meetings, CD-ROMs, and videolinked training) in
support of ADB's overall approach to knowledge management.
As part of a commitment to align its work with ADB’s mission,
ADB Institute actively looks for ways to cooperate in activities
with both ADB headquarters and resident missions. Numerous
joint activities and staff exchanges have been arranged, as well
as mutual use of facilities for conferences and meetings.

Capacity building and training (CBT) activities expanded
considerably during 2004. A total of 16 courses were conducted
in the areas of poverty reduction, regional cooperation, private
sector development, and governance. Six of these courses were
directly related to ICT and “e-topics.” Around 600 participants
from DMCs were trained, a quarter of them women. Over

20 CD-ROMs (CD-Rs) were produced from the course materials,
including 8 interactive or lecture CD-Rs and 15 covering
proceedings. Country-specific CBT programs were initiated in
the PRC, India, and Indonesia to meet the growing demand for
tailor-made training programs in local languages. (Viet Nam
and other transition countries will be served by the separate
Japan Fund for Public Policy Training which is administered by
a unit of ADB Institute (see page 5). As part of an ongoing
knowledge management activity, almost 20 reviews of
development-oriented CD-Rs produced by various organizations
(similar in nature to book reviews) were posted on the
Institute’s expanded website (www.adbi.org). ADB Institute
appears to be the only institution in the world regularly

reviewing developmental CD-Rs.

Research activities were concentrated around three of the
priority areas. A major output in the poverty reduction theme
was the completion of country studies on the effectiveness of
poverty targeting measures in a number of DMCs. In
governance, a series of country studies was completed that
surveyed the current state of corporate governance. Evaluating
these measures and identifying current challenges are essential
for the further improvement of corporate performance where
the private sector is becoming increasingly important for
development. Eight other in-house research studies were
formally published, as well as an important survey of
postconflict reconstruction of Afghanistan’s economy. In
addition to its own research program, ADB Institute supports
visiting researchers (mainly from the region) who work on one
of the strategic themes. Five visiting researchers were received
at the Institute in 2004.

The Institute is also the implementing agency for the ADB and
Inter-American Development Bank agreement on the Latin
America/Caribbean and Asia/Pacific Economics and Business
Association. As part of this collaborative research initiative,
two conferences were organized in Manila and Beijing. New
ideas in knowledge management are being piloted including
easy-to-read research summaries and a daily e-letter of news
and analysis, which includes a roundup of development blogs

from civil society.

ACHIEVING DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

Emphasizing Integrity, Impartiality,

and Independence

The credibility of evaluation depends on the quality and
integrity of analysis, the degree of transparency, and the
independence of the evaluation unit. The dimensions of
independence include (i) behavioral autonomy, (ii) avoidance of
conflict of interest, (iii) insulation from external influence, and
(iv) organizational independence. The autonomy of OED is
evident from its project, sector, and country evaluation studies.
OED both recognizes positive achievements and points out
shortcomings. OED has maintained a high degree of
transparency and openness in reporting and publicly disclosing
its findings. To enhance its independence from Management,
effective 1 January 2004, OED reported to the Board of
Directors through the Development Effectiveness Committee
DEC). For the first time in 2004, the Board appointed the
irector General of OED under the new procedures on the

recommendation of DEC and the President.

he focus of OED’s work shifted to cover (i) the broader
developmental agenda, and (ii) project and program
evaluations feeding into country assistance program evaluations
CAPES). The shift requires closer links between the CAPE and
the CSP and between sector assistance program evaluations
and other evaluation studies (impact, special, and thematic).
The alignment of OED’s work in these areas will ensure that its

oducts are timed to feed into the preparation of CSPs, sector

 

olicies, and development strategies.

Consistent with the redefined role of OED, the section of the
Operations Manual on evaluation was reissued in September
2004 to reflect changes in OED’s reporting structure and
organizational arrangements and in the way in which private
sector operations are evaluated. In coordination with the

Private Sector Operations Department, OED is preparing newASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

guidelines for project performance audit reports on private
sector operations that incorporate the Good Practice Standards
for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations agreed
upon among the members of the Evaluation Cooperation Group
(ECG) of MDBs. The guidelines will also form the basis for
preparing project completion reports (PCRs). OED also began
to review existing evaluation guidelines for individual public
sector operations (projects, programs, and technical assistance)
to harmonize them with the good practice standards prepared
by the ECG.

OED continued to participate in the ECG, including

(i) developing good practices for policy-based lending,

(ii) benchmarking private sector good practice standards,

(iii) capacity building for evaluation, and (iv) strengthening and
promoting the dissemination of lessons learned and of
feedback. OED prepared a report on good practices for
evaluating policy-based lending and an addendum to the ECG’s
good practice standards for MDB-supported public sector
operations, both adopted by the ECG in 2004. To enhance inhouse expertise and to improve the quality of its evaluation
studies, OED introduced a seminar series, the OED Colloquium
on Evaluation. Open to all ADB staff, the colloquium provides
a forum for free exchange of methodological and empirical

concerns on the effectiveness of development.

Country Assistance Program Evaluations
CAPEs are designed to assess the development effectiveness of
ADB's strategy and assistance programs in a country over an
extended period, to derive lessons learned, to put forth
recommendations for more effective future assistance, and to
improve coordination among aid agencies. CAPEs have
generally focused on the quality of ADB’s strategies and
programs, their implementation and outcomes, and their
perceived contribution to overall development. Eight CAPEs
have been done since 1998—Bangladesh, Cambodia, PRC,
Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, and Viet
Nam-—with the current rate usually two per year. CAPEs have
used varied methodologies including focus group interviews,
formal and informal surveys, detailed desk reviews of existing

data, statistical analyses, field visits, and case studies.

CAPEs revealed problems with the former country operational
strategies (COSs) and country assistance plans (CAPs) and thus
contributed to the decision to switch to the CSP as COSs and
CAPs tended to address the formal, internal needs of ADB

rather than providing new insights for ADB operations. COSs

were too vague and general; they should instead have been

more operational. CAPs should have been more focused and
selective. The eight CAPEs consistently pointed to the need for
a standard methodology for evaluations which will be
developed in 2005.

The CAPE for Nepal done in 2004 was prepared in parallel
with the CSP, ADB’s first results-oriented CSP. The two
processes fed into each other. Overall, the Nepal CAPE
concluded that the ratings of completed projects were generally
within the level of success achieved by other countries in the
region. The evaluation found that the government and ADB
were able to improve performance and capitalize on successes.
Another major strength was the willingness of the government
and ADB to tackle difficult policy and institutional issues in
the major productive sectors. Shortcomings included an
overestimation by ADB of the ability of government agencies to
resolve institutional and policy issues, which resulted in slow
project/program implementation. Recommendations in the
CAPE that were incorporated in the CSP include (i) development
of a more focused program, (ii) flexibility in responses to incountry conditions, and (iii) sector focus that can enhance
successful investments based on proven achievements in

management.

Development Results of

ADB’s Lending Operations

The performance of ADB’s lending operations is assessed
through evaluation of completed projects and programs, selfevaluation by operations departments in the PCR, and
independent evaluation by OED in the project/program
erformance audit report (PPAR). PCRs are prepared for all
ublic sector projects/programs 1-2 years after their
completion but have contained a rating only from 1995
onward. The target 25% PCR average for private sector
rojects has not been achieved. PPARs are typically prepared 3
years after project/program completion. Until 1984, PPARs
were prepared for all projects and programs. Thereafter there
has been 100% coverage for program loans, but coverage of

rojects was reduced to 70% and then to 35%.

Both PCRs and PPARs use the same methodology for rating a
roject/program. A three-category system—generally successful,

artly successful, and unsuccessful—was used prior to 2000. As

 

art of harmonizing the evaluation methodologies of MDBs, a
four-category system—highly successful, successful, partly
successful, and unsuccessful—has been used since 2000. The
rating is derived on the basis of five criteria: relevance,

efficacy, efficiency, sustainability, and institutional developmentPART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

and other impacts. Work started in 2004 to develop guidelines
for private sector operations evaluation that, among other

things, will broaden coverage of assessing development results.

PCR and PPAR results are aggregated by using PPAR ratings in
all cases where both PCR and PPAR ratings are available. To
provide a “success rate” for all rated individual operations,
projects/programs rated generally successful under the threecategory system and either highly successful or successful under
the four-category system are added together. During 19742004, 1,048 public sector projects/programs were completed
and rated through PCRs and/or PPARs. Of these, 654 (62%)
were rated successful, 311 (30%) partly successful, and 83 (8%)
unsuccessful.

The figure below shows the trend by year of completion for
projects/programs rated successful. Due to the relatively small
number of projects completed each year, there are wide
fluctuations from year to year; however, two distinct trends can
be discerned. From 1974 to 1989, there was a declining trend
in the proportion of programs and projects rated successful.
The downward trend was reversed in 1990, which may be
explained by the combined effect of efforts to improve project
quality covering both project preparation and project
administration and by changes in the composition of
operations. An analysis of project design and formulation
carried out for 201 projects comprising all PPARs prepared
from 1994 to 2003 revealed that the design of ADB-funded
projects improved over the last decade. The ratio of projects
with major design issues fell from 50% of approvals during

1976-1980 to 12% during 1991-1995. In terms of
composition, an improvement in ratings for South Asia was
reinforced by higher success rates in large, new borrowing
DMCs, e.g., India. A slow improvement in ratings for
agriculture and social infrastructure was strengthened by the
higher success rate and higher proportion of energy and of

transport operations.

Of the 1,227 completed public and private sector projects/
programs with PCRs, 689 have been independently
evaluated. The PPARs rated 59% of these projects/programs
as successful, 31% as partly successful, and 10% as
unsuccessful. PPAR ratings by sector (see table on page 42)
show continuing high success rates for transport and
communications and for energy projects/programs. These
results confirm that financing infrastructure projects is one
of ADB’s strengths.

On the other hand, there is a significantly lower probability of
success for agriculture and natural resource projects/programs,
although a small improvement has been achieved for those
evaluated over the past 10 years with half rated successful.
Agriculture projects/programs have often been adversely
affected by weaknesses in formulation and design, ineffective
policy environment, institutional weaknesses, and declining
commodity prices. Changes have been made by ADB in some of
its approaches in the sector, but it appears that they are not
working well enough. The special evaluation study (SES) on
Effectiveness of Participatory Approaches in Rural Development
Projects found that participatory or bottom-up approaches do

EFFECTIVENESS OF PARTICIPATORY
APPROACHES IN RURAL DEVELOPMENT
PROJECTS

The study found that participatory approaches improved
information flow but did not lead to increased empowerment in
resource control and decision making or to increased
motivation to care for and maintain project facilities. The
application of standardized packages of participatory
approaches did not make project interventions more relevant or
sustainable. The report recommends that project interventions
be based on a thorough understanding of local conditions in a
project area. Adequate fieldwork is needed during project
design to identify potential local opportunities and solutions to
address local development issues and challenges. (For the full
report, see www.adb.org/Evaluation.)

 

not necessarily offer an effective solution to problems
encountered in earlier projects (see box above). A further
serious review of ADB approaches for the agriculture sector is
needed to develop the right business models for the current
environment as about two thirds of the region’s 3 billion
people live in rural areas and depend on agriculture. The SES
Small-Scale Freshwater Rural Aquaculture for Poverty
Reduction recommended steps to make ADB operations in
aquaculture development more relevant for poverty reduction

(see box at right).

ADB's operations in the financial sector have also performed
relatively poorly (see table on page 42), mainly due to the poor
performance of development finance institution (DF) projects,
which comprise 88% of the total evaluated in the sector.
Excluding those in the Republic of Korea and Singapore, the
success rate for DFI projects declined to 32%. Areas of concern
in the sector include (i) the institutions through which funds are
channeled since experience with state-owned institutions has
been less than successful, particularly in the Pacific; (ii) poor
assessment of demand for credit resulting in lower than
anticipated disbursements in a number of cases; (iii) ADB
lagging behind commercial banks in developing a broader
range of suitable products for DFls; and (iv) inadequate
monitoring and records of key impacts (e.g., jobs created,
exports) making evaluation of outcomes difficult. As with the
agriculture sector, ADB’s business model is not working well
enough for the financial sector. Further serious review is needed
to get the right business models to improve the performance of

projects in the sector.

SMALL-SCALE FRESHWATER RURAL
AQUACULTURE FOR POVERTY REDUCTION

The report covers the main factors that enable fish farmers to
generate sustainable livelihoods and reduce poverty and steps
that can be taken to overcome binding constraints. It highlights
the importance of access to capital assets (human, social,
natural, physical, and financial) and to a range of services
including markets, institutions, facilities, and infrastructure. The
roles of legal frameworks, development policies, resource
management, biosafety, and aquatic health are also
emphasized. Case studies in Bangladesh, Philippines, and
Thailand analyzed various aspects of freshwater aquaculture in
diverse settings. The study offers many lessons and an
analytical framework for researchers and development
practitioners and concludes that ADB's interventions in this area
were generally successful. There is growing recognition of the
importance of small-scale freshwater aquaculture to household
food security and human nutrition, as freshwater aquaculture
contributes to rural livelihoods, improves food supply, and
makes low-cost fish available in domestic markets. (For the full
report, see www.adb.org/Evaluation.)

 

The results of PPARs done in 2004 confirm the continuing
success of ADB lending operations in the energy and transport
sectors as well as modest improvements in the agriculture and
social sectors. All four infrastructure projects evaluated were
rated successful. Among those, the trans-basin Nam Leuk
Hydropower Project in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(Lao PDR) exceeded the targeted output of providing 215
gigawatt-hours per year. With diligent operation and
maintenance, the plant can be sustained for more than its
40-year designed economic life. Project-related relocation issues
were carried out well; some follow-up actions were
recommended on a few resettlement issues. In the agriculture
and social sectors, only five of nine projects/programs
evaluated were rated successful. The successful rural enterprise
credit project in Thailand provided small loans to farmers and
operators who used them productively. Project clients included
women who were full business partners in their enterprises. The
successful education development project in the Cook Islands
enabled schools to mobilize funding from the government,
parents, and their communities to enhance the quality of
education and to improve school facilities and infrastructure.
Parents and communities became proactively involved in school
management and became aware of the importance of

educational standards.PART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

Portfolio Performance

Annual Report on Loan and Technical Assistance

OED’s third annual report on portfolio performance represented
a significant move to a more evaluative format. Special
investigations were conducted into projects delegated to RMs,
project performance management, cancellation of surplus loan

proceeds, and the country portfolio review mission.

Based on project performance report (PPR) ratings, there was
little change in portfolio performance year to year. Evidence
shows that the PPR system fails to identify all projects at risk.
The report points out the incompatibility of the dual purposes
served by the PPR and recommends that it be used only for its
intended purpose of identifying the bottom quartile of projects
in terms of performance. Key performance issues include the
following: (i) over the last 5 years, 84% of the projects closed
required extensions, and fully 65% required multiple
extensions; (ii) net resource transfer from ADB to DMCs was a
negative $5.3 billion in 2003, heavily influenced by $5.6 billion
of voluntary prepayments from large borrowers that refinanced
their loans elsewhere; (iii) many loans were approved before
project readiness criteria were met; (iv) disbursements were at
their lowest level in 5 years; and (v) cancellation of surplus
loan proceeds remains a significant issue. The principal
recommendation of the report is to pilot-test annual reporting

on generating project outputs.

Project Cost Estimates

An analysis of projects completed after 1995 found that 35%
had major cost underruns, while 9% had overruns. The study
was designed to determine the principal causes of both and to

recommend ways to improve cost estimation.

Significant positive correlations were found between the level
of cost underruns and the number of scope changes, the
proportion of local costs to the total cost, the proportion of
the local currency component, and the proportion of costs
other than civil works. In analyzing variations between
expected and actual cost estimates, PCRs cited price-related
reasons most frequently (71%), scope changes (35%), and
inaccurate estimation of base costs (33%). Other reasons for
underruns included natural calamities and events related to

peace and order (38%).

Key factors for major overruns or underruns were poor cost
estimates in feasibility studies, poor project design, major
delays in implementation, and predetermined loan amounts. A

survey of ADB staff ranked inadequate or difficult-to-collect

information and inadequate resources and time for feasibility
studies as the most important factors in poor project cost
estimation. Recommendations of the study include (i) realistic
time and resource allocations to improve project design;

(ii) more rigorous consideration of inflation and depreciation
factors in cost estimates; (iii) more realistic estimation of civil
works and their operation and maintenance costs;

(iv) consideration of two-part loans for projects, one for base
costs and one for contingencies and minor overruns; (v) more
attention and resources for project administration; and

(vi) periodic updating of cost estimates.

Project Frameworks

As part of the focus on MfDR, OED promoted the use and
improved the quality of project frameworks. Since the
introduction of the project performance management system
(PPMS) in the 1990s, OED has played a leading role in its
development. The project framework is a core element of the
PPMS and a principal tool for ensuring sound project design as
it establishes the basis for monitoring and evaluating
performance. OED staff presented briefing sessions attended by
more than 300 headquarters staff on what to look for when
assessing the quality of project frameworks. The group sessions
generated a large demand for one-on-one guidance. To meet
the needs of RM staff and those unable to attend the briefing
sessions, a video presentation was recorded. The briefing
material and a checklist have been included in the operations
tool kit. OED assessed the quality of all frameworks for loans
and technical assistance approved in 2004. The quality of loan
frameworks showed a statistically significant improvement
compared with 2002, with the average 2004 score in the
satisfactory range (it was partly satisfactory in 2002). However,
the quality of advisory technical assistance showed almost no
improvement, and the average rating remained partly
satisfactory. Regional technical assistance showed significant

improvement but overall remained partly satisfactory.

Development Results of ADB's
Technical Assistance Operations

ADB must provide knowledge and innovation to complement
its lending operations. Technical assistance is an important
strategic tool for ADB, particularly in enhancing institutional

development in DMCs.

As with lending operations, technical assistance is evaluated
through a combination of self-evaluation by the responsible
department and independent evaluation by OED.

Independent technical assistance evaluation by OED startedASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

in 1990; self-evaluation through completion reports by
responsible departments began in 1993. The two methods
have yielded different results. Completion reports, which
focus on outputs, have reported consistently high success
rates of over 80%. Independent performance audits, which
focus on achievement of results and sustainability of
outcomes, have shown much lower success rates averaging
49%-62% (see tables below).

The results of technical assistance are mixed. Successful
technical assistance contributed significantly to institutional
development in a number of DMCs and played a catalytic role
in some sectors. For example, ADB-financed technical
assistance for the development of genetically improved farmed
tilapia served as a major impetus in associated research and
development investments (see box at right). ADB's interventions
through technical assistance on nutrition and food fortification
played a catalytic role in nutrition development in Asian
countries (see box on next page).

On the other hand, ADB encountered some problems with the
performance of its knowledge-based products. The SES on
capacity development assistance to the Lao PDR concluded
that the overall impact on the country was scattered; the
report suggests that ADB systematically review its approach to
capacity development (see box on next page). The results of
technical assistance activities evaluated in 2004 showed that
considerable improvement is needed so that DMCs get the full
potential benefits of ADB’s knowledge-based products. Only

5 of the 17 evaluated were rated successful, and 11 were partly
successful. Nearly two thirds did not fully achieve their objectives

The report assesses (i) the relevance of genetic improvement
research to tilapia farming; (ii) how genetically improved

breeds; (iii) the development and dissemination of breeding
methods and protocols; and (iv) the institutional,
socioeconomic, and environmental impacts of GIFT. Experience

The overall conclusion is that the ADB-financed technical
assistance was successful and played a catalytic role in GIFT
development in diverse institutional and socioeconomic
environments. Fish are important in the diet of people in the
poorest countries, supplying more than 50% of their animal
protein intake. Attention to fish production and consumption will
help to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of
eradicating hunger and reducing malnutrition. The growing use
of GIFT indicates the important contribution of tilapia to nutrition
among the poor. The evaluation concluded that this was a
successful case of aid coordination as ADB worked with other
development partners (including the WorldFish Center and the
United Nations Development Programme) to achieve these
good results. (For the full report, see www.adb.org/Evaluation.)

approved during 1995-2003. Three were successful and three
partly successful. Three focused on capacity building as part of
the fiscal management programs in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
and Kerala. The report concludes that technical assistance in
Gujarat was partly successful and was successful in Madhya
Pradesh and Kerala. The report notes the importance of
political will to reduce budget deficits and to improve
governance as prerequisites for effective fiscal management.
Another focus of technical assistance was building capacity to
administer value-added taxes that the government decided in
1999 to introduce nationwide by 2002 but subsequently

postponed until 2005. The report concludes that capacity
building in a large country like India requires more work, a
sustained commitment by ADB, and the involvement of high
level staff.

NUTRITION AND FOOD FORTIFICATION

Nutrition is integral to achieving the
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on
eradicating extreme poverty and hunger
and is instrumental in achieving the
MDGs on primary education, gender
equality, child mortality, maternal health,
and combating diseases. Research
shows that infant malnutrition plays an
important role in perpetuating poverty
and malnutrition across generations. The
evaluation identified four lessons.

+ Recommendations should be
commensurate with the level of
nutritional risks and the capacity of
government agencies and

stakeholders in the country involved.

+ ADB can play a catalytic role in
promoting good nutrition in the region.

* ADB-financed regional technical
assistance is a more cost-effective
intervention than determining activities
for a specific country, although there
are limitations to this approach
because of local dietary patterns and
other conditions.

* Food fortification has great promise for
improving nutrition, but it has to be
combined with household food security
and community nutrition initiatives.

The study found that capital costs in food

fortification programs supporting quality
assurance and standardization are often
neglected. Weaknesses in the scope of
some technical assistance activities and
inadequate participation of some
recipient countries during the design
stage reduced their impact on the
development of an effective nutrition
policy for Asia and the Pacific. However,
the overall conclusion is that ADB, in
coordination with other development
partners, contributed positively to
promoting nutrition and food fortification.

CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC

The evaluation concluded that the
different capacity development (CD)
approaches used in each sector were
relevant and effective in their contexts;
however, the overall impacts were
diffused. Local institutions still require
external assistance. Identified lessons
and key issues highlight the need for
rethinking the CD concept, a lesson that
has been identified in other Operations
Evaluation Department reports. The lack
of comprehensive and systematic
diagnostics affected the design (choices,
scope, priorities, and sequencing of
activities), implementation, and results of
CD assistance. Several key areas lacked
attention: (i) functions, clients, and

services; (ii) human resource
management; (iii) finance, including
recurrent expenditure and financial
management skills; and (iv) relationships
among organizations.

For ADB, improvements should entail
developing a definition, a working
framework, and tool kits that can change
the approach to diagnosis, design, and
implementation and move CD beyond
the project level. For the government, the
focus must move from project
management to the ministry level and to
building capacities for independent, selfsustained operations. Systemic issues
require attention at the country level.

Rigorous application of design standards
and principles for CD are needed to
develop clearly stated goals and
objectives. These include organizational
performance criteria, baseline
information, and time-bound targets to
monitor progress and assess outcomes.
A review by the government, ADB, and
development partners of the financial
dimension of CD must identify options for
long-term, sustainable solutions.

structures. By and large, their impact was limited. Four were
rated partly successful, and one was not rated because it had
been only recently completed and its full impact was not clear
at the time of evaluation. Important findings of the report are
that (i) key recommendations were dismissed as irrelevant
because they could not be implemented readily and more
practical recommendations were overlooked; (ii) the executing
agencies did not demonstrate strong ownership and proactive
involvement, and outputs were regarded more as a reference
than as an agreed upon course of future action; and (iii) results
were not adequately disseminated to relevant participants, and
most stakeholders and the government agencies concerned were
in fact generally unaware of them. To increase the involvement
of recipients and to help ensure that the design of subsequent
projects can achieve the desired outcomes and impact, the
report recommends that ADB request executing agencies to
evaluate the performance of technical assistance activities

within 2 years of completion.

A broad lesson learned to date is that capacity building is a
long-term process requiring comprehensive support, training,
monitoring, and strong supervision, and cannot be achieved
within the short duration of a single technical assistance
activity. ADB needs a strategic focus for technical assistance
operations in a given country and not just for particular sectors

or themes.

HUMAN RESOURCES AND BUDGET

The President approved the new HR strategy following external
independent studies, internal assessments, and consultations
with the Board of Directors, Management, and staff. The new
strategy is an integral part of ADB’s overall strategic
framework and is positioned to support ADB’s other strategic
initiatives including LTSF, PRS, MfDR, the knowledge
management framework, and ISTS ll. It identifies 20 actions.
Implementation commenced in 2004 and will continue in 2005

with the delivery of several initiatives.

An ADB-wide competency framework was completed and serves
as the foundation for the design and improvement of all HR
systems at ADB. The framework consists of five core
competencies (i.e., client orientation, achieving results, working
together, learning and knowledge sharing, and application of
technical knowledge and skills) and three managerial
competencies (i.e., managing staff, leadership and strategic

thinking, and inspiring trust and integrity).

A review of ADB’s recruitment and selection process was also
completed and recommendations have been outlined. The
planning and design phase is now under way concentrating on
integrating the competency framework, identifying options for
reducing time to hire, improving applicant management, and

removing unnecessary variations.

Mainstreaming gender into the HR policies and processes
continued during 2004. The launching of the Women’s
Education Network, new gender-based training programs, and
meetings with senior staff to discuss gender equality were the
highlights for the Gender Action Program Il. The working
group focusing on local staff gender issues finalized its action

plan for implementation in 2005.

Training and development programs were reviewed in 2004 to
ensure alignment with business processes, new initiatives, and
future developments. Leadership and training programs were
strengthened to support the implementation of the HR strategy.
OAS staff received training on developing measurements for
reducing variation and waste in business processes. An
extensively revamped project team leadership program was

launched. The development of a learning strategy based on the

 

REVIEWING THE REORGANIZATION

In 2004, an independent panel of external experts reviewed the
effectiveness of ADB's reorganization in 2002. The panel
concluded that the goals and guiding principles of the
reorganization were appropriate and that ADB had made
satisfactory progress in improving country focus and expanding
regional cooperation. The final report provided
recommendations and options for ADB's consideration for
further improvement of development effectiveness in four
areas: (i) strategic focus, (ii) sector strength and resources,
(iii) quality assurance, and (iv) operational effectiveness.

The President decided to take immediate action on most
recommendations that could be implemented in the short term
and approved an action plan that stipulates the principal
implementing unit, mechanism, time frame, and methodology.
For options and recommendations that would require detailed
study or careful analysis for a balanced solution for the medium
term, Management designated lead units to undertake further
study and analysis and in consultation with departments and
offices concerned. The results will be submitted to Management
for consideration as soon as possible. Follow-up actions will be
integrated into ongoing strategic and reform initiatives.PART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

competency framework and the business needs of ADB was
completed and released for managers and staff to use with the
new performance management system's learning and
development plan. Initial steps were taken to strengthen the

evaluation of learning within the organization.

The planning and design phase of the new performance
management system was completed for implementation in early
2005. The new system is based on the competency framework
and includes the definition of job families, job profiles, required
experience and qualifications for each job, output indicators,

and learning plans.

Benchmarking research of comparable organizations was
completed on legal and policy development issues, on
disciplinary measures and procedures, on administrative review
and appeal procedures, on recruitment and appointment, and
on separation. The key findings were included as part of the
review of existing policies and processes.

At the end of 2004, ADB had a staff of 2,394 coming from

53 of its 63 member countries. The total comprised

860 professional staff members! and 1,534 local staff
members,” of which 388 staff members? or about 16.2% are
located in the field offices. During the year, there were 85
appointments and 61 departures of professional staff members,
while 128 local staff members joined ADB, and 69 left. The
number of women professional staff members increased from
241 or 28.8% at the end of 2003, to 255 or 29.8% of total
professional staff at the end of 2004.

Compensation

Consistent with ADB’s market-driven compensation system, a
4.3% weighted average increase in professional staff salaries
was approved in 2004 (effective 1 January 2005). For local
staff at headquarters, the salary survey for 2004 resulted

in a 9.1% weighted average salary increase effective

1 January 2004. An overall weighted average salary increase of
8.3% for local staff in 21 field offices was also implemented. A
comprehensive review of professional staff salaries and benefits

is under way, expected to be completed by July 2005.

The compensation and benefits package of local staff in the
field offices was monitored and revised as necessary. A major
review of the terms and conditions of assignment of
professional staff in the field offices was undertaken and
changes were implemented effective 22 November 2004. Group

life, accidental death and disability, and worker’s compensation

insurance plans were renewed for another 3 years at existing
terms and conditions. The pension and discretionary benefits
self-service feature of the HR management information system
was rolled out in mid-2004, providing staff online access to
their own retirement and discretionary benefits based on

assumed retirement dates and salary increases.

Internal Administrative Budget

Actual internal administrative expenses (IAE) for 2004
amounted to $275.0 million, a savings of $4.5 million against
the original budget of $279.5 million. The savings mainly came
from lower-than-expected expenses related to the ThirtySeventh Annual Meeting and not using the 1% general
contingency. Under the budget category operational expenses,
there were overruns in the budget items for consultants and
relocation, mainly due to the need to absorb resource
requirements for some initiatives under the reform agenda that
were not anticipated at the time the 2004 budget was
prepared, and because of higher-than-anticipated inter-office
movements of staff. These overruns were offset by savings in
salaries due to a favorable exchange rate and slower-thanexpected recruitment, particularly in the earlier part of the

year, and less business travel.

The IAE budget for 2005 amounts to $299.8 million including
a general contingency of 1% (summarized in Appendix 8). The
increase over the 2004 revised estimate is 7.3% consisting of a
net volume increase of 2.5% and an overall price increase of
4.8%. Major cost drivers for 2005 include implementation of
various initiatives under MfDR and the reform agenda,
establishment of new and expanded RMs, an expanded
accountability mechanism and strengthened anticorruption
capability, the cost for expanded use of trust funds, increased
contributions to the staff retirement plan and rising costs of
medical insurance, and depreciation associated with critical IT

upgrades.

Budgetary resources in 2005 will fund a prioritized work
program including (i) support to lending operations and
enhanced portfolio supervision at regional departments;

(ii) expanded private sector operations; (iii) MfDR and the
reform agenda (including implementation of the new HR
strategy); (iv) knowledge management initiatives and a review of
several policies and strategies; (v) increased delegation of project
implementation and other functions to RMs; (vi) strengthened
anticorruption initiatives; and (vii) more evaluation of private
sector operations and broader evaluations at policy as well as at

sector and country assistance program levels.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

In addition to IAE, the 2005 budget also includes an annual
capital budget of $3.85 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital
expenditures for headquarters facilities and IT equipment, and
to meet replacement and acquisition requirements of field
offices. The overall annual capital budget for 2005 is decreased
by $1.0 million as compared with the $4.85 million allocation
in 2004.

ADMINISTRATION

Special Capital Budget Projects

ADB’s headquarters and its facilities were designed in the late
1980s. Normal wear and tear compounded by harsh weather
have gradually increased maintenance and repair costs, and its
security features were not designed to address current threats
and risks like terrorist attacks or bombings. The Board of
Directors therefore approved two major special capital budget
projects (SCBPs): (i) improved daylight access for ADB atria
and adjacent staff offices with an allocation of nearly $1.6
million in November 2003, and (ii) rehabilitation of ADB’s
headquarters building and enhancement of security with an
allocation of $14.8 million in April 2004. In total there are
12 projects, but the priorities are security and safety. The
security projects started in mid-2004 and are expected to be
completed by 2006. An SCBP steering committee was formed
comprising heads of departments and chaired by the vicepresident for finance and administration.

Field Offices Projects

In 2004 ADB approved two new funding sources to enhance
security and safety in the field. One was an annual capital
budget for the procurement of security and safety related
equipment in the field. The other was an administrative budget
to assist the field offices to comply with the United Nations
(UN) minimum security standards in accordance with our
memorandum of understanding with the UN on security

arrangements.

ADB also provided technical assistance and assessments to
several field offices such as the Bangladesh Resident Mission

regarding the need for new or expanded office space.

Managing Business Continuity

In 2004, the Business Continuity Management (BCM) Steering
Committee was established. The BCM Working Group led by
OAS and assisted by external consultants completed the first

part of a strategy to mitigate the probability of a risk to

business functions and to reduce its impact by timely responses
to disruptions in critical business functions. The first phase
improved existing recovery site facilities and established an
in-country business continuity facility. The next phase covers
other business functions and the possible establishment of an

offshore recovery facility.

Continuity plans covering all critical aspects of ADB’s business
functions will be developed and tested by departments
concerned in coordination with OAS in 2005. The plans will
cover arrangements and procedures for ADB to respond to any
disruption to ensure safety and security of personnel and that
critical business functions will continue in a timely and
effective manner. This will include the organizational structures
and delegation of authority needed to deal with all
emergencies. The plans will guide ADB from the initial
declaration of a disaster or crisis through crisis management to
recovery and restoration of processes and systems. OAS will
ensure the plans and procedures are evaluated and adjusted on

a regular basis.

Streamlining Business Processes

During 2004, business processes were refined and consolidated
throughout ADB including actions and initiatives to enhance
development effectiveness especially in the areas of client

orientation and responsiveness, efficiency, and product quality.

Client Orientation and Responsiveness

ADB worked with governments and its development partners to
identify development objectives, to formulate plans for
achieving them, and to specify time-bound indicators to
monitor implementation. ADB is committed to aligning its
CSPs to DMCs’ own national poverty reduction strategies to
efficiently channel resources to match priorities identified in
CSPs and to deliver high-quality assistance while minimizing

transaction costs and response time for DMCs.

Acknowledging the key role of RMs, ADB continued to
delegate responsibilities for project administration and
management, for preparing CSPs and CSP updates, and for
conducting country portfolio reviews. This further strengthened
the capacity of RMs to use their close contacts with DMC
governments and development partners to improve project

implementation, coordination, and collaboration.

Efficiency
The review of new business processes completed in the first half

of 2004 identified additional areas for their enhancement andPART 1: INSTITUTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS

 

reinforcement by rationalizing CSP preparation and processing
technical assistance and reducing and streamlining document
circulation. The actions to streamline business processes for
private sector operations were initiated to better support the
various facets of due diligence and to be more responsive to
clients. The review concluded that better ways and bolder
changes at the project, sector, and country levels need to be
explored to further streamline procedures, increase efficiency,
and improve the quality of products. To eliminate
redundancies, a review of instructions and guidelines on

operational procedures was conducted.

Several initiatives were started. The ordinary capital resources
(OCR) partnership aims to strategically reposition ADB for
greater relevance, responsiveness, and quality of OCR-financed
operations. An innovation and efficiency initiative aims to
reduce the cost of doing business with ADB, to raise its
productivity, and to boost innovations for OCR and ADF
borrowers. ADB is also reviewing strategic orientation and
management of its technical assistance program to improve its

quality and relevance.
Product Quality

ADB is amending its business processes to ensure (i) a greater

focus on the overall quality of country assessments and the

ENDNOTES

introduction of a results framework in each CSP;

(ii) improved thematic and sector assessments by involving
experienced thematic and sector staff in CSP preparation;
and (iii) the introduction of a biennial stocktaking of CSPs
and their lending and nonlending operations to examine if
they are results-based and demonstrate improved quality at
entry. To improve the quality of project design, regional
departments initiated quality enhancement measures. In
particular, quality assessment and facilitation teams were
created in the South Asia Department, and the Economics
and Research Department reviewed the quality of economic
analysis of ADB-financed policy-based operations approved
in 2003.

ADB continued to focus attention on improving project quality
through better implementation, monitoring, and portfolio
management. In March 2004, the technical assistance
performance report (TPR) system became operational. Both the
TPR and PPR are being enhanced to allow web access and
more information on design changes and action taken on
project implementation issues. An action plan was approved in
2004 to improve the quality of project and technical assistance
frameworks, to enhance monitoring through PPRs and TPRs,
and to revise PPMS procedures and guidelines to achieve better

effectiveness and efficiency.

Improving economic conditions in many developing member
countries (DMCs) and high economic growth rates in the
People’s Republic of China (PRC), India, and elsewhere have
been important contributors to a reduction in overall poverty
rates in Asia and the Pacific, but achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) (see box below) by 2015 remains a
challenge. The devastation caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami

has added a new dimension to this challenge.

The MDGs are clearly reflected in ADB’s Long-Term Strategic
Framework (LTSF) 2001-2015 and in its poverty reduction
strategy (PRS) adopted in 1999. ADB’s work program is guided
by the PRS. In July 2004, ADB completed a comprehensive
review of the PRS to obtain feedback on its implementation
and to examine its relevance in the context of the major
changes that have occurred both within the region and
globally. The PRS review confirmed that the three pillars of the
strategy—pro-poor, sustainable economic growth; inclusive
social development; and good governance—are still relevant. To
achieve greater effectiveness, however, the review recommended
refinements in strategic directions including a greater country
focus to align ADB operations with national poverty reduction
strategies and to foster partnerships. It also called for increased
attention to results, monitoring, and evaluation, including that
monitoring of performance be shifted to managing for
development results closely linked to the MDGs. The review also
recommended that capacity development be added to ADB’s
thematic priorities of private sector development, environmental
sustainability, gender and development, and regional

cooperation.

 

MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS

Eight Millennium Development Goals were set out in the 2002
United Nations Millennium Declaration. ADB formally adopted
them into its operations in April of that year. They are

* eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;

* achieve universal primary education;

* promote gender equality and empower women;

* reduce child mortality;

* improve maternal health;

* combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases;

* ensure environmental stability;

+ develop a global partnership for development.

A further 18 targets and 48 indicators were specified as guides
to their achievement.

Acting on the review’s recommendations, ADB implemented
several initiatives in 2004 including new guidelines and
instructions on project classification and on sector and
thematic monitoring and modifications of relevant sections of
the operations manual. This work will continue in 2005 and
will include implementing changes to the project classification
system, guidelines to improve the quality of country poverty
analyses, and the introduction of results-based country
strategies and programs (CSPs) (see box below). Work to
develop a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework

 

ENHANCED POVERTY REDUCTION
STRATEGY

National poverty reduction strategies (NPRS) prepared by
developing member countries (DMCs) in cooperation with ADB
and other development partners will be closely aligned with
ADB's country strategies and programs (CSPs). The CSP will
translate the substance and priorities of the NPRS into specific
activities and a program of loans and technical assistance.
Partnerships with nongovernment organizations—both national
and international—are crucial. Resident missions will play key
roles in this process.

Monitoring performance will shift to managing for development
results (MfDR) closely linked to achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). All new CSPs will have a results
framework that includes monitoring and that links constraints to
poverty reduction with the proposed program, desired outputs
and expected outcomes. The CSP will indicate how desired
outcomes can be met by linking each lending, technical
assistance, or knowledge product to one or more country
outcome indicators. To complement the framework, links
between project outputs and sector outcomes will be
emphasized in sector road maps. Management reforms will be
enacted to enhance openness, accountability, and
responsiveness.

Monitoring and evaluation will be integrated into ADB's MfDR
framework. The traditional project-focused monitoring and
evaluation system will be enlarged to include monitoring at the
country, sector, theme, and institutional levels also. The overall
impact on poverty reduction at the institutional level will be
monitored through achievement of the MDGs. An annual report
will assess improvements in DMC policy and institutional
capacity for poverty reduction, improvements in CSPs and
project implementation, the quality of knowledge products, and
the effectiveness of partnerships.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

for the PRS and to improve financial and organizational

capacity also commenced in 2004.

An important feature of the enhanced PRS is a stronger
emphasis on the MDGs in recognition of the generally weak
performance in the region on the nonincome dimensions of
poverty. It also responds to growing international efforts to
eliminate extreme poverty in all its dimensions and to ensure
the basic human rights set out in the Millennium
Declaration.

The impact of the PRS on poverty reduction is monitored
through achievement of the MDGs at the regional level.
Preparations for publishing a regional report on the MDGs
with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) began in 2004. The
report will be finalized in 2005 along with the global UN
MDG report to emphasize actions needed in the region by

policymakers, the international community, and other

STRATEGIC PRIORITIES

Pro-Poor, Sustainable Economic Growth
In 2004 ADB continued to support sustainable, inclusive, propoor economic growth that fully integrates the environmental
and social considerations of each of its DMCs. ADB also
continued to work with its development partners to create
conditions for growth, such as achieving and maintaining
macroeconomic stability, improving fiscal management, aiding
financial sector restructuring, and developing the institutional
and regulatory frameworks for private sector development. ADB
provided as much as $2.5 billion in assistance in 2004 through

17 projects supporting pro-poor, sustainable economic growth.

One of the main bottlenecks facing growth prospects in the
region has been the lack of infrastructure. In fact, it is
estimated that the infrastructure requirements of the region are
approximately $250 billion per year. ADB places high priority
on investing in physical and technological infrastructure and

provided support in 2004 for projects in transport and

stakeholders.

communications and in energy.

 

NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION COLLABORATION

ADB strengthened its cooperation with
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in
2004. For the second year in a row,
NGOs participated in nearly two thirds of
ADB-approved loan projects and
programs by giving input on project
design, conducting surveys and
assessments, facilitating consultations,
and contributing to implementation. NGO
involvement was also envisioned in
nearly half of the country and regional
technical assistance activities approved
in 2004 as well as in many activities
financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction. Representatives of hundreds
of NGOs participated in consultations on
several ADB policies and strategies
including those on anticorruption,
governance, public communications, and
water.

The year also witnessed the launch of a
new network promoting NGO-private
sector partnerships for poverty reduction
in Asia and the Pacific. The network grew
out of a workshop organized by ADB, and

hosted in March 2004 by the Population
and Community Development
Association, a Thai NGO. The network
offers an opportunity for private sector
enterprises and NGOs to exchange
experiences, share knowledge and best
practices, pool talents, combine
energies, and ultimately forge
partnerships for socially and
environmentally beneficial causes across
the region. A secretariat was established
at the Bangkok-based Kenan Institute
Asia to coordinate the network's
activities.

ADB approved grants for 45 small-scale
NGO-led initiatives in 13 developing
member countries with the regional
technical assistance project, NGO
Partnerships for Poverty Reduction.
Launched in 2003 with $500,000 from the
Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund
(PRF), the grant supports promising
community projects identified by resident
missions. Interest in the facility led to a
doubling of funding to $1 million in 2004.

In another PRF-supported grant, ADB
explored how to increase civil society
involvement in regional programming. In
particular, representatives of
governments and NGOs from the six
Greater Mekong Subregion countries met
with ADB staff in Bangkok, Thailand in
January 2004 to discuss multistakeholder
participation in the development of the
draft regional cooperation strategy and
program. Workshop recommendations
were taken into consideration in
finalizing it. World Vision Australia, a
development NGO, served as the
implementing agency.

In addition to these activities, ADB’s NGO
Center provided advice and support on
engaging NGOs in formulating country
strategies and programs and in
developing projects. Also during the year,
ADB signed a memorandum of
understanding with IUCN—the World
Conservation Union and carried out joint
activities with WWF.PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

The region’s vibrant private sector is an important partner in
efforts to expand its growth potential. Lessons from regional
development indicate that those countries that encouraged
private sector participation were successful in increasing
economic growth. In 2004, private investment contributed
strongly to growth in Hong Kong, China and Taipei,China in
East Asia. A revival of private investment in Southeast Asian
countries in 2004 played a role in strengthening long-term
growth prospects. Private investment activities also played a
critical role in supporting growth in other subregions. In
support of private sector development, ADB assisted DMCs in
2004 in their efforts to develop their financial sectors, capital

markets, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Inclusive Social Development

While economic growth is essential in reducing poverty, it must
be accompanied by effective social development programs to
enable disadvantaged groups to benefit from the expanding
opportunities that growth offers. In 2004, ADB continued to
support efforts of DMCs in planning for their human capital

development and in developing the policies, institutions, and
infrastructure necessary to effectively deliver basic social
services to the poor. Loans in the education sector in 2004
included support for the rehabilitation of schools in conflict
areas, for basic education, for sector development programs,
and for developing the skills of postsecondary school
beneficiaries. Health sector support was provided through
projects addressing improvements in the health of the poor and
the disadvantaged as well as financing of reforms for better
delivery of health care services. ADB also assisted urban water
supply and sanitation projects (see box on pages 52-54).
Specific attention was paid to gender and development, social
protection, indigenous people, involuntary resettlement, and

participatory development.

ADB support for inclusive social development contributes to the
attainment of the nonincome MDGs. UNESCAP’s report,
Promoting the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the
Pacific: Meeting the Challenges of Poverty Reduction, notes

that given current trends, the region is unlikely to meet some

 

POVERTY FUNDS

ADB administers three regional poverty
reduction grant facilities in addition to
country-specific ones. These funds help
ADB and its developing member countries
better understand how to formulate,
implement, and monitor policies and
projects that accelerate poverty reduction.
Activities financed by these funds often
play complementary roles to ADB's core
lending operations by ensuring benefits
reach the poor and vulnerable.

The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction,
financed by the Government of Japan,
was established in May 2000. The fund
now stands at well over $326.9 million of
which $146 million have been committed
to 53 poverty reduction projects widely
involving civil society. In 2004,

15 projects amounting to $29.87 million
were approved. The project by
Uzbekistan’s business women’s
association on vocational training and
microcredit was a noteworthy success in
creating job opportunities for women
from low-income households in
Karakalpakstan. The project received the

UN-HABITAT Dubai International Award
for Best Practices for 2004.

The Cooperation Fund in Support of the
Formulation and Implementation of
National Poverty Reduction Strategies,
financed by the Government of the
Netherlands, has been in operation since
November 2001 and has supported

19 projects amounting to $6.2 million. The
projects endorsed in 2004 include
reformulation of a national poverty
reduction strategy better aligned with the
Millennium Development Goals in
Azerbaijan; support for monitoring poverty
in Kazakhstan and Mongolia; and
formulation of a local government poverty
reduction strategy in Balochistan, Pakistan.

The Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund
financed by the Government of the United
Kingdom has supported a range of
poverty reduction activities since July
2002 including policy support, research,
capacity development, and knowledge
dissemination. Out of a total of

$74 million, $46 million have been

committed to 87 projects. In 2004,

37 projects were endorsed. In the
People’s Republic of China new technical
assistance is helping the government of
Liaoning Province provide adequate,
affordable heating for the urban poor
through programs designed and
monitored by the poor themselves. In
Pakistan, it is increasingly acknowledged
that poor and vulnerable people and
women are disproportionately subjected
to police harassment and extortion when
they try to access public services or
security. The fund is supporting a project
in four pilot districts in Punjab Province to
help improve the quality of police
services as part of a larger access to
justice program.

In May 2004, the Government of the
People’s Republic of China announced
support for the establishment of the
People’s Republic of China Regional
Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund.
The initial donation of $20 million will
support regional initiatives from 2005
through 2009.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

nonincome MDGs such as in achieving universal primary
education, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health,
and ensuring environmental sustainability. ADB’s support in

these areas is critical.

Gender and Development

Women comprise two thirds of the poor in the region;
improving their status is central to any strategy for poverty
reduction. ADB mainstreams gender and development in its
economic and sector work and in its operational activities. As
part of the analytical and background studies for its CSPs, in
2004 ADB prepared and published country gender assessments

for Bangladesh, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR),
and Philippines.

ADB's 2004 loan portfolio included several loans directed to
improve women’s livelihoods and to provide them with better
access to basic and essential services such as health care,
education, safe water, and income-earning opportunities. Sectors
covered include health, nutrition, and social protection;
education; water supply, sanitation, and waste management;
agriculture and natural resources; and law, economic
management, and public policy. ADB also approved several

technical assistance projects directed at (i) securing essential

 

SECTOR ACTIVITIES IN 2004

Agriculture and Natural Resources

Seven projects totaling $199 million were approved for

(i) agriculture in Afghanistan; (ii) irrigation projects in Lao
People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Nepal, and Tajikistan;
(iii) decentralized rural infrastructure and livelihood in Nepal;
(iv) gender equality and empowerment of women in Nepal; and
(v) sustainable livelihoods in Pakistan. In addition, 46 technical
assistance grants totaling $27 million were approved.
Regional technical assistance supported the Water for the
Poor-Partnership for Action pilot test in six provinces in the
central region of Viet Nam. A ninth umbrella regional
technical assistance project for $3 million was approved for
research to reduce postharvest losses of vegetables, to
improve staple crop yields, and to address water shortages
and land degradation.

ADB continued its partnerships and networking with
international research centers. In addition, two regional
workshops were held to improve the effectiveness of
agricultural research in Central and South Asia. In Bangkok,
ADB, the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture
Organization, and the UN Economic and Social Commission for
Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) hosted a regional roundtable
on eradicating poverty and promoting food security. ADB also
organized the International Year of Rice with the Government of
the Philippines.

Education

Loans of $278 million funded 9 projects in 8 countries, and

3 multisector projects totaling $39 million were funded to
rehabilitate schools in conflict areas. A $45 million loan to
Cambodia supported a sector-wide approach for educational
reforms with the donor community. Loans totaling $184 million
supported teacher education in Bangladesh, school
modernization in Sri Lanka, textbook development in

Uzbekistan, and school reform in Viet Nam. Loans totaling

$47 million upgraded the skills of postsecondary young adults in
rural Nepal and provided technical education, especially to
women’s polytechnics in Balochistan and North-West Frontier
Province in Pakistan.

ADB supported programs in the Mekong to raise awareness on
HIV/AIDS and focused on the need for human resource
development in Central Asia to make the subregion
internationally competitive. ADB worked closely in Bangkok
with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO) and UNESCAP and with the Southeast
Asian Ministers of Education Organization to plan the direction
of basic education programs, cooperated with United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in Bangkok in promoting programbased approaches, and worked with the World Bank to
strengthen Education for All fast-track initiatives. ADB will assist
ADB Institute with e-learning technologies to improve school
quality especially in rural communities.

Energy

Six projects totaling $857.4 million in loans, equity investments,
and partial credit guarantees were approved for electricity,
natural gas, and coal mine methane capture in the People’s
Republic of China (PRC), India, and Viet Nam. A $400 million
loan for upgrading India’s national power grid will help provide
electricity to all households by 2012. A private sector loan and
equity investment in a 1,095-megawatt gas-fired combinedcycle power plant will provide additional electricity to the state
of Gujarat in India at a competitive price and in an
environmentally and financially sustainable manner. With a
$120 million loan, the expansion and upgrading of 500 and
220 kilovolt transmission systems will be implemented in
Hanoi, Haiphong, and Quang Ninh to help mitigate power
shortages in Viet Nam.PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

workers’ rights for women, (ii) building capacity for inclusive
citizenship and participatory governance, (iii) improving women’s
reproductive health, (iv) increasing literacy, (v) developing skills
as entrepreneurs, and (vi) institutional reforms to improve
women’s status in the public sector. (For more details refer to

Gender and Development section on page 60.)

Social Protection

In its 2001 strategy on social protection, ADB defines social
protection as a set of policies and programs designed to reduce
poverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets,

diminishing people’s exposure to risks, and enhancing their

capacity to protect themselves against hazards and
interruption/loss of income. In 2004 social protection activities
focused on gaining a deeper understanding of country activities
and on creating new knowledge. Social protection studies were
started in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal, and
Pakistan. In addition, two regional studies focused on Central
Asia and selected Pacific DMCs. Concerning knowledge
creation, ADB provided technical assistance to develop social
protection indexes in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Viet Nam.

The components of social protection are complex and broad.

 

Finance

ADB approved six loans for a total of $337.5 million for five
projects. A $200 million financing facility without government
guarantee will provide long-term peso-denominated loans to
private sector borrowers via mainly international banks in the
Philippines. In Sri Lanka, a program loan supports policy
reforms that develop financial markets and strengthen the
banking system. ADB also continued its support for the
Government of Viet Nam's efforts to develop nonbank financial
intermediation channels.

ADB invested a total of $15.6 million in four financial
institutions: Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia, the
Afghanistan International Bank, the Shenzhen Orienwise
Guarantee and Investment Co. Ltd. in the PRC, and the Local
Government Unit Guarantee Corporation in the Philippines. In
addition, ADB’S first-ever equity investment in the microfinance
industry was $2.5 million in ShoreCap International Fund, an
investment fund targeting financially viable and growth-oriented
microfinance institutions. Investments of up to $135 million in
four private equity funds were also approved as were

22 technical assistance grants totaling $12.6 million, six of
which were regional totaling $2.6 million. These grants include
assistance for strengthening the payment and settlement system
in Bhutan, for establishing a well-functioning, secured transaction
framework in Vanuatu, for strengthening governance of the
securities trading market in the Philippines, for strengthening
microfinance operations in Timor-Leste, for developing a
framework and microfinance regulations in Azerbaijan, and for a
Southeast Asian workers’ remittance study.

Health, Nutrition, and Social Protection

Three projects totaling $273 million were approved. Loans to
the Philippines support comprehensive reforms in health care
financing and health governance with investments in selected

provinces. Loans to Uzbekistan and Viet Nam focused on
improving services and access to primary health care.
Multisector projects in Pakistan supported rehabilitating and
improving health services and in Sri Lanka included
restoration of basic health infrastructure in conflict areas. In
addition, technical assistance funds supported 12 new
projects including food safety in the PRC, urban nutrition in
Indonesia, psychosocial health in Sri Lanka, strengthening
ADB's response to HIV/AIDS, decentralization in health, and
the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and other emerging diseases.

ADB maintained its partnership with WHO to deal with SARS
and other infectious diseases. On HIV/AIDS, ADB collaborated
with the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) to assess the economic impact of the epidemic in the
region. The results were presented in the International AIDS
Conference in Bangkok. ADB also worked with the Swedish
International Development Agency on a special fund expected
to be functioning in 2005.

Industry and Trade

Five loans for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
development for a total of $130 million will expand access to
resources and international markets in Bangladesh and will
facilitate reforms of business registration and licensing systems
and the overall SME policy framework in Cambodia and Viet
Nam. ADB also approved an equity investment of up to

$10 million in the Shenzhen Orienwise Guarantee and
Investment Co. Ltd. for SME loans and 11 technical assistance
grants totaling $6.8 million for SME development.

In 2004, ADB trade assistance included two loans amounting to
$18.2 million for regional customs modernization and
infrastructure development in the Kyrgyz Republic andASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

To gain a better understanding of the benefits and challenges
of integrated social protection policies and programs, ADB
works in close cooperation with other development partners
and agencies. The areas of special concern include social
protection in the informal sector, social insurance, labor issues
in enterprise restructuring, and migration as a safe employment

creation activity (see www.adb.org/socialprotection).

Indigenous Peoples

ADB continued to strengthen the implementation of its 1998
policy on indigenous peoples (see www.adb.org/Documents/
Policies/Indigenous_Peoples/). ADB reviewed 73 projects and

equity investments approved in 2004 for compliance with the
policy. Twenty (27%) of the projects and equity investments
actively applied the policy; eight (11%) projects were found to
have significant impact (category A) and required the
preparation of a development plan/framework for indigenous
peoples. Five of those were infrastructure projects in the PRC
and India, two were health sector projects in the Philippines
and Viet Nam, and one was a community-managed irrigation
project in the Lao PDR.

Twelve (16%) out of the 73 projects were found to have limited

impact (category B) requiring specific actions to mitigate

 

Tajikistan. In addition, four technical assistance grants
supported capacity building and institutional strengthening for
customs modernization in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan,
for trade and investment creation in India, and for developing
industrial standards in the Lao PDR.

Law, Economic Management, and Public Policy

Eleven loans to India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet
Nam totaled $584.4 million in 2004. Programs funded included
public resource management in Assam, India; reform of the
state audit sector in Indonesia; resource management in
Balochistan, Pakistan; fiscal management reform in Sri Lanka;
and support for poverty reduction in Viet Nam. An additional
$57.1 million was provided for technical assistance.

Transport and Communications

Eighteen loans totaling $2.0 billion were approved for

17 projects. In India, a $400 million loan supported the second
national highway project, provided capacity building, and
implemented a road safety zone and a program to raise
awareness of the risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. A
$301.2 million loan developed roads in North-West Frontier
Province in Pakistan as part of an integrated program of
institutional and policy reforms. In the PRC, three road projects
and one railway project will help less-developed, poor areas
get better access to markets, services, and jobs.

Loans also supported airport rehabilitation and improvement of
the Andkhoy-Qaisar road in Afghanistan; the Chittagong Port
trade facilitation project in Bangladesh; road projects in Kyrgyz
Republic, Lao PDR, and Mongolia; and the community water
transport project in Papua New Guinea. A $15 million technical
assistance loan for the road project preparatory facility in Sri
Lanka was also approved. Thirty-four technical assistance
projects totaling $18.6 million were approved including five for
regional technical assistance. A grant of $2.2 million for

Cambodia will support the introduction of labor-based
technologies for maintenance of the national road network.
ADB also loaned $50 million for two private sector projects to
support the expansion of telecommunication services in the
Grameen phone project in Bangladesh and to improve access to
mobile and rural community phone services in Afghanistan.

Water Supply, Sanitation, and Waste Management

One project in Azerbaijan on urban water supply and sanitation
was financed through a $30 million loan that will benefit

147 residential users, industries, and the business sector in
three secondary towns. A multisector project in Bangladesh
combines river protection with drainage and basic sanitation
services in nine secondary towns. A multisector project in the
PRC on soil conservation and rural development supported rural
water supply, and two multisector projects in India and Pakistan
for Jammu and Kashmir supported urban water supply and
sanitation. In addition to these loans, technical assistance
supported 17 new projects in urban water supply, wastewater,
solid waste management, storm water/flood management, and
drainage.

ADB Water Week 2004 was held in Manila, and President Chino
presented the 2004 Water Prize to the Phnom Penh Water
Supply Authority in Cambodia for excellence in governance and
financing. ADB’s water awareness program continued its
outreach to the media with five workshops for journalists in
India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia.

The Water for Asian Cities program with UN-HABITAT
supported capacity building. ADB maintained its membership in
the Cities Alliance to allow access to resources for development
strategies and to key decision makers. In 2004, membership
facilitated the approval of a Philippine project proposal
amounting to $500,000; three additional project proposals are
in the pipeline.PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

negative impacts or to ensure that benefits will accrue to
indigenous peoples. Six of the category B projects were related
to education in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Sri Lanka,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Three projects involved
infrastructure in PRC, Lao PDR, and Nepal. The three
remaining were an agriculture sector project in Afghanistan, an
environmental improvement project in the PRC, and a women’s

empowerment project in Nepal.

To strengthen the implementation of the policy and to reflect
its new business processes, ADB approved a new section on
indigenous peoples in its operations manual and continued to
provide regular in-house orientation workshops for ADB staff
and for DMC officials on the policy’s implementation. ADB
also began drafting a handbook on indigenous peoples to
guide the implementation of the policy at ADB and to
harmonize its approach with that of the World Bank.

To commemorate the end of the International Decade for
Indigenous Peoples (1994-2004), ADB conducted the regional
workshop Indigenous Peoples and Communal Land
Management in Asia in December. The workshop discussed
issues such as the challenge of defining the term “indigenous
peoples” in the context of Asia, the development interventions
that displace indigenous peoples, recognition of their rights by

the state, and inclusive development.

ADB continued to actively participate in global discussions on
safeguarding the interests of indigenous peoples. Together with
the Alaska Federation of Natives, the World Bank, the InterAmerican Development Bank, and several other development
agencies, ADB cosponsored the Leadership Forum for Building

Knowledge-Based Economies in Alaska in June.

Involuntary Resettlement

In 2004, ADB reviewed 73 projects and equity investments for
compliance with its policy on involuntary resettlement (see
www.adb.org/Documents/Policies /Involuntary_ Resettlement).
The review supported early screening of projects to assess and
manage risks and to set standards for resettlement planning
and implementation. Twenty-six (36%) of the projects had
involuntary resettlement impacts and required resettlement
plans/frameworks. Of those 26 projects, 16 had significant
resettlement impacts. In the 10 remaining the impact was not
significant. Resettlement frameworks, assurances, or other
safeguards were incorporated in a further 9 projects to address
potential resettlement impacts during project implementation.

The remaining 38 (52%) projects were not expected to have

any resettlement impacts. ADB held nine orientation sessions on

involuntary resettlement to familiarize staff with safeguards.

ADB assisted DMCs to develop and implement national
resettlement policies and helped strengthen the capacity of
executing agencies to implement them. Six workshops and
orientation sessions helped build the capacity of ADB resident
mission, executing agency, and project management staff in
Lao PDR, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. A regional technical
assistance project on capacity building for resettlement risk
management in Cambodia, PRC, and India was implemented. In
addition, ADB approved three new technical assistance grants
to enhance legal frameworks, to develop national policies, and
to build institutional capacity in Bangladesh, Cambodia, and
Nepal. ADB continued to enhance national resettlement policy
standards in Sri Lanka and Viet Nam through technical
assistance and through a program loan in the Lao PDR (see
www.adb.org/resettlement/activities.asp). Support for
developing and implementing national policies complements
ADB’s efforts to implement the involuntary resettlement policy.
ADB provides updated information on resettlement on its

website (see www.adb.org/resettlement).

Participatory Development

A series of workshops held in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Chengdu,
Sichuan, PRC; Jakarta, Indonesia; and at ADB headquarters
attended by a wide range of stakeholders from central,
intermediate, and local government and civil society focused
on two projects in each country illustrating the range of
participation and how it might be optimized in projects
sponsored by ADB and other organizations. In-depth
discussions provided an opportunity for learning among
groups that rarely communicate and generated
recommendations for ADB to promote participatory

development in its operations.

Modes of Participation, a collection of short ADB case studies
that illustrate the distinctions among information sharing,
consultation, collaboration or shared decision making, and
empowerment or shared control were translated, printed, and
disseminated in Chinese, Indonesian, Khmer, Lao, and Russian.
The participation network continued to share reference
materials and training announcements with staff members in
resident missions and at ADB headquarters, and held a small
number of lunchtime presentations. ADB approved a regional
technical assistance project to support training for groups of
stakeholders on specific ADB projects throughout Asia and the

Pacific and to support trials of participation in strategyASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

formulation and implementation. Work continued on

developing training and reference materials.

Governance for Effective

Policies and Institutions

The policy Governance: Sound Development Management
adopted in 1995 committed ADB to support DMC efforts to
institutionalize good governance. The policy defines four aspects
of sound governance: accountability (that officials are
answerable to the entity from which they derive their authority,
that work has been conducted according to agreed rules and
standards, and that work is reported fairly and accurately);
participation (allowing public employees a role in decision
making; empowering citizens, especially the poor, by promoting
their rights to access and to secure control over basic
entitlements that allow them to earn a living); predictability
(fair and consistent application of laws, regulations, and
policies); and transparency (low cost, understandable, relevant
information made available to citizens to promote effective
accountability and clarity about laws, regulations, and policies).
ADB’s medium-term agenda and action plan for 2000-2004 is
the basis for the implementation of the governance policy. A
cluster of policies approved since 1995 further broadened ADB's
governance work to include the participation of civil society
(1997), law and policy reform (1998), anticorruption policies

(1998), procurement (1999), and anti-money laundering (2003).

ADB began a comprehensive review of the governance policy in
2004 that will continue in 2005. As part of this, a review of
the anticorruption policy is being conducted in conjunction
with the Office of the Auditor General. A desk study and
internal and external consultations were done in 2004 and a
medium-term agenda and action plan for 2005-2009 will be

prepared based on the review’s recommendations.

Law and Policy Reform and the Rule of Law

In 2004, ADB continued its program of technical assistance
and loans in support of law and policy reform and the rule of
law. This program focused on access to justice for the poor,
judicial reform, administrative law, corporate governance, antimoney laundering, secured transactions and insolvency law
reform, and legal training. Toolkits developed in 2004 help to
mainstream law and policy reform through CSPs and CSP
updates (CSPUs).

Country Governance Assessments
Country governance assessments (CGAs) were carried out in

cooperation with individual DMCs to systematically assess the

quality of governance and to strengthen the link between the
quality of governance and the levels and composition of
assistance. During 2004, assessments were initiated for
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, India, Lao PDR, Nepal, Palau, Sri
Lanka, and Uzbekistan. CGAs were published for Indonesia,
Mongolia, and the Pacific. CGAs improve CSPs and the contents
of loan and technical assistance pipelines. In 2004, attention
was given to operationalizing CGAs in CSP/CSPUs, particularly

by supporting governance as an area of strategic focus.

Governance Portfolio

In 2004, 10 loans were classified as law, economic
management, and public policy (core governance) for a total of
$578.0 million (compared with $299.5 million in 2003). Also,
39 advisory technical assistance projects were approved totaling
$22.7 million ($20.3 million in 2003). Some advisory technical
assistance projects were funded by the Governance Cooperation
Fund that was established by the governments of Canada,
Denmark, and Norway, and administered by ADB. In addition,
15 loans were classified as thematic governance (financial and
economic governance, public governance, civil society

participation, and anticorruption).

ADB-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) Anticorruption Action Plan

for Asia and the Pacific

Since 1999, the ADB-OECD anticorruption initiative has
promoted regional cooperation in the fight against
corruption. The initiative aims to foster both regional and
country-specific policy reforms tailored to policy priorities
identified by the endorsing countries and provides the means
by which governments, international organizations, and
other partners can review progress. It further assists
participating countries in building sustainable legal and
institutional frameworks to combat corruption by
implementing the standards and principles in its action
plans. In 2004, the following occurred.

(i) The fifth meeting of the steering group of the initiative
was held at ADB headquarters in July in conjunction with
the second master training seminar on curbing corruption
in public procurement.

(ii) Palau and Viet Nam became the 22™ and 23" members of

the steering group.

 

(iii) The medium-term strategy and work plan for 2004-2006
were approved.

(iv) A book comparing the legal and institutional frameworks
of anticorruption policies of endorsing countries was
published.PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

Local Governance and Service Delivery to the Poor

A technical assistance project (i) studied the policies and
ractices adopted by local governments in participating DMCs
to improve responsiveness in delivering services and to share the
indings, good practices, and lessons in the region and (ii) gave
local governments the opportunity to learn from international
good practices at the Regional Seminar and Learning Event on
Local Governance and Pro-Poor Service Delivery held in
February. It was a unique learning opportunity for national and
local government practitioners and civil society advocates to
share experiences and to improve the quality of and access to
ublic services in their localities. ADB Institute and the United
Nations Capital Development Fund helped with the event. The
seminar produced case studies on international good practices
and a practical learning guide for local government

ractitioners involved in continuous service improvement

Loc_Gov_Service_Delivery_Poor/).

Public Administration Networks

ADB supports the establishment of a network of schools and
institutes of public administration in Asia and the Pacific to
build and enhance their capacities and those of research
organizations and think tanks to enable them to transform
their governments into agents of good governance. In
December 2004, the Network of Asia-Pacific Schools and
Institutes of Public Administration and Governance was
launched at an international conference in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia. The conference provided a venue for educators and
practitioners to share expertise and experiences on the role
public administration plays in promoting good governance and
alleviating poverty. It was conducted in partnership with the
National Institute of Public Administration in Malaysia and
brought together 234 public administration experts, civil
servants, academics, trainers, and researchers from Asia and the
Pacific and beyond. Further, a total of 110 individuals
representing 92 institutions from 25 different countries
attended the network’s first business meeting where an interim

steering committee was established.

Cambodia Public Financial

Management Reform Program

In 2004, ADB and the World Bank facilitated preparation of a
public financial management reform program to be
operationalized through a consolidated action plan and phased
over 3-5 years based on four realistic and achievable reform
platforms. The program builds on the findings of the 2003
joint Government of Cambodia/ADB/World Bank public

expenditure review. The objective of the review was to assist the
government to assess public service performance and the
efficiency of public expenditure planning. A second feature was
to facilitate assessment of performance in finance and line
ministries and to formulate capacity development action plans.
Government leadership is provided through the national reform
committee and secretariat chaired by the minister of economy
and finance. A donor secretariat ensures well-coordinated
external assistance, including pooled funding for technical
assistance. Joint performance reviews and follow-up actions are
based on well-defined capacity development outcomes at each

phase of reform.

THEMATIC PRIORITIES

ADB’s thematic priorities are capacity development,
environmental sustainability, gender and development, private

sector development, and regional cooperation.

Promoting Capacity Development

The review of the PRS recommended that capacity development
be adopted as a new thematic priority. As a first response, the
Capacity Development Working Group was established and
given the task of formulating a medium-term strategic
framework and action plan for improving the effectiveness,
efficiency, and sustainability of ADB’s capacity development.
The group also proposed updates for related business processes
in ADB and agreed on a definition of capacity development
and a classification system to be applied to projects starting in
2005. A draft report from the working group will be provided
to Management in the third quarter of 2005.

As part of its capacity-building activities, ADB participated in
the Multilateral Development Bank Technical Working Group
on Financial Management Harmonization and the OECD's
Development Assistance Committee’s Joint Venture on Public
Financial Management and reviewed and contributed to the
proposed International Public Sector Accounting Standard
on Disclosure Requirements for Recipients of External
Assistance. As harmonization proceeds, it may be possible to
shift some financial due diligence to DMCs to reduce the
cost of project management and implementation and to
simplify disbursement and monitoring. Such a shift will
require increased internal capacity in the areas of financial

management and accounting.

In addition, ADB continued to provide support to the

International Federation of Accountants, the Confederation ofASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

Asia and Pacific Accountants, the International Organization of
Supreme Audit Institutions, the Asian Organisation of Supreme
Audit Institutions, and the South Pacific Association of
Supreme Audit Institutions. The purpose of this support was to
strengthen accounting and auditing capacity in the public and

private sectors at the regional and country levels.
Addressing Environmental Sustainability

Promoting Environmental Interventions

to Reduce Poverty

Out of 58 approved public sector projects, 8 had environmental
elements supporting the seventh MDG to ensure environmental
sustainability. The total combined loans of $569 million
represents 12% of total public sector lending—an increase from
9% in 2002 and 5% in 2003 (see box at right). Five of these
projects will support the development of water supply and/or
sanitation systems including wastewater and solid waste
management systems mostly in urban areas of Azerbaijan,
Bangladesh, Federated States of Micronesia, and Tajikistan. A
project in the PRC will address continued land degradation in
Fujian Province and will promote rural development through
market mechanisms that incorporate conservation and poverty
reduction in integrated agricultural systems. Two other projects
in the PRC involve coal bed methane and coal mine methane
production in Shanxi and Liaoning provinces. The increased
removal, capture, and use of methane will reduce greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions, increase clean fuel use, improve air
quality, and improve coal mine safety and efficiency. Through
the clean development mechanism (CDM) facility, ADB assisted
in developing the CDM component of the Liaoning project.
Taking into account a private sector loan to India for a
combined-cycle power plant using liquefied natural gas, all
three energy sector development projects involved the use of
clean fuel and GHG abatement technologies. In combined loan
amounts, the three “green” energy sector development projects
(the other two are transmission and distribution projects)
represented 32% of the total energy sector loan portfolio in
2004—an increase from 5% in 2003.

ADB also provided technical assistance to prepare loans to
improve managing natural resources such as water, coastal
fisheries, and wetlands; to develop or improve water supply and
sanitation; and to improve environmental quality. Grants were
awarded to strengthen national institutions and build
capacities for environmental and natural resource management,
to explore alternative energy sources, to combat land

degradation, and to develop environmental monitoring and

management information systems. ADB will assist the PRC in
evaluating the national environment policy, in formulating
environmental legislation, and in implementing a national
strategy for soil and water conservation that focuses on the
Ministry of Water Resources. Likewise, ADB will assist
Afghanistan with air quality management, Indonesia in
establishing the feasibility of gas generation from waste, and
Tajikistan in developing a community-based micro-hydropower
project. At the subregional level, ADB will promote effective
water management policies and practices, build capacity for
sustainable development, and promote biodiversity conservation

in the Greater Mekong Subregion.

The Poverty and Environment Program enhanced institutional
learning on ways to integrate the environment into poverty
reduction projects with the approval of eight subprojects
amounting to $1.6 million focused on poverty, conservation,
and health; sustainable alternative livelihoods; biodiversity
conservation; disaster management; rehabilitation of degraded
forestlands; rehabilitation of polluted sites; and combating
desertification. The program is funded by the $3.6 million
Poverty and Environment Fund jointly established by ADB and
the governments of Norway and Sweden and finances pilot
environmental interventions in three main areas: protection,
conservation, and sustainable use of natural resources and
ecosystem services; reduction of air and water pollution; and
disaster prevention and reduction of vulnerability to natural
hazards.

Through strategic partnerships with key development agencies,
ADB addresses regional and global environmental problems and
tackles the challenges of environmental problems caused by
poverty. ADB’s active partnership with the Global Environment
Facility (GEF) and its direct access to GEF project resources
have generated additional cofinancing opportunities and
strengthened the program pipeline. In 2004, two projects on
land management in Indonesia and Central Asia entered the
pipeline; and two projects (integrated coastal resource
management for the Philippines and Sanjiang plains wetland
protection for the PRC) were approved by the GEF Council.
ADB also obtained endorsement from the GEF chief executive
officer of the PRC/GEF partnership on land degradation in

dryland ecosystems in the western region.

The Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Climate Change
program that brought together trust funds from Canada,
Denmark, and the Netherlands continued to mainstream

programs, many in conjunction with incentives available
through the GEF and CDM (see box at bottom right).
Moreover, through the joint ADB-World Bank Clean Air
Initiative (CAl)-Asia—a regional, multisector network with over
100 members—ADB continued to support several studies and
regional dialogues in Asia on the impact on health of air
pollution, benchmarking air quality management capacity, and
policy formulation. CAI-Asia hosted a meeting in India on
better air quality attended by over 600 participants, mostly key
decision makers from the public and private sectors, to improve
awareness on integrating air quality considerations in
environmental and sector policy making and implementation,
and to enhance networking. ADB also signed a memorandum
of understanding with the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature (the World Conservation Union), and
participated in the World Conservation Congress. It also
engaged with the multilateral finance institution Working
Group on Environment and contributed to harmonizing the
environmental assessment framework. Together with the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Health
Organization (WHO), ADB organized a high-level meeting on
health and environment. It also participated in the Asia-Pacific
Forum for Environment and Development to address key
regional development and environmental issues. ADB interacted
with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) on environmental
safeguards and on related issues. To promote good corporate
environmental performance in the region, ADB also began
work on the publication, Making Profits, Protecting Our
Planet: Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Performance

in Asia and the Pacific.

Integrating Environmental Considerations

in ADB Operations

Multilateral and bilateral development agencies have
recognized the need to strengthen country analytical work and
priority setting exercises to improve environmental
sustainability in country strategies and in technical assistance
and lending programs. One tool to achieve this is the country
environment analysis (CEA) report that describes ADB's role in
helping remove environmental constraints. In 2004, ADB
finalized CEAs for Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, reviewed eight
draft CEAs, and approved a regional technical assistance

project to help prepare CEAs for eight Pacific DMCs.

To comply with environmental safeguards, all 73 projects and
equity investments approved by the Board of Directors were
reviewed to ensure the adequacy of measures to mitigate and

manage potential impacts and to contribute to improving

 

PUBLIC SECTOR LOAN PROJECTS WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL ELEMENTS

In the PRC, the Fujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development
Il project incorporates conservation and poverty reduction into
integrated agricultural systems. A project in southern Shanxi
Province covers all aspects of effective and efficient coal mine
methane and coal bed methane production, capture, and
utilization using all the latest technologies. A project in Liaoning
Province will use those same technologies to improve gas
distribution and central heating supplies.

In Central Asia, the urban and water supply and sanitation
project in Azerbaijan will improve the quality, reliability, and
sustainability of water and sanitation in three secondary towns
and will pilot approaches for reforms in others. In South Asia,
assistance to Bangladesh will implement flood protection and
improve slums, drainage systems, and solid waste
management. In Pakistan, assistance will support critical
reforms; strengthen institutions; and build capacity and
partnerships in health, education, and water supply and
sanitation.

 

 

ENERGY INITIATIVES

ADB and the Dutch Cooperation Fund for Promotion of
Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency cofinanced a regional
technical assistance grant that has developed country
assessments and feasibility studies on cogeneration using
biomass in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and
Viet Nam; on micro hydropower in Indonesia, Uzbekistan, and
Viet Nam; on the use of solid waste to generate electricity in
Bangladesh and Indonesia; on electric trolley lines in Nepal;
and on wind farms in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and
Indonesia.

The Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate Change financed
through the Canadian International Development Agency
supported a program for adapting to climate change in the
Pacific, for carbon sequestration through the clean development
mechanism (CDM), for generating gas from waste in Indonesia,
and for CDM capacity building in India and the PRC.

The Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency in Rural Areas financed projects in the PRC,
Indonesia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Uzbekistan, and the
Pacific. The initiatives financed from these funds have brought
in additional revenue from carbon markets for projects that
would not otherwise be financially viable.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

project performance outcomes. ADB engaged with stakeholders,
and reviewed environmental assessment reports required of

53 projects. In compliance with ADB's environment policy,
summary assessment reports of nine environmentally sensitive
projects in the transport and energy sectors were circulated 120
days in advance of the Board of Directors’ consideration.
Safeguard review missions in Bangladesh, PRC, Lao PDR, and
Sri Lanka provided insights on factors critical to improved
performance outcomes. Three orientation courses increased the
awareness and understanding of 120 staff members on ADB's
three safeguard policies. Also, ADB developed checklists,
prepared best practice papers, and developed or improved
safeguard tools to supplement the resources in the Environment
Assessment Guidelines (2003) (see www.adb.org/documents/

Guidelines/Environmental_ Assessment).

Gender and Development

The enhanced PRS reaffirmed gender equality as one of ADB’s
five thematic priorities. As women comprise the bulk of the
poor in the region, the pursuit of gender equality and the
empowerment of women are recognized as central for poverty
reduction and for achieving the MDGs. ADB continued to
strengthen its overall loan portfolio addressing gender issues.
Significant gender mainstreaming was evident in 38% of loans
in 2004. Of these 18% (13 loans) were classified with a gender
theme while 20% (15 loans) were classified with significant
gender mainstreaming. A further 22% (16 loans) were classified
as having some gender benefits. Loans addressing gender
equality objectives were represented in all three core strategic
areas of ADB operations—pro-poor, sustainable economic
growth; inclusive social development; and good governance.
While they tend to be concentrated in the health, education,
and water supply sectors, some loans were for irrigation, rural
development, agriculture and natural resources, SMEs, public

resource management, and rural infrastructure.

ADB also continued to improve addressing gender issues in
large infrastructure projects, especially road projects. Nine
loans in the transport sector included the prevention of HIV/
AIDS and trafficking of women and children in the project
design. In fact, a review of 2004 loans indicates that
prevention of HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and children
are becoming standard mitigation measures in ADB-supported

road projects.

In 2004, ADB approved the stand-alone, targeted loan project
Nepal Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women to correct

gender disparities and accelerate improvements in women’s

economic, social, and legal status (see box at right). Likewise, a
project in women’s and children’s health in Uzbekistan was
approved to reduce infant and maternal mortality rates.
Special features of the project include improving the status of
midwives and nurses through targets in education and training,
improving antenatal care, and increasing deliveries by health
professionals. Other good examples of projects approved in
2004 aimed at enhancing women’s access to decision making
and to economic benefits include the secondary towns integrated
flood protection project in Bangladesh and the communitymanaged irrigated agriculture sector project in Nepal. These
loans include targets and indicators to ensure (i) women’s
employment in project activities, (ii) equal pay for equal work,
(iii) representation in decision-making bodies, (iv) access to

project resources, and (v) provision for female field staff.

ADB approved a range of technical assistance projects to
promote gender equality and women’s empowerment. Countryspecific technical assistance focused on building the gender
capacity of sector agencies to promote improved service
delivery and integration of gender issues primarily in

agriculture and rural development.

ADB piloted a learning initiative designed to promote peer
training as part of its DMC gender capacity-building efforts. A
regional seminar on gender, poverty, and rural development was
organized for executing agency project directors from
Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,
Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. Directors who had successful genderinclusive loan projects presented case studies describing the
development of their gender action plans (GAPs) highlighting
improved results and contributions to meeting project goals and
achieving sustainability. Presentations by peers rather than
gender specialists proved to be a powerful tool for convincing
directors of the benefits and value of gender-inclusive loans. A
follow-up, country-specific workshop was requested by Sri
Lanka and three directors from Bangladesh were invited to
present cases of gender mainstreaming in loans in rural
infrastructure, water management, and education projects. ADB
also organized an exchange visit between Cambodia and Viet
Nam to enable four members of the Gender Working Group of
the Cambodian Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to
learn how Viet Nam developed a gender strategy and plan for

the agriculture sector.

To obtain timely feedback and learn lessons from the
implementation of ongoing loan projects, ADB conducted

rapid gender assessments of three loans each in Bangladesh,PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

Cambodia, Nepal, and Pakistan. The aim was to assess whether
the introduction of project-specific GAPs had any impact on
implementation, outreach, and results for women. Results were
assessed in the following areas: participation in project
activities; access to resources; practical benefits delivered by
the project including any differences in benefits for males and
females; and changes in gender relations at individual,
household, or community levels. Loans reviewed were in
agriculture, infrastructure, education, governance, livestock,
and health. Initial findings of the assessments indicate that
including GAPs in loan designs results in a more systematic
approach to implementing gender mainstreaming and to

improved participation and benefits for women.

Building partnerships and coordinating with other development
agencies was strengthened in 2004. Since both ADB and the

World Bank require preparation of country gender assessments
(CGAs) for CSPs, a joint CGA was prepared for Mongolia. This

positive experience was replicated and broadened to include
other agencies resulting in commencement of multidonor CGAs
for Indonesia (Canadian International Development Agency,
UNDP, World Bank), an ADB/United Nations Development Fund
for Women CGA for Timor-Leste, and an ADB/World Bank CGA
for the PRC. Cooperation with civil society organizations was
also pursued in 2004. Activities commenced under the Gender in
Water Partnership Agreement between ADB and the Gender and

Water Alliance, a global network of organizations.

The multidonor gender and development cooperation fund
established in 2003 continued to support gender equality and
women’s empowerment through regional and national technical
assistance projects. Twelve projects were endorsed for funding
to (i) enhance gender design features in ADB loans, (ii) support
innovative and strategic approaches to empower women and
girls, and (iii) promote regional awareness and cooperation on

gender issues. ADB began preliminary work on a review of the

 

NEPAL: THE GENDER EQUALITY AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN PROJECT

The low economic, social, and political
status of women in Nepal is due to
economic, legal, sociocultural, political,
and institutional factors. Women’s
poverty is further exacerbated by caste
and ethnic discrimination. While
Nepal's constitution guarantees equal
treatment, discrimination against
women persists.

The project aims to improve the
socioeconomic conditions of poor, rural
women, including those of low caste
and from ethnic minorities through
economic, social, legal, and political
empowerment. Provisions include

(i) strengthening individual capabilities
to improve access to and control over
assets, (ii) building group support to
influence and hold institutions
accountable, and (iii) reforming
government institutions and processes
to become gender responsive and to
integrate previously marginalized
women into development.

Economic Empowerment. This
component focuses on increasing
income, assets, and employment

opportunities by starting viable
microenterprises. The project will
provide training, will assess the
comparative advantage of such
enterprises, and will assist in meeting
women’s credit needs. About 30,000
women are expected to benefit.

Legal Empowerment. Activities will
increase the knowledge and awareness
of poor rural women about their legal
and administrative rights and
obligations and will also help to build
an enabling environment to implement
those rights. Support will also be
provided to Tribhuvan University to
prepare a specialized course and
syllabus on the rights of women and
other vulnerable groups, and training
will be given to judges and prosecutors.
Likewise, women's issues will be
included in the curricula of secondary
schools. Implementing legal activities
will also be strengthened through
alternative dispute resolution and by
designating one female lawyer per
district to provide legal advice and
assistance to women and to the
community.

Social Empowerment. The project will
provide community-based literacy
courses and activities to strengthen group
cohesion. Support will be provided for
establishing multipurpose women's
centers to serve as venues for social
activities and training. A household
technology fund will be established to
provide appropriate time-saving devices,
and a demand-driven infrastructure fund
will support community-based social
infrastructure to reduce the time and
energy women spend on menial tasks.

Institutional Strengthening and Project
Management. To ensure smooth and
effective implementation of activities in
the three components, government
institutions and processes must be more
gender responsive. This component will
support activities to strengthen the
Department of Women’s Development,
the Women’s Development Office, and
local bodies to adopt and implement
gender mainstreaming programs. An
organizational audit of the department
and district line agencies will be carried
out together with intensive training and
capacity-building activities.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

progress and effectiveness since its adoption in 1998.

Promoting the Role of the

Private Sector in Development

ADB plays an important role in facilitating private sector
development to support sustainable economic growth and
poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific because of its
capacity to provide both public and private sector operations in
a complementary way. This enables ADB to work with
governments to increase opportunities for private sector
involvement in the economy in an integrated manner. ADB
supports private sector development through policy dialogue;
by support for institutional, legal, and regulatory reforms; by
increasing the availability of financial services; by creating
opportunities for private sector participation in projects; by
catalyzing private investment through direct financing and risk
mitigation under guarantee schemes; and by improving
corporate governance.

Access to finance and related services is an important concern
in the region. Much of the private sector in developing
countries consists of SMEs that create jobs and develop local
technology. ADB support to SMEs in 2004 included policy
interventions for Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Viet Nam to
assist governments in establishing the institutional framework
for SME development and to improve governance, regulatory
reforms, and access to credit. ADB also catalyzed private
investments by providing loans and equity to institutions and
funds that facilitate access to finance for SMEs. In addition,
financial sector program loans were approved for Sri Lanka
and Viet Nam to reform and strengthen financial markets and
to increase the availability of financial products and services,
especially long-term funds to the private sector. In the Lao
PDR, ADB and the government began reforming aspects of
commercial and financial legislation that impede private sector
development. Similarly, ADB and the government reviewed the
framework for industrial standards to support the

implementation of consistent quality standards.

In line with ADB's strategic objective to increase and broaden
the flow of capital into more countries, equity investments and
private sector loans were approved for six countries compared
with three in 2003. Key projects in 2004 included commitments
to support telecommunication facilities in Afghanistan and a
newly privatized state-owned bank in Mongolia as well as
support to the Philippines’ Local Government Unit (LGU)
Guarantee Corporation that provides protection against default

to private financial institutions and other investors in LGUs.

ADB also has an important role to play in facilitating publicprivate partnerships particularly at a time when the investment
community lacks confidence in developing countries. For
Pakistan, ADB approved technical assistance for facilitating
public-private partnerships in national highway development.
ADB continues to take the lead in developing innovative
solutions and measures to mitigate risks and encourage private
sector investments in its DMCs. An example of risk mitigation
is the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility approved in
2004 to provide political risk guarantees to eligible investors
and financiers to facilitate private sector investment into

Afghanistan.

The magnitude and complexity of regional cooperation for
development have led the public sector to realize that private
sector resources, both intellectual and financial, need to be
tapped to supply the demand for regional capacity building

and infrastructure development. ADB devoted significant efforts

 

PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
IN THE PACIFIC

The private sector development strategy for the Pacific
examined some of the factors underpinning its disappointing
economic growth. Some of the reasons were (i) the pervasive
role of the state in all aspects of economic activity, (ii) an
inadequate commercial and legal framework for modern
business transactions, (iii) ongoing land tenure issues that
remain significant barriers to new investment, and (iv) failure of
financial markets to intermediate efficiently between savers
and borrowers. Addressing these challenges requires a
substantial commitment to re-orienting government activities
that contribute to the high costs of doing business in the region.

ADB is committed to continued support of private sector
development in the Pacific as a matter of priority. The newly
established Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney,
Australia will be instrumental for promoting the reform agenda,
both vis-a-vis Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) and
in coordination with other development partners.

In 2004, Pacific DMCs made some progress in formulating and
implementing the private sector development reform agenda.
Initiatives dealing with the productive and economic uses of
land are ongoing in Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands,
Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu. Fiji Islands, Marshall
Islands, and Solomon Islands are initiating reforms of their
legal business environments. Samoa and Tonga are pursuing
the rationalization of their respective state-owned enterprise
portfolios, and other DMCs are considering similar steps.
Continued efforts can be expected in 2005 and beyond.PART 2: POVERTY REDUCTION

 

to catalyze private sector interest in the regional cooperation
programs it supports by organizing public-private sector
consultations, approving technical assistance for facilitating
cross-border trade and investment in the Greater Mekong
Subregion and by endorsing a regional trade facilitation and

customs cooperation program for East and Central Asia.

Supporting Regional Cooperation

and Integration for Development

Since the early 1990s, the rationale for supporting regional
cooperation has rested on two main factors: the imperative
need for DMCs to respond to common transboundary problems
and the opportunities for greater access to external trade,
investment, expertise, information, and technology. The PRS
and LTSF formally identify regional cooperation as a core
component for reducing poverty. Based on project pipelines for
2004-2007, regional investments will increase to 20% of total
ADF concessional lending, representing a sharp increase from
1998-2003 levels of 6%. To advance poverty reduction,
preparations began in 2004 on a strategic approach to
regional cooperation that will outline how ADB will coordinate
support among the five subregions, namely East and Central
Asia, Mekong, the Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia (see
box on next page). The goal is to prepare innovative

interventions for the 2006-2010 medium-term strategy.

ADB supports cooperation between and among countries in
addressing trade, maritime safety, prevention of infectious
diseases, air pollution, financial contagion, terrorism, money
laundering, trafficking, and other crimes. Trade, financial, and
monetary shocks, risks to the environment, and infectious
diseases are particularly important. Among other initiatives, ADB
promoted an improved trade environment by supporting customs
harmonization and streamlining, combating money laundering,
and other measures in coordination with organizations such as
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asia-Pacific
Group of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.

Creating a corruption-free business environment is the aim of
the global UN Convention Against Corruption and is key to
improving trade throughout the region. In an effort to address
this critical issue, the Asia-Pacific Anticorruption Initiative
supported by ADB and OECD brought together 23 countries to
design and undertake effective programs. Increased trade and
integration can help countries in many ways. Export-oriented
firms and those with some foreign ownership are more
competitive than domestically oriented firms by 40% in

Indonesia and the Philippines and by 15-20% in the Republic

of Korea and Thailand. Firms also boost productivity by linking
up across borders to integrate production networks that supply
raw materials, manufacture components, assemble finished
goods, and move them through regional and global distribution
chains to consumers. With assistance from ADB, developing
Asian countries are trying to promote similar production
networks by improving their regulatory environments and

freeing up trade and transactions.

The growth arising from increased competitiveness and
productivity helps to enhance human and social capital, and to
reduce poverty. The same can be said of meeting the
requirements of trade agreements. For example, as the PRC has
started meeting its World Trade Organization (WTO)
commitments on agricultural liberalization, agricultural
incomes have risen as farmers shift to value-added crops. It is
expected that further improvements will occur as the PRC

addresses issues such as rural education and labor mobility.

The environmental challenges facing Asia and the Pacific
include problems of water allocation, habitat and species
conservation, and air pollution. Intergovernmental
organizations are the key players, including the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Mekong River
Commission, and the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities.
Although these organizations are making progress, the overall
institutional framework to address transboundary
environmental governance is incomplete. Decisions at the local,
national, and regional levels need to be more synchronized.
The outbreak of Avian flu in 2004 and the rapid spread of
HIV/AIDS along new economic corridors have severely affected
the poor. ADB is working in partnership with WHO to quickly
assess country readiness to react effectively to contain disease
outbreaks and to mobilize financial support. ADB’s Community
Action for Preventing HIV/AIDS, funded by the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction, focuses on source and destination areas of

 

mobile populations in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.
ADB is also actively facilitating the provision of regional public
goods in combating HIV/AIDS by providing access to
information about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS and about
the ways to successfully prevent the disease. Although proactive
regional approaches are making headway, more resources and

commitments from regional governments are needed.

In collaboration with UNICEF and other partners, ADB worked
with five countries—PRC, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, and Viet

Nam-—on national country investment plans for foodASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

 

REGIONAL COOPERATION

Strengthening Connectivity for
Sustainable, Pro-Poor Growth
Improving connectivity will not only
increase the volume of trade, it can
also affect the pattern of trade in a way
that increases competitiveness.
Connectivity will facilitate trade by
bringing down transaction costs and
making neighboring markets more
accessible.

From 1972 to 2004, ADB funded 18
regional investment projects totaling
$3,926 million with ADB providing
$1,361.3 million, and cofinancing of
$962.4 million had been mobilized for
8 of these projects. ADB has also
provided 95 technical assistance grants
totaling $57.8 million for the Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) program's
priority areas.

Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC)

ADB initiated the Central Asia Regional
Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program
in 1997. CAREC is also an alliance of
institutions that support regional
cooperation including the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, the
International Monetary Fund, the Islamic
Development Bank, the United Nations
Development Programme, and the World
Bank.

The primary objective of the CAREC
program is to promote economic growth
and raise living standards by encouraging
economic cooperation. The program
focuses on financing infrastructure
projects and improving the region's
policy environment in the priority areas
of water and energy, trade facilitation,
and transport. The goal is to lessen
Central Asia’s economic isolation;

maximize the potential benefits of
available natural resources such as
water, coal, and natural gas; and support
the development of policy frameworks
that enable trade within and beyond the
region.

Greater Mekong Subregion

ADB's strategy for 2004-2008 supports
sustainable pro-poor growth by
strengthening connectivity and facilitating
cross-border movements and tourism in
the GMS. This will be implemented
through priority subregional projects in
transport, energy, telecommunications,
and trade facilitation identified in the
plan of action endorsed by the 30 GMS
ministerial meeting in Vientiane, Lao
People’s Democratic Republic in
December 2004 to enhance connectivity,
competitiveness, and community. The
strategy also proposes developing an
updated and integrated master plan
beyond 2006 for the transport and energy
sectors, and extending assistance in
implementing key sector reforms to
foster the development of information
and communication technology,
particularly in the delivery of services to
the poor. Measures are also in place to
mitigate the negative impact of greater
connectivity, e.g., transmission of
communicable diseases, environmental
degradation, and trafficking in people
and wildlife.

Southeast Asia

Building connectivity in the archipelagic
geography of Indonesia, Malaysia, and
Philippines is a major undertaking
requiring carefully coordinated planning
of infrastructure links. In the more
remote islands of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations region this
enhanced connectivity is an essential

precondition for improving the livelihood
of local populations. ADB is currently
working with stakeholders to finalize its
first Regional Cooperation Strategy and
Program for Southeast Asia, in which
strengthened regional transport and
energy linkages are two of the core areas
of activity. Actual investments in
infrastructure are being complemented
by technical assistance to facilitate trade
through improved logistics, capacity
building in multimodal transport
planning, and harmonization.

South Asia

ADB promotes economic cooperation
and integration within South Asia and
beyond. In 2004, under the South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation
program, a transport loan was approved,
and several technical projects were
implemented or processed in six priority
areas: transport; energy; tourism;
environment; trade, investment, and
private sector cooperation; and
information and communication
technology. The Subregional Economic
Cooperation in South and Central Asia
program includes Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and
Uzbekistan, and Iran as an observer. Its
objective is to promote cooperation in
transport, transit, and trade. ADB is also
working with the South Asian Association
for Regional Cooperation to explore ways
in which it can assist with the regional
cooperation agenda.

MONETARY AND FINANCIAL
COOPERATION IN EAST ASIA

Monetary and financial cooperation in East Asia has gained
considerable momentum since the 1997 financial crisis
especially under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN)+3 Finance Ministers’ Process established in November
1999. Cooperation has proceeded in four main areas: economic
review and policy dialogue, the Chiang Mai Initiative, the Asian
Bond Market Initiative (ABMI), and the ASEAN+3 research

group.

The ASEAN+3 finance ministers meet annually and their
ministry and central bank deputies meet semiannually for
economic review and policy dialogue to discuss, among others,
major economic policy challenges facing the region and to
conduct reviews of one another's policies. Under the Chiang
Mai Initiative of May 2000, 16 bilateral swap agreements have
been signed for a total of $36 billion.

A more recent initiative of the ASEAN+3 finance ministers is the
ABMI of December 2002. An ABMI focal group and six working
groups have been established. The ASEAN+3 research group is
a network of some 30 regional think tanks that conduct
research to support the various components of the ASEAN+3
Finance Ministers’ Process.

The Regional Economic Monitoring Unit (REMU)' was
established by ADB in early 1999 in the wake of the 1997 Asian
financial crisis. It supports all of these components in various
ways. REMU prepares the semiannual Asia Economic Monitor
and the Asia Bond Monitor reports and provides technical
assistance to build developing member countries’ regional
economic policy-making and associated institutional capacities
and supports activities of various ABMI working groups. It also
conducts research on regional cooperation and integration and
recently has started extending support for ongoing efforts to
promote Asian economic integration by helping build bridges
between various Asian regions. REMU develops and maintains
the Asia Regional Information Center (aric.adb.org/index.asp)
and the AsianBondsOnline (asianbondsonline.adb.org/
regional/regional.php) websites.

1 Effective 1 April 2005, the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI)
was established to replace REMU. The mandate of OREI is to promote
economic cooperation and integration of the developing member
countries of ADB among themselves and to contribute to the harmonious
economic growth of the region as a whole.

gold), increased production of key commodities, the inflow of
foreign direct investment, and buoyant demand in export
markets were responsible for this impressive performance. In the
PRC, manufactured exports to international markets were
sustained by technological upgrading and aggressive marketing
driven by foreign direct investment and investments in

infrastructure and skills.

ADB's efforts to promote cooperation in the region were
strengthened by its Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) program. With strong ownership from
member countries and strategic alliances with development
partners, CAREC has evolved into a full-fledged, extensive
regional cooperation program in transport, energy, trade
facilitation, and trade policy. CAREC also promotes private
sector participation and greater cooperation with neighboring
countries in the south, particularly Afghanistan. At the third
ministerial conference in Astana, Kazakhstan in November,
members reaffirmed their commitment to working together and
agreed to prepare a comprehensive action plan up to 2007.
ADB completed its regional cooperation strategy and program
(RCSP) for CAREC member countries for 2004-2007.

strengthen ADB's effectiveness and relevance particularly in (i)
reducing project preparation time, (ii) exploring new areas for
operations, and (iii) improving the effectiveness of advisory
technical assistance. A joint task force identified ways to
streamline project processing. Dialogue with the government
identified innovative lending approaches and explored new
areas for future loans including agriculture and rural
development, energy conservation, financial sector reform, and
social development. The government and ADB agreed to
develop a sharper focus for advisory technical assistance, to
allocate more of these funds to strategically important areas,
to provide more training to executing agencies, to set up a
quarterly operational review system, and to establish an annual

award for advisory technical assistance projects.

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The overall objective of the
country strategy and program (CSP) for 2004-2006 is to reduce
poverty. This will be addressed primarily by promoting private
sector-led economic growth and support for human
development. The CSP emphasizes (i) agriculture as a key sector
for achieving pro-poor growth; (ii) the financial sector to
stimulate domestic savings and investment; (iii) improving trade
and road links with regional markets; and (iv) providing
primarily basic education and early childhood development.
The CSP is based on the development objectives and strategy
in the comprehensive development framework to 2010 and
the national poverty reduction strategy for 2003-2005, the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the strategic focus

external agencies, and ADB’s knowledge and experience in

the country.

ADB's policy dialogue focused on reforming customs, the
judicial system, and management of external assistance. Under
the regional trade facilitation and customs cooperation
program, the government revised the customs code to bring it
in line with international standards and conventions for
simplifying procedures and introduced modern controls.
Coordination between customs and other revenue collection

agencies was improved.

Under the second ADB corporate governance and enterprise
reform program, the government undertook constitutional
changes, amendments to the law on joint stock companies to
improve corporate governance, streamlining adjudication to
resolve commercial disputes quickly, and protection of creditors’
rights. ADB provided technical assistance to improve donor
coordination, to strengthen project management in line

ministries, and to plan public investment.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Two loans for $40.3 million
were approved: one for $32.8 million for rehabilitation of the
southern transport corridor road and one for $7.5 million as a

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. A new CSP is under preparation
to provide an updated framework to identify and target future
ADB interventions. It will take account of significant, recent
demographic changes, accelerated rural migration to urban
areas, structural changes in the economic system, and new
capacity building needs. More importantly, the new CSP will
seek to address Mongolia’s persistent high levels of poverty. In
order to help Mongolia achieve the MDGs, ADB must continue
to promote economic growth for job creation and to improve
essential services for the poor. Following parliamentary
elections in June 2004, policy dialogue with the new
government has focused on further reform to the financial
system, updating the education strategy, and urban
development.

Loan and Technical Assistance. ADB approved a loan of
$37.1 million for the regional road development project to
complete the north-south corridor linking the country with its
major trading and investment markets, the PRC and the
Russian Federation. ADB also approved and fully disbursed a
financing package of $6.1 million to the Trade and
Development Bank of Mongolia that includes an equity
investment of $1.6 million in exchange for a 10% stake along
with a $4.5 million subordinated loan. This is ADB’s first
private sector investment in Mongolia. Seven technical

Uzbekistan

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. ADB’s strategy for Uzbekistan
focuses on reducing poverty and promoting regional
cooperation. The government's living standards strategy was
completed in July 2004 with ADB assistance. It affirms the
government’s commitment to poverty reduction and outlines
the main strategic policies to be implemented to improve living
standards up to 2010. ADB’s efforts to bring the economic
benefits of cooperation to the region include encouraging
Uzbekistan and its neighbors to strengthen regional
infrastructure, particularly in energy, transport, and trade
facilitation.

The second textbook development project addressed the
availability and affordability of textbooks in basic education
along with curriculum reform and encouraged private sector
involvement in publishing and printing. The health project for
women and children supported government policy reforms
integrating primary health care into the medical system,
developing the resources of medical personnel, streamlining
health care financing, and strengthening the blood safety
program.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Two loans totaling $65.0
million were approved for the textbook and health projects. Six
technical assistance activities totaling $2.5 million were also
approved.

Mekong

The region comprises five countries sharing the Mekong River,
namely Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao
PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Greater Mekong

 

Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program also includes

the People’s Republic of China.

Real GDP growth ranged between 6 and 7.5% in 2004.
National estimates indicate that the incidence of poverty
dropped from a range of 27-58% in 1990-1994 to 10-36% in
1997-2003. Poverty levels remain high, however, particularly in

rural areas.

Two important developments during the year were the
formation of a new government in Cambodia following the
2003 elections and ratification of Cambodia's accession to
WTO. Negotiations for WTO membership for the Lao PDR and
Viet Nam continued. Another milestone was the completion of
all preparations for opening the resident mission in Thailand
which is expected to play a pivotal role in strengthening ADB's

partnerships with the government.

A number of initiatives accelerated concrete results and
promoted long-term effectiveness and impact for the GMS. The
GMS road map in the RCSP for 2004-2008 was approved in
March. Seventeen regional technical assistance projects were
also approved with ADB contributions of $7 million. The
Mekong Development Forum in Paris in June and the PublicPrivate Consultation Meeting in Bangkok in September
attracted a broader range of development partners to
participate in the GMS. The year culminated with a highly
successful 13 GMS Ministerial Conference in December in
Vientiane, Lao PDR that noted the substantial progress
achieved in enhancing connectivity, increasing competitiveness,

and building a greater sense of community. The conference

Coastal areas of Myanmar and Thailand were affected by the
tsunami on 26 December. In Thailand, six provinces in the
southern part of the country—Krabi, Phang-Nga, Phuket,
Ranong, Satun, and Trang—bore the major effects, including
substantial loss of life, assets, and livelihoods though the

impact on Thailand's overall economy is expected to be limited.

In Myanmar, the damage was much less. The coastal villages
affected included the townships of Labutta and Ngaputaw in
the Ayeyawady Delta, Kawthoung in Taninthayi Division, and
some townships of Rakhine State.

Cambodia

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. ADB prepared a new CSP
2005-2009 to support implementation of the government’s
rectangular strategy for growth, employment, equity, and
efficiency. In line with the priorities and strategies identified
in the strategy, the CSP will focus on (i) broad-based
economic growth through investments in physical
infrastructure, development of the financial sector, support
for greater regional integration, sustainable development of
SMEs, and investments in agriculture and irrigation;

(ii) inclusive social development focusing on education,
gender mainstreaming, controlling communicable diseases,
the provision of rural water supply and sanitation facilities,
and community-based, sustainable management and
conservation of natural resources in the Tonle Sap Basin;
and (iii) good governance supporting improvements in public

financial management and decentralization to strengthen

public service delivery, improve accountability, and reduce

corruption.

Support will continue for legal, regulatory, and institutional
reforms to improve corporate governance and efficiency in the
sectors in which ADB operates. A geographic (Tonle Sap Basin)
and subregional focus (GMS) supported one of the poorest and
environmentally sensitive regions of Cambodia and provided
benefits from the opportunities provided by regional
cooperation. The CSP was based on wide-ranging consultations
with the government, donors, civil society, and the private
sector. ADB, the World Bank, and the United Kingdom’s
Department for International Development and later the UN
System closely cooperated and coordinated on country
strategies and policy dialogue to reduce transaction costs to

the government.

Loans and Technical Assistance. ADB approved three loans
totaling $65 million for two projects. A program loan and a
project loan will increase educational opportunities for the
poor through policy reforms, institutional capacity building,
developing facilities, decentralized technical and vocational
education and training, and targeting education incentives to
the poor. The other project will create an enabling environment
for SMEs by establishing a development framework, enhancing
governance and business regulations, improving access to
finance, and assisting in the development of business services
and public-private partnerships. Twelve technical assistance
activities totaling $4.6 million and two grants from the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction totaling $4.0 million were also
approved.

where the incidence of poverty remains high. ADB also helped
Viet Nam to modernize and/or expand economic infrastructure
using OCR. Policy operations focused on reducing structural
weaknesses and improving the business environment for private

public administration system. ADB also supported the
establishment of a regulatory framework for the insurance and

financial sector program loan.

The SME development project will enhance the policy and
regulatory framework, improve access to finance and land use
rights, and help increase access to domestic and international

including a research and capacity building initiative on making
markets work better for the poor.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Six loans totaling

$296.4 million were approved to support the government's
efforts to (i) develop alternative channels of market-based
financial intermediation; (ii) create a business environment
conducive to economic growth and generating employment;
(iii) improve the quality, efficiency, access, and management of

The Pacific

The Pacific DMCs face significant challenges in generating
broad-based, sustained economic growth from small, high-cost,
narrowly focused economies. Some are on track to achieve the
MDGs while others are not making significant progress. Poverty
is a growing concern in many. HIV/AIDS threatens to destroy
progress in Papua New Guinea and potentially elsewhere in the

region.

The aggregate GDP increased by 2.4% with the two largest
economies (the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea) growing

solidly due to strong tourism performance and improved

 

commodity prices, respectively. Timor-Leste emerged from
recession. Solomon Islands rebounded from previous instability
albeit high growth involved unsustainable rates of logging of
natural forests. More generally, the region benefited from
strong commodity prices and higher returns in overseas
financial markets. Some progress was made in formulating and
implementing the private sector development reform agenda
including initiatives on the productive and economic uses of
land, reforms of the legal business environment, and
rationalization of state-owned enterprises.

Political instability, or the threat of it, remained a major
concern in Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu. Voters in Nauru
elected a reformist government after years of economic
mismanagement. Governance challenges, including corruption,
persisted, but there were also notable improvements in fiscal
management, particularly in Papua New Guinea, Solomon
Islands, and Vanuatu. On the other hand, the potential burden
of underperforming public enterprises was demonstrated by the
bankruptcy of Royal Tongan Airlines and continued support for

Samoa’s Polynesian Airlines.

The Board of Directors endorsed the Pacific strategy for 20052009 in November. It takes the expressed priorities of the
poor—opportunities to earn cash income and better access to
basic social services—as its starting point. Key result areas fall
under three strategic objectives: (i) to support an environment
conducive for the private sector, (ii) to enhance the supply of

and demand for good basic social services, and (iii) to promote
effective development. Detailed strategies will be developed at
the country level with a strong focus on governance and

building demand for effective markets and services.

The South Pacific Subregional Office in Suva, Fiji Islands was
officially opened in June 2004, and the Papua New Guinea
resident mission in Port Moresby and the Pacific Liaison and
Coordination Office in Sydney, Australia will be formally
inaugurated in 2005. These new offices significantly enhance

ADB’s capacity to deliver the Pacific strategy.

partnership with the private sector and the government.
ADB's operational strategy focused on public investment in
productive physical infrastructure in key sectors; on
strengthening the associated policy, institutional capacity,
and regulatory frameworks; and on supporting increased
private sector participation and competition in public
enterprise operations. The sector focus included
transportation and communications; energy; alternative
agriculture livelihoods and fisheries; urban water supply,
sanitation, and waste management; and the further
development of capital markets and banking. Policy
dialogue focused on the Pacific plan to enhance

and the balance was canceled on 2 October 2002. Subsequent
governments reversed the reform measures previously agreed
making it difficult for ADB to proceed with subsequent releases.
A new reform-minded government was elected on 23 October
2004, and ADB has recommenced assistance starting with
technical assistance to support national policy formulation and
national planning. Nauru has an outstanding loan service

payment that prevents further loan assistance.

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans or technical

assistance activities were approved in 2004.

Palau

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. Palau became a member of
ADB on 29 December 2003. No CSP has been formulated as
yet, but discussions on a private sector development policy with
the United States Department of the Interior were initiated.

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans or technical

assistance activities have yet been approved for Palau.

financial management and public service reform. For private
sector development, ADB is helping to improve policy and
institutional frameworks (agriculture and fisheries), enhance
factor productivity (microfinance services), and improve market
access with transport infrastructure investments especially in
tural areas. In the social sectors, ADB will continue to assist in
policy development in health and to support water and
sanitation and service delivery. ADB, the Australian Agency for
International Development, and the World Bank are aiming to
develop a strategy for activities, based on joint diagnostic work

to improve the effectiveness of assistance.

Loans and Technical Assistance. One loan of $19.0 million
was approved for the community water transport project. A

total of $500,000 was approved for technical assistance.

sanitation sectors will improve the physical business
environment. ADB will continue to support government
efforts to increase public participation in urban
management and planning; to foster good corporate
governance, especially in state-owned enterprises; and to
continue the dialogue on appropriate poverty reduction
strategies. Assistance for improving the access to and quality
of primary and secondary education will continue as will
programs that provide information and communication
technology to rural schools and create community access
facilities. Given the number of development partners in the
education sector, a government-led multipartner approach is
vital to systematically address emerging issues in a longterm strategic approach.

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans were approved in
2004. Three technical assistance grants totaling $700,000 were
approved for supporting privatization, preparing the 20062014 education policy and strategic plan, and strengthening

state-owned enterprise corporate governance.

Solomon Islands

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The country strategy’s
overarching goal was rapid, pro-poor, private sector-led
economic growth. In support of the government’s national
economic recovery, reform, and development plan for 20032006, ADB will provide transportation infrastructure and
services and strengthen the enabling environment for the
private sector. To address these objectives, ADB will focus on

building capacity and on promoting good governance.

Key strategies for overcoming the constraints in the business
environment include regulatory reforms; development of
transport infrastructure and services particularly in aviation
and shipping; reforming state-owned enterprises; financial
sector reforms including the collateral framework; provision of
policy and governance advice to provincial governments;
development of statistics to inform policy formulation,
monitoring, and evaluation; and formulation of sector policies
to promote investment and growth. The improvement of interisland transportation and reforms of the state-owned enterprise
sector are priority pillars of ADB’s medium-term operational
assistance portfolio and policy dialogue. Solomon Islands will
be able to access the ADF IX grant facility as a result of its
classification as a poor, postconflict country.

Loans and Technical Assistance. In 2004, no loans were
approved. ADB approved three technical assistance grants
amounting to $1.9 million of which $650,000 came from the
Government of Australia. These were for state-owned enterprise
reforms and private sector participation, institutional
strengthening of the ministry of infrastructure and
development, and diagnostic assessment of inter-island

transport.

Timor-Leste

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The strategy identified reducing
poverty and improving the people’s quality of life through
equitable and sustainable economic growth as its main
objectives. This is consistent with the national development
plan formulated in 2002 and its associated road map. ADB

assistance focused on (i) support for physical infrastructure

for Timor-Leste; (ii) support for microfinance development by
enhancing the sustainability of the microfinance institution;
and (iii) establishing appropriate institutional, policy, and
regulatory frameworks in selected ministries, in particular
through capacity development in the water sector and in public
financial management. Technical assistance was provided to
strengthen government capacity in planning for and managing
the revenues from the Timor Sea oil and gas fields. Support
was also provided to develop sector investment programs to
strengthen the links between the national development plan
and the national budget. Local government capacity was
strengthened through the provision of a comprehensive training
effort to local district administrators. Timor-Leste is eligible to
access ADF IX funds as a result of its classification as a poor,
postconflict country.

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans were approved in
2004. ADB approved three technical assistance activities
amounting to $900,000 for capacity building in the ministry of
planning and finance to monitor the national development
plan to strengthen microfinance operations, and to strengthen

financial management capacity.

growing disparity in economic opportunities between urban and
rural dwellers with further assistance planned for technical and

vocational education and development of productive rural skills.

The government gives priority to (i) improving governance and
public service delivery via strengthened law enforcement and
macroeconomic management, (ii) improving the lives of rural
people through better access to markets and better
management of natural resources, (iii) raising private
investment by lowering obstacles to private enterprise,

(iv) enabling greater stakeholder participation in policy
formulation, and (v) increasing equity in access to services and
employment opportunities.

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans were approved, but
two technical assistance grants amounting to $1.3 million were
approved in 2004. These were for the development of a
medium-term strategic framework and secured transactions
reforms.

South Asia

The year 2004 ended with the tsunami in India, Maldives, and
Sri Lanka that are likely to increase poverty and retard
progress toward achieving the MDGs. The economic toll in
South Asia was highest in the Maldives and Sri Lanka; their
projected growth rates for 2005 were accordingly revised
downwards. Although India’s death toll was in the thousands,
the economic impact was limited. ADB pledged to assist all
three countries and made considerable funding available to

help finance reconstruction and rehabilitation.

The disaster marked the end of a year of mixed results. Robust
economic growth helped to reduce income poverty substantially,
but progress on the nonincome MDGs was mixed. Mortality
rates for children under five were substantially reduced, and
primary school enrolment and completion rates increased. At
the same time, progress in child malnutrition, maternal
mortality, and gender balance in education and health
outcomes was not as significant. Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS
were also a cause for continuing concern.

Macroeconomic performance was robust although weaker than
in the previous year. GDP growth slowed to 6.4% while
inflation rose to 5.5%. Less favorable weather conditions, price
increases for metals and petroleum products, and slower than
anticipated growth in the global economy were the main
causes behind the somewhat weaker performance.

 

The region continued to face economic challenges. Several
countries recorded surpluses in their current accounts that
reflected an excess of national savings over national
investment. Measures should be taken to step up investment. In
addition, the surpluses resulted in an unprecedented

accumulation of foreign reserves.

The multifiber arrangement, a system of quotas that regulated
the textile trade, came to an end in 2004 and could have an
impact on the location of production. The quotas made a
number of smaller South Asian countries heavily dependent on
textile exports, raising concerns that producers could move
operations. Adequate infrastructure investment will prove

crucial for retaining competitiveness.

With the success of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) summit in January 2004 and
improvements in relations between India and Pakistan, the
prospects for regional economic cooperation have greatly
improved and a program of cooperation with SAARC focusing
initially on transport has started. Members of the South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation program endorsed a plan
for developing subregional tourism with great interest from
potential development partners and the private sector. As part
of the Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central
Asia program, ADB assisted with the Central and South Asia
Transport and Trade Forum (CSATTF), focusing on developing
corridors connecting landlocked countries with ports in the
Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf via Afghanistan. A CSATTF
customs cooperation plan was developed for implementation
during 2005-2007.

Afghanistan

At the January 2002 Tokyo conference, ADB pledged to deliver
loan and grant assistance of some $500 million over 2.5 years.
At the April 2004 International Conference on Afghanistan and
the International Community (Berlin Conference), ADB pledged
to consider additional assistance of some $800 million in ADF
loans and grants during 2005-2008. ADB also identified loan
and equity investments of up to $100 million in partnership with
local and foreign investors and guarantees of about $100 million
to catalyze private investments. With these pledges, ADB will
provide Afghanistan with more than $1 billion in assistance in
2005-2008 and more than $1.5 billion in 2002-2008.

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. In 2004 ADB continued to
support Afghanistan's reconstruction and development by
helping to build national capacity, by assisting in the establishment of appropriate policy and institutional frameworks, and
by rehabilitating essential infrastructure. At the request of the
government, ADB’s assistance continued to focus on transport
(roads and civil aviation), energy (power and gas), natural
resource management (agriculture, irrigation, and environment),
and on governance and the financial sector. ADB’s private sector
interventions focused on banking and telecommunications.

In 2004, ADB assistance was directed to rebuilding a key
portion of the national road network and rehabilitation of
regional airports. ADB also helped to establish a sound
agriculture policy framework and efficient sector institutions
including systems for managing sustainable use of the country’s
natural resources. Capacity development was featured through
an ambitious program of technical assistance.

Policy dialogue focused on the development of a framework for
agricultural investment, improved efficiency of agricultural
support services, the restructuring of state-owned enterprises,
and improved fiscal management. Support also was given to
promote private sector activity and to attract foreign direct
investment through cofinancing an investment guarantee

facility to provide political risk guarantees.

Loans and Technical Assistance. In 2004, ADB approved five
loans totaling $205.0 million for five projects to further
support the reconstruction of Afghanistan’s primary road
network, to rehabilitate seven regional airports, to support
market-based agriculture sector policy reforms and
organizational capacity building, to help finance the
Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF) and a newly
established mobile communications telephone network. ADB
also approved a $10 million political risk guarantee for the
AIG and a $2.6 million equity investment representing a 25%
stake in the Afghanistan International Bank. Also approved in
2004 was a $10 million project grant financed through the
JFPR to rehabilitate and upgrade traditional irrigation
structures and to improve water management in Afghanistan’s
Balkh River basin. Fourteen technical assistance grants totaling

$13.6 million were also approved.

urban sectors. In the energy sector, the thrust was on further
progress toward autonomy and commercialization of sector
entities. In the transport sector, the focus was on formulating
the national land transport policy and on enhancing the
efficiency of port operations through computerization and

environmental improvements including containing oil spills.

The assistance program emphasized development of SMEs,
improved quality of secondary education, improved urban flood
protection, enhancing port capacity, and meeting international
port security and environmental standards. For the development
of SMEs, the stress was on strengthening the policy
environment and improving access to credit and support
services. A gender action plan will ensure the participation of
women entrepreneurs in policy making, training programs, and

credit fund allocations.

ADB's assistance will boost efficiency and security at
Bangladesh’s Chittagong Port. The emphasis will be on
installing modern computer systems to expedite cargo
processing which will lead to lower shipping and port-handling
charges and will foster greater international trade. Several
procedural and operational improvements will be addressed.
These include enhancement of personnel skills, a strategic plan
for increasing productivity and cutting costs, support for the
preparation of an anticorruption strategy, modernization of
procedures, revisions to tariffs, and better environmental
management.

Bhutan

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. ADB’s CSP is fully consistent
with the objectives of the October 2001 poverty partnership
agreement, Bhutan’s development philosophy of gross national
happiness, and the development priorities outlined in the ninth
5-year plan which include strengthening infrastructure,
improving the quality of social services, ensuring good
governance, promoting private sector growth, and generating
employment. The operational program focuses on road
infrastructure, rural electrification, urban infrastructure, and

promotion of the private sector.

In support of the government’s development objectives, in 2004
ADB also provided support for capacity development in public
resource management in the Department of Planning, the
Statistics Bureau, Bhutan Electricity Authority, the Department
of Aid and Debt Management, and the Department of Budget
and Accounts of the Ministry of Finance. Dialogue

concerning ADB’s safeguard policies was also undertaken. In

developments since the 2003 CSP confirm the validity of
mainstreaming poverty reduction through infrastructure-led
growth supported by social development and good governance.
In line with the new government's priorities, some aspects of the
strategy were strengthened in the CSPU for 2005-2007, namely
ADB's operations in agriculture and rural development (including
integrated water resource management and agribusiness
development), and the shift in focus to poorer states and less

management systems remained the backbone of ADB’s
assistance. Transport sector operations focused on
strengthening connectivity to link poor rural families to
markets and social services in cities, towns, and ports while
energy sector operations assisted with power sector reforms,
promotion of more efficient, renewable energy sources,
upgrading transmission and distribution systems, and
encouraging energy conservation. Urban sector projects
combined infrastructure development with targeted poverty
reduction components and strong elements of municipal
governance and policy reforms. ADB’s private sector
development program focused on rationalizing capital market
regulations and extending the securities market. Social
development goals were addressed in components of physical
infrastructure and other economic projects. ADB also provided
assistance for comprehensive fiscal reforms in several states
including Kerala and Assam and technical assistance to
modernize central tax administration. ADB’s ongoing policy
dialogue with the government and various executing agencies
focused on improving state policy environments and in critical
sectors such as power, transport, urban infrastructure, finance,

and agriculture and rural development.

Loans and Technical Assistance. In 2004, ADB approved six
loans amounting to $1.3 billion covering five projects for
upgrading national highways, an inter-state power transmission
system, reconstruction work in the states of Jammu and
Kashmir, a policy loan for implementing fiscal reforms and
improving governance in the state of Assam, and one private
sector loan for a power generation plant involving an equity

investment of $20.6 million. Two equity investment projects

were approved in 2004—$20 million in a private sector equity
fund, and $9.7 million in a liquefied natural gas terminal which
also involved a partial credit guarantee facility for $65.3 million.
ADB launched its first local (rupee) currency bond issue for

Rs5 billion (about $110 million) in February 2004—the first such
issue by ADB in a DMC. This will enable ADB to offer rupeedenominated loans to private sector borrowers thus protecting
them against exchange rate risks since most ADB-financed
projects generate revenues in local currency. Sixteen technical
assistance activities for $11.2 million were also approved.

Maldives

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The CSP and poverty
partnership agreement of 2002 set priorities that are still
relevant and should be pursued even in the wake of the
tsunami: (i) improving physical and public infrastructure in the
atolls; (ii) reducing economic vulnerability by diversifying
economic activity; (iii) creating an enabling environment for
private-sector development and new sources of employment;
(iv) supporting good governance especially by improving public
sector managerial efficiency and promoting legal and judicial
reforms; and (vy) raising the level of social development through
support to postsecondary education and developing
employment skills.

The tsunami was a national disaster. Thirty-nine islands were
significantly damaged and nearly a third of the 300,000
inhabitants were severely affected; they will continue to suffer
unless immediate mitigating measures are taken. About 7% of
the population was displaced, and the livelihoods of thousands

were undermined. Total damages were estimated to be about

Loans and Technical Assistance. No loans were approved in
2004. Three technical assistance grants totaling $1 million were
approved for commercializing agriculture, strengthening the
education framework toward vision 2020, and developing

domestic maritime transport.

Nepal

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. ADB formulated a new CSP for
Nepal for 2005-2009 to support implementation of the
government’s poverty reduction strategy embodied in the Tenth
Plan (2003-2007). It is ADB’s first results-based CSP and was
the outcome of extensive consultations with the government,
local community groups and leaders, civil society, the private
sector, and other development partners. To respond to the
special implementation challenges posed by the ongoing
conflict, the CSP proposes more flexible assistance modalities,
wider community participation in project design and

implementation, and greater transparency in ADB operations.

Policy dialogue with the government focused on adopting a
common development results framework, capacity building of
key government institutions, and an effective monitoring
mechanism for the new results-based CSP. ADB also engaged in
extensive dialogue with the government on key policy reforms
set out in the Tenth Plan and provided support for introducing

legislative reforms to empower women and amend
discriminatory laws against them. ADB continued to support
governance reforms focusing on improving the efficiency of the
civil service, reducing corruption, and automating civil servants’
and teachers’ personnel records. Public sector management
reforms were also supported for privatization of public
enterprises, prudent fiscal management, decentralization, and
corporate and financial governance. In collaboration with other
development partners, ADB also supported power sector
reforms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the Nepal
Electricity Authority through restructuring and establishing a
regulatory institution.

Loans and Technical Assistance. ADB approved five loans
totaling $110 million for gender equality and the empowerment
of women, for decentralized rural infrastructure and livelihood,
for a community-managed irrigation project, a skills for
employment project, and a subregional transport facilitation
project. ADB also approved 10 technical assistance grants
totaling $3.2 million.

Pakistan

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. Following successful economic
reforms resulting in significant improvements in Pakistan’s
macroeconomic fundamentals in recent years, ADB engaged the
government in extensive policy dialogue on the need to
accelerate growth to ensure that the benefits of reform reach
the poor. The results of this dialogue are reflected in the CSPU
for 2005-2006 in which ADB agreed to provide support for
achieving sustained high growth. To this end, ADB will provide
assistance for infrastructure projects that would have the

greatest impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. At
the same time, the emphasis on supporting improved
governance and decentralizing the delivery of social services

will be maintained.

As part of the strategic dialogue, ADB completed a major
report on Pakistan's devolution reform that was published as a
three-volume series in June 2004. This report responded to the
government's request for a series of empirically robust and
practically oriented recommendations on the way forward for
further devolution. ADB continued support for provincial public
resource management reforms and decentralized social service
delivery. In this regard, a major reform package was approved
for Balochistan to support fiscal and financial reforms, to
improve administrative frameworks and public-private
partnerships for effective public service delivery, and to create
an enabling environment for private sector development. A
social sector reform and investment program in Punjab was
also approved to support increased allocations for social

sectors.

To directly support poverty reduction and create employment,
assistance was approved for strengthening technical education
and the vocational training system and making it more market
oriented in Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province
(NWFP). ADB also supported sustainable rural livelihoods in
districts with a high incidence of poverty in Punjab to enhance
access to land, water, markets, services, agriculture inputs,
technology, and employment for the poor. In its first-ever
support for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), ADB provided

assistance for improving living conditions, quality of life, and

economic prospects in the area by rehabilitating and
reconstructing essential physical and social infrastructure.
Finally, the emphasis on improving subregional cooperation was
maintained and assistance was provided to strengthen regional
connectivity between Pakistan and Afghanistan and to promote
trade and commercial ties between South and Central Asian

countries.

Loans and Technical Assistance. ADB approved 11 loans
totaling $709.2 million for seven projects: assistance for
sustainable livelihood improvement in Punjab; multisector
rehabilitation in AJK; public resource management in
Balochistan; technical education and vocational training in
Balochistan and NWFP; devolved social services in Punjab; and
road development and subregional connectivity in NWFP.
Twenty-three technical assistance grants totaling $28.9 million

were also approved.

Sri Lanka

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The CSPU for 2005-2006 was
prepared, but the new government elected in April 2004
adopted different policies in a number of areas and sectors. As
a consequence, it became necessary to reassess ADB operations
in light of the new priorities which place greater emphasis on
the development of rural and peripheral areas and on poverty
reduction but less emphasis on private sector-led economic

growth.

The 2004 CSP followed the poverty partnership agreement
signed in March 2002 and focused on private sector

development, governance, and reducing poverty related to

conflict. ADF lending was mainly directed to the education and
the transport sectors. Technical assistance also supported
private sector development, transport and infrastructure
development, and conflict-affected communities. A
macroeconomic assessment covering progress in economic
reforms and analyzing the country’s debt sustainability was
carried out to inform and strengthen the CSP and policy
debate.

The 26 December tsunami struck more than 1,000 kilometers
(two thirds) of Sri Lanka’s coastline. Coastal infrastructure
(roads, railway, power, telecommunications, water supply, and
fishing ports) was significantly affected; the overall loss of
assets has been estimated at 4.4% of GDP with reconstruction
costs rising to $1.5 billion or 7% of GDP. Given its
concentration on the northern and eastern coastal areas, the
tsunami affected a disproportionately large share of the poor
engaged in fishing, subsistence agriculture, and small-scale
trading. The human impact, in terms of lives lost and
livelihoods and families destroyed was staggering, and there is
a real possibility that poverty will become further entrenched if
the already disadvantaged do not benefit from the
reconstruction program and do not regain the means to
support themselves.

Norwegian-led efforts at restarting peace talks, stalled since
April 2003, were not successful, but all parties involved remain
committed to maintaining the cease-fire. ADB continued to
implement conflict-sensitive programs and projects and was
actively involved in the formulation of guiding principles for
tsunami aid that stress the importance of the "do no harm”

principle and of conflict awareness.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Eight loans totaling $195.0
million were approved for five projects. The projects aim to
modernize secondary education, to develop the road sector, to
continue support for postconflict restoration and development
in the northeast, to strengthen fiscal management, and to
support financial markets for private sector development. Four
technical assistance grants totaling about $4.0 million were
also approved including $1.7 million for strengthening the
domestic debt market and $1 million for preparing a road
sector master plan. A grant from the JFPR for $1.5 million was
also approved for the power fund for the poor.

Southeast Asia

Southeast Asia, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, and the
Philippines, contains 60% of the population and production
base of ASEAN. Malaysia, with a GDP per capita of $4,175, is
firmly established as a middle-income country and has laid a
strong foundation for further development. Indonesia and the
Philippines have also developed into middle-income countries
but still face many of the problems of low-income countries
including high poverty rates. Their challenges are compounded
by their geography and ethnic diversity; together they contain
over 21,000 islands and over 900 spoken languages.

GDP growth soared in 2004 fueled by a continuing surge in
demand for regional exports and by solid domestic demand. All
three exceeded projections with growth at 5.1% in Indonesia
(up from 4.1% in 2003), 7.2% in Malaysia (up from 5.2%), and
6.1% in the Philippines (up from 4.7%). Strong economic

growth in Japan and the United States (US) and only a
moderate slowdown in the PRC created a very positive export
environment though growth in Malaysia and the Philippines
slowed in the second half of the year as sharply higher world
market prices for oil and an uncertain outlook for the US
economy moderated demand. Recent rankings showed declines
in competitiveness for Indonesia and the Philippines that
dampened foreign and domestic investment in the face of
intense competitive pressures from other emerging economies
of Asia.

Progress toward MDG 1, eradicating extreme poverty and
hunger by 2015, was significant. Based on present trends, the
incidence of poverty using the $1-a-day standard is expected
to be close to zero in Malaysia and to be 2.5% and 7.2% of
the population in Indonesia and the Philippines, respectively.
The record of achievement of nonincome MDGs has been
mixed. All three countries performed extremely well in primary
education (MDG 2), in gender indicators for MDG 3, and in
reducing the under-five mortality rate (MDG 4). The last was
halved or nearly halved in all three between 1990 and 2001.
However, all three have fallen well short of hunger indicators
(MDG 1.2) as measured by the percentage of children who are
moderately or severely underweight. Declines of 35-26% in
Indonesia, 23-18% in Malaysia, and 30-28% in Philippines
were registered during the period.

A key focus of ADB’s work in 2004 was regional cooperation.
A series of consultations in all three countries and in Singapore
led to the preparation of the first Southeast Asian RCSP which

focused on enhancing competitiveness and on building

connectivity for more isolated parts of the region. The program
is designed to support ASEAN’s new Vientiane plan of action,
and to mobilize resources inside and outside of ADB to

promote economic integration.

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. The 2002 CSP addressed the
main medium-term needs of the economy and recognized the
need for a geographic focus by introducing a three-tier system
that encouraged the grouping of projects in common areas.
The 2005 CSP will adopt a sharper focus and introduce further
selectivity in terms of sectors and the criteria for identifying
geographic areas in the context of management for
development results and the review of the poverty reduction
strategy. Support for 2005 will be formulated at a time when
there will be a significant focus on post-tsunami rehabilitation
and reconstruction in the provinces of Aceh and North

Sumatra.

In 2004, portfolio administration at the resident mission was
strengthened. It is expected that by the end of 2005, it will be
administering about half of the portfolio of 36 loans

(33 projects). Enhanced quality control mechanisms and
stringent readiness criteria adopted for new loans should reduce

start-up delays.

Loans and Technical Assistance. Two loans were approved in
2004 for the state audit reform sector development program to
support policy and capacity-building initiatives to create an
auditing sector that operates to internationally accepted
standards: a $200 million program loan and a $25 million
investment loan. Twenty-four technical assistance grants
totaling $17.6 million and a grant from the JFPR for $1.5

million were approved.

Malaysia

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. Malaysia has not availed of
new loans from any major multilateral finance institution in
recent years. In November, ADB issued its debut Malaysian
ringgit (RM) bonds in the domestic capital market with a
principal amount of RM400 million and a bullet maturity of 5
years. This was a landmark event in ADB's efforts to support
bond market expansion in the region and reflected the rapid
development of the Malaysian financial market regulatory
regime. In 2004, Malaysia announced a $5 million contribution
to ADF Kx, its first contribution since ADF VII. In addition,
Malaysia remained an active partner in subregional activities
supported by ADB.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Strategy and Policy Dialogue. Due to steadily tightening
government fiscal conditions and uncertain financing
mechanisms, several high priority projects reaching advanced
stages of preparation in 2004 were put on hold. A new CSP
reflecting current fiscal constraints is under preparation.
Meanwhile, ADB (i) addressed fiscal imbalance through
interventions in the power sector, the single largest contributor
to the consolidated fiscal deficit and largest drain on public
sector finances; (ii) supported decentralization and managing
local government unit (LGU) revenues and expenditures; and
(iii) developed programs in governance, health systems, and

operations. By improving the local investment climate, longterm partnerships will be established with financially sound and
well-managed LGUs to undertake development projects without

national government budget support.

ADB collaborated with the government, the World Bank and
the Japan Bank for International Cooperation to achieve a
more manageable portfolio and efficient project
implementation. The government and ADB conducted two
exercises on portfolio management and performance
monitoring and evaluation. Despite adverse impacts on
disbursements due to budget constraints, the portfolio showed

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS

Overview

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is an international
development finance institution whose vision is to make Asia
and the Pacific free of poverty. ADB was established in 1966
through the “Agreement Establishing the Asian Development
Bank” (the Charter), ratified by 31 countries to promote the
social and economic development of the region and reduce
poverty. As of 31 December 2004, ADB had 63 members,

45 of which are in the region.

ADB provides various forms of financial assistance to its
developing member countries (DMCs). The main instruments are
loans, technical assistance, grants, guarantees, and equity
investments. These instruments are financed through ordinary
capital resources (OCR), Special Funds, and various trust funds.
OCR and Special Funds are used to finance operations that are
solely under ADB administration. Trust funds are externally
funded and are administered by ADB on behalf of donors. The
Charter requires that funds from each resource be kept

separate from the others.

ADB also provides policy dialogues and advisory services and
mobilizes financial resources through its cofinancing operations
tapping official, commercial, and export credit sources to
maximize the development impact of its assistance.
Cofinancing for ADB projects can be in the form of loans,
technical assistance, grant components of loan projects, or

credit enhancement products such as guarantees.

Ordinary Capital Resources

Funding for OCR comes from three distinct sources: funds
borrowed from private placements and capital markets, paid-in
capital provided by shareholders, and accumulated retained
income (reserves). The financial strength of OCR is largely
based on the support of shareholders and on financial policies
and practices. Shareholder support is reflected in the form of
capital backing from members and in the record of borrowing

members in meeting their debt service obligations.

Borrowed funds, together with equity, are used to fund OCR
lending and investment activities as well as general operations.
Loans are generally made to DMCs and to private borrowers
that have attained a higher level of economic development.
Public sector loans are priced on a cost pass-through basis in

which the cost of funding the loans plus a lending spread is

passed through to the borrowers. Private sector loans are priced

based on market practice.

With the introduction of London interbank offered rate
(LIBOR)-based loans (LBL) and the retirement of other loan
products, ADB has evolved into a full-fledged LIBOR-based
lender. In view of the higher interest rates charged for poolbased loans compared with LIBOR-based loans and the general
trend in the interest rate environment, prepayments of poolbased loans of $2.8 billion were received in 2004.

In addition to direct lending, ADB also provides guarantees to
assist DMC governments and private borrowers in securing
commercial funds for ADB-assisted projects. ADB has
experienced strong and growing demand for guarantees as

credit enhancement products.

Basis of Financial Reporting

Statutory Reporting. Table | presents financial data for 2004.
ADB prepares its financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
(US). Effective 1 January 2001, ADB complied with Financial
Accounting Standards (FAS) 133, “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and its related
amendments (collectively referred to as FAS 133). FAS 133
allow hedge accounting only if qualifying criteria are met. An
assessment of those criteria indicated that most of ADB's
derivative transactions are highly effective in hedging the
underlying transactions and are appropriate for reducing
funding costs. However, applying FAS 133 hedge criteria does
not entirely reflect ADB’s risk management and hedging
strategies. Compliance with hedge accounting would impose
undue constraints on future borrowing, loan, and hedge
programs and would likely detract from minimizing the cost of
borrowings, which ADB believes is more important.
Accordingly, ADB elected not to adopt hedge accounting and
reports all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair
value while recognizing changes in the fair value of derivative

instruments in the period as part of net income.

Supplemental Reporting. ADB manages its balance sheet by
selectively using derivatives to minimize the interest rate and
currency risks associated with its financial assets and liabilities.
Derivative instruments are used to enhance asset/liability
management of individual positions and portfolios and to
reduce borrowing costs. As certain financial instruments
(including all derivatives and certain investments) are recorded

at their fair value while loans, borrowings, and certainASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

investments are recorded at carry value, applying FAS 133 does
not fully reflect the overall economic value of ADB’s financial
instruments. Therefore, to better reflect ADB’s financial position
and risk management, two supplemental financial statements
are included: current value and pre-FAS 133. Applications of
consistent approaches on these statements allow for better

analysis for management information and decision making.

Discussion and Analysis of Current Value

Table 2 presents estimates of the economic value of OCR
financial assets and liabilities taking into consideration changes
in interest rates, exchange rates, and credit risks. Current value
reflects the exit price for financial instruments with liquid

markets and is the estimated fair value. For financial

instruments with no market quotations, current value is
estimated using the expected cash flow streams discounted with
the appropriate interest and exchange rates (for details see
tables 3 and 4).

Current Value Balance Sheets

Loan Portfolio. Most loans are made to or guaranteed by ADB
members. ADB does not sell its loans believing that there is no
comparable market for them. The current value of loans
incorporates Management's best estimate of expected cash
flows including interest. Estimated cash flows from principal
repayments, interest, and other loan charges are discounted by
the applicable market yield curves for ADB’s funding cost plus
ADB's lending spread.

unrealized gains on asset swaps due to increasing interest rates
in certain markets.

Equity Investments. Equity investments with readily
determinable market values are reported at fair value. Unlisted
equity investments without readily available market value are
reported at cost less allowance for losses, which represents a

fair approximation of the current value.

Receivable from Members. These consist of unrestricted and
maybe restricted promissory notes. The current value is based
on the cash flow of the projected encashment of the promissory

notes discounted using appropriate interest rates.

Borrowings after Swaps. The current value of these liabilities
includes the fair value of the borrowings and associated
derivatives. The current value of these liabilities is calculated
using market-based valuation models incorporating observable

market data.

The $1.1 billion increase in the valuation of these liabilities—
equivalent to 4.5% of the value of the borrowing portfolio
after swaps, from the FAS 133 reported basis of $23.5 billion
which incorporates the value of embedded derivatives to the
current value basis of $24.5 billion—is mainly due to the fact
that the average cost of the portfolio is higher than the market

rate at which ADB can currently obtain new funding.

Current Value Income Statements

The total current value adjustment of $173.2 million

($746.7 million in 2003) in Table 4 represents the change in the
current value of all of ADB's financial instruments during the
year. The adjustment reflects changes in both interest rates

and in currency exchange rates in 2004.

Current Value Adjustments. All unrealized gains and losses
are presented as current value adjustments. Thus, the change in
net unrealized losses on investments and equity investments of
$31.2 million as well as the $5.0 million provision for loan

losses are presented as part of the adjustment.

For 2004, current value net income was $562.8 million
compared with pre-FAS 133 net income of $389.6 million and
statutory reported net income of $430.6 million (see Table 3).
The $173.2 million increase from the pre-FAS 133 basis to
current value basis (i.e., current value adjustment) comprises a
net effect of $99.7 million from the valuation of all

outstanding financial instruments, $105.8 million from

favorable translation adjustments, and $19.3 million unrealized
gains on equity investments net of $50.5 million of unrealized
investment losses and minimum pension liability adjustment of
$1.1 million (see Table 4).

Impact of Changes in Interest Rates. The net increase in the
current value adjustments on the balance sheet during 2004
was $99.7 million. It was a result of a $245.3 million decrease
in unrealized losses in the borrowing portfolio, and an

$8.6 million decrease in unrealized losses in other assets offset
by a decrease in unrealized gains in the loan and investment
swap portfolios of $139.2 million and $15.0 million,
respectively. The current value changes reflect increases in
interest rates in the US market for the year where the majority
of ADB's portfolios are held.

Impact of Changes in Exchange Rates. The increase in the
current value adjustment from 2003 to 2004 was also
attributed to changes in exchange rates. Translation
adjustments, reflected as part of “accumulated other
comprehensive income” under the statutory reported basis, are
presented as current value adjustments. The general weakening
of the US dollar against other major currencies in 2004
resulted in a significant positive translation adjustment of
$105.8 million.

Operating Activities

In pursuing its objectives, ADB provides financial assistance
through loans, technical assistance, guarantees, and equity
investments to its DMCs to help them meet their development

needs.

Loans. Until 30 June 2001, ADB’s three windows for loans
from OCR were the pool-based multicurrency loan (PMCL), the
pool-based single-currency loan (PSCL) in US dollars, and the
market-based loan (MBL). With the introduction of LBL
products on 1 July 2001, the PMCL and the MBL were no
longer offered and on 1 July 2002, the PSCL in US dollars was
retired. The LBL is a timely response to borrower demand for
loan products that suit project needs and effectively manage
their external debt. LBL products give borrowers a high degree
of flexibility in managing interest rate and exchange rate risks
and at the same time provide low intermediation risk to ADB.
In November 2003, ADB offered to let borrowers transform
their outstanding PMCLs of $6.5 billion into PSCLs in Japanese
yen. The transformation eases borrower’s administration for
loan service payments and loan accounting. The transformation

became effective on 1 January 2004.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

OCR Loan Approvals, Disbursements, Repayments, and
Prepayments. In 2004, 33 OCR loans totaling $4.0 billion
were approved compared with 38 OCR public and private
sector loans totaling $4.7 billion in 2003. Disbursements in
2004 totaled $2.5 billion which represented a decrease of 6.7%
from the $2.7 billion disbursed in 2003. Regular principal
repayments for the year were $1.2 billion ($1.2 billion in 2003)
while prepayments amounted to $2.8 billion ($5.9 billion in
2003). In 2004, 41 loans were fully prepaid. On 31 December
2004, the total loans outstanding after allowance for losses

and unamortized front-end fees amounted to $24.2 billion.

Status of Loans. One public sector OCR loan to Nauru and

11 private sector loans were in nonaccrual status at the end of
2004; the total outstanding balance was $2.3 million

($2.3 million in 2003) and $50.4 million ($77.1 million in 2003),
respectively. The decrease in private sector loans in nonaccrual
status was due to loan restructuring. Three loans totaling

$33.7 million came out of nonaccrual status while two new
loans totaling $7.5 million were placed in nonaccrual status
during 2004. The total loans in nonaccrual status of $52.7 million represented 0.2% of the total outstanding OCR loans.

Lending Rates. The lending rates for PSCLs are based on the
previous semester’s average cost of borrowings. Interest rates
for MBLs are either fixed or floating. The lending rates for
MBLs are determined on the basis of 6-month LIBOR with
reset dates of either 15 March and 15 September or 15 June
and 15 December. Effective 2001, all public sector loans
without specific provisions in the loan agreements were charged
with a lending spread of 60 basis points over the base lending
rate. In 2004, 20 basis points of the lending spread were
waived on public sector loans outstanding from 1 January
2004 to 30 June 2005 for borrowers that do not have loans in
arrears. ADB’s variable lending rates for PSCLs in US

dollars and PSCLs in Japanese yen are shown below.

ANY 2003 PSCLs

LENDING RATES
(% per annum)

REBATE RATES
(% per annum)

Lissa ttg

For private sector loans, the lending spread is determined on a
case-by-case basis to cover ADB’s risk exposure to specific

borrowers and projects.

ADB also normally charges a front-end fee of 1% to cover the
administrative costs incurred in loan origination. In 2004, the
Board of Governors approved the waiver of the entire front-end
fee on all new public sector loans approved from 1 January
2004 to 30 June 2005. Prior to that, 50 basis points waiver was
applied to all public sector loans approved on or after 1 January
2003. In addition, ADB currently applies a progressive
commitment fee of 75 basis points on undisbursed loan balances
for public sector project loans and a flat commitment fee of

75 basis points for public sector program loans.

Rebates and surcharges are standard features of public sector
LBLs. To maintain the principle of cost pass-through pricing,
ADB returns the actual sub-LIBOR funding cost margin to its
LBL public sector borrowers through rebates. A surcharge could
arise if ADB’s funding cost exceeds the 6-month LIBOR, but
that is a remote possibility unless ADB experiences serious
credit deterioration. Rebate or surcharge rates are set on

1 January and 1 July every year and are based on the actual
average funding cost margin for the preceding 6-month period.
Based on rebate rates, ADB returned an actual sub-LIBOR
funding cost margin of $12.8 million to its LBL public sector
borrowers during 2004 (see below).

Technical Assistance. From 1967 to 1991, technical assistance
expenses were charged to OCR and to other technical
assistance funding resources—the Technical Assistance Special
Fund (TASF), the Japan Special Fund (JSF), and trust/grant
funds. From 1992 to 2000, no technical assistance expenses
were charged to OCR. In 2001, the Board of Directors
approved the financing of high-priority technical assistance

programs out of OCR current income within a rolling 4-year

Japanese Yen

financing framework. The amount of financing required varies
between years and is subject to the approval of the Board of
Directors. In 2003, the Board reverted to the practice of
allocating OCR net income to the TASF and of financing
technical assistance activities through it and various other

funding resources.

Guarantees. ADB provides guarantees as credit enhancements
for eligible projects to cover risks that the private sector cannot
easily absorb or manage on its own. Reducing these risks can
make a significant difference in mobilizing debt funding for
projects. ADB has used its guarantee instruments successfully
for infrastructure projects, financial institutions, capital
markets, and trade finance. These instruments generally are not
recognized in the balance sheet and have off-balance sheet
risks. For guarantees issued and modified after 31 December
2002 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others,” ADB
recognized at the inception of a guarantee the noncontingent
aspect of its obligations. ADB’s total exposure on signed and
effective loan guarantees is disclosed in Note E of OCR

Financial Statements.

ADB offers two guarantee products—political risk and partial
credit—designed to mitigate risk exposure of commercial
lenders and capital market investors. These guarantees are not
issued on a stand-alone basis but are provided for projects in
which ADB participates. ADB cooperates with other
multilateral, official, and private sector lenders and insurers to

provide guarantee products.

Political Risk Guarantee (PRG). A PRG is designed to
facilitate cofinancing by providing lenders/capital market
investors of ADB-assisted projects with cover against
specifically defined political risks. Coverage is available against
any combination of the risks of expropriation, currency
inconvertibility or nontransferability, political violence, and
breach of contract, and is available for loans and other forms
of debt instruments. Equity instruments are ineligible for PRG
coverage. Tenors are based on the merits of the underlying
project. All or part of outstanding debt service obligations to a
lender may be covered. The cover may be for principal and/or
interest payment obligations. For private sector projects, ADB
can issue a PRG without a counter guarantee from the host
government; however, PRG exposure to such a project is subject

to a maximum of $150 million or 50% of the project cost,

whichever is lower. Fees are market-based and comprise
guarantee fees, front-end fees, and standby fees. A PRG is
callable when a guaranteed event has occurred and such an
event has resulted in debt service default to the lender. In
2004, ADB approved a $10 million supplemental PRG cover
without government counter guarantee for the Afghanistan
Investment Guarantee Facility. As of 31 December 2004, the

project was not yet effective.

Partial Credit Guarantee (PCG). A PCG provides
comprehensive cover (of commercial and political risks) for a
specific portion of the debt service provided by cofinanciers.
PCG is particularly useful for projects in DMCs with restricted
access to financial markets but which ADB considers
creditworthy and financially sound. Since the 1997 Asian
financial crisis, borrowers, project sponsors, cofinanciers, and
host governments have increasingly sought to hedge currency
mismatch risks by borrowing in the same currency as the
revenues generated by the project. A PCG can cover local
currency debt including domestic bond issues or long-term
loans from local financial institutions. For private sector
transactions not supported by a counter guarantee from the
host government, the exposure limit stands at $75 million or
25% of the project cost, whichever is less. Guarantee fees for
private sector transactions are market based. Fees for
transactions backed by the host government guarantee
comprise a standard guarantee fee of 40 basis points (0.4%)
per annum on the present value of the outstanding guarantee
obligation plus a front-end fee to cover processing costs. Fees
can be charged to the borrower or to the lender. In 2004, ADB
approved a private sector PCG for $65.3 million equivalent to
support a local currency bond issue for a liquefied natural gas
terminal in India. The project was not yet effective as of

31 December 2004.

Cofinancing. ADB coordinates with development partners to
maximize the impact of its assistance programs to all DMCs by
identifying official and/or commercial cofinancing
opportunities that directly complement ADB projects. This
includes the application of credit enhancement products, such
as guarantees, in support of commercially attractive public and
private sector projects and programs. Identifying the best
financing solutions for these projects and programs, especially
with the use of ADB's credit enhancement products, has been
the core of the cofinancing dialogue with DMCs. Official
cofinancing arrangements with bilateral partners and
multilateral financial institutions totaled $713.4 million for

24 projects comprising $147.1 million in grant funds andASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

$566.3 million in loans, compared with $775.3 million for

18 loan projects in 2003. Commercial cofinancing totaled

$1.7 billion for 10 projects, of which guarantee operations
amounted to $75.3 million. In addition, $77 million in grants
were mobilized to cofinance 102 technical assistance projects in
2004.

Private Sector Operations. In response to the growing role of
private enterprise in its DMCs, ADB assists enterprises
undertake financially viable projects with significant
development impact. ADB’s assistance can take the form of
equity investments, loans, guarantees, or complementary
financing schemes. The Charter allows the use of OCR for equity
investments in private enterprises of up to 10% of its unimpaired
paid-in capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of
special reserves. As of 31 December 2004, the total approved
equity investments in OCR, net of allowance for probable losses,
amounted to $537.3 million. This represented about 40% of the
ceiling defined by the Charter.

As of 31 December 2004, the overall private sector portfolio
(equity investments, loans, and guarantees) was approximately
$1.5 billion. As an interim arrangement, pending the
implementation of a more objective capital allocation
methodology, approvals of private sector operations in excess
of the operational limit of $1.5 billion established by the Board
of Directors have been allowed since September 2001. Private
sector guarantee operations include PRG commitments of
$202.2 million in four projects and PCG commitment of
$117.5 million in two projects. Approximately $101 million in
PRG commitments have counter guarantees from the respective

governments.

ADB actively seeks to recycle funds in existing investments after
its development role in such investments has been fulfilled.
Divestments are carried out in a manner consistent with good
business practices and without destabilizing the companies
concerned. In 2004, ADB actively sought full and partial
divestments of equity shareholdings in the amount of

$18.2 million, while $82.2 million in principal repayments were
received. ADB disbursed a total of $41.7 million in equity
investments and $109.4 million in loans in 2004. Negotiations
over legal documentation in 10 approved projects for a total

amount of $366.4 million are ongoing.

ADB maintains a loss allowance for all private sector
investments that do not have readily available market values

and for which no specific provisions have been made. The loss

allowance as of 31 December 2004 amounted to $44.5 million

and the specific provision amounted to $89.8 million.

Capital and Resources

Capital. Total shareholders’ equity on a reported basis grew
from $12.9 billion as of 31 December 2003 to $13.3 billion as
of 31 December 2004. This was primarily due to (i) net income
of $427.1 million; (ii) favorable translation adjustments of
$105.2 million; (iii) the net effect of change in special drawing
rights (SDR) value on capital and reserves of $128.1 million,
net of transfers to the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and the
TASF of $150 million and $50 million, respectively; and (iv) net
unrealized loss on investments and equity investments of

$31.2 million.

On 31 December 2004, authorized and subscribed capital was
$54,161.6 million. Of the subscribed capital, $3,809.4 million
was paid-in and $50,352.2 million was callable. Callable
capital can be called only if required to meet ADB's obligations
incurred on borrowings or guarantees under OCR. No call has

ever been made on ADB's callable capital.

To ensure it has adequate risk-bearing capacity, ADB reviews
its income outlook annually. Based on that review, the Board
of Directors allocates a portion of the previous year’s actual
net income to reserves to ensure that the level is commensurate
with the income planning framework. In addition, to the extent
feasible, it allocates part of the net income to support
development activities in its DMCs. In May 2004, the Board of
Governors approved allocations of 2003 net income of

$218.8 million to loan loss reserves, of $195.5 million to
surplus, of $150 million to the ADF, and of $50 million to the
TASF and reduced the cumulative revaluation adjustment
account by 2003 FAS 133 adjustments of $178.4 million.

In February 2003, the Board of Directors reviewed ADB’s
lending and borrowing limitations and approved the following
policies to take effect immediately: (i) gross outstanding
borrowings are limited to no more than the sum of callable
capital from nonborrowing members, paid-in capital, and
reserves (including surplus), subject to the Charter limit of
100% of callable capital; (ii) outstanding loan commitments
measured by the sum of outstanding disbursed and undisbursed
loans, equity investments, and guarantees! are limited to no
more than the sum of the total callable paid-in capital and
reserves (including surplus but excluding special reserve).

In March 2003, the Board of Directors reviewed the OCRPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

resource position. The review followed a medium-term capital
management approach within the approved financial
framework for assessing the adequacy of current and
prospective lending and borrowing headroom. The review
concluded that ADB’s capital position is comfortable enough to
support projected lending operations through 2005 and to
maintain a prudent buffer against exchange rate fluctuations
and a margin for unutilized lending capacity. As of

31 December 2004, headroom for lending and borrowings was
$22.5 billion and $19.6 billion, respectively (compared with
$19.9 billion and $16.4 billion, respectively, in 2003).

Borrowings

ADB’s primary borrowing objective is to ensure availability of
funds at the lowest possible cost for its lending operations.
Subject to this objective, ADB seeks to diversify its funding
sources across markets, instruments, and maturities. To achieve
that objective, ADB continued in 2004 the strategy of (i) issuing
liquid benchmark bonds to maintain ADB's strong presence in
key currency bond markets, (ii) raising funds through costefficient opportunistic and private placement transactions to
minimize borrowing costs, and (iii) emphasizing borrowings
with longer maturity ranges to smooth ADB’s debt redemption
profile. Also, in 2004, ADB pursued the objective of
contributing to the development of regional bond markets and
of providing local currency financing for ADB’s private sector
operations through local currency bond issues. All proceeds
from new funding transactions are invested until they are

required for ADB’s ordinary operations. Funding raised in any
given year is utilized for ADB’s ordinary operations, including
loan disbursements and refinancing of maturing funding

obligations.

2004 Funding Operations. In 2004, ADB completed

19 borrowing transactions raising about $1.6 billion in longand medium-term funds compared with $4.1 billion in 2003.
The decrease in funding requirements in 2004 was primarily
attributed to $2.8 billion loan prepayments received during the
year. The new borrowings were raised in US dollars, Japanese
yen, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, Indian rupees, and
Malaysian ringgit. After swaps, $1.5 billion or 93% of 2004
borrowings were in US dollars and the remaining 7% were in
Indian rupees. The average maturity of 2004 borrowings was
7.9 years compared with 7.6 years in 2003. Of the total 2004
borrowings, $1.5 billion was raised through five public
offerings and the rest through private placements. Additionally,
ADB raised $90 million in short-term funds under its Euro
Commercial Paper Program. Table 5 shows details of 2004

borrowings as compared with borrowings in 2001-2003.

Benchmark Bond Issue. In October 2004, ADB launched a
10-year $1.0 billion 4.25% benchmark global bond issue. This
was in line with the strategy of maintaining a strong presence
in the US dollar bond market and further smoothing the debt
redemption profile. The transaction generated robust demand
globally with 45% of the bonds placed in Asia (excluding

Japan), 21% in Japan, 20% in US, and 14% in Europe.

Local Currency Bond Issues. In 2004, ADB launched local
currency bond issues in the domestic capital markets of India;
Hong Kong, China; Malaysia; and Singapore. Table 6 shows
the details of these local currency bond issues. The Indian rupee
(INR), Malaysian ringgit (MYR), and Singapore dollar bond
issues are ADB's inaugural issues in the domestic capital
markets of those countries. The INR and MYR issues are also
the first issues by a foreign and a supranational entity in those
domestic markets as well as the first issues in those countries
rated triple A by Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard and Poor's.

Private Placements. In keeping with the overriding objective of
minimizing costs, 14 private placement borrowings were
undertaken in 2004 totaling $169 million or 10% of the year’s
total borrowings. These private placements were callable
foreign exchange-linked notes targeted to institutional
investors in Japan. These structured notes typically have
principal amounts in Japanese yen and coupon rates linked to
foreign exchange rates. All 2004 private placements were
swapped on a fully hedged basis into floating rate US dollar
liabilities.

Use of Derivatives. ADB undertakes currency and interest rate
swaps to raise, on a fully hedged basis, currencies needed for
operations in a cost-efficient way while maintaining its
borrowing presence in major capital markets. The proceeds of
all borrowings undertaken in 2004, with the exception of the
INR bond issue, were swapped into floating rate US dollars.

Liquidity Portfolio

The liquidity portfolio helps to ensure the uninterrupted
availability of funds to meet loan disbursements, debt servicing,
and other cash requirements. It also contributes to ADB’s
earning base. ADB’s Investment Authority governs liquid asset
investments. Its primary objective is to maintain security and
liquidity of funds invested. Subject to these two parameters,
ADB seeks to maximize the total return on its investments. In
compliance with its Charter, ADB does not convert currencies
for investment; investments are made in the same currencies in
which they are received. At present, liquid investments are held

in 19 currencies.

Liquid assets are held in government and government-related
debt instruments, time deposits, and other unconditional
obligations of banks and financial institutions, and, to a
limited extent, in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities,
asset-backed securities of high credit quality, and derivatives.
They are held in four subportfolios—core, operational cash,
cash cushion, and discretionary liquidity—all of which have
different risk profiles and performance benchmarks. The yearend balance of the portfolios in 2004 and 2003 including
receivables for securities repurchased under resale arrangements
and excluding securities transferred under securities lending
arrangements and pending sales and purchases is presented in
Table 7.

 

FIGURE 1: EFFECT ON CURRENCY COMPOSITION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGSPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

The core portfolio is invested to ensure that the primary
objective of a liquidity buffer is met. Cash inflows and outflows
are minimized to maximize the total return relative to a
defined level of risk. The portfolio is funded largely by equity,
and performance is measured against external benchmarks with
an average duration of about 2 years. The remaining part of
the core portfolio is funded by debt and is invested to
maximize the spread earned between borrowing cost and

investment income on high-quality investments.

The operational cash portfolio is designed to meet net cash
requirements over a 1-month horizon. It is funded by equity
and invested in short-term, highly liquid money market

instruments. The portfolio performance is measured against

short-term external benchmarks.

The cash cushion portfolio holds the proceeds of ADB's
borrowing transactions pending disbursement. It is invested in
short-term instruments, and performance is measured against

short-term external benchmarks.

The discretionary liquidity portfolio is funded by issuing
floating rate debt and is invested to maximize the spread
earned between borrowing cost and investment income on
high-quality instruments. For 2004, the target size of the
discretionary liquidity portfolio was set at $2.3 billion.

Contractual Obligations
In the normal course of business, ADB enters into various
contractual obligations that may require future cash payments.

Table 9 summarizes ADB’s significant contractual cash

 

obligations on 31 December 2004. Long-term debt includes
direct medium- and long-term borrowings excluding swaps but
does not include any adjustment for unamortized premiums,
discounts, or effects of applying FAS 133. Other long-term
liabilities include accrued liabilities and unfunded pension and

postretirement benefits.

Risk Management

In its development banking operations, ADB assumes various
credit, market (interest rate and foreign exchange), liquidity,
and operational risks. Of these, credit risks in the loan and
guarantee portfolios are the most significant. ADB has adopted
an integrated risk management infrastructure designed to
ensure that credit and other risks are appropriately identified,

measured, monitored, and managed.

Risk Bearing Capacity. On 19 February 2004, the Board of
Directors approved a new income planning framework that
established the equity-to-loan ratio (ELR) as the key measure
of ADB’s risk bearing capacity. Consequently, the use of
financial indicators, the reserve-to-loan ratio, and the interest
coverage ratio were discontinued. The ELR measures the
adequacy of equity capital to absorb unexpected losses from a
major credit event in the public sector loan and guarantee
portfolios as well as the ability to generate adequate net income
to absorb loss of loan income while also matching growth in the
loan and guarantee portfolios. Because ADB's loan and
guarantee portfolios are unavoidably highly concentrated in
Asia, a credit event of one borrower could have a significant
impact due to high correlations. ADB has established a target
ELR of 35% to accommodate this volatility.

Variable
54.6%

FIGURE 2: EFFECT ON INTEREST RATE STRUCTURES OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGSASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

In determining the ELR, ADB’s equity capital is defined as the
sum of usable paid-in capital, the ordinary reserve, the special
reserve, and surplus. At 31 December 2004, the ELR was 50.5%
under the pre-FAS 133 basis (46.8% on 31 December 2003).
ADB's higher-than-target ELR represents a very strong equity
capital position relative to the credit risk of the loan and
guarantee portfolios indicating that both net income and
equity capital are adequate to sustain a major credit event.
ADB also protects the ELR from exchange rate fluctuations by
periodically aligning the currency composition of its equity to
that of its loans.

Under the new income planning framework, ADB also
introduced the loan loss reserve (LLR) to absorb expected losses
from public sector loan and guarantee portfolios. Hence both
expected and unexpected losses are addressed through
adequate LLR and ELR.

Country Credit Risks. The new income framework approved in
2004 links the adequacy of net income and equity capital to
the country credit risk of the public sector loan and guarantee
portfolios. A credit risk model is used to estimate expected and
unexpected losses in these portfolios, incorporating borrower's
default probability, loss given default, projected exposure, and
default correlations. In addition, ADB stress tests net income
projections to ensure net income is adequate to absorb the loss
of loan income due to credit shocks and to support sufficient
growth.

In December 2004, ADB adopted an internal country credit risk
rating system to assess independently the creditworthiness of its
borrowers. ADB also began enhancing the credit risk model to

incorporate Monte Carlo simulations expected to be completed
by June 2005.

Counterparty Credit Risks. Counterparty credit risk is the risk
of loss when a derivative counterparty does not honor its
obligations measured by the aggregate positive replacement
cost or the net positive marked-to-market value of the
derivatives. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, ADB has strict
counterparty eligibility criteria. Only those with a minimum
rating of A-/A3 and an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association master agreement with ADB are eligible to
undertake swaps. In addition, ADB has executed the Credit
Support Annex (CSA) with several counterparties.

ADB utilizes a sophisticated system that allows for daily
monitoring and managing of counterparty credit risk exposure.
Under the CSA arrangements, derivatives’ positions are
marked-to-market daily, and collateral calls, transfers, and
adjustments with counterparties are made in coordination with
an external collateral manager. ADB also sets exposure limits
on individual counterparties based on their credit ratings and
equity and daily monitors current and potential counterparty
exposure against the limit.

Market Risks. ADB controls the market risk of its liquid asset
investments by adopting investment policy guidelines which
only allow for investments in government and governmentrelated debt instruments, time deposits, and other
unconditional obligations of banks and financial institutions,
and to a limited extent, in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed
securities, and asset-backed securities of high credit quality.
The principal source of investment risk arises from income
volatility due to interest rate movements. ADB monitors and
manages interest rate risks by employing various quantitative
methods. All positions are marked-to-market, and risk-sensitive
measures, including potential exposure, are calculated and

compared to internally established risk limits daily.

ADB manages exchange rates to ensure that the ELR as the
measure of equity capital adequacy and risk-bearing capacity
is immune from fluctuations in exchange rates. ADB can
achieve this by periodically aligning the currency composition
of loans with that of equity thus ensuring that fluctuations in
exchange rates would have similar effects on both. ADB
mitigates the market risks associated with the loan portfolio by
passing on all associated costs to borrowers and employing
derivatives to closely match the characteristics of loans with
those of borrowings.

ADB has an infrastructure designed to ensure that the market
risks associated with its activities are fully identified, measured,
monitored, and managed. In this regard, ADB recently
broadened its market risk management capabilities by

(i) improving the risk metrics and assumptions used in the
valuation and risk analysis of its treasury activities and

(ii) enhancing the performance measurements and attribution
methodologies used for investment portfolios. Stress testing and
scenario analyses have been incorporated as supplementary risk
management tools, and ADB has continued to expand on the
architecture used to value highly structured borrowings and

related swap transactions.

In 2004 ADB upgraded its treasury system and automated a
number of manual procedures related to pricing and trade
reconciliation. A daily risk, performance, and attribution system
was inaugurated for the six major investment portfolios to
further enhance risk and performance feedback to treasury
management. Moreover, an agreement was reached at the end
of the year to outsource risk analyses for the external
investment portfolios which will significantly bolster riskmetrics, stress testing, and scenario analyses for ADB’s
investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities and

corporate bonds.

Liquidity Risks. The objective of ADB’s liquidity policy is to
ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all
financial commitments despite uncertain conditions in the
capital markets. The policy establishes minimum levels of
liquidity to maintain expected operations. ADB’s liquidity
requirements are primarily determined by expected lending
volumes and disbursements, redemption of current borrowings,
repayments and prepayments of loans, and cash from net
income. The policy defines ADB’s annual net cash requirement
(NCR) to meet large contractual obligations for loan
disbursements and debt redemption. ADB relies on borrowings

to meet most of these obligations. The proxy NCR is the sum

of loan disbursements net of repayments and debt redemption
for the year.

Prudential minimum liquidity is set at 40% of the next 3 years’
proxy NCR and represents the minimum amount of liquidity
necessary for ADB to continue operations even if its access to
capital markets is temporarily denied. Maintaining that level
enables ADB to cover normal NCR for 20 months and stressed
NCR for 14 months without borrowing. In addition, ADB can
raise discretionary liquidity, funded entirely by borrowings, to
provide flexibility in the funding and debt redemption schedule
over time. The policy limits discretionary liquidity to 50% of
prudential minimum liquidity. Levels of liquidity, NCR, and
proxy NCR are monitored on an ongoing basis and reviewed by
the Board of Directors quarterly.

Operational Risks. Operational risk represents the potential for
loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or
systems, human factors, or external events including business
disruptions and system failure, transaction processing failures,
and failure in execution of legal, fiduciary, and agency
responsibilities. ADB is exposed to many types of operational
tisks and attempts to mitigate them by maintaining a system
of internal controls and processes and system upgrades. In
addition, ADB has a rigorous process for approving
transactions that requires reviews and authorization by all
relevant parties to ensure all transactions are properly
approved, documented, monitored, and controlled. ADB
recently approved a strategy to strengthen the business
continuity plan to reduce the impact of disruption affecting

business processes (see page 46).

Risk Management in Private Sector Operations. ADB
maintains a separate risk management unit for private sector
operations that provides an independent credit review for
projects in the pipeline and projects in the portfolio. A special
unit separately manages vulnerable private sector projects.

ADB's private sector investments are usually not backed by
government guarantees and are exposed to a full range of
commercial and political risks. Managing and monitoring those
risks is a key priority. ADB evaluates not only the development
angle of a project but also analyzes its credit strength,
financial viability, and good corporate governance. Each
private sector project undergoes an in-depth credit analysis and
appraisal prior to approval. The Private Sector Credit
Committee provides Management approval for due diligence

and guidance on all key issues associated with the investmentASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

and endorses submission to the Board of Directors for
consideration. When applicable, the projects are reviewed by

the Interest Rate Committee and/or the Guarantee Committee.

The current private sector strategy capitalizes on strength in
the infrastructure and financial market sectors and will
continue to focus assistance there. Nevertheless, ADB remains
responsive to the changing needs of DMCs and private
investment opportunities in other sectors. The objective is to
build a diversified private sector portfolio in terms of both
countries and sectors while managing concentration risks by
establishing appropriate limits for countries, industries, and
groups. The total amount of ADB assistance to a single project,
including equity investments, loans, and guarantees, must not
exceed 25% of the total project cost or $75 million, whichever
is lower. ADB uses an internal rating system to classify its
exposure based on international credit standards that reflect
the risk of timely and full recovery of investments. The rating
system is used to monitor risk exposure to individual projects.

ADB streamlined approval of investment recovery operations.
They generally involve negotiations for financial restructuring,
foreclosure, or other remedies, including liquidation.
Restructuring is undertaken only when it is expected to improve
ADB’s prospects for recovery. If the financial condition of the
entity has deteriorated beyond recovery, ADB may have to
proceed with liquidation or other legally permissible forms of

recovery.

Summary of Financial Performance

Net Income. Net income before FAS 133 adjustments was

$389.6 million, compared with $616.6 million in 2003. The

decrease of $227.0 million (36.8%) was predominantly due to
the following:

e decrease in net loan income after interest and financial
expenses of $221.8 million due to the decrease in loans and
borrowing balances associated with prepayments from 2003
to 2004; in addition, the waiver of 20 basis points on the
lending spread for public sector loans decreased loan income
by $10.6 million, and $17.9 million in front-end fees were
waived during the year;

e a reduction of $11.3 million in investment income due to
lower realized gains from the disposal of investment
securities;

© a decrease of $9.1 million in income from other sources
attributed to the proportionate share of losses recognized for

equity investments and lower dividends received.

These decreases were partially offset by a $13.1 million
decrease in the provision for private sector loans and equity
investments associated with prepayments and disposals and a

$2.1 million write-back of technical assistance.

FAS 133 Adjustments. Favorable FAS 133 adjustments
increased to $41.0 million (unfavorable of $178.4 million in
2003) due to increased interest rates and the general
weakening of the US dollar. These accounted for the increase
in the unrealized gains of embedded derivatives, the decrease in
unrealized losses of the borrowings-related swap portfolio, and
the decline in unrealized gains of the investment swap portfolio
(see Note K of OCR Financial Statements).

Staff Retirement Plan and Postretirement Medical Benefits.
Retirement benefits are provided by the pension plan to which
staff members are expected to contribute 9.3% of their
salaries. In addition, staff may make additional voluntary
contributions. The pension plan is administered by ADB as a
separate fund and is required to be kept separate from ADB
resources. In addition, postretirement medical benefits are
provided to retirees who elect to enroll in the postretirement
medical plan. ADB covers 75% of the medical insurance

premium.

Recognition of ADB’s obligations for the two plans is based on
benefit projections net of the fair value of the projected plan
assets, both determined using certain actuarial assumptions. As
of 31 December 2004, the pension plan and the postretirement
medical plan showed an unfunded status of $130.1 million and
$173.9 million, respectively. To the extent allowed, certain
costs, gains/losses, and obligations are deferred and recognized
in relevant accounting periods as permitted by accounting
standards. Consequently, the unfunded amounts are not
recognized as liabilities, but periodic costs based on actuarial
valuation are recognized in OCR accounts. Recognition of
future costs will depend on future events. In that respect, the
fund's status and the periodic costs are reviewed annually with
the assistance of actuaries. These reviews may lead to a revision
in the funding rate to the pension plan. ADB’s contribution rate
increased from 13% in 2003 to 15% effective January 2004.
Commencing January 2005, the budgeted rate will be 16%.

 

Critical Accounting Policies

and Estimates

Significant accounting policies are contained in Note B of
OCR’s financial statements. In the financial statements,

Management makes estimates in determining the fair value ofPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

financial instruments. Estimates by their nature are based on
judgment and available information; therefore, actual results
could differ and could have a material impact on the financial

statements.

Fair Valuation of Financial Instruments. Under statutory
reporting, ADB carries its investments and derivatives, as
defined by FAS 133, on a fair value basis. These derivatives,
including embedded derivatives in the structured borrowings,
are separately valued and accounted for in the balance sheet.
Fair values for exchange-traded securities and derivatives are
based on quoted market prices. Fair valuations where market
prices are not readily available are determined using marketbased pricing models incorporating readily observable market

data and require judgment and estimates.

All pricing models used for determining fair values of ADB’s
derivatives are based on discounted expected cash flows using
observable market data. ADB reviews pricing models to assess
the appropriateness of assumptions to reasonably reflect the
valuation of transactions. In addition, valuations derived from
the models are subject to ongoing internal and external
verification and review. The models use market-sourced inputs
such as interest rates, exchange rates, and option volatilities.
Selection of these inputs may involve some judgment and may
impact net income. Nevertheless, ADB believes that the
estimates of fair values are reasonable given existing controls
and processes.

Special Funds

ADB is authorized by its Charter to establish and administer
Special Funds. These are the Asian Development Fund; the
Technical Assistance Special Fund; the Japan Special Fund
(JSF), including the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility
(ACCSF); and the ADB Institute Special Fund (ADBISF).
Financial statements for each fund are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles except for ADF’s
which are special purpose financial statements prepared in

accordance with ADF Regulations.

Asian Development Fund

ADF is ADB’s concessional financing window for DMCs with
low per capita gross national products and limited debt
repayment capacities. It is the only multilateral source of
concessional assistance dedicated exclusively to reducing
poverty and to improving the quality of life in Asia and the
Pacific. Twenty-nine donor members (regional and nonregional)
have contributed to the fund.

ADF VIII. The seventh replenishment of the fund (ADF VIII),
authorized in December 2000 by Resolution No. 276 of the
Board of Governors, was intended to finance concessional
lending operations for 2001-2004. Donors agreed on a total
replenishment from their contributions of $2.79 billion based on
the exchange rates specified in the Resolution. By the end of
2004, ADB had received Instruments of Contribution from 26
donors for a total of $2.93 billion (including a contribution
from Luxembourg which became a member of ADB in
September 2003 and an additional contribution from Spain).
Twenty-three donors deposited unqualified Instruments of
Contribution. Canada; Taipei,China; and United States
deposited instruments containing a qualification as permitted by
the Resolution that all installments except the first were subject
to budgetary appropriations. By the end of 2004, 22 donors
paid their ADF VIII contributions in full. The US paid the first
two installments and part of the third installment. As a result,
three donors—Austria, Germany, and Turkey—exercised their
prorata rights and did not release their fourth installments for
operational commitment (for details of amounts released for
operational commitment in 2004, see the column labeled
“Addition” in Table 28 in the Statistical Annex).

To augment the ADF VIII commitment authority, the Board of
Governors approved the transfer of $350 million OCR net
income to the ADF ($200 million and $150 million, respectively,
out of 2002 and 2003 net income). In addition, Management
assessed the opportunities for freeing committed resources by
canceling loans that were not moving or by identifying savings.
In October 2003, the Board approved the use of loan savings
and cancellations to directly increase the ADF VIII commitment
authority. By the end of 2004, $495 million from canceled loans

had been included for new loan commitments (see Table 10).

ADF IX. The eighth replenishment of the ADF (ADF IX), which
covers the 4-year period 2005-2008, was authorized in August
2004 by Resolution No. 300 of the Board of Governors.
Donors recommended a replenishment of $7.0 billion,
consisting of $3.3 billion in new contributions from donors and
$3.7 billion from internal resources based on the exchange rate
specified in the Resolution. ADF IX features a new grant
program that may represent up to 21% of its financing
framework, including 3% as priority technical assistance. The
grants in ADF IX will be used to ease some of the costs of
external development finance in some of the poorest highly
indebted countries and will assist poor countries in making the
transition from conflict to peace and stability. They will also be

used to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

Disbursements during 2004 totaled $1,055.1 million, a decrease
of 6.5% from $1,128.1 million in 2003. At the end of the year,
cumulative disbursements from ADF resources were

$20.9 billion. Loan repayments during the year amounted to
$390.2 million, and cumulative repayments were $2.7 billion.
At year-end, outstanding ADF loans amounted to $21.6 billion.

Status of Loans. At the end of the year, 28 public sector loans
to Myanmar were in nonaccrual status. The total of
outstanding loans to Myanmar amounted to $515.3 million

comprising about 2.4% of the total outstanding ADF loans.

Investment Portfolio Position. The ADF investment portfolio
amounted to $5.6 billion on 31 December 2004 compared with
$4.3 billion in 2003. About 35% of the portfolio was invested
in bank deposits, and 65% was invested in fixed income
securities. The annualized rate of return on ADF investments in
2004 was 3.4% compared with 3.5% in 2003. The portfolio
was denominated in 10 currencies. Euros, pounds sterling,
Australian dollars, and Canadian dollars accounted for 88% of

the portfolio.

 

TABLE 10: ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND COMMITMENT AUTHORITY
($ million)

Technical Assistance Special Fund

Review of Activities. In 2004, the Board of Governors
approved an allocation of $50 million from 2003 OCR net
income to TASF. In addition, India made a wholly untied,
direct, voluntary contribution (its 19") amounting to

2.25 million Indian rupees ($49,800 equivalent). At the end of
2004, total TASF resources amounted to $1,062.0 million

(see Table 11). Of this, $962.8 million were committed leaving
an uncommitted balance of $99.2 million (for details, see
Table 29 in the Statistical Annex).

Operations and Resource Position. Technical assistance
commitments (approved and effective) decreased from

$80.1 million in 2003 to $73.5 million in 2004 for 168
technical assistance projects made effective during the year. In
2004, $6.3 million ($10.1 million in 2003) representing
completed and canceled technical assistance projects were
written back as a reduction in technical assistance, and the
corresponding undisbursed commitment was eliminated.
Revenue from investments decreased from $5.3 million in 2003
to $5.0 million in 2004 despite the increase in the size of the
investment portfolio because of lower yields in some capital
markets. As a result, the uncommitted balance available for
future commitments decreased from $104.1 million in 2003 to
$99.2 million in 2004. The TASF contributed 41% of funding
for all technical assistance approved in 2004.

At the end of the year, TASF investments stood at

$240.4 million, up 5.2% from 2003. Other assets—due from
banks, advances to consultants, and others—totaled

$8.9 million. Accounts payable to OCR and others amounted to
$52,000.

Japan Special Fund

Review of Activities. Technical assistance funded by the JSF
continued to support ADB operations aimed at reducing
poverty. In March 2004, Japan contributed 2.7 billion yen
($24.2 million equivalent) as a regular contribution. As of

31 December 2004, Japan’s cumulative contribution to the JSF
since its inception in 1988 amounted to 101.9 billion yen
(about $876.9 million equivalent) comprising regular
contributions of 83.8 billion yen ($726.1 million equivalent)
and supplementary contributions of 18.1 billion yen

($150.8 million equivalent). In 2004, ADB approved 69
technical assistance for the JSF totaling $39.5 million inclusive
of those that were approved but not yet effective (see

Table 12). The uncommitted balance after taking into account
approved technical assistance not yet effective as ofPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

31 December 2004 was $118.2 million (for details, see tables 30
and 31 in the Statistical Annex).

Sector Activities. In 2004, the JSF financed 20% of the total
amount of technical assistance approved by ADB including
38% of the total amount of project preparation technical
assistance during the year. The breakdown of JSF approvals by
sector is shown in Table 12.

ADB Institute Special Fund

The costs for operating the ADB Institute are met from the
ADBISF which is administered by ADB in accordance with the
Statute of ADB Institute. Japan made its ninth contribution in
the amount of 1.4 billion yen ($13.1 million equivalent) in June
2004.

As of 31 December 2004, cumulative commitments amounted
to 11.6 billion yen (about $96.2 million equivalent) excluding
translation adjustments. Of the total contributions received,
$80.1 million had been used by the end of the year mainly for
research and capacity-building activities including organizing
symposia, forums, and training; preparing research reports,
publications, and websites; and for associated administrative
expenses. The balance of net current assets excluding property,
furniture, and equipment available for future projects and
programs was about $16.1 million.

Trust Funds Managed by ADB
In addition to OCR and the Special Funds, ADB also manages
and administers the Japan Scholarship Program (JSP), the

 

TABLE 11: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
SPECIAL FUND CUMULATIVE RESOURCES
(S million)

Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), the Japan Fund for
Information and Communication Technology (JFICT), and
channel financing arrangements of a number of trust funds
provided by bilateral donors to support technical assistance and
soft components of loans. These funds do not form part of
ADB’s own resources.

Japan Scholarship Program

The JSP was established in 1988 to provide an opportunity for
well-qualified citizens of DMCs to undertake postgraduate
studies in economics, management, science, and technology,
and other development-related fields at selected educational
institutions in Asia and the Pacific. The JSP is funded by Japan
and administered by ADB. Currently, 20 institutions in

10 countries participate.

Between 1988 and 2004, Japan contributed $68.3 million. A
total of 1,780 scholarships has been awarded to recipients from
34 members. Of the total, 1,442 have already completed their
courses. Women have received 548 scholarships. The number of
new scholarships awarded annually grew from 49 in 1988 to
157 in 2004 (see www.adb.org/JSP).

Channel Financing Arrangements

Official grant cofinancing plays a vital role in ADB operations,
particularly in view of the continuing constraints on TASF and
ADF resources. These grant funds support technical assistance
and finance mostly soft components of loan projects. Most
grants are provided by bilateral donors under channel financing
arrangements (CFAs). ADB acts as administrator of the funds

$ Million

TABLE 12: JAPAN SPECIAL FUND
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BY SECTOR, 2004ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

and applies its own guidelines and procedures in recruiting

consultants, making disbursements, and supervising projects.

Under a CFA, the donor enters into a comprehensive agreement
with ADB whereby the donor provides an untied grant fund to
be administered by ADB, but the fund does not become part of
ADB’s own resources. The donor indicates its preferred sectors
and recipient countries. ADB regularly provides a list and
description of proposed technical assistance projects that satisfy
the donor's preferences, and they agree on the specific activities
to be financed. Funds provided under a CFA are usually
transferred to an interest-bearing account and may also be
invested by ADB pending disbursement. Donors are provided
with regular financial statements and progress reports on the
use of the funds. ADB is responsible for project preparation,
processing, and administration. CFAs may be replenished with

additional funds at the donor's discretion.

The primary advantage of CFAs is that funding for several
individual technical assistance projects may be provided under
a single agreement. Accordingly, they minimize the need for
detailed negotiations on a case-by-case basis and foster
administrative efficiency. The first CFA was negotiated in 1980.
Since then, ADB has entered into CFAs with the following
bilateral development partners: Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. In
2004, Finland replenished its fund, Italy made new
contributions to establish a second trust fund, and Australia

cofinanced six projects with its fund.

In addition to the traditional type of CFA which may be used
for several sectors, thematic CFAs with bilateral agencies have
increased sharply in recent years in such areas as renewable
energy, climate change, poverty reduction, governance, water,
gender and development, and poverty and environment. Several
thematic CFAs have been packaged as umbrella facilities to

allow more than one donor to contribute.

ENDNOTE

In 2004, ADB and its partners established two new
cooperative funds: the Cooperation Fund in Support of
Managing for Development Results with an initial
contribution from Canada followed by a contribution from
the Netherlands and the Cooperation Fund for Regional
Trade and Financial Security Initiative with initial
contributions from Australia, Japan, and United States. As
of 31 December 2004, cumulative contributions committed
amounted to $237.0 million ($221.9 million in 2003) and
289 projects (219 in 2003) amounting to $157.1 million
($116.8 million in 2003).

Recently, mobilizing grant funds has been explored with private
sector entities. During 2004, ADB successfully obtained funds
from several private sector entities mostly to cofinance regional

technical assistance projects in the environment sector.

Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction

The JFPR was established in May 2000 as a trust fund to
support poverty reduction and social development activities
that can add substantial value to ADB projects. Since 2000,
Japan has contributed $326.9 million in total. To date,
$146 million for 53 projects have been approved of which
15 projects valued at $29.9 million were approved in 2004
(see www.adb.org/JFPR and Table 32 in the Statistical

Annex).

Japan Fund for Information and

Communication Technology

The JFICT was established in July 2001 to assist DMCs in
bridging the digital divide to help reduce poverty. The JFICT
had an initial contribution of 1.3 billion yen (approximately
$10.7 million) for a 3-year period. The JFICT was originally
scheduled to close by 31 July 2004 but was extended by 1 year
to accommodate new proposals. To date, $7.03 million for

8 projects have been approved for implementation (see
www.adb.org/Documents/others/CLICK/R21_03.pdf).

1 ADB's financial policies require that a political risk guarantee (PRG) be charged against lending limitations at the nominal value of the guaranteed obligation, plus

the interest that will accrue for the succeeding interest period and partial risk guarantee (PCG) at the present value of the guaranteed obligation.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheets and the related statements of income and expenses, cash
flows, and changes in capital and reserves present fairly, in all material respects, in terms of United States
dollars, the financial position of the Asian Development Bank—Ordinary Capital Resources at 31 December
2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development Bank; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America which require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken
as a whole. The accompanying summary statements of loans and of borrowings as at 31 December 2004
and 2003, and of statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as at 31 December 2004
are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not required parts of the basic financial
statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the
basic financial statements and in our opinion, is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS
ON LOANS, GUARANTEES, AND EQUITY
INVESTMENTS

Nature of Operations

The Asian Development Bank (ADB), a multilateral development finance institution, was established in 1966 with its
headquarters in Manila, Philippines. ADB and its operations are
governed by the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter). Its purpose is to foster economic
development and co-operation in the Asian and Pacific region
and to contribute to the acceleration of the process of economic development of the developing member countries (DMCs)
in the region, collectively and individually. With the adoption
of its poverty reduction strategy at the end of 1999, ADB made
reducing poverty in the region its main goal. ADB provides
financial and technical assistance (TA) for projects and programs, which will contribute to achieving this purpose.

Mobilizing financial resources, including cofinancing, is
an integral part of ADB’s operational activities. In addition,
ADB, alone or jointly, administers on behalf of donors, including members, their agencies and other development institutions, funds restricted for specific uses, which include TA grants
as well as regional programs.

ADB's ordinary operations comprise loans, equity investments, and guarantees. During the years 2001 and 2002, limited
technical assistance to member countries to support high
priority TA programs was included. ADB finances its ordinary
operations through borrowings, paid-in capital, and retained
earnings.

Limitations on Loans, Guarantees, and Equity Investments

Article 12, paragraph 1 of the Charter provides that the total
amount outstanding of loans, equity investments, and guarantees made by ADB shall not exceed the total of ADB’s unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves, and surplus, exclusive of
the special reserve. At 31 December 2004, the total of such
loans, equity investments, and guarantees aggregated approximately 64.7% (67.7% - 2003) of the total subscribed capital,
reserves, and surplus as defined.

Article 12, paragraph 3 of the Charter provides that equity
investments shall not exceed 10% of the unimpaired paid-in
capital together with reserves and surplus, exclusive of the special
reserve. At 31 December 2004, such equity investments repre
sented approximately 4.0% (3.2% - 2003) of the paid-in capital,
reserves, and surplus, as defined.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are all functional currencies. The
reporting currency is the United States dollar, and the financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United States
dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets and liabilities are translated from their functional currencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable rates of
exchange at the end of a reporting period. Income and expense
amounts are translated for each semimonthly period generally at
the applicable rates of exchange at the beginning of each period;
such practice approximates the application of average rates in
effect during the period. Translation adjustments other than
those relating to maintenance of SDR capital values (see Notes
1] and J), are charged or credited to “Accumulated translation
adjustments” and reported in “CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part
of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Valuation of Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 of the Charter “in terms of United States dollars
of the weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the
1966 dollar) and the value of each share is defined as 10,000
1966 dollars. The capital stock had historically been translated
into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit of account)
on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From 1973 until
31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was $1.20635
per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second
Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies no longer
have par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB's selection of
the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock
has been valued for purposes of these financial statements in
terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current
United States dollars as computed by the IMF, with each share
valued at SDR10,000.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

As of 31 December 2004, the value of the SDR in terms
of the current United States dollar was $1.54784 ($1.48597 2003) giving a value for each share of ADB’s capital equivalent
to $15,478.40 ($14,859.70 - 2003). However, ADB could decide
to fix the value of each share at $12,063.50 based on the
31 March 1978 par value of the United States dollar in terms
of gold.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”,
along with its amendments, collectively referred as FAS 133,
became effective on 1 January 2001. FAS 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument be recorded in the Balance Sheet as either
an asset or liability measured at its fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recorded in net income or other
comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is
designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if it is, the type
of hedge transaction.

ADB uses derivative instruments for asset/liability
management of individual positions and portfolios, as well as
for the reduction of transaction costs. In applying FAS 133 for
purposes of financial statement reporting, ADB has elected not
to define any qualifying hedging relationships. Rather, all
derivative instruments, as defined by FAS 133, have been marked
to fair value, and all changes in the fair value have been
recognized in net income. ADB has elected not to define any
qualifying hedging relationships, not because economic hedges
do not exist, but rather because the application of FAS 133
hedging criteria does not make fully evident ADB’s risk
management strategies.

The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
includes the difference between the carrying value and the fair
value of the derivative instruments in the borrowings portfolio
as well as loans that met hedge criteria on 31 December 2000,
offset by any gains or losses on these borrowings and loans for
which a fair value exposure was being hedged. The net effect
gave rise to a transition loss of $81,657,000 in comprehensive
income and a gain of $34,656,000 was reported in net income.
The allocation between net income and other comprehensive
income was based upon the hedging relationships that existed
before the initial application of this statement.

Since ADB has not defined any qualifying hedging relationships under this standard, the amount recorded in other

OCR-8

CONTINUED

comprehensive income as part of the transition is being reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods in which the
hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of deposits
held by ADB other than derivative instruments are considered
by Management to be “Available for Sale” and are reported at
estimated fair value, which represents their fair market value.
Time deposits are classified as “Held-to-Maturity” and are
reported at cost. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in
“CAPITAL AND RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other
comprehensive income.” Realized gains and losses are included
in income from investments and are measured by the difference
between amortized cost and the net proceeds of sales. With
respect to futures, realized gain or loss is reported based on
daily settlement of the net cash margin.

Securities Transferred Under Securities Lending Arrangement
and Securities Purchased Under Resale Arrangement

ADB accounts for transfers of financial assets in accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfers are accounted for as
sales when control over the transferred assets has been relinquished. Otherwise the transfers are accounted for as repurchase/resale agreements and collateralized financing
arrangements. Securities transferred under securities lending
arrangements are recorded as assets and reported at estimated
fair value. Securities received under resale arrangements are
not recorded on ADB's balance sheet.

Loans

ADB’s loans are made to or guaranteed by members, with the
exception of loans to the private sector, and have maturities
ranging between 3 and 30 years. ADB requires its borrowers to
absorb exchange risks attributable to fluctuations in the value
of the currencies which it has disbursed. Loan interest income
and loan commitment fees are recognized on accrual basis.
With the introduction of LIBOR-based loans in 2001, in line
with ADB’s principle of cost pass through pricing, any variation
in the actual cost of borrowings is passed to LIBOR-based
borrowers as surcharge or rebate.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

It is the policy of ADB to place loans in nonaccrual status
for which principal, interest, or other charges are overdue by
six months. Interest and other charges on nonaccruing loans
are included in income only to the extent that payments have
been received by ADB. ADB maintains a position of not taking
part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public
sector loans. In the case of private sector loans, ADB may agree
to debt rescheduling only after alternative courses of action
have been exhausted.

ADB determines that a loan is impaired and therefore
subject to provisioning when principal or interest is in arrears
for one year for public sector loans (unless there is clear and
convincing evidence warranting the deferment or acceleration
of such provisioning) and six months for private sector loans.
If the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan’s effective interest rate is less than the carrying
value of the loan, a valuation allowance is established with a
corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.

ADB’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on its past loan loss experience,
known and inherent risks in existing loans, and adverse situations that may affect a borrower’s ability to repay.

Effective 2000, ADB levies front-end fees on all new public
sector loans. These fees are deferred and amortized over the
life of the loans after offsetting deferred direct loan origination costs. In 2004, entire front-end fee on all new public sector
loans approved during the year was waived.

ADB levies a commitment charge on the undisbursed
balance of effective loans. Unless otherwise provided by the
loan agreement, the charges take effect commencing on the
60" day after the loan signing date and are credited to loan
income.

Guarantees

ADB extends guarantees to public sector and private sector
borrowers. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the
underlying financial obligation of the borrower is incurred. ADB
would be required to perform under its guarantees if the payments guaranteed were not made by the debtor, and the
guaranteed party called the guarantee by demanding payments
from ADB in accordance with the term of the guarantee.
Prior to 1 January 2003, guarantees in the absence of
any call, were not reflected in the financial statements but
disclosed as a note to the financial statements (see Note E) in
accordance with the provisions of FASB No. 5, Accounting for

Contingencies. FASB Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others”, which
came into effect in 2003, requires the recognition of two types
of liabilities that are associated with guarantees: (a) the standby ready obligation to perform, and (b) the contingent liability.
ADB recognizes at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
the stand-by ready obligation to perform on guarantees issued
and modified after 31 December 2002. The liability is included
in “Miscellaneous liabilities”.

Front-end fee income on guarantees received is deferred
and amortized over the period of the guarantee contract and
the unamortized balance of deferred front-end fee of guarantee is included in “Miscellaneous liabilities.”

Equity Investments

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable
fair values are reported at cost less probable losses inherent in
the portfolio but not specifically identifiable.

The reserve against losses for equity investments is reviewed
quarterly based on Management’s evaluation of potential losses
for such investments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains
and losses excluded from net income and reported in “CAPITAL
AND RESERVES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive
income.” ADB applies the equity method of accounting to one
investment where it has the ability to exercise significant influence
and to equity investments in limited partnership.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and, except
for land, depreciated over estimated useful lives on a straightline basis. Maintenance, repairs, and minor betterments are
charged to expense.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
liabilities at the end of the year and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the year. The actual results could
differ from those estimates.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Accounting and Reporting Developments

In April and December 2003, FASB issued FAS No. 149 “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” and FIN No. 46 (revised), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”, respectively. These standards do not have a
significant impact on ADB's financial statements.

In December 2003, FASB issued FAS No. 132 (Revised
2003), “Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits.” This statement provided for additional
employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, which have been incorporated in Note M.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, ADB considers
that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE FROM
BANKS.”

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts and information have been made to conform to the current year’s
presentation.

NOTE C—RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF CURRENCIES
AND DEMAND OBLIGATIONS OF MEMBERS

In accordance with Article 24, paragraph 2(i) of the Charter,
the use by ADB or by any recipient from ADB of certain currencies
may be restricted by members to payments for goods or services
produced and intended for use in their territories. With respect
to the currencies of 39 DMCs for 2004 (40 - 2003), cash in
banks (due from banks) and demand obligations totaling
$50,625,000 ($54,388,000 - 2003) and $173,672,000
($173,744,000 - 2003), respectively, may be, but are not currently
so restricted.

In accordance with Article 24, paragraphs 2(i) and (ii) of
the Charter, one member (one - 2003) has restricted the use by
ADB or by any recipient from ADB of its currency to payments
for goods or services produced in its territory. As such, cash in
banks (due from banks) and investments totaling $1,000 ($18,000
- 2003) and $2,789,000 ($2,766,000 - 2003), respectively, have
been restricted. None of the demand obligations held by ADB
in 2004 was restricted (nil - 2003).

NOTE D—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are
governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board
of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment Authority
to invest in government and government-related debt
instruments and in time deposits. In the US dollar portfolio
only and up to limited amounts, investments may be made in
corporate bonds rated A or better, AAA-rated asset-backed
securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities. Securities
may be lent, borrowed, and sold short.

In addition, ADB may purchase and sell financial futures
and option contracts, and enter into currency and interest rate
swaps, and forward rate agreements. Exposure to interest rate
risk may be adjusted within defined bands to reflect changing
market conditions. These adjustments are made through the
purchase and sale of securities, and financial futures. Accordingly, financial futures are held for risk management purposes.
At 31 December 2004, the notional amount of outstanding
purchase and sales futures contracts were $110,900,000 and
$21,800,000, respectively, ($93,600,000 and $129,200,000 2003). In addition, ADB entered into 18 asset swap transactions with a total notional amount of $2,125,611,000
($1,321,986,000 - 2003).

Included in “Other securities” as of 31 December 2004 were
corporate bonds and other obligations of banks amounting to
$2,300,457,000 ($2,255,768,000 — 2003) and asset/mortgagebacked securities of $664,625,000 ($653,672,000 - 2003).

As of 31 December 2004, gross unrealized losses amounted
to $54,719,000 ($53,690,000 - 2003) from government and
government-guaranteed obligations, corporate bonds and mortgage/asset-backed securities, resulting from the market movement. There were six government and government-guaranteed
obligations, one corporate obligation, 23 mortgage/asset-backed
security positions that sustained unrealized losses for over one
year, representing only 4.49% (0.03% - 2003) of the investments. Additional details are as follows:

Asset/Mortgage-backed Securities: Asset/Mortgagebacked securities are instruments whose cash flow is based on
the cash flows of a pool of underlying assets or mortgage loans
managed by a trust.

Futures: Futures are contracts for delayed delivery of
securities or money market instruments in which the seller agrees
to make delivery at a specified future date of a specified instrument at a specified price or yield. Initial margin requirements
are met with cash or securities, and changes in the market prices
are generally settled daily in cash. ADB generally closes out
open positions prior to maturity. Therefore, cash receipts or
payments are limited to the change in market value of the future
contracts.

NOTE E—LOANS AND GUARANTEES
Loans

ADB does not currently sell its loans, nor does it believe there
is a comparable market for its loans. The estimated fair value
of all loans is based on the estimated cash flows from principal
repayments, interest and other charges discounted at the
applicable market yield curves for ADB’s borrowing cost plus
lending spread. The estimated fair value of public sector loans
is not generally affected by credit risks based on ADB's experience with its borrowers. Allowance for loan losses is made
against impaired public sector and private sector loans.

* Transformed from pool-based multicurrency loans effective 1 January 2004.

Prior to 1 July 1986, the lending rate of ADB was based
on a multicurrency fixed lending rate system under which loans
carried interest rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the
entire life of the loans. Effective 1 July 1986, ADB adopted a
multicurrency pool-based variable lending rate system. In
addition, in July 1992, ADB introduced a United States dollar
pool-based variable lending rate system, and in November 1994,
a market-based lending rate system was made available to
financial intermediaries in the public sector and to the private
sector borrowers. For loans to the private sector borrowers,
approximately 86% (83% - 2003) of the loans were based on
market-based lending rates.

Commencing 1 July 2001, ADB offered LIBOR-based loans
(LBLs) in the following currencies - Euro, Japanese yen, and
United States dollar. The new LBL lending facility offers borrowers the flexibility of (i) choice of currency and interest rate
basis; (ii) options to link repayment schedules to actual disbursements for financial intermediary borrowers; (iii) change
the original loan terms (currency and interest rate basis) at any
time during the life of the loan; and (iv) options to cap or
collar the floating lending rate at any time during the life of
the loan. LBL terms are available for all loans for which the
invitation to negotiate is issued on or after 1 July 2001. With
the introduction of LBLs, all other loan windows are no longer
offered to borrowers. In 2002, ADB offered local currency loans
to private sector borrowers.

In November 2003, ADB offered borrowers to transform
their outstanding pool-based multicurrency loans of $6.5 billion to pool-based single currency loans in Japanese yen. The
transformation facilitates borrower's administration for loan
service payments and loan accounting. The transformation
became effective on 1 January 2004.

In 2004, ADB received full prepayments for 41 loans
amounting to $2,790,488,000 ($5,883,772,000 - 2003) and
collected prepayment premiums of $59,427,000 ($107,404,000
- 2003) which have been included in “Other income from loans.”
Ninety-nine percent of the prepaid amounts were pool-based
single currency (US dollar and Japanese yen) loans and fixed
rate multi-currency loans.

Since 1988, ADB has charged front-end fees for private
sector loans. Effective 1 January 2000, ADB levies a front-end
fee of 1% for public sector loans for which the loan negotiations are completed after that date. In addition, a flat commitment fee of 0.75% is charged for new program loans and the
progressive commitment fee of 0.75% is maintained for project
loans. Effective 1 January 2000, the lending spread applied to
all outstanding pool-based OCR public sector loans and new
public sector market-based loans was increased from 0.4% to
0.6%.

Waivers of Lending Spread and Front-End Fee

In 2004, the Board of Governors approved the waiver of the
entire 1% front-end fee on all new public sector loans approved
during 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005 (waiver of 50 basis
points on public sector loans approved in 2003) and waiver of
20 basis points of the lending spread on public sector loans
outstanding from 1 July 2004 - 30 June 2005 for borrowers
that do not have loans in arrears. Front-end fees waived during
the year totaled $17,871,000 ($3,008,000 - 2003) and the
lending spread waiver reduced net income by $10.6 million.

The front-end fees received for the year ended 31 December 2004 were $23,734,000 ($24,342,000 - 2003). Administrative expenses relating to direct loan origination ofASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

outstanding for this loan as of 31 December 2004 was $2,300,000
($2,300,000 - 2003) of which $462,000 ($340,000 - 2003)
was overdue. The loan in nonaccrual status resulted in $144,000
($145,000 - 2003) not being recognized as income from public
sector loans for the year ended 31 December 2004. The accu
mulated interest and other charges on this loan that were not
recognized as income as of 31 December 2004 would have totaled
$702,000 ($558,000 - 2003).

Eleven private sector loans were in nonaccrual status as
of 31 December 2004 (twelve - 2003). The principal outstanding at that date was $50,426,000 ($77,115,000 - 2003) of which
$38,735,000 ($70,045,000 - 2003) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in $9,582,000 ($6,776,000 - 2003) not
being recognized as income from private sector loans for the
year ended 31 December 2004. The accumulated interest and
other charges on these loans that were not recognized as income
as of 31 December 2004 would have totaled $46,488,000
($36,906,000 - 2003).

Loan Loss Provision

ADB has not suffered any losses of principal on public sector
loans. During the year, loan loss provision of $2,060,000
($240,000 - 2003) was provided against one public sector loan.
The amount was determined based on the carrying value of the
loan and the present value of expected cash inflows discounted
at the loan’s effective interest rate. Loan loss provisions have
been made against impaired private sector loans (see Note K).

Information pertaining to loans which were subject to
loan loss provisions at 31 December 2004 and 2003 is as follows:

NOTE F—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB's investments in equity securities issued by private enterprises located in DMCs include a $7,472,000 ($14,284,000 2003) investment in the Asian Finance and Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC) and $20,016,000 investments in limited partnership which are accounted for on the equity method. AFIC,
domiciled and incorporated in Singapore, was established in
1989 with 26 shareholders comprising ADB and a group of
international commercial banks. AFIC is principally engaged in
the business of merchant banking including the operation of
an Asian Currency Unit under the terms and condition specified by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. ADB's participation in AFIC’s equity was to provide financing for private sector
enterprises to strengthen and diversify the institutional structure in DMCs. At the end of 2004, AFIC had $24,471,000 in
net assets ($46,891,000 - 2003) and $22,136,000 in net loss
(net profit of $3,270,000 - 2003).

ADB’s holding represents 30.5% of AFIC’s issued ordinary share capital and net assets. ADB also holds 100% of AFIC
issued convertible noncumulative preference shares in the amount
of $25,000,000 ($25,000,000 - 2003). As of 31 December 2004,

of these premises. The compensation is in lieu of being provided
premises under the agreement and accordingly, is deferred and
amortized over the estimated life of the new headquarters
building as a reduction of occupancy expense. The amortiza-PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

tion for the year ended 31 December 2004 amounted to $331,000
($337,000 - 2003) reducing depreciation expense for the new
headquarters building from $4,471,000 ($4,471,000 - 2003)
to $4,140,000 ($4,134,000 - 2003). At 31 December 2004, the
unamortized deferred compensation balance (included in
“ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES - Miscellaneous”)
was $8,639,000 ($9,039,000 - 2003). At 31 December 2004,
accumulated depreciation for property, furniture, and equipment was $112,545,000 ($101,766,000 - 2003).

NOTE H—BORROWINGS AND SWAP TRANSACTIONS

The key objective of ADB’s borrowing strategy is to provide
adequate funds at the lowest possible cost for the benefit of
its borrowers. ADB uses financial derivative instruments in
connection with its borrowing activities to increase cost efficiency, while achieving risk management objectives. Currency
swaps are used to convert a currency borrowed under advantageous terms into one of ADB's major operational currencies,
taking advantage of the opportunities offered in different
financial markets. Such currency swaps enable ADB to raise
operationally needed currencies in a cost-efficient way and to
maintain its borrowing presence in the major capital markets.
Interest rate swaps are used generally to reduce interest rate
mismatches arising from lending operations.

ADB issues structured debt, which includes embedded
derivatives in order to decrease its cost of borrowing. ADB
simultaneously enters into currency and/or interest rate swaps
to fully hedge the effects of such embedded derivatives.
Borrowings are reported on the balance sheet at their carrying
book value adjusted for any unamortized premium or discounts,
and include the fair value of embedded derivatives of
$364,972,000 as of 31 December 2004 ($149,474,000 - 2003)
that are required to be separately accounted for under FAS
133.

The fair value of outstanding currency swap agreements
and interest rate swap agreements is determined at the estimated amount that ADB would receive or pay to terminate the
agreements using a market-based valuation model. The basis
of valuation is the present value of expected cash flows based
on observable market data.

Interest rate swaps: Under a typical interest rate swap
agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments based
on a notional principal amount and an interest rate that is

CONTINUED

fixed at the outset of the agreement. The counterparty agrees
to make floating rate payments based on the same notional
principal amount. The terms of ADB’s interest rate swap agreements usually match the terms of particular borrowings.

Currency swaps: Under a typical currency swap agreement, one party agrees to make periodic payments in one currency
while the counterparty agrees to make periodic payments in
another currency. The payments may be fixed at the outset of
the agreement or vary based on interest rates. A receivable is
created for the currency swapped out, and a payable is created
for the currency swapped in. The terms of ADB’s currency swap
agreements usually match the terms of particular borrowings.

NOTE I—CAPITAL STOCK, CAPITAL TRANSFERRED TO
ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND, MAINTENANCE OF

Capital Stock

The authorized capital stock of ADB as of the end of 2004
consists of 3,499,171 shares (3,499,171 — 2003), all of which
have been subscribed by members (3,499,171 - 2003). Of the
subscribed shares, 3,253,061 (3,253,061 - 2003) are “callable”
and 246,110 (246,110 - 2003) are “paid-in.” The “callable”
share capital is subject to call by ADB only as and when required
to meet ADB's obligations incurred on borrowings of funds for
inclusion in its ordinary capital resources or on guarantees
chargeable to such resources. The “paid-in” share capital has
been paid or is payable in installments, partly in convertible
currencies and partly in the currency of the subscribing member which may be convertible. In accordance with Article 6,
paragraph 3 of the Charter, ADB accepts nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing demand obligations in satisfaction of the portion
payable in the currency of the member, provided such currency
is not required by ADB for the conduct of its operations. The
settlement of such amounts is not determinable and, accordingly, it is not practicable to determine a fair value for these
receivables.

As of 31 December 2004, all matured installments amounting to $3,799,515,000 ($3,641,308,000 - 2003) were received
(receivable of $739,000 from one country - 2003). Installments

For the Year ending 31 December:

Capital Transferred to Asian Development Fund

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of the
Charter, the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside
of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by members
pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the Charter and of the
convertible currency portion paid by members pursuant to Article
6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter as of 28 April 1973 to be used
as a part of the Special Funds of ADB. The resources so set aside
amounting to $73,692,000 as of 31 December 2004
($70,746,000 - 2003) expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis
of $1.54784 ($1.48597 - 2003) per SDR ($57,434,000 in terms
of $1.20635 per 1966 dollar—see Note B), were allocated and
transferred to the Asian Development Fund.

Maintenance of Value of Currency Holdings

Prior to 1 April 1978, the effective date of the Second Amendment to the IMF Articles, ADB implemented maintenance of value
(MOV) in respect of holdings of member currencies in terms of
1966 dollars, in accordance with the provisions of Article 25 of
the Charter and relevant resolutions of the Board of Directors.
Since then, settlement of MOV has been put in abeyance.

Inasmuch as the valuation of ADB’s capital stock and the
basis of determining possible MOV obligations are still under
consideration, notional amounts have been calculated provisionally as receivable from or payable to members in order to
maintain the value of currency holdings in terms of the SDR.
In view thereof, the notional MOV amounts of receivables and
payables are offset against one another and shown as net notional
amounts to maintain value of currency holdings in the “CAPITAL
AND RESERVES” portion of the Balance Sheet. The timing of
the establishment and settlement of such amounts is uncertain
and, accordingly, it is not practicable to determine a fair value
for such receivables and payables.

The net notional amounts as of 31 December 2004 consisted of (a) the increase of $732,935,000 ($606,902,000 - 2003)
in amounts required to maintain the value of currency holdings
to the extent of matured and paid capital subscriptions due to
the increase in the value of the SDR in relation to the United
States dollar during the period from 1 April 1978 to 31 December
2004 and (b) the net increase of $89,991,000 (decrease of

$13,903,000 - 2003) in the value of such currency holdings in
relation to the United States dollar during the same period. In
terms of receivable from and payable to members, they are as

follows:
2004 2003
Notional MOV Receivables $912,255,000 $879,531,000
Notional MOV Payables 269,311,000 258,726,000
Total $642,944,000 $620,805,000

Membership

As of 31 December 2004, ADB is owned by 63 member countries, 45 countries from the region and 18 countries from outside
the region (see OCR-7). There has been no subscription from
new members in 2004 (Luxembourg and Palau - 2003).

NOTE J—RESERVES
Ordinary Reserve and Net Income

Under the provisions of Article 40 of the Charter, the Board of
Governors shall determine annually what part of the net income
shall be allocated, after making provision for reserves, to surplus
and what part, if any, shall be distributed to the members. During
2004, no allocation to ordinary reserve was made ($473,059,000
- 2003). Of the net income for the year ended 31 December
2003, the amount of $218,800,000 was allocated to Loan Loss
Reserve, $195,472,000 to Surplus and the amounts of
$150,000,000 and $50,000,000 were allocated to ADF and TASF,
respectively ($200,000,000 and $80,000,000, respectively - 2003).

The restatement of the capital stock for purposes of these
financial statements on the basis of the SDR instead of the
1966 dollar (see Note B) resulted in a net charge of $27,170,000
to the Ordinary Reserve during the year ended 31 December
2004 ($50,567,000 - 2003). That charge is the increase in the
value of the matured and paid capital subscriptions caused by
the change during the year in the value of the SDR in relation
to the United States dollar not allocated to members as notional
maintenance of value adjustments in accordance with resolutions of the Board of Directors.

Cumulative Revaluation Adjustments Account

In May 2002, the Board of Governors approved the allocation
of net income representing the cumulative FAS 133 adjustmentsPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

to a separate category of Reserves - “Cumulative Revaluation
Adjustments Account.” During the year, the 2003 FAS adjustments of $178,387,000 resulted in a reduction (increase of
$224,756,000 - 2003) of the balance of the Cumulative Revaluation Adjustments account at 31 December 2004 to
$193,870,000 ($372,257,000 - 2003).

Special Reserve

The Special Reserve includes commissions on loans and guarantee
fees on guarantees set aside pursuant to Article 17 of the Charter.
Special Reserve assets consist of term deposits and government
and government-guaranteed obligations and are included under
the heading “INVESTMENTS.” For the year ended 31 December
2004, guarantee fees amounting to $3,473,000 ($2,302,000 2003) were appropriated to Special Reserve.

Loan Loss Reserve

In 2004, the Board of Directors approved the creation of Loan
Loss Reserve through an allocation of $218,800,000 out of
prior year net income. The Loan Loss Reserve forms part of
Capital and Reserves to be used as a basis for capital adequacy
against the estimated expected loss in ADB's public sector loans
and guarantees portfolio. The estimated expected loss is determined using ADB’s credit risk model net of loan loss provisions
taken up in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Surplus

Surplus represents funds for future use to be determined by
the Board of Governors. During 2004, the Board of Governors
allocated $195,472,000 out of 2003 net income to Surplus (nil
- 2003).

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income has two major components: net income
and other comprehensive income comprising gains and losses
affecting equity that, under generally accepted accounting
principles, are excluded from net income. Other comprehensive
income includes such items as the effects of the implementation of FAS 133, unrealized gains and losses on available-forsale securities and listed equity investments, currency translation
adjustments and minimum pension liability adjustment.

31 December 2004 was $281,793,000 ($369,455,000 - 2003).
The annualized rate of return on the average investments held
during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning
and end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses
on investment securities, was 2.21% (3.74% - 2003). If unrealized gains and losses on investment securities were included,
the annualized rate of return would be 1.81% (2.30% - 2003).

Income from other sources primarily includes dividends
received for the year ended 31 December 2004 amounting to
$10,540,000 ($14,879,000 - 2003), gain on sale of equity
investments of $30,425,000 ($25,440,000 - 2003), and share
in the net loss of equity investments of $13,185,000 (net income
of $632,000 - 2003) accounted for on the equity method.

Total interest expense incurred for the year ended
31 December 2004 amounted to $849,414,000 ($974,839,000
- 2003). Other financial expenses consist of amortization of
borrowings’ issuance costs and other expenses of $19,397,000
($22,070,000 - 2003) net of income of $11,000 ($9,400,000
- 2003) on early redemption of certain borrowing obligations.

Administrative expenses (other than those pertaining
directly to ordinary operations and special operations) for the
year ended 31 December 2004 were apportioned between
ordinary capital resources and the Asian Development Fund in
proportion of the relative volume of operational activities of
each fund. Of the total administrative expenses of $305,893,000
($285,136,000 - 2003), $165,151,000 ($153,018,000 - 2003)
was accordingly charged to the Asian Development Fund. The
balance of administrative expenses after allocation was reduced
by the deferral of direct loan origination costs of $22,421,000
($13,678,000 - 2003) related to new loans for the year ended
31 December 2004 (see Notes B and E).

Following the approval by the Board of Directors in June
2003 of the resumption of direct net income allocation to TASF
to finance technical assistance (TA) operations, no TA commitments during the year were charged to OCR current income as

NOTE M—STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

ADB has a contributory defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan
(the Plan). Every employee, as defined under the Plan, shall, as
a condition of service, become a participant from the first day
of service, provided that at such a date, the employee has not
reached the normal retirement age of 60. The Plan applies also
to members of the Board of Directors who elect to join the
Plan. Retirement benefits are based on length of service and
highest average remuneration during two years of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated and are not included in the
accompanying Balance Sheet. The costs of administering the
Plan are absorbed by ADB, except for fees paid to the investment managers and related charges, including custodian fees,
which are borne by the Plan.

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make additional voluntary contributions. ADB’s contribution is determined at a rate sufficient
to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the
participants’ contributions.

Expected Contributions

The expected amount of contributions to the Plan for 2005
amounts to $64,020,000 representing ADB’s contributions of
$19,734,000 ($17,431,000 - 2003), based on budgeted contribution rate of 16% (15% - 2003), participants’ mandatory
contributions of $11,507,000 ($10,846,000 - 2003) and discretionary contributions of $32,779,000.

Investment Strategy

Contributions in excess of current benefits payments are invested
in international financial markets and in a variety of investment
vehicles. The Plan employs six external asset managers and one
global custodian who function within the guidelines established
by the Plan’s Investment Committee. The investment of these
assets, over the long term, is expected to produce higher returns
than short-term investments. The investment policy incorporates
the Plan’s package of desired investment return, and tolerance for
tisk, taking into account the nature and duration of the Plan’s
liabilities. The Plan’s assets are diversified among different markets and different asset classes. The use of derivatives forPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

speculation, leverage or taking risks is prohibited. Selected derivatives are used for hedging and transactional efficiency purposes.

The Plan’s investment policy is periodically reviewed and
revised to reflect the best interest of the Plan’s participants and
beneficiaries. The current policy, adopted in January 2003, specifies an asset-mix structure of 70% of assets in equities and
30% in fixed income securities. At present, investments of the
Plan’s assets are divided into three categories: US equity, NonUS equity, and US fixed income.

As of 31 December 2004 and 2003, the breakdown of
the fair value of plan assets held is as follows:

All investments excluding time deposits are valued using
market prices. Time deposits are reported at cost. Fixed income
securities include US government and government-guaranteed
obligations, corporate bonds and time deposits. Other assets
include forward exchange contracts in various foreign currencies transacted to hedge currency exposure in the investment
portfolio, which are reported at fair value.

For the year ended 31 December 2004 the net return on
the Plan assets was 11.1% (27.7% - 2003). ADB expects the
long-term rate of return on the assets to be 8%.

Assumptions

The assumed overall rate of return takes into account longterm return expectations of the underlying asset classes within
the investment portfolio mix, and the expected duration of the
Plan’s liabilities. Return expectations are forward looking and,
in general, not much weight is given to short-term experience.
Unless there is a drastic change in investment policy or market
environment, the assumed investment return of 8% on the Plan’s
assets is expected to remain broadly the same, year to year.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

In 1993, ADB adopted a cost-sharing plan for retirees’ medical
insurance premiums. Under the plan, ADB is obligated to pay
75% of the Group Medical Insurance Plan premiums for retirees,
including retired members of the Board of Directors, and their
eligible dependents who elected to participate. The cost-sharing
plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits.

The table on the next page sets forth the pension and
postretirement medical benefits at 31 December 2004 and 2003:ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

Additional fair value information, including methods used
to estimate certain values, is included in the notes referenced
in the above table.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using valuation models.
The basis of valuation is the expected cash flows discounted
based on observable market data.

NOTE O—CREDIT RISK

ADB is exposed to risk if the borrowers falls in arrears on
payments. ADB manages country risk for lending operations
through continuous monitoring of creditworthiness of the
borrowers and rigorous capital adequacy framework. Guarantees involve elements of credit risk which are also not reflected
on the balance sheet. Credit risk represents the potential loss
due to possible nonperformance by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contract.

As of 31 December 2004, ADB has a significant concentration credit risk to Asian and the Pacific region associated
with loan and guarantee products with credit exposure determined based on fair value of loans and outstanding guarantees
amounting to $27,538,206,000.

ADB transacts in various financial instruments as part of
liquidity and asset/liability management purposes that may
involve credit risks. For all securities, ADB manages credit risks
by following the guidelines set forth in the Investment Authority.
(See Note D).

ADB has a potential risk of loss if the swap counterparty
fails to perform its obligations. In order to reduce such credit
tisk, ADB only enters into long-term swap transactions with
counterparties eligible under ADB's swap guidelines which include
a requirement that the counterparties have a credit rating of
A-/A3 or higher and requires certain counterparties with executed Credit Support Annex, to provide collateral in form of
cash or other approved liquid securities based on mark-to-market
exposure.

As of 31 December 2004, ADB had received collateral of
$219,421,000 in connection with the swap agreements. ADB
has also entered into master swap agreements which contains
legally enforceable close-out netting provisions for all counterparties with outstanding swap transactions.

NOTE P—SPECIAL AND TRUST FUNDS

ADB’s operations include special operations, which are financed
from special fund resources, consisting of the Asian Development
Fund, the Technical Assistance Special Fund, Japan Special Fund,
and the Asian Development Bank Institute Special Fund.

In addition, ADB, alone or jointly with donors, administers on behalf of the donors, including members of ADB, their
agencies and other development institutions, projects/programs
supplementing ADB’s operations. Such projects/programs are
funded with external funds administered by ADB and with
external funds not under ADB’s administration. The funds are
restricted for specific uses including technical assistance to
borrowers and technical assistance for regional programs. The
responsibilities of ADB under these arrangements range from
project processing to project implementation including the
facilitation of procurement of goods and services.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Asian Development Bank

We have audited the accompanying special purpose statements of assets, liabilities and fund balances of
the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund at December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related
special purpose statements of revenues and expenses, cash flows and changes in fund balances for the years
then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Asian Development
Bank. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosure in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note B, the Board of Directors approved in May 2001 the adoption of special purpose
financial statements for the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund. With the adoption of the
special purpose financial statements, loan loss provisioning has been eliminated. The accompanying
financial statements are not intended to be a presentation in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

In our opinion, the special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances of Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund at
31 December 2004 and 2003, and the revenues and expenses and cash flows for the years then ended, on
the basis explained in Note B.

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the special purpose financial statements
taken as a whole. The accompanying special purpose statements of loans as at 31 December 2004 and 2003,
and of resources as at 31 December 2004 are presented for purposes of additional analyses and are not
required parts of the special purpose financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audits of the special purpose financial statements and in our opinion is fairly stated
in all material respects in relation to the special purpose financial statements taken as a whole.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, Board of Directors,
management and members of the Asian Development Bank—Asian Development Fund. However, under the
Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Fund, this report is included in the Annual Report of the
Asian Development Bank and is therefore a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Asian Development Fund (ADF) was established on 28 June
1974 to more effectively carry out the special operations of the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) by providing resources on
concessional terms which are made available almost exclusively
to the least developed borrowing countries.

The resources of ADF have been subsequently augmented
by seven replenishments, the most recent of which became
effective in June 2001 in a total amount equivalent to
$2,791,483,000 to cover the operational requirements for the
four-year period from January 2001. During the year, an
allocation in the amount of $150,000,000 ($200,000,000 2003) was made to ADF from the 2003 net income of ADB’s
ordinary capital resources (OCR).

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

In May 2001, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of
the special purpose financial statements for ADF. Due to the
nature and organization of ADF, these financial statements have
been prepared for the specific purpose of reflecting the sources
and applications of member subscriptions. With the adoption
of the special purpose financial statements, loan loss provisioning has been eliminated. With the exception of the aforementioned, the ADF financial statements are prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of contributing member countries are functional
currencies. The reporting currency is the United States dollar,
and the special purpose financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, amounts available for loan commitments and
advance payments on contributions are translated from their
functional currencies to the reporting currency, generally at
the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period.
Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each semimonthly period, generally at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates

the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments relating to set-aside resources (see Note
G) are recorded as notional amounts receivable from or payable to OCR. All other translation adjustments are charged or
credited to “Accumulated translation adjustments” and reported
in “FUND BALANCES” as part of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.”

Investments

All investment securities and negotiable certificate of deposits
held by ADF are considered by Management to be “Available
for Sale” and are reported at estimated fair value, which represents
their fair market value. Time deposits are classified as “Heldto-Maturity” and are reported at cost. Unrealized gains and
losses are reported in “FUND BALANCES” as part of
“Accumulated other comprehensive income.” Realized gains and
losses are included in revenue from investments and are measured
by the difference between amortized cost and the net proceeds
of sales.

Securities Transferred Under Securities Lending Arrangement
and Securities Purchased Under Resale Arrangement

ADB accounts for transfers of financial assets in accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfers are accounted for as
sales when control over the transferred assets has been relinquished. Otherwise the transfers are accounted as repurchase/
resale agreements and collateralized financing arrangements.
Securities transferred under securities lending arrangements are
recorded as assets and reported at estimated fair value. Secutities received under resale arrangements are not recorded on
ADB’s balance sheets.

Loans

It is the policy of ADF to place in nonaccrual status loans made
to eligible borrowing member countries if the principal or interest
with respect to any such loans is overdue by six months. Interest
on nonaccruing loans is included in revenue only to the extent
that payments have actually been received by ADF. ADB maintains a position of not taking part in debt rescheduling agreements with respect to public sector loans. In the case of private
sector loans, ADB may agree to debt rescheduling only afterASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

alternative courses of action have been exhausted. When ADB
decides that a particular loan is no longer collectible, the entire
amount will be expensed during the period.

Contributed Resources

Contributions by member countries are included in the financial statements as amounts committed and are reported in
“Contributed Resources” as part of “FUND BALANCES” from
the date Instruments of Contribution are deposited and related
formalities are completed.

Contributions are generally paid or to be paid in the
currency of the contributor either in cash or notes.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of special purpose financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and fund balances
as at the end of the year and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the year. The actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Special Purpose Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the special purpose statement of cash flows,
ADF considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to
“DUE FROM BANKS.”

Reclassification

Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts and information have been made to conform to the current year’s presentation.

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are
governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board
of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment Authority
to invest in government and government-related debt instruments and in time deposits. In the US dollar portfolio only and
up to limited amounts, investments may be made in corporate
bonds rated A or better, AAA-rated asset-backed securities, and

AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities. Securities may be lent,
borrowed, and sold short.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio
as of 31 December 2004 and 2003 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, including securities transferred under secutities lending arrangement and securities purchased under resale
arrangement, based on the portfolio held at the beginning and
end of each month, excluding unrealized gains and losses on
investment securities, was 3.43% (3.91% - 2003). If unrealized
gains and losses on investment securities were included, the
annualized rate of return would have been 3.39% (3.55% - 2003).

As of 31 December 2004, gross unrealized losses amounted
to $2,031,000 ($6,203,000 - 2003) from government and
government-guaranteed obligations and corporate bonds,
resulting from market movements. There are eleven positions
(four - 2003) that sustained unrealized losses for over one year,
representing only 4.7% (1.6% - 2003) of the investments.

NOTE D—LOANS AND LOAN LOSS PROVISION

Loans

Prior to 1 January 1999, loans of ADF were extended to eligible
borrowing member countries, which bore a service charge of
1% and required repayment over periods ranging from 35 to
40 years. On 14 December 1998, the Board of Directors approved
an amendment to ADF loan terms, as follows: (i) for loans to
finance specific projects, the maturity was shortened to 32 years
including an 8-year grace period; (ii) for program loans to support
sector development, the maturity was shortened to 24 years
including an 8-year grace period; and (iii) all new loans bear
a 1% interest charge during the grace period, and 1.5% during
the amortization period, with equal amortization. The revised
ADF lending terms took effect on 1 January 1999 for loans for
which formal loan negotiations were completed on or after
1 January 1999. ADF requires borrowers to absorb exchange
risks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the currencies
disbursed.

ADB believes that there is no comparable market, nor
ADB intends to sell its loans. The use of market data to arrive
at the loan at fair value will give meaningless results. As such,
the fair value of loans is determined using an entry value method.
Under this method, fair value is determined based on the terms

at which a similar loan would currently be made by ADB to a
similar borrower. For such loans, fair value approximates the
carrying amount. The estimated fair value of loans is not affected
by credit risks because the amount of any such adjustment is
not considered to have a material effect based on ADB’s experience with its borrowers.

Undisbursed loan commitments and an analysis of loans
by country as of 31 December 2004 are shown in ADF-5.

The principal amount outstanding of public sector loans
in nonaccrual status as of 31 December 2004 was $515,326,000
($495,974,000 - 2003) of which $135,776,000 ($106,895,000
- 2003) was overdue. Loans in nonaccrual status resulted in
$4,906,000 ($4,620,000 - 2003) not being recognized as income
from loans for the year ended 31 December 2004. The accumulated interest on these loans that was not recognized as
income as of 31 December 2004 would have totaled $33,187,000
($28,281,000 - 2003). The loans in nonaccrual status as of
31 December 2004 were 28 loans made to Myanmar (28 loans
to Myanmar - 2003).

No private sector loan was in nonaccrual status as of
31 December 2004 (nil - 2003).

Private sector loan outstanding as of 31 December 2004
was $6,074,000 ($5,962,000 - 2003), and there was no undisbursed loan commitment (nil - 2003).ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND

NOTES TO SPECIAL PURPOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE E—DUE FROM CONTRIBUTORS

Included in “Due from contributors” are notes of contributors
and contributions receivable. Notes of contributors are nonnegotiable, noninterest-bearing and, subject to certain restrictions imposed by applicable Board of Governors’ resolutions,
encashable by ADB at par upon demand.

ADB currently expects that the notes outstanding at
31 December 2004 will be encashed in varying amounts over
a seven-year period ending 31 December 2011.

The fair value of notes of contributors is determined using
an entry value method, whereby fair value is determined based
on the terms at which notes are currently being accepted from
contributors. On this basis, the fair value of outstanding notes
of contributors approximates their carrying amount.

NOTE F— ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND
ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses for 2004 included a directly identifiable expense of $1,000 ($3,000 - 2003) and administration
charge from OCR amounting to $165,151,000 ($153,018,000
- 2003). The charge represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses of ADB (other than those pertaining directly
to ordinary operations and special operations), in the proportion of the relative volume of operational activities of each
fund.

NOTE G—SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 19, paragraph 1(i) of the
Articles of Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank
(the Charter), the Board of Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the unimpaired “paid-in” capital paid by
member countries pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(a) of the
Charter and of the convertible currency portion paid by member
countries pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2(b) of the Charter
as of 28 April 1973, to be used as a part of the Special Funds
of ADB. The capital so set aside was allocated and transferred
from the OCR to ADF as Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of ADB is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Charter, “in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966” (the 1966
dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been

translated into the current United States dollar (ADB’s unit of
account), on the basis of its par value in terms of gold. From
1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arrived at on this basis was
$1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at which time
the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into effect, currencies
no longer had par values in terms of gold. Pending ADB's selection
of the appropriate successor to the 1966 dollar, the Set-Aside
Resources have been valued for purposes of the accompanying
financial statements in terms of the Special Drawing Right (SDR),
at the value in current United States dollars as computed by
the IMF. As of 31 December 2004, the value of the SDR in
terms of the current United States dollar was $1.54784 ($1.48597
- 2003). On this basis, Set-Aside Resources amounted to
$73,692,000 ($70,746,000 - 2003). If the capital stock of ADB
as of 31 December 2004 had been valued in terms of $12,063.50
per share, Set-Aside Resources would have been $57,434,000.

NOTE H—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

Comprehensive income has two major components: excess of
revenue over expenses and other comprehensive income. Other
comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale securities and currency translation adjustments.

NOTE I—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations
are not readily available are valued using methodologies and
assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which such financial
instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction, or
whether they are actually exchangeable is not determinable.

The carrying amounts of ADF’s assets, liabilities, and fund
balances are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and E for
discussions relating to investments, loans, and notes of
contributors.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

TASF-6

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) was established
to provide technical assistance on a grant basis to developing
member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
for regional technical assistance. TASF resources consist of direct
voluntary contributions by members, allocations from the net
income of ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributions, and revenue from investments and other sources.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the TASF are presented on the basis
of unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets.

TASF reports contributed cash and other assets as restricted
support if they are received with donor stipulations that limit
the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose restriction is
accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets are reclassified
to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of
Activities and Changes in Net Assets as net assets released from
restrictions. There were no restricted net assets at 31 December
2004 and 2003.

Investments

All investment securities held by TASF are reported at estimated
fair value, which represents their fair market value. Realized
and unrealized gains and losses are included in revenue. Time
deposits are classified as “Held-to-Maturity” and are reported
at cost.

Contributions

Contributions from members are included in the financial statements from the date contribution agreements become effective. Contributions from donors which are restricted by them
to technical assistance (TA) projects/programs with specified
procurement sources are classified as temporarily restricted
contributions. Those without any stipulations as to specific use
are accounted for as unrestricted contributions.

Technical Assistance to Member Countries

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements
when the related project is approved and becomes effective.
Upon completion of the TA project, any undisbursed amount
is written back as a reduction in technical assistance for the
period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment is eliminated accordingly.

Reporting Currency

The financial statements of TASF are expressed in thousands
of current United States dollars. As a matter of convenience,
the United States dollar is the functional and reporting currency and is used to measure exchange gains and losses.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances in currencies other
than United States dollars are translated at the applicable rates
of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Contributions
included in the financial statements during the year are
recognized at applicable exchange rates as of the respective
dates of commitment. Revenue and expense amounts in currencies other than United States dollars are translated for each
semimonthly period generally at the applicable rates of exchange
at the beginning of each period; such practice approximates
the application of average rates in effect during the period.
Translation adjustments are accounted for as exchange gains
or losses and are credited or charged to operations.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and uncommitted balances as
at the end of the year and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the year. The actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the TASF

considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

TASF-6

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are
governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board
of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment Authority
to invest in government and government-related debt instruments and in time deposits. In the US dollar portfolio only and
up to limited amounts, investments may be made in corporate
bonds rated A or better, AAA-rated asset-backed securities, and
AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities.

The currency compositions of the investment portfolio
as of 31 December 2004 and 2003 expressed in United States
dollars are as follows:

Currency 2003
Australian dollar $ 8,359,000
Canadian dollar 131,321,000
Euro 15,315,000
United States dollar 68,789,000
Others 4,709,000

Total $228,493,000

 

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month was 2.14% (2.78% - 2003).

NOTE D—FUNDING

Since inception in 1967, direct contributions have been made
by 29 member countries. In 1986 and 1992, the Board of
Governors, in authorizing a replenishment of the ADF, provided
for an allocation to the TASF in an aggregate amount equivalent to $72,000,000 and $140,000,000, respectively, to be
used for technical assistance to ADF borrowing developing
member countries and for regional technical assistance.

In 2004, $50,000,000 was allocated out of OCR net income
to TASF bringing the accumulated allocation out of OCR net
income to $631,000,000.

Some of the direct contributions received can be subject
to restricted procurement sources, while some are given on condition that the technical assistance be made on a reimbursable
basis. The total contributions received for the years ended
31 December 2004 and 2003 were without restrictions.

NOTE E—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent effective ongoing grant-financed TA
projects/programs which are not yet disbursed as of the end of
the year. During 2004, an amount of $6,283,000 ($10,136,000
- 2003) representing completed and canceled TA projects has
been written back as a reduction in technical assistance of the
period and the corresponding undisbursed commitment has been
eliminated. The fair value of undisbursed commitments approximates the amounts undisbursed because ADB expects that grants
will be made for all projects/programs covered by the commitments. For technical assistance approved prior to 1 January
2002, and provided as a project preparatory grant leading to
an ADB loan, the amount of the grant exceeding $250,000 are
refunded by the borrower through the loan proceeds under the
terms of that ADB loan. Refinanced amount of $1,337,000
($458,000 - 2003) was charged to such loans and credited to
revenue from other sources of the TASF during the year ended
31 December 2004. All project preparatory technical assistance
(PPTA) funded from TASF and OCR current income approved
on or after 1 January 2002 are no longer subject to cost recovery.

NOTE F—OTHER ASSETS AND MISCELLANEOUS
LIABILITIES

Included in other assets and miscellaneous liabilities as of
31 December 2004 is an amount receivable from Agency Trust
Funds of $28,000 ($20,000 - 2003), and amounts payable to
Ordinary Capital Resources of $51,000 ($15,000 - 2003) and
to Japan Special Fund of $1,000 (nil - 2003).

NOTE G—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount
at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable
estimate of fair value and thus unrealized loss was not incurred
as of 31 December 2004.

The carrying amounts of TASF’s assets, liabilities, and
uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair values
for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B and E for
discussions with respect to investments and undisbursed commitments, respectively.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Japan Special Fund (JSF) was established in March 1988
when Japan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) entered
into a financial arrangement whereby Japan agreed to make an
initial contribution and ADB became the administrator. The
purpose of JSF is to help developing member countries (DMCs)
of ADB restructure their economies and broaden the scope of
opportunities for new investments, thereby assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs of ADB. While JSF resources are used
mainly to finance technical assistance (TA) operations, these
resources may also be used for equity investment operations in
ADB’s DMCs. Under the agreement between ADB and Japan,
ADB may invest the proceeds of JSF pending disbursement.
In March 1999, the Board approved the acceptance and
administration by ADB of the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility
(ACCSF) to assist Asian currency crisis-affected member countries (CAMCs). Funded by Japan, ACCSF was established within
JSF to assist in the economic recovery of CAMCs through interest payment assistance (IPA) grants, TA grants, and guarantees.
With the general fulfillment of the purpose of the facility, Japan
and ADB agreed to terminate the ACCSF on 22 March 2002. An
amount of $90 million in the ACCSF account, upon request of
Japan, was transferred to the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction
(JFPR). JFPR, established by Japan in May 2000 supporting
innovative poverty reduction and related social development
activities, is one of the trust funds managed by ADB. The ACCSF
account is to be kept open until the completion of all TA disbursements and the settlement of all administrative expenses.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of JSF are presented on the basis of
unrestricted and temporarily restricted net assets. ACCSF funds
are separately reported in the financial statements.

JSF reports the contributions of cash and other assets as
restricted support if they are received with donor stipulations
that limit the use of the donated assets. When the donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time or purpose
restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets are
reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Assets as “NET ASSETS
RELEASED FROM RESTRICTIONS.”

Investments

All investment securities held by JSF are reported at estimated
fair value, which represents their fair market value. Realized
and unrealized gains and losses are included in revenue. Time
deposits are classified as “Held-to-Maturity” and are reported
at cost.

Contributions

Contributions by Japan are included in the financial statements
from the date indicated by Japan that funds are expected to
be made available. Contributions which are restricted by the
donor for specific TA projects/programs or for IPA grants are
classified as temporarily restricted contributions. Those without any stipulation as to specific use are accounted for and
reported as unrestricted contributions.

Technical Assistance

Technical assistance is recognized in the financial statements
when the related project is approved and becomes effective.
Upon completion of the TA project or cancellation of a grant,
any undisbursed amount is written back as a reduction in TA
for the year and the corresponding undisbursed commitment
is eliminated, accordingly.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The United States dollar is considered the functional currency
as it has become the currency of the primary economic operating environment of the Fund. The reporting currency is the
United States dollar. The financial statements are expressed in
thousands of current United States dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated to
the reporting currency at the applicable rates of exchange at
the end of a reporting period. Contributions included in the
financial statements during the year are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense amounts are translated for each
semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates in effect during the period. ExchangeASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—JAPAN SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

gains or losses on currency transactions arise on exchange
differences between the date a project/program is committed
and the timing of disbursements. Exchange gains or losses are
credited or charged to operations.

Equity Investments

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are
reported at fair value using quoted market prices.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year.
The actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the JSF considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS.”

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The main investment management objective is to maintain
security and liquidity. Subject to these parameters, ADB seeks
the highest possible return on its investments. Investments are
governed by the Investment Authority approved by the Board
of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted by its Investment Authority to invest in government and government-related debt
instruments and in time deposits. In the US dollar portfolio
only and up to limited amounts, investments may be made in
corporate bonds rated A or better, AAA-rated asset-backed
securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed securities.

The investment portfolios of both JSF and ACCSF as of
31 December 2004 and 2003 are comprised of United States
dollars holdings. Included in other securities as of 31 December 2004 were all corporate bonds.

The annualized rates of return on the average investments held under ACCSF and JSF funds during the year, based
on the portfolio held at the beginning and end of each month
were 1.35% and 1.47%, respectively (1.45% and 1.30%, respectively - 2003).

NOTE D—EQUITY INVESTMENTS

ADB used JSF resources to make an equity investment in India
in 1990. In 2004, JSF sold this equity investment and realized
a net gain of $900,000.

NOTE E—OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Included in other assets and liabilities are advances made for

TAs totaling $2,042,000 ($2,398,000 - 2003) and interfund
transfers as follows:

2003
Amounts Receivable by JSF from:
ACCSF $1,410,000
Technical Assistance
Special Fund Total $1,410,000
Amounts Payable by:
JSF to: Ordinary Capital
Resources $ 141,000
Agency Trust Funds 8,000
Total 149,000
ACCSF to: Japan Special Fund 1,410,000

Total $1,559,000

NOTE F—UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS

Undisbursed commitments are denominated in United States
dollars and represent TA projects/programs which have become
effective but not yet disbursed. During 2004, an amount of
$8,428,000 representing completed and partially canceled TA
projects ($7,891,000 - 2003) have been written back as a reduction in technical assistance for the year, and the corresponding undisbursed commitments have been eliminated. The
fair value of undisbursed commitments approximates the
amounts outstanding because ADB expects that disbursements
will substantially be made for all the projects/programs covered by the commitments.

NOTE G—CONTRIBUTIONS AND
UNCOMMITTED BALANCES

All contributions for the years ended 31 December 2004 and
2003 were received during the respective years.PART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

Effective 31 December 2002, all remaining temporarily
restricted net assets under JSF were transferred and integrated
into the unrestricted regular net assets, as concurred by Japan,
in order to optimize the use of JSF. Similarly, Japan lifted the
restriction over the use of net accumulated investment income,
which under the original terms of agreement between ADB and
Japan, may only be used for defraying JSF’s administrative
expenses. Japan agreed to use the net accumulated investment
income as additional resources for funding future ADB’s TA
operations.

In June 2004, the Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade
and Financial Security Initiative was established as a multi

The temporarily restricted uncommitted balance remaining available as of 31 December 2004 corresponds to funds
under ACCSF of $26,022,000 ($25,067,000 - 2003) to cover
completion of TA disbursements and the amount of net accumulated investment income of $2,865,000 ($2,402,000 - 2003)
for settlement of all administrative expenses.

Net assets released from restrictions relate to commitments for technical assistance satisfying the conditions specified by the donor and, in the case of accumulated investment
income, to defray the administrative expenses of the Fund.

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at

which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

countries for enhancing port security and combating money
laundering and terrorist financing. In July 2004, the Government of Japan agreed to transfer US$1,000,000 to the fund
from the investment income of JSF.

Uncommitted balances comprised of amounts which have
not been committed by ADB as at 31 December 2004. These
balances include TA projects/programs that had been approved

but not yet become effective.
As of 31 December 2004 and 2003 these balances are as
follows:

$25,067,000 $125,078,000 $150,145,000

 

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable
estimate of fair value and thus unrealized loss was not incurred
as of 31 December 2004.

If available, quoted market values are used to determine
fair values. Financial instruments for which market quotations are not readily available are valued using methodologies
and assumptions which necessarily require the use of subjective judgments. Accordingly, the actual value at which
such financial instruments could be exchanged in a current
transaction or whether they are actually exchangeable is not
determinable.

The carrying amounts of JSF’s assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are considered to approximate fair values
for all significant financial instruments. See Notes B, C, D, and
F for discussions relating to investments, equity investments,
and undisbursed commitments.ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

NOTE A—NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1996, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the establishment of the Asian Development Bank Institute (the Institute)
in Tokyo, Japan as a subsidiary body of ADB. The Institute commenced its operations upon the receipt of the first funds from
Japan on 24 March 1997, and it was inaugurated on 10 December
1997. The Institute's funds may consist of voluntary contributions, donations, and grants from ADB member countries, nongovernment organizations, and foundations. The objectives of the
Institute, as defined under its Statute, are the identification of
effective development strategies and capacity improvement for
sound development management in developing member countries. In 2004, a new trust fund, Japan Fund for Public Policy
Training (JFPPT) was set up under ADBI's administration.

NOTE B—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Presentation of the Financial Statements

The financial statements of the Institute are presented on the
basis of those for not-for-profit organizations.

The Institute reports donor's contributions of cash and
other assets as unrestricted support as these are made available
to the Institute without conditions other than for the purposes
of pursuing the objectives of the Institute.

Investments

All investment securities held by the Institute are reported at
estimated fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and
losses included in revenue. Estimated fair value generally represents market value. Time deposits are reported at cost.

Property, Furniture, and Equipment

Property, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straightline method.

Contributions

Contributions from donors are included in the financial statements from the date committed.

Securities Purchased Under Resale Arrangement

ADBI accounts for transfers of financial assets in accordance
with FAS 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities - a replacement of FAS 125.” In general, transfers are accounted for as

sale under FAS 140 when control over the transferred assets
has been relinquished. Otherwise, the transfers are accounted
for as repurchase/resale agreements and collateralized financing arrangements. Securities received under resale arrangements are not recorded on ADBI’s balance sheet.

Functional Currency and Reporting Currency

The functional currency of the Institute is the Japanese yen.
The reporting currency is the United States dollar and the financial
statements are expressed in thousands of current United States
dollars.

Translation of Currencies

Assets, liabilities, and uncommitted balances are translated from
the functional currency to the reporting currency at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Contributions included in the financial statements during the period
are translated at the applicable exchange rates as of the respective dates of commitment. Revenue and expense amounts in
currency other than the United States dollar are translated for
each semimonthly period at the applicable rates of exchange at
the beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates in effect during the period.

Accounting Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires Management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities as at the end of the year and
the reported amounts of income and expenses during the year.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Statement of Cash Flows

For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Institute
considers that its cash and cash equivalents are limited to “DUE
FROM BANKS”. Due from banks include bank accounts held on
behalf of the JFPPT (Note H).

NOTE C—INVESTMENTS

The investment portfolio was composed wholly of investments
denominated in Japanese yen. As of 31 December 2004 and
2003, the estimated fair value of the investments approximated
cost or amortized cost. All such investments are due within one
year.

The annualized rate of return on the average investments
held during the year including receivable for securities purchased under resale arrangement, based on the portfolio heldPART 3: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 

at the beginning and end of each month was 0.002% (0.003%
- 2003).

Investments are governed by the Investment Authority
approved by the Board of Directors in 1999. ADB is restricted
by its Investment Authority to invest in government and government-related debt instruments and in time deposits. Subject
to these parameters, ADB administers the Institute’s investment
and seeks the highest possible return on its investments.

As of 31 December 2004, ADBI did not hold any investments in an unrealized loss position.

NOTE D—FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at
which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction
between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of time deposits is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

The Institute’s statements of financial position carrying
amounts are considered to approximate fair values for all
significant financial instruments.

NOTE E— STAFF RETIREMENT PLAN AND
POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

Staff Retirement Plan

The Institute participates in the contributory defined benefit
Staff Retirement Plan (the Plan) of ADB. Every member of the
professional staff, as defined under the Plan, shall, as a condition
of service, become a participant from the first day of service,
provided that at such a date, the staff has not reached the
normal retirement age of 60. Retirement benefits are based on
length of service and highest average remuneration during two
years of eligible service. The Plan assets are segregated and are
not included in the statement of financial position. The costs
of administering the Plan are absorbed by ADB, except for fees
paid to the investment managers and related charges, including custodian fees, which are borne by the Plan.

CONTINUED

Participants are required to contribute 9 1/3% of their
salary to the Plan and may also make voluntary contributions.
The Institute’s contribution is determined at a rate sufficient
to cover that part of the costs of the Plan not covered by the
articipants’ contributions.

Expected Contributions

The expected amount of contributions to the Plan for 2005,
based on the Institute’s contribution rate for the coming year
of 16%, and the participants’ mandatory contribution are
151,000 and $88,000, respectively.

 

Investment Strategy

Contributions in excess of current benefits payments are invested
in international financial markets and in a variety of investment vehicles. The Plan employs six external asset managers
and one global custodian who function within the guidelines
established by the Plan’s Investment Committee. The investment of these assets, over the long term, is expected to produce higher returns than short-term investments. The investment
policy incorporates the Plan’s package of desired investment
returns, and tolerance for risk, taking into account the nature
and duration of the Plan’s liabilities. The Plan’s assets are
diversified among different markets and different asset classes.
The use of derivatives for speculation, leverage or taking risks
is prohibited. Selected derivatives are used for hedging and transactional efficiency purposes.

The Plan’s investment policy is periodically reviewed and
revised to reflect the best interest of the Plan’s participants and
beneficiaries. The current policy, adopted in January 2004,
specifies an asset-mix structure of 70% of assets in equities
and 30% in fixed income securities. At present, investments of
the Plan’s assets are divided into three categories: US equity,
Non-US equity, and US fixed income.

As of 31 December 2004 and 2003, the breakdown of
the fair value of plan assets held is as follows:

2003
Amount Percentage
$ 602,000
237,000

$1,206,000ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ANNUAL REPORT 2004

 

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK—ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK INSTITUTE SPECIAL FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
31 December 2004 and 2003

All investments, excluding time deposits, are valued using
quoted market prices. Time deposits are reported at cost. Fixed
income securities include US government and governmentguaranteed obligations, corporate bonds and time deposits. Other
assets include forward exchange contracts in various foreign
currencies transacted to hedge currency exposure in the investment portfolio, which have been marked to fair value.

For the year ended 31 December 2004 the net return on
the Plan assets was 11.1% (27.7% - 2003). ADB expects the
long-term rate of return on the assets to be 8%.

Assumptions

The assumed overall rate of return takes into account long-term
return expectations of the underlying asset classes within the
investment portfolio mix, and the expected duration of the Plan's
liabilities. Return expectations are forward looking and, in general,
not much weight is given to short-term experience. Unless there

is a drastic change in investment policy or market environment,
the assumed investment return of 8% on the Plan's assets is
expected to remain broadly the same, year to year.

Postretirement Medical Benefits Plan

The Institute participates in the cost-sharing plan of ADB for
retirees’ medical insurance premiums of ADB. Under the plan,
the Institute is obligated to pay 75% of the Group Medical
Insurance Plan premiums for retirees and their eligible dependents who elect to participate. The cost-sharing plan is currently unfunded.

Generally accepted accounting principles require an
actuarially determined assessment of the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits.

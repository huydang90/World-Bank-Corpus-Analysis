per cent from 88 per cent in 1988. Co-financing from
commercial sources nearly tripled to $278 million. In the
private sector, co-financing amounting to $62 million was
provided under the Bank's Complementary Financing
Scheme.

On a sectoral basis, lending for social infrastructure
rose to $757 million from $445 million in 1988 and its share
of total lending Increased to 21 per cent from 14 per cent
in 1988. The increase in volume was due to the greater
emphasis placed by DMCs on urban infrastructure and

poverty alleviation issues.

Loans to agriculture and agro industry rose to $846
million from $674 million and the sector’s share of total

Gujarat, India, Tt raject is one of many private sector enter;
through a $100 million Bank fi at IndustriatOR the world economy, 1989 was a relatively good year,
:fowever, after two years of very rapid growth in 1987 and
“1988, there were signs that economic expansion in the
industrialized countries was moderating to more sustainable
“evels. The general tightening of monetary conditions, begun
‘jn 1988, largely succeeded in reducing the risk of a sigicant acceleration of inflation. The prospects for the
urrent expansion continuing for the next few years have
ighiened.

‘Economic growth in the developing world was also
lower, and the average growth rate for the Bank’s develop“ing: “member countries (DMCs) fell sharply from the record
level of the previous year. Still, the DMCs continued to do
much better than the rest of the developing world and the
“GDP growth rate for.developing Asia was almost twice that
_of other regions.

‘The decline in the DMCs’ growth rate was in part the
result of macroeconomic policies adopted to slow down
overheated economies and reduce ihe inflationary pressures
that had been building up. Despite this, the average inflation
rate Continued to increase, Most ol the DMCs also continued
. to follow economic policies of financial and. trade liberaliza
tiori, industrial derequiation and expansion in the role of the
 sprivate sector, thus laying the basis for continued strong

_ economic performance in the nineties.

 

_The International Setting

“In 1989, world output increased by 3.1 per cent com' .paredto 4 per cent in 1988. Expansion in the volume of
world trade, although slower than the extraordinarily rapid
increase of 9 per cent in 1988, continued at a healthy rate
of over 6.9 per cent, The buoyancy of international trade
results in part from the strenath of global investment, which
generally has a higher import content than other components of demand, and from the emergence of capacity
constraints in some countries. import growth remained
strong in Japan while United States and Federal Republic of
Germany led the expansion in exports.

International economic cooperation has been
strengthened progressively over a wide range of issues and

policy areas in the second half of the 1980s. In turn,
intensified policy coordination among the major industrialized countries on macroeconomic issues has helped sustain
the current expansion for such a long period. However, it
has been less successful in significantly reducing the large
internal and external imbalances that have existed since the
mid- 1980s.

Despite some progress in recent years, external debt
remains a major problem for many developing countries.
The problem of excessive commercial debt is primarily
located in Latin America, where reschedulings have been
necessary on a regular basis in recent years. In Asia, only
the Philippines has needed lo reschedule its commercial debt
since the general onslaught of the debt crisis in 1982.

American and a few Asian countries has also occurred during
the same period. Despite several initiatives, including debtfor-equity swaps and the aforementioned reschedulings,
progress in debt reduction has been modest except in a few
cases, such as Chile, where the Government has been able
to undertake major restructurings. In a further effort to
achieve progress, the United States, in May 1989, proposed
to strengthen the debt strategy by providing financial support
for debtor countries’ efforts te reform their economies and
achieve lasting growth. These proposals, which for the first
time involved official funds, including assistance frorn the
Iriternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank, increased
the emphasis on debt and debi-service reduction as a complement to new lending by cormmercial banks and stressed
investment and flight capital repatriation as important sources of capital, The Philippines was the second case following
Mexico of a completed deal to reduce outstanding debt
through an officially-sanctioned program.

In spite of rapid growth in the volume of world trade,
protectionist pressures lave remained strong inthe industrialized countries. Itis, therefore, encouraging that some
positive results were achieved at the Mid-Term Review of
the Uruguay Round, which was begun in Montreal in
December 1988 and completed in Geneva in April 1989.
These included agreements on procedural issues in all
negotiating groups and cornprehensive guidelines for the
negotiation of a framework regarding the progressive
liberalization of trade in services. The Review also requires

agriculture sector. The long-term objective is to provide for
substantial and progressive reductions in agricultural support
and protection over an agreed periad of time.

Economic Situation in Industrialized Countries

The current expansion in the industrialized countries
that began late in 1982 is now one of the longest on record.
In 1989, however, there was some rmoderation in the pace
of expansion with the aggregale GNP growth rate slowing
to 3.5 per cent frorn 4.4 per cent in 1988. in the United
States, the slowdown was the most pronounced as GNP
growth fell io 2.9 per cent from 4.4 per cent in 1988. This
resulted from a significant deceleration in expansion of
domestic dernand following the tightening of monetary
conditions since the beginning of 1988, In Japan, growth
remained strong with only slight moderation to 4.9 per cent
from 5.7 per cent in 1988. Expansion in domestic demand
remained the driving force as the contribution of the external
sector continued to be negative. In the European Com
munity, growth slowed to 3.4 per cent from 3.7 per cent in
1988 as a result of a weakening of consumption, while
business investment remained strony. However, in the
Federat Republic of Germany, GNP growth accelerated to
4 per cent from 3.6 per cent in 1988 despite a significant
slowdown in the expansion of domestic demand. ‘This was
the result of rapid growth in net exports and was responsible
for a substantial increase in the Federal Republic of. .Germany’s current account surplus in 1989.
“Growth in business investment, which has been an
important feature of the recent growth performance of most
industrialized countries, slowed down significantly in the
nited States but remained strong in most of the other
: countries, particularly dapat and Federal Republic of Germany, The long period of sustained growth during the 1980s
has raised resource utilization to very high levels. In the
manufacturing sector, rates of capacity utilization in all major
_. countries have risen to their highest levels since the previous
cyclical peak in 1979-1980. Labor market conditions also
-have tightened raarkedly and unemployment rales in United
States and Japan are relatively low. Unemployment has
“clearly begun to fall in the Federal Republic of Germany, but
« there has been relatively little progress in the rest of condimental Europe.

Consumer prices in all major industrialized countries
picked up sharply in late 1988, but the firm anti-inflationary
stance of monetary policy in most countries prevented
inflation from getting out of hand. Consequently, there was

“ a‘relatively moderate increase in the inflation rate to 4.5
“per cent from 3.3 per cent in 1988. Short-term interest
“rates, which started to move up in mid-1988, were on the
verage more than a percentage point higher in 1989. In
the United States, interest rates had begun to decline in June
1989 as the Federal Reserve atiempted to stimulate the
sluggish economy, but in most of Europe and Japan interest
. gates continued to rise throughout 1989,

__. The combined current account deficit of the industrialized ‘countries increased to $77.6 billion trom $54.4 billion
in 1988. This was primarily because of higher deficits in
- Canada, Spain and United Kingdom, and a smaller surplus
“in, Japan.

a It is expected that the current expansion will be sustained at an acceptable pace through 1990 and phesibly
- beyond. At the same time, inflationary pressures should
diminish gradually. However, the prospect of sizeable and
persistent current account imbalances among the three
“fargest industrialized countries continues to cause concern
-“jn the medium-term.

 

 

  
  

 

. Economic Situation in Developing Countries

Output growth in the developing countries taken as a
_ -group.slowed to 3.2 per cent from 4.2 per cent in 1988.
“This was the result of two factors. First, increasing inflationary pressures in 1988 led to a tightening of financial policies
and the adoption of other macroeconomic policies aimed at
- restricting domestic demand in a number of countries.
Second, external conditions have deteriorated somewhat as
‘aresull of the rise in world inerest rates, the weakening of
' nNon-fue] commodity prices ard the slower, albeit still rapid,
'* growth of export markets.
; “ “Tor many developing countries in the Western | lemi- Sphere, because of their heavy debit exposure, the recent
changes in the extemal environment, especially rising interest rates, have been particularly unfavorable. As a result,
their real GDP was approximately unchanged in 1989,

which implies a further decline in per capita incomes in the
region. On average, output growth in sub-Saharan Africa
improved modestly in 1989. However, this rise in output
wil barely match the increase in population, implying little,
if any, recovery in per capita output. In the Middle East, on
the average, real GDP grew at about the same rate as in
1988, while output expanded by only 1.9 per cent in
European developing countries.

The total outstanding external debt of the developing
world declined modestly to $1,194 billion i 1989. The
lower level of external debt, and the continued growth of
exports from developing countries, sustained the decline in
the aggregate ratio of debt to exports that had commenced
in 1987, This ratio declined to 126 per cent from 140 per
cem in 1988, The debt-service ratio was also lower at 17
per cent compared to 19.9 per cent in 1988.

Overview of Developing Member Countries

There was some deceleration in the growth perfor
mance of DMCs in 1989 and their aggregate GDP increased
by 5.3 per cent compared to the record 9.4 per cent in
1988. The People’s Republic of China and India, which had
enjoyed exceptionally high growth rates in 1988, registered
significantly lower economic growth in 1989 and this partially accounts for the lower average growth in the DMCs.
Domestic policies aimed at controlling the overheating of

the economies in many DMCs also contributed to slower
growth In the region.

Rapid economic growth for two or three successive
years in the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) and the
Southeast Asian countries has led to increasing slrain on
infrastructure, crealed shortages of labor and led to a gradual
rise in wages and inflation. Arnong the NIEs, in Hong Kong,
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, infrastructure bottlenecks are severe. In the Southeast Asian countries, while
Thailand has the most strained infrastructure, other
countries are also facing constraints. The Philippines is
facing major electricity and transportation shortages, while
constraints in the areas of port capacity, transport and
communications are appearing in Malaysia and Indonesia.

Although domestic demand is becaming an increasingly
important component of growth, exports remain a major
determinant af growth in many DMCs, Consequently, softening of commodity prices and reduced demand for
manufactured goods in the industrialized countries also contributed to the less robust growth of the DMCs, Import
demand for DMCs’ exports registered Jower growth in 1989
because of a signilicant slowdown in the expansion of
domestic dernand in the United States and continuing
protectionist pressures in the industrialized countries. However, in contrast to their earlier sensitivity to developments
in the Western economies, the DMCs are drawing more
economic strength from within the Asian and Pacific region.
First, domestic demand is generating a larger share ofeconomic growth in most of the DMCs. Second, the impor
tance of Japan and the NIFs as providers of capital investment and importers of regional products, is increasing.
Intra-regional trade and investments in the Asian and Pacific
region have grown rapidly during the past two or three years,
making this region the fastest growing trading area in the
world.

At the sectoral level, most DMCs maintained fairly high
rates of agricultural growth, the important exception being
Bangladesh which was affected by natural calamities. In
. many DMCs, the manufacturing sector continued to be
’ vibrant, spurred primarily by industrial deregulation policies
~ and inflows ol foreign direct investment. However, civil strife

and political disputes had an adverse impact particularly on

the industrial growth of several South Asian countries and
ithe People’s Republic of China.

Despile the slowdown in growth, DMCs continued to

". be the fastest growing sub-region in the global economy.

é

ENGINEERS at work at the Republic of Korea’s Southern
Seoul District Heating Project which was supported by a
Bank loan of $32 million.

 

Thailand's economy led the region, and possibly the world,
with a second straight year of double-digit growth. Indonesia,
which had experienced relatively slow growth since 1982,
entered the ranks of the fast growing countries in 1989,
primarily due to successiul policy reforms and inflows of
foreign investment.

The average inflation rate of the DMCs, which reached
a double-digit figure in 1988, increased further in 1989 to
31 per cent. People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and
most of the South Asian countries registered double-digit
inflation in 1989 due to a combination of cost-push and
demand-pull pressures. Curbing inflation and inflationary
expectations remains a major policy objective in these DMCs
as well as ofhers which have seen their export competitive
ness gradually erode because of risiny inflation and increas
ing wages.

The growth of aggregate exports of the DMCs dropped
to 12.9 per cent from 23.3 per cen! in 1988. Export growth
slowed significantly in almost ail countries except India,
Indonesia; Malaysia, Taipei,China and Viet Nam. Import
growth also declined, ‘but not by as much as exports. Asa
result, in ail countries, except ! long Kong and Taipei,China,
either the current account surplus declined or the deficit
widened. ‘The external debt situation of the DMCs, however,
continued to remain relatively comfortable in 1989.

The following paragraphs discuss economic developments in five country groups: newly industrializing
economies, Southeast Asian countries, South Asian
countries, People’s Republic of China and South Pacific
DMCs.

Newly Industrializing Economies

Growth Siackening But is Siill Robust

In 1989, economic growth in most of the newly industrializing economies (NIEs) decelerated significantly, and
their aggregate GDP growth rate declined to 6.2 per cent
from 9.4 per cent in 1988. Individual economic performance, however, diverged widely. While growth in
Hong Keng and Republic of Korea was only about half that
of 1988 — 2.5 per cent and 5.9 per cent, respectively —
Singapore registered 9.2 per cent growth in GDP — only a
marginal deceleration — and Taipei,China grew at a rate of
7.7 per cent which was slightly higher than in 1988.

The slowdown in Hong Kong can be attributed tv a
significamt deceleration in export growth and a soflening in
the domestic dernand; the laiter was largely a result of a joss
in business confidence following the economic and political
disruptions in the People’s Republic of China. On the other
hand, the decline in the GDP growth rate of the Republic of
Korea resulted from a virtual stagnation in exports and
disnaptions in industrial production because of labor unrest.

in 1989, with the exception of Jong Kong, the main
source of growth in the NiEs was domestic demand. In
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, some deceleration in
invesiment activity was more than offset by an16

unprecedented consumer boom which resulted from large
wage increases accorded since 1987. In Singapore, while
consumer spending remained high, investment demand,
mainly in the construction and services sectors, strengthened
considerably in 1989.

Strong domestic dernand pushed up inflation In the
NIEs to an average of 5.8 per cent, 1 per cent higher than
in 1988, Inflation showed little sign of abating in Hong Kong
as prices for food imported from the People's Republic of
China continued to rise, In Talpei,China, inflation more than
tripled while in Singapore it almost doubled. However,
inflation rates remain relatively low in both countries. In the
Republic of Korea, inflation declined as a result of strict
anti-inflationary policies followed during most of the year.

Export Growth Slows

The NIEs experienced a significant deceleration in their
export growth in 1989, The slowdown was particularly
marked for the Republic of Korea as its exports in. dollar
terms expanded at a meager rate of 2.4 per cent, sharply
down from 29 per cent growth in 1988, Large wage
increases in manufacturing following similar increases in
1987 and 1988, production disruptions due to strikes, and
the continued appreciation of the Korean won in real terms
{by 28 per cent since 1987) combined with a slowdown in
world demand to cause a sharp reduction in Korean exports.

In spite of falling external demand, in particular for
electronics goods, and a continued appreciation of the New
Taiwan (N.T.) dollar — by 12 per cent in real terms in 1989
— the exports of Taipei,China maintained a more satisfactory record, growing at a rate of 12.3 per cent compared
with 13.2 per cent in 1988, However, there was a sharp
deceleration in export growth in Hong Kong — to
18 per cent from 30.4 per cent in 1988 — and Singapore
— to 13.7 per cent from 39.3 per cent in 1988. This
deceleration resulted from a slackening of dernand in most of
their major overseas markets and an appreciation of their
currencies in real terms.

Responding to slower economic growth, merchandise
imports of the NIEs increased by 15.3 per cent in 1989,
substantially below the exceptional growth of 32.6 per cent
in 1988. In Republic of Korea and Taipel,China, the
decrease in the rate of growth of imports occurred in spite
ol strong domestic demand and continued liberalization of
trade, The Republic of Korea’s current account surplus felt
sharply to $4.8 billion, about one third its value in 1988. By
contrast, the current account surplus of Taipei,China increased by about 31 per cent to $13.3 billion. The current
account surplus of Hong Kong also increased significantly,
Both Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, particularly the
jatter, continued to step up their foreign investments in
1989, mainly in Southeast Asian countries, The Republic of
Korea has accelerated its external debt repayments as well
so that, by the early 1990s, it is expected to become a net
creditor country. Net capttal inflows to Singapore continued
to rise as foreign investments increased rapidly. Foreign
excharige reserves in all NIEs increased in 1989.

“"" peavily:on the massive sale of Monetary Stabilization Bonds.
“Jn the closing months of 1989, however, there was a
significant monetary policy reversal, as the dramatic fall in
the. current account surplus, stagnating exports and the
failure to revive investment raised the fear of a recession. To
encourage investments for restructuring the export industry
and to increase productivity to offset rapidly rising wage
Me “costs, monetary policy was substantially relaxed. The dis
-. count rate. was lowered by 1 per cent and low inierest loans
‘amouniing to $1.5 billion were offered,

° Inall the NIEs, governments have kept a conservative
‘fiscal stance and, as a result, have been able to run sizeable
budget surpluses which partly offset the liquidity inflow from
’ the foreign sector. In 1989, the Republic of Korea started a
major tax reform which eventually will lead to a complete
*-overhaul of its taxation system by 1991. Income and cor
” porate taxes were revised and excise taxes and tariffs were
: rationalized. Measures to curb land and stock market
speculation were also implemented in Taipei,China.
Generally, there was a perceptible shift in budgetary and
fiscal policies as social objectives, including the improvement
_» of welfare and the distribution of income, were given higher
* priority.

: Both Republic of Korea and Taipel,China took a wide

_array of measures to reduce current account surpluses and
. offset them by increased capital outflows. While the Korean
won and N.T. dollar were allowed to appreciate further,
import restrictions and tariffs were reduced substantially,
The Republic of Korea reduced its average tariff rate frorm
18 per cent to less than 13 per cent. Taipei,China lowered
lariffs by 20 to 50 per cent on over 4,700 products in 1989,
Overseas travel was liberalized, as were overseas rernittances,

In response to dwindling competitiveness resulting from
curyency appreciation and rapidly rising labor costs, capital
outflows were eased considerably, mainly in the form of
direct foreign investments, and encouraged through tax
incentives, pasticularly in Republic of Korea and Singapore.
Taipei,China has become the second most important
foreign investor ir, Southeast Asia, with direct investment
amounting to about $6 billian in 1989, compared with $3.2
billion in 1988, The Republic of Korea also stepped up the
relocation of labor-intensive industries, such as garments and
footwear, to lower-cost countries in Southeast Asia. Hong
Kong, which had directed its foreign investment mainly to

the People's Republic of China, has increasingly turned to
Southeast Asia for investinent opportunities as a result of
the uncerlainty presently looming over economic reforms in
the People’s Republic of China.

At the same time, to accelerate the restructuring of their
industries and attract investments in high technology, the
NILs have raised Incentives for foreign investors. The
Republic of Korea has raised the automatic approval limit of
a capital investment to $100 million from $3 million previously. Singapore has continued fo improve tax incentives
with regard to high technology industries. In Republic of
Korea and Taipei,China, the deregulation of the domestic
financial market has been pursued further and there has
been progress in the liberalization of ihe capital account.
Foreign securities firms have been allowed to participate
more in the markets of Republic of Korea and Taipei,China
and the size of the Korea Fund has been increased, In both
Republic of Korea and Taipei,China, international convertible bond issues by the private sector have been encouraged.
In Taipei,China, ihe foreign exchange market has been
deregulated further while the Republic of Korea announced
it would overhaul its foreign exchange-rate system,

Southeast Asian Countries

Sustained Growth

The economies of Southeast Asia experienced sus:
tained growth in 1989 with aggregate GDP expanding by
7.7 per cent — only marginally below the rate in 1988, Such
an achievernent is remarkable as it occurred while the
expansion ol world trade slowed and growth in industrialized
countries decelerated.

The growth rate of Thailand — 10.8 per cent — was
particularly impressive as it represented double-digit expansion for the second consecutive year, While firm agricultural
prices, particularly for rice, maize and sugar, and successful
crop diversification helped to achieve a 4 per cent growth
in the agriculture sector, industry continued to expand at a
brisk 15 per cent, The construction sector erew by 18
per cent, about’4 per cent higher than in 1988, as private
construction expanded unabated and work on major public
infrastructure projects was started, Rapid growth, however,
further strained an already inadequate physical infrastructure
and shortages of skilled, technical and managerial manpower emerged, putting upward pressure on cerfain
categories of wages.

In Malaysia, growlh was about 1 per cent less than in
1988 but was still strong al 7.6 per cent, Manufacturing
remnuined the most dynarnic sector, expanding at a rate of
13 per cent, while the construction sector continued its rapid
recovery as dernand for housing strengthened and major
public sector projects were undertaken. The mining and
services sectors expanded at about the same rate as in 1988,
but agricultural growth decelerated to 3.1 per cert as output
of rubber and sawnlogs contracted while that of cocoa and
palm oil expanded at a slower rale.

The economic recovery of the Philippines slowed somewhat in 1989 and GDP growth declined to 6 per cent from
6.2 per cent in 1988. The agriculture sector expanded
somewhat faster than in the previous year, with rice, sugar,
coconut and fisheries production increasing strongly.
Growth in the manufacturing sector decelerated to about
7 ner cent as both domestic demand, mainly consumption,
and extemal demand weakened. Reflecting strong investment activity, particularly in the private sector, the growth
of the construction sector accelerated.

Indonesia, expanding by 6.5 per cent, was one of the
few countries in Asia to experience an improvement in
economic growth in 1989. The oil and gas sectors recovered
as output and prices increased and agricultural growth was
sustained with rice output at a record level. The manufacturing sector, responding to rapid non-oil export growth,
expanded by about 12 per cent. The services sector also
gained momentum, mainly as a result of deregulation and
reforms aimed al increasing efficiency. :

In Lao PDR, GDP growth increased to 4 per cent from
2.1 per cenl in 1988. The improvement was largely the
result of favorable weather which helped to raise the
agricultural sector growth rate to 3.5 per cent from minus
1 per cent in 1988. Industry sector performance also improved while strong growth was maintained in construction
and commerce, ~

In 1989, Viet Nam’s GDP growth decelerated to an
estimated 3.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent in 1988. The
slowdown was due largely to the poor performance of stale
industrial enterprises which had difficulties in adjusting to the
newly-intraduced ‘self-financing’ syslern. Agriculture, on the
other hand, grew by 5.6 per cent, reflecting a brisk
10 per cent increase in foodgrain production.

Generally, strong dernand pressures accelerated inflalion in Southeast Asia, the average rate rising ta 6.1 per cent
from 5.1 per cent in 1988. Strong demand and resulting
rapid economic growth since 1988 have continued to strain
resources in several sectors of the Thai economy. In addi
tion, agricultural prices, particularly for food, have been
rising and inflation, estimated at 5.6 per cent for 1989, has
become a matter of concern. In Malaysia, higher lood prices
and increases in import costs due to the lagged effect of some
depreciation of the ringgit, fueled inflation to about 3
per cent. In Indonesia, upward price pressures have followed
the extension, in January 1989, of vahie-added tax to most
services, sore indirect tax increases and strong investment
demand. The Consumer Price Index rose by about 6 per
cenl in 1989,

Inflation has become a serious problem in the Philippines as well where it has reached 9.6 per cent. Fast growth
in liquidity, substantial increases in minimum wages outpacing productivity growth, a gradual depreciation of the
peso as well as a general rise in food prices are considered
the main factors. In Lao PDR, inflation increased further to
40 per cent from 33 per cent in 1988 due to a substantial
depreciation of the currency and a large increase in the
money supply. A conspicuous exception to this trend was
Viet Nam, where the 800 to 500-per cent inflation whichpo eeiteer2er, aM ea eT

Exports Remain Buoyant

Export growth tn the Southeast Asian countries
remained buoyant in 1989, On aggregate, the growth rate
of merchandise exports moderated slightly fo 19.3 per cent
from 20.7 per cent in 1988 Inclividually, Thailand’s performance was remarkable as, for the fourth consecutive year,
its exports expanded at an annual rate of well over 25
per cent - 28.4 per cent to be exact. Extermal demand
retained strong and export-oriented foreign investments
implemented in 1987 and 1988 considerably expanded the
exporl base.

Exports from Malaysia grew at a rate of 21.4 per cent,
faster than in 1988, While oil exports performed better and
agricultural exports declined as a result of a softening of
prices for agricultural raw materials, exports of manufactured goods grew by 35.5 per cent and continued to
strengthen. The erosion cf export competitiveness in the
NIEs and the provision of generous foreign investment

incentives partly explain the strong performance of
Malaysian manufactured exports. While the export growth
in the Philippines, because of capacity constraints and real
exchange rate appreciation, slowed to 11.7 per cent —about
half the 1988 rate — the pace accelerated to 12.9 per cent
in Indonesia. As prices improved, earnings from oil and gas
exports increased more rapidly and exports of manufactured
goods, led by textiles and plywood, continued their upward
trend. In Viet Nam, exports grew by 30 per cent in 1989,
reflecting the 1.4 million tons of rice exporis which made
Viet Nam the third largest exporter of rice in the world.

In Thailand, import growth, which had been almost 50
per cenl in 1988, decelerated to 41 per cent in 1989
However, in all other Southeast Asian countries, import
growth increased markedly in 1989. Responding to strong
consumption and investment demand, the imports of
Malaysia grew particularly fast at a rate of 37.2 per cent,
compared with 28.3 per cent in 1988. In the Philippines,
import liberalization, implemented as part of the structural
adjustment program, firm investment demand and real
exchange rate appreciation led to a rapid increase in imports. The trade account thus deteriorated sharply, the

    

1‘20

current account deficit nearly quadrupled to $1.4 billion and
the foreign exchange reserves declined significantly.

The sharp acceleration in imports reduced Malaysia‘s
trade surplus by more than 20 per cent and slashed the
current account surplus to $100 million from $1.8 billion in
1988. In both Indonesia and Thailand, current account
deticits widened slightly in 1989, amounting respectively to
2.4 and 3.2 per cent of GDP. in Thailand, continued rapid
growth in tourism receipts contained the current account
deficit in spite of a large trade deficit. For Indonesia, the large
deficit an the invisible balance, which more than offset the
trade surplus, increased marginally in 1989 as interest
payments on foreign debt stabilized. The external debt
situation of Malaysia and Thailand remained very camfortable. Although it increased only marginally in 1989, the
external debt of Indonesia is very high, as is the case of the
Philippines, In 1989, Indonesia experienced a decline in its
debt-service ratio although it still remained ‘thigh at an estimated 36 per cent of exports of goods and services.

Domestic Policies

Fiscal policy has generally remained cautious in
Southeast Asian countries. In Indonesia and Thailand,
budgets continued to be conservative. For fiscal year 1989,
Thailand posted a sizeable budget surplus primarily because

tax revenues increased rapidly despite an income fax-cutin 
danuary 1989, Expenditures also rose rnore slowly as the
implementation of large public investment programs -fell
behind schedule. The Indonesian budgetary position improved in 1989 as a result of increased oil revenues and
measures taken at the end of 1988 to broaden the tax base
and raise tax rates. Although there was a 15 per cent
increase in civil service salaries and debt service payments
continued fo rise, current expenditures were contained
partly through the reduction of public subsidies, This allowed
for the expansion of development expenditures to meet the
infrastructure requirements of the faster growing economy.

Malaysia maintained a cautious fiscal stance. As
revenues, particularly tax and oil revenues, increased rapidly
and the Government maintained strict control on the growth
of current expenditure, the government savings performance improved sharply. However, as‘the pace of implementation of large infrastructure projects was
accelerated, the overall deficit of the public sector widened
significantly to about 6 per cent [rom 3.9 per cent of GNP
in 1988. In the Philippines, although revenue collection was
above target in 1989, the budgel came under severe pressure, mainly because of a rapid increase in capital expendi
tures and the burden of debt service payments on current
expendilures. The deterioration in the budget deficit required a siguificant amount of domestic borrowing which put
upward pressure on interest rates and had a crowding-out
effect on the private secior,

In Lao PDR, an increase in the fiscal deficit and a rising
inflation rate remained the major concerns of the Government, In August, major tax reforms were introduced to
increase. revenues, simplify the tax system and eliminate

distortions, The changes included the replacement of a
variable profit tax and other special taxes with a flat tax on
profits, the introduction of a broad-based business turnover
tax and an extension of the resource tax to cover all minerals,
forest products and livestock. During 1989, Viet Nam accelerated the implementation of market-oriented policy
reforms in a wide range of areas. ‘These reforms have had
a significant beneficial effect on the economy in the form of
a dramatically lower inflation rate, increased private sector
financial savings and higher foodgrain production.
Monetary policies were generally accommodating in
the Southeast Asian countries as substantial capital inflows
occurred and were only partially neutralized. However, as
inflationary pressures increased, there was a tightening of
monetary policies in most couniries. In Malaysia, there was
an overhang of liquidity from the large current account
surplus of 1988, which was further exacerbated in 1989 by
large capital inflows related to foreign investments. To
neutralize some of the excess: liquidity, ihe Central Bank
raised the reserve requirements of commercial banks in May
1989. This was followed by a general though marginal
upward trend in interest rates. Similarly, in the Philippines,
a sharp growth in domestic liquidity, which added to infla
‘tionary pressure, was curbed by a tightening of monetary
~ policy through open market operations and an increase in
. Teserve requirements on long-term deposits. Interest rates

increased, affecting investment activity adversely. In
Thailand, however, authorities have allowed liquidity to
expand rapidly by not sterilizing large capital inflows and
have been-reluctant to raise: interest rates.

Indonesia also has relaxed its tight monetary stance by
lowering reserve requirements and the discount rate, and by
lifting some of the restrictions on foreign borrowing by
commercial banks, The Indonesian economy benefited from
a major package ol financial sector and capiial market
reforms introduced at the end of 1988 and broadened in
1989, Since the introduction of the reforms, the pace of
activity in the capital market has increased rapidly. Several
joint venture banks have been established, foreign banks
have opened offices outside Jakarta and the private domestic
banking sector has expanded considerably.

Other Southeast Asian countries have also introduced
financial reforms to increase the inobilization of financial
resources and raise investment incentives. In Thailand, for
instance, the interest rate ceiling on time deposits exceeding
one year has been lifted while the withholding tax on such
deposits has largely been eliminated, Income iax on interest
paid for long-term foreign loans has also been abolished,
Malaysia introduced the Banking and Financial Institution
Act 1989 which streamlined laws on banking and finance
and simplified existing regulations. In addition, financial
reforms, including the establishment of a secondary market
for government securities and the development of a cor
porate bond market, were implemented to broaden and
deepen lhe capital market and irnprove its efficiency. In the
Philippines, financial liberalization has been emiphasized
under the updated medium-term development plan.

in 1989, all countries continued to pursue tax and tariffreforms aimed at deregulating their economies, enhancing
. the role of the private sector, reducing tariff protection and
increasing competitiveness, Indonesia and Philippines, in
particular, intensified efforts in these directions, Both
countries also undertook reforms to revitalize the important
agriculture sector,
Economic cooperation within ASEAN was stepped up
in 1989 and is directed at maintaining the impetus provided
' bythe Third Meeting of ASEAN Heads of Government held
in Manila in 1987. While a revision of import and export
“procedures was underway to facilitate the expansion of the
ASEAN Preferential Trading Arrangement (PTA), progress
was made with respect fo the ASEAN Reinsurance Corpora
tion, which was established at the end of 1988. Cooperation
in several other industrial areas was expanded through

South Asian Countries

A Difficult Year

Growth of GDP slowed down in most South Asian
countries as their governments attempted to dampen
domestic demand to bring growing budgetary deficits and
inflation under control. In some countnes, this was compounded by natural disasters, internal disturbances and
political disputes. In India, after a record GDP growth of 9.5
per cent in 1988, the rate declined to 4.5 per cent in 1989.
This was somewhat lower than the rate of recent years partly
because agricultural production settled back to its long-term
growth trend of about 2 per cent, after the very large
increase in 1988, which hacl reflected the rebound from the
severe drought in 1987. Another factor was a deceleration
fn industrial growth to about 6 per cent, caused partly by a
shortage of foreign exchange which constrained the imporfation of industrial inputs. In Pakistan, the GDP growth rate
declined to 5.6 per cenl from 7 per cent in 1988, despite
the agriculture sector recovering and growing by 6.1 per
cent. The manufacturing and construction sectors declined
significantly, being most directly affecied by civil disturbances, energy shortages and the Governrnent’s efforts at
controlling domestic demand,

The remaining South Asian countries experienced stagnation or decline in per capita mcomes in 1989. The
Bangladesh economy was once again disrupted by floods,
cyclones and a severe drought and the 2.4 per cent GDP
growth was about the same as in 1988. In Sri Lanka, civil
strife, floods and drought further reduced the already low
‘GDP growth rate io 2 per cent from 2.8 per cent in 1988,
In Nepal, because of the disruption in trade and transit
velations with India, following the lapse of the bilateral
treaties in March 1989, non-agricultural production was
Severely affected. As a result, despite a healthy 6.8 per cent
increase in agricultural production in 1989, GDP growth

declined to 1.5 per cent from %.7 per cent in 1988. In
Myarimnar, because of political problems, raw material ancl
capital shortages and high rates of inflation, the economy
reraained under pressure. However, the GDP growth rate
improved (ov 3.4 per cent from 0.2 per cent in 1988

In most Soutti Asian countries efforts to reduce inflationary pressures at best succeeded in stabilizing the rate of
inflation in 1989. However, in Pakistan the inflation rate
increased to 10.4 per cent from 8.8 per cent in 1988,
although the budget deficit was reduced te 7 per centof GDP
from 8.6 per cent in 1988. In India, also, there was an
acceleration in inflation, reflecting both slower output
growth and faster monetary expansion. The inflation rate in
all South Asian countries remains high: ~- generally between

POWER drilling in Nepal under the Vocational Educa
tion Project which is assisted by a Bank concessional loan
of $4.2 million.

8 and 12 per cent — and in one case, Myarumar, it is in
excess of 50 per cent. Efforts to reduce budgetary deficits
and maintain tight money policies will have to be continued
for the next few years if these rates are to be brought down
to more acceptable levels.

Widening External Deficits

In all South: Asian countries, the deficit on current
account tended te widen, although export performance
differed significantly from country to country. India maintained its healthy export growth rate of about 15.1 per cent
for the third year but, because of recemt import liberalization
policies, imports increased by 12.3 per cent resulting in a
deterioration in the trade balance. To cover the imbalance,
India was forced to run down its foreign exchange reserves.
There was a sharp slowdown in export growth in
Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan. Both Bangladesh and
Pakistan, besides the supply side factor discussed above,
were affected by the decline in international prices of major
exports, and even a substantial decline in the growth rate ol
imports was not sufficient to prevent a worsening of the
balance on their current accounts. In Nepal, the lapse of
trade and transit treaties with India was the primary factor.
In Sri Lanka, exports stagnated compared to a 5.7 per cent
increase in 1988; impart growth was also lower and tourist
earnings were adversely affected by the civil strife in the
country. Consequently, the current account deficit increased
to 7.6 per cent of GDP.

Domestic Policies

In most South Asian countries, a reduction in the large
budget deficits remained the dominant fiscal concern. in
India, in order to generate additional revenue, discourage
huixury consumption and promote savings, a surcharge on
high-income taxpayers, an expenditure tax on luxury goods
and other revenue raising measures were introduced and a
new household savings scheme with fiscal incentives was

_ launched. In Pakistan, the coverage of sales tax on locally

manufactured goods was increased as a first step toward the
introduction of a general sales tax, and the coverage of
excise tax was expanded. To contro! current expenditures,
the provincial governments were advised that in future the
federal government would only cover the amount previously
agreed upon of the provincial deficit and that expendilures
in excess of thal would have to be met by provincial
governments from their own resources.

Sri Lanka increased fertilizer and wheat prices by 35
and 20 per cent respectively to reduce subsidies and introduced a 20 per cent across the board cut in non-wage
non-interest recurrent expenditure. To raise additional
revenues, Sri Lanka introduced a withholding tax on interest
on government serurities and a surchatge on income and
wealth tax, and the Business Tumover ‘l'ax and a number of
indirect taxes were also increased. Myanmar was able to
generate additional reveriies through the revision of income
taxes, ar increase in sales tax and license fees and the

Most South Asian countries, despite increasing deficits
on the current account, continued fo pursue policies of
import liberalization while relying on active exchange rate
policies to deal with external imbalances. In Bangladesh, a
new two-year import policy was announced under which the
banned and restricted lists were combined into a single
control list and a large number of iiems were moved on Lo
the free list. A number of export promotion measures were
also implemented, such as the expansion of the bonded
warehouse scheme and an increased allocation of foreign
exchange to exporters. Pakistan also introduced a number
of trade liberalization and tariff rationalization measures.
These included a substantial reduction in the number of tterns
on the negative and restricted lists, a reduction in the

maximum tariff rate to 125 per cent from 150 per cent and
the restructuring of tariffs so that, in general, raw maierials
would be subject to tariffs of 20 to 25 per cent and
intermediate goods to tariffs of 30 to 80 per cent.

In India, import duties on sorne machinery and raw
materials [or high-tech’ and agro-processing industries were
reduced bul otherwise it was a period of consolidation
following several years of liberalization efforts. In order to
minirnize the impact of the current trade and transit difficulties, in May the Government of Nepal announced a 22-point
economic program which included measures for liberalization of imports, a reduction in tariffs, an expansion in the
duty drawback scheme and cash subsidies for exports. In
Sri Lanka, the government monopoly on rice imports was
removed. However, because of balance-of-payment corisiderations, some restrictions were placed on the import of
a number of juxury items in June.

In Sri Lanka, producer incentives were improved by the
removal of the sales tax on tea and subsidies on fertilizer and
wheat were reduced. In Bangladesh, action was taken for
liberalized importation and distribution of minor irrigation
equipment as well as for distribution of fertilizers. In
Myanmar, the procurement price of paddy was increased
and farmers were allowed greater flexibility in the production
and marketing of crops.

People’s Republic of China

A Sharp Slowdown in Growth

After two years of double-digit growth, the overheated
Chinese economy cooled considerably in 1989, While
market tension and inflation pressures eased, owing to the
slowdown in the economy, the GNP growth rate
deteriorated faster than expected and production costs increased sharply. The GNP growth rate was 3.9 per cent in
1989 compared with 11.2 per cent in 1988. Although
inflation for 1989 was tigh at 18 per cent, the trend of
inflation decelerated month by month, and prices in
December 1989 were only 6.4 per cent higher than those
in the corresponding month in. 1988. The industry sector
led the slowdown in the economy. The growth rate of
industrial output declined sharply to 8.3 per cent from 20,8
per cent in 1988. Sluggish industrial growth net only
reduced aggregate demand and pressures on transportation,
energy and raw materials but also resulted in higher unemployment. The agriculture sector, however, had a rela
tively better performance, with the sector growth rate at 3.3
per cent being marginally higher than in 1988.

The deficit on the external account increased sharply in
the first half of 1989 but it improved in the second half of
1989 as a resull of a policy of tight control over imports.
Exports rose by 12 per cent and imports by 11.1 per cent,
while the trade delicil was $5.5 billion compared with $5.3
billion in 1988, Tourisrn income, which grew by over
20 per cent in the past three years, dropped sharply after
June 1989. The higher current account deficit and slow

foreign investment inflow caused a reduction in foreign
reserves to $14.2 billion in December 1989 from $17.5
billion in January 1989. Total external debt reached $44
billion, 16 per cent of which was short-term debt, while the
debt-service rallo increased to 12.2 per cent.

Domestic Policies

Record high inflation led the Government to adopt a
comprehensive austerity program in the last quarler of 1988
which ft continued into 1989. In November 1989, the
Government decided that the austerity program would-continue for the nexl lwo years or more. The purpose of the
progratn was to improve the econontic environment and
restore economic order while maintaining sustainable
economic growth — a GNP growth rate of 5 to 6 per cent
and inflation below 10 per cent.

Under the austerity program, the fiscal policy was
airned at cutting administrative spending and increasing
taxes to reduce the budgetary deficit. A contractionary
monetary policy was also followed, with the People's Bank
of China, the country's central hank, setting loan quotas for
commercial banks and selling bonds to the public to reduce
money supply. In addition, a successful savings program,
which guaranteed an interest rate higher than the inflation
rate, absorbed more than 80 per cent of the new deposits.
Although ‘the unexpected negative industrial growth in
October Jed the monetary authority to loosen partially the
credit squeeze in the last quarter, the overall level of money
supply remained tight. ‘he central aciministration reasserted
control over investment and a large-scale investment cutback
was carried out. it was estimated that fixed capital investment
in 1989 was 10 per cent lower’ than the 1988 level, The
investment structure was also adjusled to emphasize the
energy, transportation, raw mialerials production and
agriculture sectors.

With regard to industrial policy, the Government reemphasized the role of large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises and discouraged the private and collective small
town and village enterprises, particularly those that were
energy or yaw material intensive, Furthermore, enterprises
involved in energy, transport and raw material production
and projects involving foreign investment were given
preferential treatment and received priority in obtaining new
loans.

Policy adjustrnents were also made in the agriculture
sector, which is considered Lo be one of the most important
areas deserving high privrily during the current program for
rectifying the econornic order and improving the economic
environment, Consequently, in 1989 the declining trend in
agricultural investments was reversed ard increased funds
were allocated to agriculture by the state and local governments. The additional funds, in the form of loans and grants,
were devoted to grain and cotton production as well as to
land improvement, irrigation and water conservation
projects. Furthermore, to stimulate farmers’ efforts in
production, the State increased the procurement prices of
grain, colton and oil-bearing crops,

 

sep tenetAlthough current measures fo check inflation are basically dependent on direct administrative controls on prices,
the ‘Governrnent has contemplated an adjustment of the
ssi price system. ‘Ihe double-track price system, under which

” there is a low state price for goods produced and distributed
- under quotas set by the state plan and a high market price
for items produced in excess of the quotas, will be gradually
“converted to a one-price system. Experience showed that
the double-track price system provided substantial opporfunities for windfall gains, Selected price adjustments were
undertaken in 1989 with careful consideration regarding the
stability of the overall price level. The procurement prices of
grainand cotton were raised. Fares for transportation by air,
rail.arid ship were increased io better reflect the operating
costs. The success of these adjustments encouraged the
Chinése Government to pursue further price reforms to
rationalize the price structure. A plan to adjust the prices of
energy, transport, grain and eash crops was approved at the
end of 1989.

Following the huge trade deficit in the first half of 1989,
the importation of luxury goods was prohibited and overall
- ‘imports were placed under tight control. Foreign borrowing
was also regulated in an attempt to keep the debt-service
ratio below 20 per cent. The number of government entities
authorized toe borrow funds from abroad was reduced sharply..Onthe other hand, foreign investments were encouraged
- and the legal rights of invesfors were protected. In December
- 1989, the Government devalued the currency by 21.2 per
- -eent. The devaluation should not only promote exports and
dampen imports but also encourage tourism aud foreign
investment. However, il is also possible thal the devaluation
could give rise to inflationary pressure as enterprises raise
prices to reflect the higher costs of imported goods.

 

South Pacific DMCs

Mixed Growth Performance

South Pacific DMCs (SPDMCs) experienced diverse
economic performance in 1989, Fiji’s GDP, recovering
from two years of negalive or zero growth, expanded by
12.1 per cent. The agriculture sector, dominated by sugar
cane production, grew briskly at a rate of 12.8 per cent and
the manufacturing sector, led by garments, expanded at a
rafe of 19.7 per cent. The tourism industry also continued
its recovery. At the same time, Papua New Guinea's
economy stagnated as the mining sector, which accounts for
20 per cent of GDP, suffered a sharp setback following the
closure in May 1989 of the large Bougainville copper mine.
Excluding mining, the GDP increased at a rate of ahout 2
Per cent, largely as a result of a declining trend in agricultural
output, and per capita income continued to stagnate.

Economic activity in Tonga and Weslern Samoa, which
experienced neyative yrowth in 1988, recovered in 1989.
Improved performance in Ihe agriculture and fishery seclors
in Tonga led to GDP growth of 3 per cent. In Western
Samoa, improved production in agriculture and manufactur
ing resulted in some increase in economic activity, The
economy of Solomon Islands, which recovered from cyclone
damage and grew at a rate of 4.3 per cent in 1988, slowed
down in 1989 in spite of continued rapid growth in the
fishery sector. Cook Islands and Vanuatu recovered slowly
from cyclone damage in the last lwo years but both countries
benefited from sustained growih in the tourism industry. In
Kiribati, real GDP growth, which averaged 1.4 per cent over
the period 1981-1988, continued to fluctuate widely. The
growth rate moderated considerably in 1989 as copra prices
fell by nearly 10 per cent.

Inflation, which in SPDMCs largely reflects increases in
import prices and availability of local food supply, generally
eased in 1989, As agricultural supply conditions improved
following drought in 1988, inflation fell markedly in Fiji to
arate of 6.5 per cent. With a decline in food prices, inflation
fell dramatically in Western Samoa to 6.5 per cent, in
Solornon Islands, because of the improved supply position,

inflation declined to 10.8 per cent from 17.1 per cent in
1988. In Papua New Guinea, inflation was 6 per cent,
reflecting some increase in import prices and in custom and
excise duties,

The export performances of most SPDMCs
deteriorated significantly in 1989 as prices for primary
commodities, which account for ihe bulk of exports, fell.
Prices for coffee, cocoa, palin oil, coconut oil and copra
declined by 1.0 to 15 per cent in 1989, By contrast, the price
of sugar, which represents 40 per cent of the exports of Fiji,
increased by nearly 20 per cent as world sugar stocks
reached their lowest levels in nearly a decade. The fall in
copper and gold prices affected Fiji and Papua New Guinea.
In the case of Papua New Guinea, the closure since May
1989 of ils largest copper mine, which accounts for about
35 ver cent of its total exports, dramatically affected its
export performance and balance-of-payment situation. The
SPDMCs are extremely import-dependent and trade bal
ances have generally deteriorated. Though tourist receipts
increased rapidly for Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu,
current accounts deteriorated in most SPDMCs, Additionally, as export growth slowed down, debt service ratios increased fram the 1988. levels.

Domestic Policies

In Papua New Guinea, monetary and fiscal policies
were tighteried significantly in 1989 to maintain a manageable balance of payments, preserve foreign exchange reserves and Jimit the budget deficit in the wake of a sharp fall
in government revenues following the closure of the
Bougainville mine. To stimulate non-mining investment, the
1989 budget initiated a tax reform aimed at reducing personal and corporate taxes on the srnall formal sector of the
economy and broadening the tax base by increasing the role
of indirect taxation. Some new taxes, such as on the exports
of logs, were introduced to encourage local precessing while
tariffs on industrial and agricultural inputs were lowered.

To encourage export manufacturing, Fiji established a
Tax Free Zone/Tax Free Factory scheme in 1.988 in order
to attract toreign investment. The scheme was extended in
1989 and has proved successful, as evidenced by the rapid
development of garment, footwear and furniture-making
industries. In addition, the tariff structure was simplified and
tariff codes were harmonized. Quanititalive import restrictions were partly lifted and protection for import substituting
industries was significantly lowered.

In Vanuatu, the Governmient’s budgetary situation has
been very precarious in recent years with a continuing deficit
at about 5 per cent of GDP. As the economy stagnated,
significant expenditure cuts had to be implemented in the
19839 budget. The second National Development Plan,
Jaunched in 1989, emphasizes manpower development, the
expansion of the role of the private sector in development
and the attraction of foreign investment, mainly in the
tourism sector. In Tonga, an important step towards mobilizing domestic financial resources was taker by establishing a
National Reserve Bank in June 1989. The Bank introduced

‘Prospects for the world economy heading for a "softnding” Improved significantly in 1989. World economic
growth remained relatively robust in 1989. Forecasts for
. 1990 indicate a further moderate slowdown in the world
conomy te about 2.9.per cent GDP growth, only marginally
jéwer than” the 3.1 per cent recorded in 1989, In the
in ized countries, GDP growth Is forecast at 2.9 per
aboiit half a per cant lower than in 1989. In developing
uuntties, growth on aggregate is, however, expected to
accelerate to over 4 per cent. World trade is estimated to
xpand in volume by about 6 per cent, 1 per cent below the
989 performance. With few exceptions, such as for sugar,
-of primary commodities will weaken further in 1990.
inflation outlook for industrialized countries improved
somewhat at the end of 1989 so that a sighificant tightening
fmonetary policies is not expected in 1990. international
interest rates might thus soften slightly in 1990, a welcome
prospect for heavily indebted developing countries, “Al
though it will continue to deteriorate, the external econornic
environment for Asian developing countries is expecied to
‘remain relatively favorable,

Union are. likely to have a significant impact on the medium_..term ‘development of the world economy, Although the

. isa possibility that the positive effects of these developments
_- + -orthe growth of the world rnarket would ultimately outweigh
+! any negative consequences which may occur in the short
tun. There is some concern in the developing countries that
-. these.changes may result in reduced financial flows. Sirilar», ly, there is concern that the progress of econotnic integration
in'Western Europe might also have an effect on trade flows.
However, the DMCs, because of their pragmatic and flexible
economic policies, are in.a relatively favorable position,
‘compared to other developing countries, to adjust to any
changing situation.

  

 

The NIEs, particularly Republic of Korea and
Taipei,China, adjusted in 1989 to a more sustainable long
term growth path. Both economies will pursue further their’

structural transformation in 1990 in line with their rapidly
shifting international comparative advantage. Sustained
growth at over 6 per cent is projected as domestic demand
continues to complement export growth. While consumer
spending will decelerate, investment activity is expected to
strengthen significantly in Republic of Korea and
Taipei,China in 1990, In Hong Kong, growth is expected
to remain low if business confidence remains weak. Slower
expansion in world demand and bottlenecks such as labor
shortages are projected fo induce some slowdown in
Singapore’s economy with GDP forecast to grow by about
6 per cent. :

In Southeast Asia, the growth performance of Malaysia
and particularly Thailand, despite some signs of overheating,
is expected to remain well above the regional average. The
prospects for the Philippine economy are uncertain as the
balance of payments is under heavy pressure. Inflation
continued to accelerate and political events eroded confidence in the economy. As domestic demand slows down,
growth in the economy will decelerate cormpared with 1989.
Prospects for Indonesia remain good although the economy
might lose momentum in 1990, GDP growth is forecast at
over 6 per cent.

For South Asia, the outlook is mixed, However,
economic performance in all countries, except Nepal,
should improve over 1989. For South Asia as a whole,
despite a negative growth projection for Nepal in 1990,
growth should rise to 5.2 per cent from:4.4 per cent in
1989. Agricultural production continues fo increase and this
should help sustain overall growth. Industrial growth should
also be higher in 1990 as exports and domestic demand
continue to rise at a good rate.

In the People’s Republic: of China, the projection is for
5.5 per cent growth in 1990 which, though better than
1989, is substantially lower than in the receni pasi, and
exports are expected to pick up slowly. Much depends,
however, on the success in dealing with the inflation problem. If inflation continues to abate, controls on credit and
foreign exchange transactions could be eased. Also, with less
pressures from the demand side, it would be possible to
reduce subsidies and thus improve the budgetary position as
well as encourage a more efficient allocation of resources.
This could provide the basis for a return to moderately high
growth in future years.

The prospects for economic growth in several South
Pacific DMCs suffered a severe setback because of-extensive
cyclone damage in the beginning of 1990. While in Fiji
growth is projected to be moderate in 1990, Papua New
Guinea is likely to experience a decline in per capila income
because of the continued closure of the Bougainville copper
mine,

New Approaches in
Development Thinking

AS the awareness grows that development is a participatory
exercise — be it the alleviation of poverty, the provision of
social services, the development of local institutions and
self-help groups, the improvement of the natural environment or policy discussion on development issues — and that
project benefits are not always easily sustainable without

involving beneficiaries, the Bank as well as other develop-,

ment financing institutions have been searching for new
- mechanisms to deliver their services.

One such mechanistn is to involve non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) in project design, implementation and
evaluation. It reflecis ihe general belief that such organiza
tions have, for certain types of projects, a comparative
advantage over government aid agencies. For their part,
NGOs, which are private, voluntary and non-profit organizations that aim to improve the quality of life and the standards
of living of the people, recagnize that there are certain areas
in which they can cooperate with government aid agenctes
and provide their special know-how and experience without
giving up their independence.

The 1980s ‘saw a trend toward participatory approaches among a number of developing member countries
(DMCs). This was partly in response to implementation
problems that crept into official programs designed without

* consultation with beneficiaries. Also, because of the financial
constraints that cropped up in the 1980s, governments
nowadays often expect communities to help pay for services.
That makes more obvious the need to ask communities what
they want. The Bank has contributed to this worldwide
change in development thinking, arguing that continued
efforts to promote growth should be complemented by
focused efforts to reduce poverty. Thus, there is now an
increasing emphasis on targeting project benefits to welldefined groups which are. actively Involved in project design,
implemeniation and evaluation. Popular participation In
development decision-making has become a desirable abjective.

Some DMCs have atiempted to improve the direct
distribution of benefits to the poor by specifically targeting

programs at them, by decentralizing rural administration and
by according high priorily to sectors and activities which can
offer immediate productivity gains or essential services to
the poor. However, many of these initiatives have been besel
with -difficulties. As the Bank’s Sector Paper on Rural
Development points out, although several DMCs have
decentralized their rural development planning procedures
in order to establish closer links with local communities,
manpower constraints have inhibited their efforts. ! Govern:
ment agencies often do not have people with enough
motivation, training and ability to assist local communities
to articulate their needs and develop a coherent focus for a
rural development program. Besides, as the Bank's Sector
Paper also notes, the poor are not represented on local
planning bodies and, therefore, DMCs have particular difficulties in involving the poorest communities in rural
development planning. Motivated as they are and being
closer to the communities they serve, NGOs can be a useful
link in the development process. A colierent and systernatic
approach to involve intermediaries like NGOs belween the
government and self-help groups is, therefore, essential if
the poor are to take advantage of government programs.

Comparative Advantages and
Limitations of NGOs

It is, however, difficult to make a comprehensive assessment of the overail role and contribution of NGOs to

socio economic developinerit. For one thing, the operations 
of NGOs are diverse ir: nature. For another, there are not
enough relevant dala on their activities. Still, within these
limitations, there are major comparative advantages to be
derived from working with NGOs. Mostly, they derive their
success not from their association with any political grouping
but from the vision of their individual leaders and the
dedication of their self-motivated staff, They are involved at
the grassroots level and are familiar with the specific needs
of the poor. They are committed to the betterment of the
neediest, the protection of the environment, the welfare. of

MAIN OBJECTIVES. OF THE BANK’S POLICY

The main objectives of the Bank’s cooperation with
NGOs in its operational activities are to assist the poor in
improving their living standards effectively, and to sup
port improved natural resource management and conser-’

vation.in the DMCs. In July 1987, a policy framework for
cooperation with NGOs was established and approved by

the Board of'Directors. In August 1988,.a task force on ©

the Bank’s role in poverty alleviation recognized that, for
the Bank to be-effective in implementing its objective, it
would be necessary to utilize channels.and mechariisms
for transferring resources and technical assistance directly
to the poor..

Within this policy frorhemnarls the Bank eeOpER ates
selectively with NGOs which are well: established.and have
experience in socio-economic activities. Such coopera:

_ tion.is.based on the-merits of individual.cases, with. prior
concurrence of DMC governments. _

There are a.number of sectors.and subsectors where

. the Bank can work: together with NGOs. Among them

are agriculture and rural development; social. infrastruc_ture;'urban development; water supply and sanitation;
heaith and population; education and training; small-scale
industry and, -of course, environmental prolection in
specific geographical regions, which has become a major
concern for the Bank. So-far, on the project level, the
Bank's cooperation with .NGOs.‘has concentrated on

“There.are several. ways the Bank can cooperate with ...
NGOs. It can-work with: them as sources of information,”

as consultants or contractors, as executing or operating
agencies or.as co-financiers,

Where.NGOs have been active. at - Samrat and
have gained development experience, the Bank, can draw
on their knowledge and expertise to identily, prepare and

the community. They emphasize self-help and self-reliance.
In their operations, they have no bureaucracy to contend
with and so can be flexible and innovative. They work
directly to develop skills through training and other technical
assistance programs; support institution-building; and help
design, prepare and implement development activities.

it is important to note that NGOs have their limitations,
too. They are small in size and scope, and, thus, can have
only a limited impact. Frequently, they lack a broader

appraise its projects; monitor and evaluate benefils; and
facilitate its post-evaluation work.

Applying the usual Bank procedures, NGOs can also
be recruited as consultants,. either directly or in collaboration with other consultants and executing agencies because of their particular famniliarity with local conditions.
Moreover, wilh the governments’ concurrence, they can
be-used as executing agencies for certain components of
Bank-financed loan and technical assistance projects.

NGOs may also be co-financiers, of Bank-financed
loan and ‘technical assistance projects, though amounts
would generally be modest. NGO financing could certainly complement and enhance the effectiveness of the
Bank's assistance. They can either put.up cash of, which
is mosth ly the case, provide the ‘necessary training and
advisory assistance. However, since the development

approach of NGOs and their crileria-and procedures for

procurement’ of goods and services could differ from
those of the Bank, parallel financing arr angements would
normally be the most appropriate involvement for NGGs.

The ‘Bank continues to identify NGOs which might
be interested in cooperating with it. It maintains proper
records and. information about such NGOs and their
activities..In order to enhance NGOs’ understanding of
the Bank's. operational policies, . strategies and proce
dures, it keeps NGOs regularly informed on projects
under consideratioriin the various DMCs. It also discusses
with executing agencies possible areas of cooperation

“with NGOs and encourages contacts between them. It
-consults and,.where appropriate, coordinates with other

World Bank) én how to .cooperate-:more closely with

economic and social perspective. Their financial and technical resources are not large either. They are loosely slruc
tured, sometimes without real accountability. And they are
often weak (or excessively flexible) in mariagement and
planning. To achieve the oplimum balance between, for
example, flexibility and planning capacity requires a high
level of experience and maturity. It is thus not surprising that
the number of efficient and effective development NGOs is
still relatively small.- “ Government Policies and
Relations with NGOs

.- At times, the relationship between NGOs and DMC
governments poses legal and administrative problems. While
some. NGOs have a legal status, others are less formally
organized, In the absence of specific policies or guidelines,
their cooperation with governments depends on the
‘relationship they have with particular government ministries
and agencies. It is also recognized that a close embrace of
NGOs by governments would be detrimental to some of their
cornparative advantages.
~* Occasionally, there could be NGOs who would take

. their concern for particular causes almost to the point of
being, hiased, ignoring the broader socio-economic considerations of the government. When such a conflict of
purpose and priority arises, cooperation with NGOs is not

going io be easy.

~ Nevertheless, NGO involvement in government

projects has increased in recent years. Sometimes, govern:

ments use them as sources for inforraation on local condi:
ions and as vehicles to deliver inputs, offer extension

‘setvices and provide training, Likewise, NGOs in some

MCs:have sought to coordinate their activities in consul
‘tation with governments so as to avoid fragmentation and

‘duplication of effort.

“A few DMC governments, in cooperation with NGOs,

have themselves directly sought lo develop self-help groups
toimprove the distribution of inputs and services. Some have
acted to boost manpower and strengihen skills at the

‘grassroots level. Others, such as the Philippines, have recog
zed the need to actively encourage the development of

GOs and use them as the final link between government

rvices and beneficiaries, either formally or informally.

“ In general, the degree to which a DMC is concemed

bout increasing beneficiary participation in rural development projects and poveriy alleviation will influence the
degree to which the Government is prepared ta encourage
the development of NGOs and collaborate with them. This,
tum; will affect the degree to which the Bank can look to

IGOs to address the queslion of increased beneficiary

Pajticipation in development projects. This will also, natural
Wy, influence the nature of Bank loans and technical assis
tance projects to improve such participation.

 

: Status of Bank’s Efforts

Between 1987 and 1989, the Bank participated in
various symposia/conferences which were organized by
NGOs or which addressed NGO issues. These symposia and
conferences presented an excellent opportunity for the Bank
40 explain its new policy measures to a large number of
NGOs and DMC governments. The Bank also kept in close
-ontact with the newly-created NGO Division at UNDP as
- Well as with the World Bank’s NGO Leam.

Besides, the Bank commissioned a study on coupera
fon with NGOs in agriculture and rural development, which

identified, assessed and suggested working arrangernents
with specific NGOs in sever DMCs (Bangladesh, India,
Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka).!
Since the policy framework for cooperation with NGOs
became effective in 1987 (see box story on opposite page),
anumber of loans and technical assistance projects involving
NGOs have been approved. The Chitral Area Developmeni
Project in Pakistan, approved in 1987, was designed on the

‘basis of close collaboration and cooperation with the Aga

Khan Rural Support Programme, an NGO with considerable
expertise in the project area. Another example of BankNGO cooperation is provided by a technical assistance grant
to Indonesia, which seeks to study how to improve the
efficiency of irrigation and management systerns in selected
areas of West Java and West Sumatra. The Bank has joined
the Ford Foundation and the International Irrigation
Management Institute (IIMI) in sharing the cost of the study.
In the Philippines, in conjunction with the Sorsogon Integrated Area Developrnent Project, the Bank agreed in
1988 to provide an advisory technical assistance grant for
establishing a pilot community organization program.
Through an NGO, the program will mobilize community
groups in Sorsogon engaged in economic aclivities in key
seciors, namely, non-irrigated food crops, tree crops,
fisheries, small-scale agro-processing and gerieral services.
In 1988, the Bank extended a Ioan to the Philippines for
the NGO-Microcredil Project, which is currently being implemented. This was the Bank’s first practical step in directly
involving NGOs to support beneficiary groups at the
grassroots level. This pilot project will finance microenterprises and cottage industries using NGOs as credlit
intermediaries as well as providers of technical assistance.
Along with the loan, the Bank provided an advisory technical
assistance fo strengthen about 30 NGOs expected tu be
accredited under the project. The Fisheries Sector Program
loan io the Philippines supports a comraunity-based coastal
zone management program to be implemented in 12 major
areas of the country, with NGOs serving as fleld-level project
managers. In 1989, the Bank approved the Low-Income
Upland Communities Project in the Philippines, in which
NGOs have also been given an important role in communitybased resource regeneration ‘activities associated with a
watershed management project in Mindoro,

Cooperation of environmental NGOs is of particular
importance to the Bank. In 1988, it: a pioneering initiative,
the senior management of the Bank held an informal meefing with representatives-of selected ervironmental NGOs to
exchange views on the Bank’s environmental policies and
programs and discuss how environmental NGOs could help
address environmental and natural resources concerns in the
DMCs, During the ninth meeting of the Committee of
International Development Institutions on the Environment
{(CIDIE) in Washington, .D.C., also in 1988, a presentation
was-made:on the ADB study on cooperative arrangements
with environmental NGOs. The presentation dealt with the

 

1 Asian Development Bank, Cooperation with NGOs in Agriculture and
Rural Developrnent (1989), ‘

31overall context of such collaboration, the opportunities for
getting DMC governments to agree with these new arrangemenls and various ideas on how to broaden the basis
of cooperation. The country-hy-courtry assessment was
undertaken in close collaboration with recognized national
NGO network bodies and in consultation with donor country
governments. its results were further discussed at the ADBNGO consultative meeting in 1989, held in conjunction with
the tenth meeting of the CIDIE in Manila.

Subsequently, the services of environmental NGOs
were built into several projects, including urban infrastructure development in Dhaka, Bangladesh; institution-building
for environmental. management in Nepal and the forestry
and fishery sector program loans and the low-income upland
communities project in the Philippines. The Bank's concern
was also reflected in the technical assistance it provided for
an environmental improvement study in the Manila
metropolitan region.

The Bank will continue to pay increasing attention to
improving formal and informal links with NGOs, particularly
indigenous NGOs in DMCs, to address environmental concems in Bank-supported activities. In this regard, resulis of
an ongoing study on institutional strengthening of indigenous NGOs, in connection with the tenth meeting of
CIDIE, will provide the modalities for future cvoperation.

Outlook

Although substantial progress has been made so far in
intensifying the Bank's cooperation with NGOs, rmuch
remains to be done. The effort to promote a better underslanding between the Bank and NGOs through symposia
and conferences could be further intensified at the DMC
level, since NGOs can perform a useful role as development
and environment educators. The Bank has benefited from

under the NGO-Microcredit Project which the Bank: isiis 1988 meetings with selected environmental NGOs in
: ‘Washington, D.C., and the 1989 Bank-NGO Consultative
. Meeting in Manila, which provided an excellent forum to
further’ improve the Bank’s understanding of environmental
jssues.. Simultaneously, contacts with NGOs in the donor
countries could be expanded. In spite of the recognition that
such NGOs could help educate public opinion in their
-countries about the problems of the DMCs, little effort was
made-in the past to foster relationships with them
Experience has also shown that the participation of
NGOs on the project level has so far been rather limited and
‘only ‘in a few countries, such as Indonesia, Pakistan and
“Philippines. Also, the involvement has been largely confined
to the agriculture and rural development sector, which raises
3. a question of geographical and sectoral balariee, However,
“ _-qith’ the emphasis shifting to poverty alleviation and the
" yelated need to design and implement beneficiary-oriented,

 

grassroot-level projects, a substantial expansion in the role
of NGOs can be expected.

The experience gained by the Bank in cooperating with
NGOs points to some other issues which are likely to emerge
in the near future. By expanding its operational cooperation
with NGOs, the Bank has realized more clearly the need to
proceed in conformity with relevant government policies on
the matter. In this context, the Bank will seek to play a
catalytic role tn promoting the relationship between NGOs
and DMC governments and facilitating a more intensive
dialogue between them on issues such as poverty alleviation,
popular participation, environment and women in development,

The Bank's cooperation with NGOs is still in the early
stages of development and some more experience needs to
be gained before the effectiveness of this strategy can be
properly evaluated,

The Need

PROGRAM lending, one of the special topics for this Annual
Report, is a lending modality that seeks to improve the
‘policy, institutional and investment environment in a country
so as io accelerate economic development. Loans are dis
‘pursed quickly and help to meet the short-term costs of
policy adjustments before jong-term benefits are realized.
Thus, program lending has a broader perspective than
project lending. Although the Bank’s projects have long
reflected an understanding of the influence of policies and
§nstitutions in realizing project objectives, the issues involved
in project lending are mainly project-specific. The sector
loans of the Bank, which finance a variety of specified
projects within a subsector, are associated often with institutional change and policy strengthening within the subsector.
But neither project nor sector loans can readily tackle
fundamental policy constraints and opportunities that are
sectorwide in nature, or bear upon. links between particular
sectors and the macroeconomy. Program lending has been
designed particularly to meet these wider needs.

The Asian Record

The chapter on Economic Developments outlines the
notable economic progress attained by the Bank's DMCs.
With an average GDP growth of more than 6.5 per cent in
the 1980s, their performance is the most impressive among
developing country groups over the past decade. Implementation of appropriate and éffective policies has been an
important factor im this achievement, Three features of
economic management merit particular mention:

First, sensible use of fiscal and monetary instruments
has, in many countries, provided the stable macroeconomic
environment that is essential for development. Although
their macroeconomic performance has varied, the DMCs by
and large have understood well thal growth is jeopardized
when budgets and exlernalxaccounts are chronically imbalanced and inflalion is excessive.

Second, there has been a growing appreciation of the

role that competitive markets and the private sector can play
in promoting growth. In varying degree, governments have
increasingly come to see their role as the providers of
infrastructure and a stable macroeconomic environment,
while establishing a structure of incentives for private investment which facilitates resource mobilization and increases
the efficiency with which resources are allocated and used.

Third, export development has become a primary objective in many DMCs and has led to a shift away from the
import substitution strategy that previously characterized the
policies of many countries. The Asian region provides the
best examples of how exports can sustain high growth and
service foreign debt while subjecting producers to efficiency
tests more rigorous than those available in domestic markets.
Exports thus serve hoth primary objectives: they generate
capital and increase the productivity of its use.

These concerns have led to a redefinition af the macro
and microeconomic policies and restructuring of institutions
of earlier decades. While there are important differences in
the circumstances of individual DMCs and ihe pace and
extent of change, certain common elements in the adjust
ment process can be identified.

On the microeconomic side, these new policies have
made production structures more competitive. The
measures employed include lower levels of protection
against imports; pragressive deregulation of investrnent approval, capacity limits and price controls; and a contraction
of public regulation of agricultural prices and markets. These
measures are designed to create an investment pattern more
consistent with comparative advantage. Together with
flexible exchange rate management and more focused financial support, they are also meant to help increase export
earnings arid establish a more diversified export base.

Reforms have been underlaken in the financial seclor
with a view to increasing domestic savings arid allocating
credit more efficiently among alternative investrnent uses. In
some countries, governmental intervention in regulating
interest rates and ailocating credit has been reduced. In some
others, efforts are underway to develop a wide variety of
financial and capital market instruments in a competitive
environment which rewards intermediative efficiency.

An important teature of the new approach tv develop
ment has been a trend towards a srnaller public role in the
direct provision of goods and services, Privatizing public
enterprises or restructuring them on a cormmercial basis have
become desirable objectives for some countries. Governments nonetheless consider they have a role to play, mainly
by providing physical and social infrastructure and, in some
cases, essential goods and public services. ‘They remain the
principal source of agricultural support services and irrigation. They also have a large involvement in the provision of
energy, transport and communications, water supply, health
and educalion.

Important shifts have ollert occurred in their approach
to these services. For example, while heullh services and

public subsidies, reflecting their importance, increasingly,

The Challenge

Despite the progress achieved so far, most Asian
economies are still in a transitional phase between policies
that were dominantin the 1970s and adjustments that began
to be made in the 1980s. This partly reflects difficulties in
overcoming past rigidities and barriers to change. Structural
adjustments are meant to have clear positive effects on
resource allucalion. Although these effects will, in the
mediurn term, have a posilive global irnpact and lead to a
net gain in benefits, there will be activities (such as inefficient
industries) which will be adversely affected and so will seeksto resist change. Govenmens also seek to minimize the

‘ social costs of adjustment by shielding vulnerable social

groups, for example, from sharp increases in the prices of
+ essential cornmadities and services.
While rapid adjustment is sometimes necessary and can

work, Asian governments have generally sought Lo avoid its

” destabilizing effects in the short term by managing policy
change in an incremental and orderly way. The methodical
-pace is also influenced by the long time frame and evolution:

ary.character of broad-based reform programs, particularly
in their institutional aspects. Improving the efficiency of
agricultural support services, or creating public confidence
in capital market institutions, are cases in point.

. Thus, while considerable progress has been made,
much rernains to be done. Many of the Bank's DMCs have
shown an impressive competence in managing structural
change while maintaining stability and economic growth.
They continue, however, to require external assistance in
two ways.

First, they require assistance, financial or otherwise, in
varying degree, in preparing adjustment programs in both
policy and institutional aspects. The Bank's role is to provide
advice at the sectoral level. In this regard, the Bank has

acquired considerable intra-regional experience and continues to build upon its capability to analyze policy issues and

~ balance country circumstances with the wider lessons on

. development that have been learnt internationally, Govern
‘ments, however, are better able to assess the domestic
acceptability of policy redirections and the pace and extent
of change. They have a better feel for the country context

_ through which general economic concepts must be inter‘mediated. The reform programs supported by the Bank have

benefited from this two-way interaction,
~~ Second, DMCs require financial support to sustain the
short-term costs that adjustment programs tend to entail.
This is most evident in the strain on budgets and external
accounts that liberalization of market restrictions can cause
since revenues may fall, budget deficits increase, and imports
rise before the new set of price and market relationships
begins to work. Equally, adjustments may entail Lransitional
output losses as factors of production are reallocaled across
sectors in response to the sarne stimuli. In view of these
effects, external financial support is often an essential requirement for adjustment in the DMCs.

Policy Dialogue under Program Lending

Prograrn Jending with policy dialogue has emerged as
the Bank's response to the DMCs’ need for support in
Preparing and financing their adjustment programs. Although program lending has been among the Bank's lending
instruments since 1978, it acquired its present policy-based
characier only in November 1987 following substantial
revisions in its content.

‘The Bank has generally tried, in ils lending operations,
‘to support the emergence of a favorable policy outlook.
Policy dialogue has also tended to focus on the degree of

change and its timing. This accords well with the very nature
of policy dialogue, which cannot progress unless there is
common ground,

The purpose of policy dialogue between the Bank and
a DMC is to discuss and develop a policy framework appropriate for Bank support. Policy conditionality cannot be
used to essentially change the character or the acceptable
speed of reform, but it can establish interim goals and a
timetable for implementation. A subsequent portion of the
Bank’s funds may only be released after these interim goals
are substarially achieved. Reforms, however, to be success
ful, must have broad-based support within the DMC and
therefore cannot be, or be seen to be, imposed frorn outside,
The aim of the Bank, in keeping with the injunction in its
Charter to achieve the most effective utilization of resources,
is to suggest policies which it believes would be conducive
to economy and efficiency. At the same time, the Bank, in
proposing policy changes, takes into account the realities in
the DMCs and the constraints and imperatives facing them.
Hence, the Bank’s role is to engage in a genuine two-way
dialogue, assess recent policy reforms, and agree on a broad
and practicable program of future reforms. If the past policy
reforms and those proposed for the future provide an
adequate basis, the Bank extends its support.

Other Features of Program Lending

Broad-based structural adjustment programs have both
macroeconomic and sectoral aspects, and the connections
between macro and sectoral issues must be reflected in the
designing of sector programs. Fiscal and monetary measures
ike tariff rationalization, exchange rate movement and interest rate adjustment can have a profound impact on
incentives as well as sector-level instruments like deregulation. In keeping with its mandate, the Bank focuses on the
sectoral aspects of adjustment and therefore works closely
with Bretton Woods institutions as well as governmenis.
Equally important is coordination with major bilateral donor
countries, since such countries are leading players in the
sectors supported by the Barik.

Prograin loans are designed to improve a sector's
performance over the medium term, thereby contributing to
faster economic development. The three major determinants of sector performance are sector policies (particularly those bearing on incentives), the adequacy of institutions
to sustain sector objectives, and the level and composition
of sector expenditures, both capital and recurrent. These
provide a three-cornered framework within which the requirements for sector development are considered,

Policy dialogue is intended to ensure that the rationale
underlying existing policy, investment plans, andl institutional arrangements are fully understood by both the Bank and
ihe DMC concermed, as well as the implications of proposed
changes. If the government’s proposed sectoral policy
reforms, investment plans, and institutional developments
are deemed appropriate for Bank supporl, they are formalized as a government policy statement in a letter from an

3738

appropriate government afficial to the President of the
Bank. This procedure has been found to appropriately
reflect the broad thrust of poticy reforms.

Considering the medium-term nature of sector development and the phasing which the policy adjustment process
requires, sector programs are normally implemented in
distinct stages. The Bank, in must cases, releases program
loans in two tranches, so that il can monitor the program
and expedite its irmplernentation. The release of the second
tranche is determined by the degree to which agreed objectives are allained, Occasionally, however, the key measures
required are iruplemented by the borrowing DMC before the
loan is approved. In such cases, the Bank's loan can be made
available in a single tranche.

While the focus of programs supported by the Bauk is
on medium-term sector objectives, loan proceeds are dis
bursed against secior imporl needs, Eligible imports are
specified on the basis of either a posilive hst or, if the sector
relaies to the entire economy, a negative list.

Loan proceeds are usually allocated by the borrowing
government to importers against the deposit of equivalent
arnounts by them in the local currency. The latter accrue to
the government's account. These resources in local currency, or counterpart funds, may be dedicated for specific
development purposes in the sector supported hy the Bank’s
program. The Bank has been careful in its use ofthis facility,
Dedication is normally related to development expenditures
that are consistent with prograrn objectives and should be
compatible with sound overall budget management,

In contrast with project loans, program loans are typically disbursed against a wide range of commodities spread
over the full spectrum of sector import requirements. The
range of importers, both private and public, is proportionately large, Procurement procedures have been designed
to reflect these characteristics and take account of the
quick-disbursing nature of program lending, while ensuring
that economy and efficiency requirements are met. The
Bank’s policy enables the bulk of procurement under program loans to be governed by normal commercial practice
in the private sector and government guidelines for the
public sector. International competitive bidding is required
only above a threshold set case by case in hight of relevant
country factors.

"These procedures, together with retroactive financing
(normally permitted for procurement made up to 180 days
prior to loan effectiveness) have enabled rapid disbursement
of the Bank’s loans. Of the total amount of the seven
program loans approved from December 1987 to duly
1989, 76 per cent was disbursed within a year of their
becoming effective. This compared with 50 per cent over
the first year in the case of the seven fastest disbursing
project loans in the same countries during the 1980s.

Bank's Record

Since November 1987, when the revised policy came
into effect, the Bank has provided 12 program loans in the
amount of $1.085 billion, compared with 17 such loans for
$580 million in the 10 preceding years (1978-1987)
Salient features of loans made up to 31 December 1989 are.
provided in the accompanying table, As primarily a project
financing institution, the Bank has set a ceiling on program
lending at 15 per cent of its total lending as a three-year
average centered on the current year. The Bank is likely to
hit this ceiling in the near future.

The sharp rise in program lending is a measure of the
DMC3’ response to it as a lending inslrument, It also reflects
the degree Lo which the two way nature of policy dialogue
has been accommodated in program agendas. ‘The Bank has
supported iniportant policy shifts intended to improve incentives and efficiency. At the same time, the pace of reformés a A ethadical and orderly, and has occurred in

Bank’s operations fo acquire a wider scope than would

‘policies and institutions through which they seek to acerate: growth, and Bank support in the preparation and

financing of reform programs in a number of its DMCs has
been an essential element in the adjustment process. By
analyzing sectors, identifying constraints and formulating
adjustment measures, the Bank has come closer to an
understanding of the policy and institutional underpinnings
on which, ultimately, the viabllity of its projects turns. Policy
dialogue rests on a strong foundation, combining the Bank's
perspectives with an appreciation of the realities with which

‘governments contend.

Prograrn lending, in its present form, is relatively new
for ihe Bank. The Bank will evaluate its impact carefully,
together with recipient governments, with a view to refining
its features and enhancing its effectiveness. In the coming
years, the Bank intends to maintain the importarit role that
program lending has come to play in ils operations.

Co-financing rose to $1,273 million from $774 million
in 1988 and the number of projects involving co-financing
increased to 26 from 17 in the same period. Official sources
of co-financing rose 46 per cent to $995 million and their
share of total co-financing decreased to 78 per cenl fromm
88 per cent in 1988. Co-financing from commercial sources
increased to $278 million from $94 million in 1988, or 22
per cent of the total compared with 12 per cent. In the
private sector, co-financing totalling $62 million was
provided under the Bank's Complementary Financing
Scheme. i

Projects approved during 1989 - including credit lines,
program and sector loans ~ had an estimated total cost of
$7.7 billion, of which 37 per cent was to be provided by
borrowing DMCs and 16 per cent by co-financiers.

Local cost financing in 1989 amounted to $812 million
for 31 projects in 10 DMCs. OCR provided $276 million of

this amount, and ADF $536 million, representing 12 per:

cent and 39 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF loans
approved. A year earlier, OCR had provided $226 million
of local cost financing and ADF $338 million, representing
11 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively, of OCR and ADF
loans approved.

The Bank's cumulative public and private sector lending
by the end of 1989 had reached $28.6 billion for 906
projects in 29 DMCs, of which $19 billion was from OCR
and $9.6 billion from ADF, The Bank's equity operations,
which began in 1983, had reached a cumulative total of
$144 million for investments and underwritings by the end
of 1989.

The Bank’s Role in Resource Transfers

Resource flows from the Bank and other multilateral
development institutions have become an Important source
of external funds far DMCs, given constraints on, and
fluctuations from, other sources, Bilateral official flows have
been constrained by budgetary considerations of major
donors and flows from private sources have fluctuated greatly since 1982.

Although flows frorn the Bank are small relative to the
total net flow to DMCs, they have made additional development finance available for the region. The Barik has also
been a catalyst in mobilizing a larger inflow of external
resources to DMCs.

The Bank’s net transfer of resources (disbursements
minus capital repayments and prepayments, payments of
interest and other charges plus equity investments) ta the
DMCs rose 56 per cent to $879 million in 1989. The
increase was due to a significant improvement in Joan
disbursements and equity investments. .

Loan disbursements and equity investments rose by
37 per cent to a record $2,278 million, Several factors
contributed to this. First, there were large undisbursed OCR

loans at the beginning of 1989 as a result of a continuous
increase ir commiiments in recent years. In addition, a
number of loans approved in earlier years reached the stage
of peak disbursement. Secondly, the Bank introduced a wide
range of measures to improve project administration and
facilitate loan. disbursement in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Speeding Up Project Administration, Greater authority has been given to the executing
agencies with respect to project implementation and loan
administration. This includes high thresholds for international shopping and direct purchase. Thirdly, the project implementation capabilities of executing agencies have been
improved through the Bank’s technical assistance for staff
training and country procurement and disbursement seri
nars. Fourthly, the Resident and Regional Offices played an
important role in impreving project admiriustralion and implementation, Finally, there was a sharp increase in the
outflow of quick-disbursing program loans which follow
more flexible procurement and disbursement procedures
than project loans. Disbursements under program loans rose~ ¢9$451 million in 1989 from $191 million a year earlier.
_.« The aggregate net transfer of resources from the ADF
: . increased by 30 per cent to $804 million. This was largely
due to the substantial increase in disbursements and a srnall
amount of principal repayments and service charges arising
from the high grant element of ADF loans.

The net transfer of OCR resources, negative since

. 1986, was reversed in 1989 with a positive net transfer of
$75 million compared with a negative transfer of $53 million
a year earlier.

The Bank’s transfer of resources varied from country
to country, Most ADF-recipient DMCs registered a positive
net transfer of ADF resources in 1989 as a consequence of
the increase in the level of disbursements. The major
recipients of ADF resources were Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and, to a lesser
extent, Lao PDR and Myanmar. Of these, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea and Philippines have access to both
ADF and OCR resources.

There was a significant increase in net transfers of ADF
resources lo Lao PDR, Nepal and Sri Lanka due to the quick
disbursement of agriculture program loans, In contrast, the

advance repayments to the Bank. The negative transfer of
OCR resources to the Philippines declined in-1989 and was

Sectoral Review

In recent years, with the formulation of the Bank's
country strategies, Bank lending has been increasingly
focused on areas in which its resources can be utilized with
maximum effectiveness. Of necessity, sectoral priorities vary
from country to country and, over the years, within individual
DMCs. The sectoral distribution of Bank loans is more often
the outcome of the combined effect of individual country
programs than of a pre-determined allocation. Thus, trends
in this regard are difficult to forecast.

Similarly, the use of the Bank’s loan modalities in
individual sectors can vary. During 1989, for exarnple, all
program lending happeried Lo tuke place in the agriculture
sector, whereas in the previous year such loans were spread

across the industrial, financial and agriculture sectors. Of
seven sector loans in 1989, four went to social infrastructure
and the rest to the highways subsector ard to the energy
seclor. The previous year, three of the seven seclor loans
were for the energy secior wilh the remainder going to
agriculture, social infrastructure and the highways subsector.

The following sectoral review of Bank lending in 1989
is made in the light of the above clarifications.

Agriculture and agro-industry remains the most important sector of Bank operations, accounting for 29 per
cent of cumulative Bank lending and 48 per cent of its
grant-financed technical assistance. The sector's share of
total lending in 1989 rose to over 23 per cent, from 21 per
cent in 1988. In terms of volume, 21 loans totalling $846
million for 18 projects and programs were approved, a 26
per cent increase over $674 million i 1988.

As in the pasi, Bunk lending in 1989 supported the
region’s growth in agricultural production, rural employment
and farm incomes. However, the focus of such lending is
shifting increasingly to agricultural diversification, povertyalleviation and environmental protection. Thus, the agriculture sector portfolio in 1989 included loans and technical
assistance projects for food and secondary crops, fisheries
“neluding. ‘aquaculture, livestock, horticulture, community
forestry, irrigation maintenance and rehabilitation, flood
rotection, Jand use and watershed management.

‘Jn order to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of
agricultural operations, DMCs have been addressing the
poltey and institutional constraints affecting this sector, as
woll'as the structure of producer incentives. The Bank
supported these efforts with program loans totalling $275
million (or 32.5 per cent of total lending to the sector) for
. five. ‘programs in Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea, Philippines,
Srj Lanka and Western Sarnoa. The loans enabled the Bank
‘and the borrowers to initiate imporlant policy reforms and
to improve sector capabilities, while the quick-disbursing
nature of the loans helped to alleviate foreign exchange

" ‘problems. Complementing the program loans were 13 tech* nical assistance projects totalling $3.7 million. These were
designed to strengthen sector institutions and the manage

studies and research, 
The program loans to Lao PDR, Papua New Guinea
and Western Samoa were intended to increase agricultural
productivity and reform and strengthen institutions. The
agriculture program loan to Sri Lanka supported the
Government's agriculture sector development program and
policy reforms aimed at achieving more self-reliance in food
production, increased export crop production and the
promotion of agro-industry. The Fishetles Sector Program
in the Philippines was designed to regenerate coastal
fisheries resources, provide incentives for offshore fishing,
reduce post-harvest losses and strengthen support services.

The Bank continues to give priority to developing and
rehabilitating irrigation facilities to achieve higher agricultural productivity. Four loans were approved for three irrigation and rural development projects in Indonesia, Malaysia
and Pakistan, accounting for 32 per cent of total lending to
the sector. The loan to Pakistan was to mitigate flood
damages, while the construction and rehabilitation of flood

control facilities were included as components of the other
projects.

The Bank provided surie loans for forestry in line with
its focus on the enviromnent and on poverty alleviation. One
loan ta Bangladesh was aimed at increasing biomass fuel
production and enhancing institutional capability for im
plementiny a nationwide social forestry program. A Philip
pine project largeted low-income upland communilies as the
beneficiaries in the rehabilitation and reforestation of eight
major watersheds, One loan to Indonesia, however, was
designed to enhance forest produce.

Agricultural diversification in DMCs is another major
concem of the Bank Thus, Joans to Pakislan and Indonesia
financed the development of livestock and brackishwater
aquaculture, respectively. A Bangladesh project involved
horticulture development, while another in Nepal was aimed
at developing secondary crops. A loan to Sri Lanka was to
revitalize fiveslock, fisheries and other agricultural activities
in areas affected by internal disturbances.

Technical assistance projects approved during the year
were closely related to the sectoral objectives of productivity
and sustainability. Advisory technical assistance projects

  

has

included such fields as forestry sector rnaster plans, pricing
and distribution policies while the multisectoral technical
assistance program loan to Papua New Guinea was aimed
at helping the Government to identify and prepare highpriority projects in important sectors, including agriculture.
The Bank also continued to support agricultural researcli
activities through collaboration with regional and interna
tional agricultural research centers

Lending for the industry and non-fue! minerals sector
fincluding development banks) fell by 8 per cent to $761
million. The focus of Bank lending was on providing credit
to small-scale and medium-scale enterprises. assisting better
absorption of a growing labor force and a more balanced
dispersal of industry. The Bank has also stepped up its direct
assistance to private seclor projects, as these have proven
lo be among the most dynamic elements in DMC
econo nies. ‘

The bulk of Bank financing to this sector conrprised live
credit lines fo Di'ls totalling $705 million (or 19.5 per cent
of total lending compared with 13 per cent in 1988), These
loans ta DFls in India, Indonesia, Pakistan. Philippines and
Tonga were intended lo help finance small-scale and

#medium-scale industrial projects. As in the past, Bank
-agsistarice to FIs should prove an effective means of
supporting industrial ventures that are not large enough to
‘be dealt with directly by the Bank. At the same time, the
‘credit lines should strengthen the financial sectors of the
" DMCs by helping DFls broaden their resource base. Associated iechnical assistance will improve portfolio management and upgrade systems for project appraisal and
‘accountability.

~~ {n jine with the increased focus on private seclor opera:
‘tions, the Bank in 1989 provided loans to eighl privaie
sector projects in this sector, totalling $86 million (up from
three such projects arnounting to $34 million in 1988). ‘The:
Bank assisted manufacturing ventures for fertilizer
» (Pakistan}, cement (Pakistan) and textiles (India, Nepal and
Pakistan). The Bank was also active in assisting firms that
provide financial services to broaden and deepen the financial sectors of DMCs. More than one third of the private
sector lending in this sector went to leasing companies (in
Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan), a relatively new activity in DMCs. Bank support in these cases involved not
only financial resources but also advisory services.

In addition, technical assistance projects totalling $6.7
“million were approved.

The Bank's growing emphasis on issues perlairiing to
living standards and to poverty alleviation contributed to a
“substantial increase in lending for social infrastructure.
‘While the number of projects rose to 12 in 1989 frorn eight
a year earlier, the volume of lending rose by 70 per cent to
- $757 million as a result of lending to jarger DMCs. Consequently, the sector’s share of total lending increased to 21
per cent in 1989 from 14 per cent in 1988, Unlike the
previous year, when five out of eight projects were for the
editcation subsector, in 1989 the Bank's social sector lending was more evenly distributed with four projects each in
wafer supply and sanitation, and in urban development and
housing: three projects in education; and one in healtli and
population. In the water supply and sanitation subsector,
~ the Bank approved five loans for four projects amounting to
$256 million, These included two water supply projects for
“Metro Manila, Philippines, a $130 million loan for increased
supply and a $26.4 million loan to reduce system losses; a
$14.4 million sector loan to Nepal to supply water to about
85 rural communities and to extend supplies for six urban
centers; and an $85 million blended loan to Pakistan to
improve and expand sewerage facilities in Karachi. Ten
technical assistance grants amounting to $3 million were
also approved for this subsector.

In the urban development and housing subsector, the
Bank approved five loans for four projects totalling $220
million, Three of these projects were for urban development
(in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan) and one for lowincome housing in Fiji. The Fiji project provided, for the first
time, funds for a housing finance institution. Thirteen technical assistance projects totalling $5.2 million were apProved for wide-ranging institutional and
project-preparatory support. In addition, an urban sector
Profile was completed for the Philippines.

In the education subsector, the Bank approved three
loan projects totalling $176 million in 1989. The Second
Vocational Education Project in Indonesia and the Technical
Education and Vocational Training in Nepal are aimed at
improving the quality and efficlency of vocational and technical education. The Pramary Education (Girls) Sector Project
in Pakistan is designed to increase educational opportunilies
for girls, in line wilh the Bank’s siress on women in develop:
ment activities. Eleven technical assistance projects totalling
$2.4 million were approved. In addition, placement of
scholars during the academic year 1989-1990 continued
both for the Japan-ADB Scholarship Program, financed by
the Government of Japan for postgraduate studies in
development-related fields, and for the ADB-financed program to award short-term scholarships for skills upgrading
in the South Pacific and other small DMCs.

In the health and population subsector, one sector
loan of $105 million for Malaysia and four technical assistance projects amounting to $1.6 million were approved. In
addition, a contribution was made to a regional seminar on
health insurance. A health and population sector profile for
Bangladesh was also cornpleted.

Bank assistance io ihe energy sector during the year
was focused on the utilization by DMCs of indigenous and,
wherever possible, renewable sources of power generation.
A joan to India financed a thermal power project based on
domestic coal reserves, while projects in Papua New Guinea
and Philippines were designed to develop hydro and
geothermal energy, respectively. Other objectives of Bank
loans to this sector were to help DMCs enhance the efficiency of energy delivery networks, reduce losses in energy
distribution and upgrade the maintenance and operations of
energy facilities. For the firsl time, the Bank financed a
private sector project for power generation {in the
Philippines), which also included the Bank's first equity
investment in the energy sector. In addition, a special
assistance loan lo Nepal financed storage and distribution
facilities for oil products.

‘Yotal Bank jending for the energy sector rose to $605
million-for six projects from $567 million in 1988. However,
the sector's share of total lending declined.to 16.7 per cent
from 18 per cent.

Fourteen technical assistance grants totalling $4.24
million were approved for this sector. These included
projects to evaluate environmental concerns in energy
development in the region, promote energy cooperalion
and strengthen power planning capabilities in lhe region.
One project was to help India prepare ar environmental
management plan for a coal fired power plant.

Lending to the transpor! and communications sector
fell to $586 million from $630 million and its share of total
lending dropped to 16 per cent from 20 per cent in 1988.
As in the previous year, well over half this assistance was
provided for five projects in the highways subsector. The
emphasis was on road improvements and rehabilitation to
meet the substantial traffic growth that has occurred in many
DMCs. Two sector loans — one to Indonesia and the other
to Thatland — were provided during the year while a loan

4748

to Bangladesh for flood damage restoration included a roads
component. The Bank also completed a transport sector
profile of Paisistan during the year.

In addition to the project loans, the Bank approved 14
technical assistance projects amounting to $4.7 million for
project preparation, maintenance and institution-building.
To ensure adequate future maintenance of roads and the
efficient allocation of resources in this subsector, the Bank
has also had extensive policy dialogue with ihe DMC agencies concerned on such matters as the pricing of trarisport
infrastructure and services, and the financing of road con
struction and maintenance budgets.

In the ports, railways and telecommunications subsector, the Bank approved four loans totalling $187 million.
in the telecommuriicatioris subsector, the Bank approved
a $118 million loan to India to provide modern plant and
machinery for the local manufacture of improved cables.
The Bank also approved a $7.4 million loan to Western
Samoa for the rehabilitation and expansion of its telecornmaunications network.

In the railways subsector, a $39.7 million loan was
approved for the construction of the Shanxi-Xiaoliu railway
project in the People’s Republic of China.

In the ports subsector, the Rank approved a $22 million
loan to Indonesia to rehabilitate port facilities in Kalitnantan
and Sulawesi.

In addition, 10 technical assistance projects totalling
$2.8 million were approved for the ports, railways and
telecommunications subsector.

Technical Assistance

Role of Technical Assistance and Its Funding’

Technical assistance activities, which are an integral
part of country programming exercises, play an increasingly
important role in Bank operations. A principal function of
technical assistance is to facilitate the transfer of resources
and technology to the DMCs by helping them identify,
design, formulate, implement and operate development
programs and projects. Technical assistance is also used to
enhance DMC capability to formulate strategies, policies,
prograris and plans to improve the allocation of scarce
domestic and external resources.

Although technical assistance operations will continue
te support these traditional functions, more emphasis will
also be placed on other areas, These include institutional
development; sectoral and issues-oriented studies; the needs
of the less and least-developed DMCs and the small island
DMCs; support for the Bank's evolving operational strateuy;
the Bank’s role as a regional Development Resource Center;
and efforts to improve regional cooperation.

Technical assistance activities are financed by the Bank
through grants, loans or a combination of both. Funding for
yrant financed technical aésistance activities cormes from
voluntary contributions to the Technical Assistance Special
Fund (!ASP) from both developed and developing member

countries; allocations to TASE from ADF V; income from
OCR operations; the Japan Special I‘und (JSF); and grants
from other multilateral and bilateral sources under co-financing and exclusive financing arrangements.

Funding for loan-financed technical assistance comes
from OCR and ADF, ioyether with other multilateral and
bilateral sources under co-financing or exclusive financing
arrangements,

By the end of 1989, a total of $2,107 million in
technical assistance loans and grants had been provided for
2,144 projects, including regional projects. Of this amount,
$420 million had been grant-financed and $1,687 million
loan-financed.: ‘ ,

The importance of technical assistance to the Bank’s
overall lending program is highlighted by the fact that, in
1989, 27 Bank loan projects totalling $1.5 billion resulted
from technical assistance. Of this amount, about $834
million was from OCR and $692 million was from ADF,
representing 37 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, of
OCR and ADF loans approved.

Cumulatively, by the end of 1989, the Bank had
provided project preparatory techriical assistance totalling
$279 million, resulting in 401 Bank loan projects amounting
to $12.5 billion and involving an estimated total investment
cost of $31 billion, Also by the end of the year, the Bank
had approved $1.8 billion for advisory and project implementation technical assistance and $67 raillion in grants
for regional activities.

Grant-Financed Technical Assistance

Technical assistance grants approved by the Bank
(funded by the Bank and other sources) totalled $81 million
for 235 projects, including regional activities, in 1989, This
compared with $59 million for 187 projects approved in
1988 and brought the curnulative total to $420 million. Of
the 1989 total, 65 per cent was provided for advisory and
project implementation purposes, 19 per cent for project
preparation and 16 per cent for regional activities.

Fifty-eight per cent, or $39.5 million, of the total
arnount of technical assistance grants to DMCs went to
countries fully eligible for ADF loans, an increase from 44
per cent in 1988. The increase was mainly due ta ihe
significant increase of technical assistance grants to
countries such as Bangladesh, Lac PDR, Nepal, Sri Lanka
and Western Sarioa.

Regional lechnical assistance grants atiounted te
$12.6 million for 50 prujecls, up from $9.6 million for 44
projects in 1988. During the year, 21,5 per cen of the total
amount! of regional activities went to training; 30.8 per cent
lo studies and workshops; 24.3 per cent to research; 20.5
per cent to conferences and seminars; and 2.9 per cent to
other activities.

Sectorally, agriculture and agro-industry retained the
largest share of grant-financedl technical assistance with 44
per cent, maintaining the same share as a year earlier. This
was followed by social infrastructure with 16 per cent and
others with 12 per cer, compared with 16 per cent and: Technical Assistance By Sector: 1989

Japan Special Fund

in 1989, the Government of Japan contributed the
equivalent of $50.8 million (net of translation adjustments}
to the Japan Special Fund (JSF), an important source of the
Bank’s technical assistance funding,The JSF was established in 1988 after the Bank entered
into a financial arrangement with Japan and agreed to
administer the fund.

‘The objective of the JSF is to help DMCs restructure
their economies and broaden their scope of new investment
opportunities, assisting the recycling of funds to DMCs. The
JSF supports DMC efforls towards industrialization, natural
and human resources development and technology transfer.

The {und is used to finance or co-finance technical
assistance projecls, on a grant basis, whether in the public
or private sector, including project preparation, advisory
services and regional activities; and, in special cases and on
a grant basis, technical assistance components of public
sector development projects financed under loans from the
Bank.

Other Sources of Technical Assistance Grants

As in previous years, the Bank was able to secure
funding from other sources to supplernent its grant resources
(mainly Technical Assistance Special Fund and OCK income) for lechnical assistance operations. Such financing —
either on an exclusive or co-financed basis — was provided
for technical assistance activities in which the Bank acted as
the executing agency. The United Nations Development
Programme was an important source of funds, providing
$10.1 million for eight technical assistance projects. corr
pared with $9.2 inillion lor 12 projects a year earlier, Other

sources inchided bilateral agencies such as the Danish
Intemational Development Agency, the Finnish International
Development Agency and the Governments of Netherlarids,
Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Such financing is available
on an ad hec basis and depends on the agencies’ or
governments’ interest in the areas covered by the Bank
technical assistance.

In 1989, such financing amounted to $12.7 million, or
16 per cent of all technical assistance grants approved
during the year, compared with $12.3 million, or 2] per
cent, in 1988. Of this, $7.4 million for six projects was
provided on an exclusive financing basis and $5.3 million
for eight projects was for co-financing with the Bank or the
Japan Special Fund.

Also during the year, an untied French fund of $10
million was established to finance technical assistance operations of the Bank, A similar fund, to be financed by the
Finnish Government, was under discussion,+

Education, Training and
Institutional Development

The Bank has assisted its DMCs establish effective and
efficient education systems for almost two decades. In 1988,
the Bank established a new education séctor policy under
which, as described in the sector paper Education and
Development in Asia and the Pacific, education is viewed
as both a human need and a human right as well as a
corporient of socio economic development,

The new education sector policy goes beyond a narrow
rationale based on manpower requirements to a broader
approach responsive to the demand far general literacy and
education and to the need for specialized manpower

This was reflected in the Primary Education (Girls)
Sector Project approved during the year far Pakistan. The
project supports the Government's goal of increasing educational opportunities for girls and is the Barik’s firsl venture
at this level of education.

The other lwo prujecls approved in 1989, the Second
Vocational Education Project in Indonesia and the Technical
Education and Vocational Training in Nepal, are designed
to help the governments improve the quality and efficiency

“of vocational and technical education.

Cumulatively, Bank loans to the education subsector
had reached $1.2 billion for 39 projects as of end-1989

Some of the 11 technical assistance grants, totalling
$2.4 million, approved for the education subsector during
the year also mirrored the new policy direction. Examples
include the Non-Formal Education Project in the Philippines
and the Open University Project in Bangladesh.

Four technical assistance grants, including three
regional projecis, were lo assist DMCs formulate policies
and strategies for the education and) training subsector,
Examples include the Education Sector Study in Lao PDR

tohelp the Government formulate ar education master plan
and the Round Table Conference of South Asian Member
Countries on Distance Education held in Pakistan.
Cumulatively, the Bank had provided technical assistance grants totalling $15.3 million for 68 projects in the
education subsector by end-1989.
During the year, the Bank also provided financing

_ amounting to more than $30 million for education and

training components of projects in other sectors.

For example, in the agriculture sector, training components amounted lo $7.7 million for the Agricultural
Rehabilitation Project in Sri Lanka and $6.7 million and
$5.4 million, respectively, for the Second Brackishwater

       

Aquaculture Development Project and the Nusa Tenggara
Agriculture Development Project, both in Indonesia.

In the power sector, the Bank provided technical assistance totalling $85,000 and $198,000, respectively, to
train staff under the Rayalaseema Therma! Power Project in
india and at the Electricité du Laos in Lao PDR.

For institutional-strengthening purposes, the Bank
provided technical assistance grants of $290,000 and
$328.000 tothe Development Bank of Hiji and the Development Bank of Tonga, respectively.

The Bank provided seven other technical assistance
grants, two of them regional in scope, to train DMC officials
in different fields, These included four grants for training in
the management of foreign aid and domestic resources.

Scholarship Programs

During its second year of irmplementation (1989/1990),
the Japan-ADB Scholarship Program financed by the
Government of Japan saw GO new scholarships awarded and
41 scholarships renewed. The scholars carne from 13 DMCs.
The Government of Japan provided $1.4 million, double the
amount provided during the first year, Eleven regional institutions known for their research and teaching capability in
maragement and technology are participating in the program. These are the Asian Institute of Management and the
international Rice Research Institute in the Philippines; the
Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand, the East-West
Center in Hawaii; the Lahore University of Management
Sciences in Pakistan; the International University of Japan
and the University of Tokyo in Japan; the University of
Sydney in Australia; the Indian Institute of Technology in
Delhi; the National University of Singapore; and the Universily of Hong Kong,

The ADB-financed Scholarship Program tor Smaller
DMCs, a $300,000 regional technical assistance, spon
sored short-term training courses for 31 governmentnominated individuals from 11 DMCs. These are Bhutan,
Lao PDR, Maldives and the eight South Pacific DMCs of
Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Solomon
Islands, ‘Tonga, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.

Country Strategies and Policy Dialogue

The Bank continued to emphasize country strategy
studies as the basis for its operations during the year. The
strategy studies examine the DMCs' economic and social
siluation and provide a framework for Bank assistance. They
also take into account concerns such as poverty alleviation,
environmental proleclion and the role of women in development,

New country strategy sludies were cormpleted during the
year for Bangladesh, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and
Western Samoa and were slarted and are ongoing for
Bhutan, People’s Republic of China, Fiji, India, Pakistan,
Solomon Islands and Tonga. In 1990, it is intended to carry
oul a strategy study for Lao PDR and revise the study onMalaysia. Work will continue on slrategy studies for some of
the smaller South Pacific DMCs,

An important aspect of country strategy ts policy
dialogue, which enables the Bank to improve its operations
and the policy environment in the DMCs. During 1989,
policy issues were discussed mainly in the financial, agriculture and energy seclurs. The improvernent of financial
miarlagement, including cost recovery schernes, was emphasized in policy dialogue.

The financial sector program loan provided to
indonesia in 1988 has resulted in successful policy reform
packages in the banking system and securities market. A
similar policy reform-based program is under consideration
for the Philippines. In the agriculture sector, discussions
centered on the food crops area in Indonesia, the Agriculture
Sector Program in Papua New Guinea and the Agriculture
Development Program in Western Samoa, In Fiji, lhe
dialogue included the abolition of agricultural input subsidies,
the introduction of production and export incentives and the
strengthening of sector institutions. In Pakistan's energy
sector, a key issue under discussion is the mobilization of
additional resources through appropriate pricing and load
managernent techniques.

Private Sector Assistance Activities

In the past, Bank assistance to the private sector was
provided, under government guarantee, through credit lines

to development finance institutions (DF ls} and sector and
program loans to the industrial‘and financial sectors. These
continue to be impertant for the Bank.

Several DMC governments, faced with resource constraints and ta speed up economic develapment, gave a
larger role to the private sector by liberalizing their
economies and financial systems and by opening up new
areas of investinenl, The Bank has responded, since 1982,
with a program of direcl assistance, without governmenl
guarantee, to the private sector. This program has gained
momenturn in the past three years and is expected to play
an increasingly significant role in future.

The Bank supports private sector enterprises in three
main ways. It offers credit tines under government guarantee
and through local DFis. It makes direct investments by way
of equity and debt instruments without government guarantee, The Bank also gives technical assistance to governments
to develop capital market and industrial policies and to
strengthen capital market institulions. Technical assistance
is also provided on request to help governments in their
privatization efforts,

In 1989, Bank tending to private sector enterprises,
under government guarantee and through DFls, rose 80 per
cent to $705 million for five projects from $392.5 million,
also for five projects, a year earlier,

A $100 million credit line for the Philippines is designed
to develop small-scale and rnediumrscale industries, This
project also includes a technical assistance grant to
strengthen the participating financial institutions and to

The Bank continued its policy of providing training to
staff of DMC financial institutions. It arranged regional
seminars on investrnent banking and a seminar on project
appraisal aimed at the South Pacific.

Rehabilitation Assistance

Faced with increasingly disruptive effects of natural and
man-made disasters on economic development in the
DMCs, the Board in 1989 formalized a policy on
rehabilitation assistance. The need for a rapid response is
stressed to minimize interruptions, Rehabilitation projects
will be focused on re-establishing services in key infrastructure sectors, Close coordination of rehabilitation efforts will
be sought on national and international levels. This policy
decision was followed by a technical assistance grant for a
regional study to promote disaster prevention, mitigation
and preparedness as ‘an integral part of development planning in the DMCs.

ADF Eligibility and Access

The Board decided that fhe access of People’s Republic
of China and India to ADF V resources should be further

Domestic resource constraints and debt-service burdens
continued to have a restraining effect on commercial
co-financing activities in the public sector. In addition, international commercial banks have been actively reducing their
exposure to developing countries, especially in the public
sector. However, projects which are traditionally altractive
to commercial co-financiers — such as those relating to power
and energy, industry and financial service institutions » were
commercially co-financed in 1989, five of which were in the
private sector, In the public sector, where mast of the
co-financing came from official sources, there were seven
co-financed projects in the agriculture and agro-industry
sector, five in the transport and communications sector, four
in the social infrastructure sector, two in the development
barks and mdustrial sectors. one in the energy sector, one
involving addilional co-financing for 11 ongoing Rankassisted projects i: various sectors and one invdlving a
financial sector prouram loan, which was commercially
co-financed, Given the DMCs’ increasing emphasis on involving the private seclor Lo gererate economic growth, the
Bank expects co-financing arrangements in this sector to
increase significantly over the next few years. The Bank's
commitment to assisting private sector development in the
DMCs was reflected in 1989 by the close relationship with
the Asian Finance and Investment Corporation Ltd. (AMC)
In 1989, under the Bank's Complementary Financing
Scheme (CFS). AFIC co-financed four projects with contributions amounting to $39 million56

Bilateral sources such as the Overseas Economic
Couperation Fund of Japan, the untied yen facility channelled through the Export-Import Bank of Japan and the
Governments of Switzerland and United Kingdom continued
to be tapped for co-financing, providing $651 milllon for 15
projects, Multilateral sources — the International Finance
Corporation, the Islamic Development Bank, the International Telecommunications Union, the OPEC Fund for
Intemational Development, the United Nations Developtnent Programme and the World Bank - - provided $344
million for 12 projects.

With continuing economic growth expected in the
DMCs during 1990s, co-financing from export credit and
commercial sources should increase, especially since new
private sector projects and energy, power and industrial
public sector projects have been identified. These trends are
reflected in the Bank's more active role in offering Ilexible
co-financing schemes and financial structuring for private
and public sector projects in DMCs. This should help to
overcome the concerns of commercial co-financiers about
asset quality.

The use of the Bank's CFS will continue to be the
primary modality in commercial co-financing arrangements
in both the public and private sectors. The benefits of the
CES to both DMCs and participating co-financiers are well
demonstrated and the scheme is finding increasing acceptance, It also opened up new sources of financing in 1989
through the lirst participation in the scheme by a nonfinancial corrmercial institution in a private sector project in
Pakistan. This should open up business opportunities for
DMCs with the international business community,

Guarantee Operations

The Bank's guarantee facility was used for the first time
during the year in Indonesia and the results ware successful
and beneficial to both the borrower and participating cofinanciers, Guarantee operations can be used in parallel with
co financing arrangements or in conjunction with the Bank's
Coraplementary Financing Scheme (CFS). Discussions with
cormmercial co-financiers and markel reaction indicate that
co-financing with the Bank's guarantee offers DMCs better
terms, particularly longer maturities, than commercial institutions. Where CFS is used with guarantee operations,
maturity periods have been extended beyond the normal
market even before the Bank guarantee has been applied,
thus further leveraging the use of the guarantee. Such
co-financing will help ease DMC debt-service profiles in their
coramercial borrowings.

Economics and Develapment Resource
Center Activities

The Economics and Development Resource Cenier
(EDRC) serves a number of functions, FDRC urtcderiakes
research on problems and policies of economic develop
ment, particularly on macroeconomic issues, as well as
topics related to project and sector work and issues concern:
iny methodologies for the econornic evaluation of projects.
EDRC is also responsible for the collection of socioeconomic data and the development and maintenance of a
Bankwide data hase, EDRC further serves as the focal point
for the Bank’s regional Development Resource Center activities, organizing seminars and workshops to discuss
development issues and making a major contribution lo the
Bank’s publications effort.

In addition to carrying out project-specific and
methouological research during the year, the Bank provicied
technical assistance to support research into several policyrelated Issues of regional and country specific importance.

EDRC organized three Round Table meetings during
the year, bringing together DMC officials from various
sectors, including government, and Bank staff to address
special issues. These were the Kound Table on
Development Strategies in January, the Round Table on
the Role of Newly Industrializing Economies in Asian
Development in March and the Development Round Table
on the Sociveconomic Policies for Poverty Alleviation in
October.

During 1989, the Bank published several new titles.
These may be found at the back of this Reporl under the list
of Major ADB Publications. The Asian Development
Outlook, the first of an annual report series, was launched
during the year. The publication provides a broad view
of economic progress in the Bank's roajor DMCs and
an analysis of short term and medium-term econotnic
prospects.

During the year, the Bank initiated the Special Second:
menl Scheme for mid-level DMC officials to undergo training
at the Bank,

The Bank also sponsored two lectures under its Distinguished Speaker series

Environmental Planning and Management

Recognizing the importance of the environmental
dimension in socio-economic development, the Bank
upgraded the Environment Unit to Division status, effective
from April 1989, The move included provision for additional
staff.

‘The Bank introduced several initialives during the year
to strengthen its environmental and natural resources planning and management activities. These included integrating
environmental considerations into program Jending and

* country programming exercises: supporting the implemen
tation of the World Commission on Environment and
Development’s (Brundtland Commission) recommendations
in selected DMCs; enhancing the environmental dimension
of traditional sectoral projects through piggy-backed Lechnical assistance grants; and supporting global issues such as
biodiversity and climate change.

The Bank now integrates environmental considerations
into all its programs anid projects, Environmental issues areSOIL erosion is a cammon enuironmental problem In the
Philippines, The Bank-assisted Forestry Sector Program

includes planting soil-binding trees on mauntain slapes,

taken into account at every stage of a project cycle from
identification and formulation through to implementation,
completion and post-evaluation.

For the future, the Bank is seeking to strengthen the
integration of environmental considerations into country
economic and sector work; develop programs for imPlementing minimum quality criteria for ecologically-sensitive areas; implement the Brundtland Commission study;
incorporate environmenial risk assessment into project appraisal; apply the geographic information system to the
management of environmental and natural resources; and
further address environtnental issues relating to eneray
development. In addition, the Bank seeks to strengthen
environmental and related line agencies, continue its ac
 

tivities as a resource center and further develop strategies
for biodiversity management in selected Asian countries.

During the year, specific atterition was paid to
strengthen environmental considerations in Bank lean
projects, particularly in sector and development finance
institution projects.

Technical assistance projects which were piggy-backed
onto loans in 1989 were usually focused on institutional
strengthening and providing a suitable policy environment.
Projects to strengthen institutions and/or establish environmental units in ministries or departments have been
completed in, or are planned for, Bangladesh, Fiji, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Vanuatu
and Western Samoa,

Regarding the dissemination of information, the Bank
has increased awareness of environmental considerations
internally through project-by-project contact and informal
discussions and in 1989 held in-house seminars and
workshops on environmental techniques and analysis in
Bank projects. A computerized information retrieval systern
was initiated during the year for country environmental and
natural resources profiles, generic guidelines, environmental
and pollution control documents and references.

Externally, the Bank continues to keep finance ministries and national environmental protection agencies informed of proposed projects which have major
environmental concerns. Policy dialogue was initiated with
DMCs to explore environmental projects for financing and
to integrate environmental considerations into sector lending strategy exercises.

The Bank strengthened ties with nurrierous bilateral and
multilateral organizations dealing with environmental issues
during the year.

One important technical assistance grant approved in
1989 was for a regional stuck) aimed at translating the
recommendations of the Brundtland Commission into
country-specific programs for DMCs. Country stuclies will be
carried out in Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal,
Pakistan, Philippines ‘and Sri Lanka and related Bank
policies will be reviewed.

In recognition of the important role of environmental
NGOs in socio-economic developmert, a meeting was held
in June between selecied environmental NGOs and Bank
staff to promote greater involvement of environmental
NGOs in DMCs. NGOs are increasingly used in Bank
projects (for further elaboration on the role of NGOs, refer
to the earlier there chapter on Cooperation with NGOs).
The Bank also hosted the Tenth Meeting of the Committee
of International Development Institutions on the Lnvironment in <ine.

Women in Development

Since the Board’s approval of a policy paper on The
Role of Women in Development in 1985, the Bank has
sought to increase efforts to provide women with opportunities to develop their potential and ta improve their share

5758

of the benefits of development such as better educational
and employment opportunities

During 1989, the Bank incorporated women in
development (WID) considerations into the formulation arid
implementation .of some projects. Steps were taken to
ensure that women receive tangible benetits, including training, extension services and employment opportunities, in a
number of projects.

During the year, the Bank approved its first loan which
exclusively targeted women as beneficiaries. The Primary
Education {Girls} Sector Project in Pakistan will finance the
construction of physical infrastructure, training of female
teachers and innovative activities to tackle socio-cultural
constraints against girls’ schoo] enrolment and attendance.
Under the Fisheries Sector Program in the Philippines, also
approved during the year, the courilerpart fund was ear
marked for providing iraining, extension and livelihood
developinert programs for women and for establishing a
related database. Women will also be the major beneficiaries
of the Low-Income Upland Communities Project in the
Philippines.

According to Bank WID policy, the role and needs of
women should be taken into account at every stage of the
project cycle, especially during feasibility studies. In 1989,
consultants examined project-specific WID issues and, based
on their findings, some projects will be aimed at providing
wornen with benefits such as credil, education and incomegenerating schemes.

The Bank focused on women as exclusive beneficiaries
in a regional activity when it organized a seminar on
"Women and Water" during the year. Women’s agencies,
rather than water agencies, participated in the serninar. Pilot
self-help family water supply and sanitation projects are
expected to result frarn the seminar’s findings and recommendations.

Another regional technical assislance grant approved
in 1989 was designed to improve inanagemednt and employ
nent skills of woinen through training programs organized
by grassroots NGOs,

WID considerations were incorporated into the Bank's
poverty alleviation projects and its sectoral and operational
strategies during the year. WID Country Briefing Papers
were also prepared for Bhutan, Malaysia and Pakistan to
help staff identify and incorporate WIN issnes into country
operations.

The Bank hekl the first in-house Lraining seminar to
promote staff awareress of WID consideralions in 1989,

Poverty Alleviation

After the Governers called for a sharper focus on
poverty alleviation at the Bank's Twenty-First Annual Meeting in 1988, the Bank established an internal Task Force on
poverty alleviation. The, Task Force recommended that the
Bank, as well as continuing its traditional growth-oriented
proj which eventually benefil the poor, should alse adopt
specifically poverty-orienled projecls. These are defined as

 

projects which have a direct positive impact on the poor
such as increasing incame and employment opportunities,
meeting basic needs and enhancing the quality of life.

The Task Force suggested a dual approach to the
problem. On one hand, the Bark should pay more attention
te poverty issues during the formulation and implementation
of traditional projects. On the other hand, the Bank should
supplement this approach with projects specifically designed
to alleviate poverty. These include social infrastructure and
environmental projects as well as those designed to increase
incomes through self-employment (especially through minidevelopment finance institutian credits} and wage employment (for example, public works programs). The Task Force
also suggested that the Bank should provide greater support
lu DMC programs and policies for poverly alleviation,
including sector development/adjustment programs for sectors such as health and education,

Recognizing the differences between poverty alleviation
projects and traditional projects, the Bank has adopted a
cautious approach, conducting talks with governments,
NGOs and other grassroots organizations, and noting the
experience of bilateral and other multilateral donor agencies.

During 1989, the Bank took several steps to enhance
its poverty alleviation efforts. Principally, it identified
projects and project components which directly address Lhe
needs of poor beneficiaries, In the agriculture and rural
development sectors, the Bank approved four projects
which are aimed at increasing the incomes of the poor and
helping them form and strengthen self-helo groups. ‘These
are the Second Brackishwater Aquaculture Development
Project in Indonesia, the Semarak Rural Development
Project in Malaysia and the Fisheries Sector Program loan
and the 1.ow-Income Upland Communities Project, both in
the Philippines.

The projects are aimed at reducing rural or urban
poverty by introducing policy measures and providing in
fraslructure facilities and production supporl services to
create income-generating activities tor target groups. All are
located in less developed areas,

‘The projects are intended to ensure that benefits reach
specific groups such as small-scale farmers, landless
laborers, poor fishermen, upland tribal communities, urban
poor and destitute women, Organizing communities,
forming and strengthening self-help groups, developing
cooperatives, resource management and the provision of
basic social services are important elements in the Bank's
integrated approach. Most projects contain a mini-credit
component for eslablishing and running cottage industries,
ticro-erilerprises or other livelihoad projects. These require
inodest capital infusion and lechnolouy, rely on jocal raw
materials and are labor-intensive, They also involve NGO
participation

In the infrastructure sector, three loans were approved
which wold meet the specific needs of the poor and requite
substantial grassroots participation during implementation.
These are the Secand Water Supply Sector Project in Nepal
and the Primary Education (Girls) Sector Project and the
Second Urban Developrnent Project. both in Pakistan. Inanother loan, for the Angat Water Supply Optimization
Project in the Philippines, there is a component to provide
standpipes for squatter areas in Metro Manilla.
The Bank also approved a number of technical assis_- tance projects during the year to help prepare proposed
"projects dealing with women's employment, primary education and health and family planning in Bangladesh, smallscale farmers’ development in Nepal and smallholders’
development in the Philippines
_. * In addition, the Bank is focusing on poverty issues in its
economic and sector work and in its training program. More
attention is being given to identifying such issues and dis~ cussing them with government officials. The Bank organized

“: in-Oetober the Seventh Round Table at Beijing with the

theme "Socio-Economic Policies for Poverty Alleviation."
_ This provided a better understanding of the causes of poverty

. in the region and of how to improve the capabilities of DMC
” officials in adopting poverty alleviation policies and strategies

and in avoiding the negative social consequences of the
_ adjusiment process. The Bank also initiated a regional technical assistance project on “Priority' Issues and Policy
Measures to Alleviate Poverty” which will analyze rural
poverty in Asia. ,

Aid Coordination

The Bank actively seeks to cooperate with bilateral and

’ - multilateral aid agencies in its DMCs to pool resources,

expertise and experiences and to ensure that activities are
complementary,

The Eleventh ADB-World Bank Coordination Meeting
was organized to coincide with the Barik's Twenty-Second
Annual Meeting in Beijing in May. The President attended
the Development Committee Meeting and Heads of Multilateral Financial Institutions Meeting in Washington, D.C. in
September.

-. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
continued fo be an important source of grant assistance for
the Bank's lending and technical assistance operations. The
Bank was represented al the UNDP Governing Council
Meeting and Inter-Agency Consultative Meeting.

The Bank continued to take part in a nurober of aid
group meetings where aid agencies meet with government
representatives to discuss economic and social develop’
ments in DMCs, external financing and coordination. In
addition, the: Bank's Resident Offices in Bangladesh and
Indonesia and Regional Office in Vanuatu participated in
theetings with various aid agencies to exchange views on
programs and coordinate project-related activities. In the
South Pacific, the Bank also has a cuoperative arrangement
with.the World Bank for project co-financing.

The Bank’s establishment of new Resident Offices in
Pakistan and Nepal in 1989 is expected to strengthen aid
coordination efforts in these countries.

«=» Annual consultations continued during the year with
concerned bilateral and multilateral institutions and guvern
Ments,

The Bank's Role in the 1990s

To prepare itself for the coming decade, the Bank had
commissioned a study of its future operational strategies and
policies in the light of the evolving requirements of its DMCs.
The study was undertaken by an external Panel of eminent
experts, assisted by two senior consultants, During the
course of their work, Panel members met with the Governors and exchanged views with the Board, management and
staff. The Panel Report, The Asian Development Bank tn
the 1990s, was presented to the Bank in January 1989 and
was extensively discussed during the year.

‘The Panel's recommendations covered the range of
Bank activities and emphasized both priorities and operational policy modifications. The priorities included social
infrastructure (expanding Bank lending to the social sector,
especially for public health and education); poverty allevia
tion (giving emphasis to social infrasiructure inveslments
which have a direct impact on living standards of the poor,
examining the impact of all projecis on the peor, and paying
special attention to the employment aspect); and protection
of the environment (minimizing environmental risks in all
projects, undertaking projecis to directly improve the environment and assisting DMCs in environmental policy
formulation). The Panel also recommended that the Bank
take a much more active role in helping to promote the
private sector, directly and indirectly, in those DMCs that
wish to do this. To increase the Bank's competence in this
area, the Panel suggested the establishment of an affiliate
en the lines of the International Finance Corporation of the
World Bank group or the creation of a separate department
within the Bank for private sector operations, Broadening
and strengthening of the Bank's policy dialogue with DMCs
was another priority. The operational policy modifications
recommended by the Panel relaled to improvements in
project appraisal and implementation techniques; Bank
operations in the field of population through public education and health prujecis; technical assistance in support of
new priorities; extension of eligibility of DMCs to the Bank's
ADF resources; active participation in donor coordination;
expansion of the Bank’s co-financing activities; financial
innovations in Bank operations, need to intensify Bank
efforts to foster regional cooperation; and Bank assistance
to micro DMCs. The Panel noted that the benefit of its
recommendations would be enhanced by an increase in ADF
resources in the 1990s and that a significant reorganization
of the Bank’s structure and a strengthening of staff may also
be required.

The Report was exarnined by Governors at the Bank's
Twenty-Second Annual Meeting in May, The Report was
also considered by the Board of Directors at an informal
session in March and later in a series of seminars in May and
June.

The Board endorsed the Panel's recommendations in
bread terms. It instructed the management to prepure
detailed recommendations on several issues covered, tncluding health and population, the Bank's environmental activities and its private sector operations.

59in Bangladesh. The Bank has assisted the power sector with 10 loans totalling
$511.7 million.: Introduction

‘WITH the aim of employing its limited resources in sectors
and activities which best serve the needs of its developing

member countries (OMCs),! the Bank continued in 1989 to
develop country studies with medium-term operational
strategies for assistance. In addition, major policy issues are
frequently the basis of policy dialogue between DMCs and
@ Bank and such discussions can contribute to appropriate
jlicy development.

Bangladesh

 

- -Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational
~ strategy for Bangladesh, which was revised hy the Board in
1989, follows a multi-sectoral approach covering agriculture, energy, industry, transport and social services, The
main emphasis is on agriculture, which is the crucial element
for growth and poverty alleviation, followed by industry,
which is expected to stimulate other productive sectors, The
Bank's program also supports major policy and institutional
~ reforms and looks at environmental issues and the role of
women in developrnent. This sectoral approach is consistent
with the Government's Third Five-Year Plan (FY19861990}, the thrust of which is being carried forward into the
Fourth Five-Year Plan (FY1991-1995).

In the Bank’s program for Bangladesh, agriculture,
Including forestry, has the highest priority. The objective is
2 fo increase food and-non-food crop production through
expanded and improved irrigation facilities, inputs and sup‘port services, including credit. Employment generating
“schemes are being promoted and small and cottage industries are encouraged to alleviate rural poverty. In the
industrial sector, the primary concern is to promole private
investments through developmen! financing institutions
{DFis), and program lending is enyphasized to support policy
* reforms.

COUNTRY ACTIVITIES

With regard to energy and transporiation, projects to
utilize natural gas and newly-discovered coal resources will
continue to receive assistance, as will projects to generate,
transmit and distribute power. Bangladesh's existing
transport infrastructure -- comprising roads, rallways and
bridges — is considered inadequate and the Bank will continue to assist its improvement.

Responding quickly to mitigate human distress resulting
from natural disasters remains another Bank priority in
Bangladesh. In the social sectors, the primary aim is to
develop human resources through better education and rural
training facilities, provide safe drinking water, improve
sanitation and upgrade the environment.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank is concerned that development programs in Bangladesh should not entail costly subsidies, explicit or implicit. The objective is adequate pricing
and payment for government goods and services which

also seeking to enhance the efficiency of the economic
system, enlarging the scope of market forces and the private
sector, Likewise, the organization and implementation of
development projects and improved utilization of existing
capacity are emphasized. Other issues being pursued by the
Bank include the need to revitalize the rural credit subsector,
derequlate the irrigation subsector; improve the implementation, and reduce the backlog, of ongoing water resource
development schemes; and formulate and implement an
institutional financial system for the maintenance of rural
infrastructure. In the transport sector, the major issues being
addressed include the respective roles of roads, railways and
inland waterways; structural reforms to generate internal
resources lo maintain and manage transpert systems; and
the formulation of rational pricing policies to promote faster
growth. .

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending to
Bangladesh in 1989 amounted to $338 million for six loans,
all from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). Two projects
were in agriculture and one each in energy, transport,
industry and non-fuel minerals, and urban development
This compared with $268 million for six projects in 1988
Five projects received local currency financing, which
totalled $136.14 million. Co-financing totalled
$103 million.

project is designed to benefit underprivileged communities
in rural areas who would receive access to land through
controlled farming as well as most of the final products
grown under the project. The Horticulture Development
Project is to enhance the know-how and institulional

make the delivery/extension of services more cost-effective.

The Dhaka Urban Infrastructure Improvement Project '
will benefit several hundred thousand low-income dwellers
in Mirpur, a suburb of Dhaka, through improved municipal
services such as water supply, sanitation, solid waste
management, road and street lighting, and market and

about 40 hectares for some 5,000 fully-serviced residential
plots and 700 small-scale commercial and industrial plots,

The Eighth Power Project will provide additional power

operational and financial efficiency of the executing agency.

The Second Flood Damage Restoration Project (Roads
and Railways) will speed up the repair and reconstruction of
high-priority roads and raihways systems damaged by the
1988 floods.

Fifteen technical assistanée grants ammounting to $8.4
million were approved in 1989. Five of them were advisory
in nature while the rest were for project preparation,

As of the end of 1989, the Bank had approved 85 loans
to Bangladesh, amounting to $2,798 million for 77 projects.
Of this amount, $11.4 million was from ordinary capital
resources (OCR) and $2,787 million from ADF. In the same
period, $55 million had been approved in technical assistance for 112 projecis, of which 42 had resulted in Bank
loans,

Project Implementation; Of the 85 loans approved
for Bangladesh as of end-1989, 36 had been closed and 49
were under administration. By year-end, one loan had not
yet become effective. Contracts worth $296 million were
awarded during the year, bringing the cumulative total to
$1,567 million. This was 57 per cent of the net effective
loan amount. Disbursements totalled $322 million, against
$226 million in 1988. This brought the cumulative amount
of disbursements to $1,392 million, or 50 per cent of the
total net effective loan amount.

The strong growth in disbursements in recent years
reflects the closer attention paid by ihe Government and
executing agencies to project implementation. Earlier
government actions in streamlining procedures for releasing
local funds, adopting imprest accounts for suitable projects
and giving officers of externally-funded projects more
authority greatly helped to improve the absorption of Bank
loans.‘The Bangladesh Resident Office in Dhaka continued to
4 dosely with the Government and its executing agenice. The constant information flow helped both sides take
finch corrective actlons. The Bank continued to undertake
a projects review missions to discuss implementation
sroblems and cross-sectoral issues, A procurement seminar

Policy Dialogue: Discussions were mainly concerned
with institutional changes in the Ministry of Agriculture and
the Department of Trade and Industry, which were the focus
of technical assistance projects that were substantially completed during the year. A forestry sector meeting in Thimphu
jooked at donor coordination and sector status, on which
the Bank's forestry master plan will be based. Future policy

totalling $400,000 were approved. To date, the Bank has
provided Bhutan with $31.6 million in eight loans and $9.3
million in technical assistance for 30 prolects. A country
strategy study for Bhutan is expected to be finalized in 1990.

Project Implementation: All the eight loans to
Bhutan approved as of end-1989 were under administration. Contracts worth $1.5 million had been awarded during
the year, bringing the cumulative total to $14.6 million,
which was 41 per cent of the net effective loan amount.
Disbursements totalled $3.1 million, against $3.5 million in
1988. The cumulative amount of disbursements stood at
$12.8 million, or 36 per cent of the total net effective loan
amount.

Project implementation in 1989 was characterized by
a slow start in some recent projects and continuing delays
in some of the older ones. This resulted in a lower volume
of contracts awarded and a slower pace of disbursements
than in 1988, Government officials’ unfamiliarity with Bank
procedures and a shortage of qualified manpower were the
major constraints, The Bank continued to address the problem through technical assistance projects.

China, People’s Republic of

Operational Strategy: ‘The thrust of the Bank's
strategy is to support the key sectors that will help the

People’s Republic of China (PRC) achieve its long-term 
objective of quadrupling the gross value of its industrial and
agricultural output and thereby raise the living standards of
its people, .

The strategy takes into consideration the size of the
country, the terms of the Bank's lending and the Governunent’s
development objectives and priorities. Since 1987, it has
emphasized the improvement of infrasiructure, the develop
. ment of energy resources and the upgrading of industries

producing scarce raw materials. Assistance to manufacturing, in particular, has been designed ta modernize and

expand the production capacities of key raw material indusiries. The effort in the infrastructure area has been to
remove botilenecks and particularly to improve the operational and administrative efficiency of the power and
transport sectors. In addition, through its technical assistance program, the Bank seeks to upgrade the technical and
administrative skills of major institutions and agencies
engaged in the country’s development tasks. Geographically, the Bank wall focus on the eastern region while considering high-priority projects in other regions on a case-by-case
basis.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank's policy dialogue in the
PRC has so far been conducted mainly in relation to project
specific assistance. The idea is to better apprise the Government of the developrnent perspectives relating to particular
sectors and thus accelerate policy reforms and institutional
improvements. In the industrial sector, issues relating to the
efficiency and productivity of various enterprises, the pricing
policy on their inputs and outputs, and generally the upgrading of industry were addressed. Pricing issues also marked
discussions on the development of physical infrastructure,
mainly to allow for optimal planning and capacity usage. In
the eneray sector, rationalization of tariffs was sought in
order to keep energy projects viable and encourage eneray
conservation.

Loans and Technical Assistance: The Bank approved a $39.7 million joan from OCR for the ShanxiXiaoliu Railway Project in January 1989. This brought its
cumulative lending to the PRC to $456 million.

By the end of 1989, loan negotiations had been
completed for five projects totalling $423 million. Two were
for the industrial sector to step up steel and acrylic fiber
production, two were credit lines for agribusihess and industrial enterprises and one was for a railway project in
Guangdong. :

Six technical assistance projects totalling $3.6 million
were approved, Three project preparatory technical assisfarive grants were for the development of water resources

projects.

Project Implementation: All seven loans approved
for the PRC by the end of 1989 were under administration.
Contract awards amounted to $83 million, bringing the
cumulative value of awards to $108 million, or 27 per cent
of the net effective loan amount, Disbursements increased to
$52 million from $3 million in 1988, and cumulative disbursements stood at $55 million, or 14 per cent of the total amount
of net effective loans.

All projects are in the initial stage of implementation.
A country procurement seminar was held to enhance the
project implementation capabilities of executing agencies.

Private Sector Investment Management: One line
of equity had been approved in the PRC as of the end of
1989.

Fiji

Operational Strategy: The Government's economic
program is aimed at restoring private sector confidence and
competitiveness and re-establishing growth, particularly in
the agriculture sector. The objectives are to achieve real
economic expansion, generate job opportunities for the
growing labor force and promote a more equitable distribution of development benefits. The Government’s strategy is
to stabilize the economy and encourage the private sector.
It intends to implement this through incentives and a
countercyclical budgetary policy; agricultural diversification,
export-oriented industrialization and tourism; increased external competitiveness of the economy; and macro and
secior policy adjustments to speed up economic transformation. Social programs are focused on providing welfare
assistance to the more disadvantaged sections of the community through targel-oriented initiatives.

The Bank supports efforts to revitalize the economy,
consolidate economic recovery in the shori term and
broaden the long-term base of the economy, particularly
through strengthening the external sector. An equally important objective is to achieve a wider spread of the benefits
of development and to expand employmeni and income
opportunities. An underlying aim is to: help strengthen
institutions and improve human resources. Within this context, continuing assistance to the agriculture sector, particularly for smallholder development and agricultural
diversification, is emphasized. The tourism sector is imporiant in broadening the country's economic base. Manufacturing is a key sector in increasing exports and In the
structwal transformation of ihe economy. Resource-hased

Policy Dialogue: Before the Agriculture Diversification Program (ADP), policy dialogue had been conducted
within the framework of processing and implementing
specific development projects, It had been narrowly focused
and of limited effect. The ADP provided a vehicle for
intensive dialogue on a wide range of issues affecting agriculture. Government strategy was particularly directed toward
encouraging a greater degree of private sector activity. The
agreed program, among other things, called for the abolition
of subsidies on agricultural inputs; the introduction of
production, taxation and export incentives; and the
strengthening of principal sector institutions. in parallel, the
Government agreed to take stronger measures to protect
the environmerit and to promote industrial investment. All
these policy measures have been fully implemented.

Loans and Technical Assistance: One loan, for
$9.6 million, was approved in 1989 and this generated
co-financing to the extent of $18 million, [t brought the
cumulative total to $103 million for 11 loans by end-1989.
In earlier years, the Bank had emphasized the power subsector, which received three loans between 1972 and 1981.
Subsequently, agriculture and rural development carne into
focus and received two loans. The objective was to diversily
agriculture, primarily by providing basic infrastructure and
support services, In 1988 came the Agriculture Diversification Program, which has effected important policy
measures, encouraged institutional changes and provided
financial support to the Government's investment programs
during a time of severe budgetary constraint, The Bank has
also assisted the transport and communications sector with
port and road developrnent loans, and helped strengthen the
country’s credit system through loans to the Fiji Development Bank.

Technical assistance totalling $2.2 million for nine
projects was provided in 1989. In all, the Bank had provided

6566

DRILLING water wells in
around 700 furm famities.

30 technical assistance grants to |i, amounting to $6.1
million, by the end of the year. Eleven were for project
preparation, the rést being advisory and operational in
nalure,

Project Implementation: Of 11 loans to Fiji, seven
had been closed by the end of 1989 and four were under
administration. Contract awards during 1989 totalled $7
million, bringing the cumulative value of contracts awarded
to $83 million, or 95 per cent of the net effective loan
amount. Disbursements lotalled $1.3 million jn 1989, bringing cumulative disbursements to $70 million, or 81 per cent
of the net effective loan amount.

The implernentation of projects has been generally
satisfactory. The two agriculture sector projects were adversely affected during 1987 and 1988 by the sharp decline
in government revenues and ensuing budgelary reductions.
But the Agriculture Diversification Program loan generated
counterpart funds for both projects and their implementation accelerated considerably frorn early 1989.

India

Operational Strategy: The Bank's role in India’s
development process is to provide well directed and sustained financial assistance in cunsonance with the
Govemment's objectives, priorities and prograrns. The
Bank's operational strategy focuses on India’s rapid industrialization, one of the Government’s most important
objectives. Assistance is aired al improving the structure of
the industry sector and productive efficiency to increase
industry's share of GDP, export eamings and employment.
Priority is being given te industries that can play a major role
in modernizing the industry sector and in stimulating growth
in other sectors, with an emphasis on the development of
private sector manufacturing. Support for manufacturing is
being channelled mainly through development finance institutions as well as equity investment and direct lending to
the private sector,

Assistance is direcled also at removing infrastructure
bottlenecks particularly in sectors such as power, transportand telecommunications, affecting industrial development.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank’s dialogue with India
mainly concerned the Government’s continuing policy of
industrial deregulation and trade reform. The Bank has

.expressed the view that industrial deregulation should be

expedited and licensing and other restrictions reduced.
Trade reform, It feels, should include a movement away from
quantitative import restrictions.

Dialogue also took place on power and finance sector
issues, for which the Bank had earlier prepared sector
profiles. These discussions provided each side with the
opportunity to understand the other’s development perspective. A sector study on ports and shipping was ongoing
during the year and is expected to lead to similar oppor
 funities for dialogue.

Loans and Technica! Assistance: In 1989, the

. Bank provided four loans to India from OCR, including one

joan to the private sector without government guarantee,
fotalling $504 million. This brought cumulative lending since

1986 to $1,645 million, One loan of $118 million was

‘provided to strengthen the efficiency of telecommunications

: equipment manufacturing. Another, for $150 million, was
“made to a DFI for onlending to medium-scale industrial
- enterprises in the private sector for modemizing/expanding
- their facilities. A loan of $230 million was approved for the
“power sector to help develop additional thermal generating

capacity in Andhra Pradesh. A loan of $5.9 million was
made to a private company for acrylic fiber development.
This was in addition to an equity investment of
$2.24 million. Finally, an equity investment of $800,000
was made in the Credit Capital Venture Fund.

Nine technical assistance projects totalling $3.3 million
were approved during 1989. Two, telated to the road

_ improvement project approved in 1988, were for pavernent

management and expressway system planning. Three were
piggy-backed on the 1989 telecomrnunications project and
included a management training prograrn, a telephone cable
specifications study and an industrial engineering standards
study, Technical assistance was also provided to prepare a

Indonesia

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational
strategy for Indonesia was revised due to recent economic
developments and Repelita V, which covers the five-year
period beginning 1 April 1989, The adjustment and
development objectives of Repelita V are considered compatible with the country’s economic circumstances and are
realistic and achievable. In support of Repelita V, Bank
programs and projects will be designed to promote nonoil/liquefied natural gas exports; mobilize domestic resources; generate employment; develop basic needs and
human resources; increase private sector participation; and
improve the efficiency ol existing investments while optimizing resource utilization. The Bank will take into account the
role of other donors in order to maximize benefits.and avoid
duplication within particular sectors.

Policy Dialogue: Policy dialogue concentrated on
financial sector reforms, capital market development and
food crop sector policy reforms. Within the financial sector,
the Bank supported a major program of reforms under the
Financial Sector Program Joan approved in November
1988, These reforms included financial deregulation with
increased freedom to open new banks and branches of
existing banks, to offer new financial services and to borrow
abroad, Concurrently, central bariking supervision was
strengthened with limits on lending to principal customers
and on foreign borrowing relative to bank capital, In Sep
tember, the second disbursement under that loan was made

67after substantial progress in the prograrn’s implementation.
Piggy-backed on this loar: were technical assistance grants
that provided the required technical support for the expansion of the capital markets, Several policy-related missions
discussed appropriate reforms in the agriculture sector,
particularly in the food crops area, to maintain selfsufficiency while promoting diversification and increasing
the efficiency of resource utllization. These and other areas
of policy reforms will continue to receive the Bank's financial
support in the future.

Malaysia

Operational Strategy: She Bank reformulated its
operational strategy for Malaysia in 1987 after the
Gevernment’s policy responses to the recession of the
mid-1980s. The strategy is aimed at promoting structural
adjustment and growth through increased productivity and
efficiency, while enhancing the role of the private sector. It
is designed to support programs and policies to restructure,
diversify and strengthen the productive base of the tos
important sectors, particularly manufacturing and agricul
ture. The Bank will also support activities lo alleviate poverty, both rural and urban, reflecling the Government's own
concerms and adhering lo the objeclives of its New Economic
Policy (NEP),

Accordingly, the Bank will assist projects that
strengthen the manufacturing industry, directly or indirectly,
by upgrading, rehabilitating and adding to the infrastructure
and by developing the human resource base. The role of the72

private sector will be emphasized.

In the agriculture sector, the Bank will support afforestation and the maintenance of natural forests. To promote
rural development, it will seck to improve the productivity
of smallholder cultivators by encouraging crop diversification
and preduction of cash crops and through innovative
marketing schemes.

Social and physical infrastructure will be supported to

‘erisure that growth dees not falter on account of bottlenecks.

Loans and Technical Assistance: Bank lending in
1989 amounted to $122 million, compared with
$99 million in 1988. Tt consisted of six loans, including a
special assistance pragram and the Bank’s first private sector
loan to Nepal, for activities in the agriculture, education,
energy, industry, transportation and water supply sectors.
Co-financing to the extent of $8 million was involved in one
project. There were 15 technical assistance projects
arnounting to $8.3 million. All but two were advisory technica) assistance, including a follow-up project to install a
program budgeiing and project monitoring system in the
Ministry of Finarice and extend it to line ministries.

$42 million in 1988, Cumulative disbursements stood at
$382 million, or 50 per cent of the net effective loan
amount,

The most significant development affecting the Bank's
operations in Nepal during 1989 was the expiry on
23 March of the country's'trade and transit lreaties with
India. This affected bilateral trade between the lwo countries.
Ongoing projects were affected by ihe shortage of vital
gaods, including petroleum products and other commodities
previously available under quota arrangements from India.

The Government’s budgetary difficulties also affected
project implementation by delaying the release of lacal
funds. Disbursernents, however, increased by a significant
91.3 per cent in 1989, mainly because of the clisbursement
of the first tranche of the agricultural program loan and
closer attenlion paid by the authorities to implementation.
A procurement seminar was held in Kathmandu to further
strengthen the implementation process.

A Resident Office was established in Kathmandu in
December to coordinate with, and advise, the Government
on matters relating to project implementation. Its efforts
were supported by regular review missions which discussed
overall implementation issues

Private Sector Investment Management: The
Bank approved its first private sector investment in Nepal in
1989 — a $4 million loan and equity facility for a spinning
mill project. Disbursemenis irom the investment have yet to
be made.

Pakistan

Operational Strategy: The Bank's operational
strategy for Pakistan was recently revised, paying special
attention to macroeconomic imbalances, particularly the
budget and external payments gaps. Five major (hemes are
underscored. These are export growlh and conservation of
foreign exchange; domestic resource mobilization, increased private sector participation; iaprovernent of the
efficiency of existing investments and lhe optimization of
resource allocation; and lhe satisfaction of basic needs,
poverty alleviation and huinan resource development.

In agricullure, the main concern is to boost productivity
and rnanage scarce financial resources prudently. The Bank
seeks to phase out fertilizer subsidies and to achieve progress
towards the full recovery of operation and maintenance costs
of provincial irrigation systems. In the industrial sector,
policy programs will be focused on improving competitive
ness and expanding the export hase, subsfituting imports
more efficiently, and shedding the import bias which had
earlier been inherent in the industrial sector. In the financial
avea, efforts for policy reforms, including exchange rate
policy and tariff rationalization, will be continued. The
increased participation of the private seclor will continue to
be supported. In the power sector, a key objective is to
mobilize additional resources to meet investment needs, and76

restrain demand growth through pricing mechanisms and
better load management, Continued monitoring of gas
prices and consumer demand through gas conservation
need to be maintained, Constraints in the sucial sectors are
the high local currency content of social projects, a shortage
ol budget funds for developrnent and recurrent expenditure
and the general weakness of the concerned institutions.
Institulional development in all sectors will continue’ to be
the goal of advisory technical assistance.

Policy Dialogue: The Bank has been particularly
active in supporting the growth of private enterprise in
Pakistan, through both loans and direct equity investments.
It has had an intensive dialogue with the Government in this
respect, based on its program loan for the industrial sector
as well as its third and fourth loans for development financing. The objective is not only to develop a deregulatory policy
environment for rapid, industry-led and export-oriented
economic growth, but also assist in implementing the
privatization policy of the Government, rationalize the working of developrnent financing institutions, and promote a
secondary market for fixed-income securities.

in the agriculture sector, discussions have been under:
laken on the mobilization of financial resources from the
sector and the enhancement of agricultural productivity. In
the energy sector, the Bank has coordinated with other aid
agencies in addressing policy issues, and in the area of
infrastructure, economic tariffs for key urban services and
better operational efficiency have heen stressed.

Loans and Technical Assistance: The Bank approved 13 loans for 11 projects totalling $724 million to
Pakistan in 1989, including $54 million to the private sector.
This compared with $649 million approved for eight

of net effective loans

The Government’s awareness of the importance of
effective prcject implementation and consequent favorable
impact on disbursements is underlined by its decision to
undertake a study, under a Bank technical assistance project,
of government procedures and requirements,

Operational Strategy: In consonance with the
Government's Medium-Term Development Plan, the Bank’s
operational strategy continues to he focused on poverty
alleviation, employment generation, particularly in rural
areas, and balanced regional development, in view of the
wide disparities in income and quality of life prevailing in the
different regions. In response to the over-exploitation of
natural resources, more alterition is being given under the
strategy to the renewal aru! management of natural resources and to environmental iimproverertt.

In irmplermenting the strategy, three main considerations

Policy Dialogue: During 1989, the Bank continued
'o exchange views with the Government on a wide-ranging
set of policy issues both in the context of project processing
and.in more general forums. As in the earlier Bank-assisted
. Forestry Sector Program, the Fisheries Sector Program
-approved in 1989 has as its twin objectives the improvement
of efficiency in resource use and the enhancement of social
-equity. The program will involve NGOs in the implernentalion process and seek a number of major policy and institutional reforms relating to resource sustainability, coastal
“zone management, environmental rehabilitation and the
strengthening and enforcernent of fishery laws.

Policy Dialogue: During the year, the Bank under
took a major policy dialogue with Western: Sama related to
its Agriculture Development Program. The objective was to
address structural constraints in the economy and transtorm
the macroeconomic policy framework into one that is more
supportive of agricultural production, economic diversification, increased productivity, domestic resource mobilization,
improved resource allocation between sectors, enhanced
public sector efficiency and greater private sector activity.
Discussions took place on the telecommunications sector,
too, and related to transforming the Posts arid Telecomm
munications Department into a commercial corporation and
realigning tariffs, cosis and revenues.

In Tonga, the dialogue focused on the role of the
National Reserve Bank in implementing an interest rate
policy by which a real, market-oriented and flexible interest
rate structure could be maintained over the meclium and long
term.

Loans and Technical Assistance: A fourth line of
credit was extended to Tonga Development Bank and two
loans were approved for Western Samoa, the Second
Telecormmunications Project and the Agriculture Develop
ment Program loan. Ail three loans, amounting to $27.4
million, were from the ADF. ‘The development bank loan
was Inline with the anticipated financing needs of existing
and new industries and involved co-financing fer $3 million.
The Second Telecommunications Project for Western
Samoa will upgrade its telecommunications systern with; aiein technology. This loan also involved co-financing of
wh million, The Agriculture Development Program is to
i pport the Government’s medium-term development profor agriculture and related industries.
y the end of 1989, the Bank had approved 53 loans
16 the. six South Pacific countries, amounting to $156.4
on, Western Samoa was the largest recipient country
with’ 22 loans amounting to $79 million, followed by
“Solomon Islands (11 Joans amounting to $38 million), Tonga
(iine loans amouniting to $20 million), Vanuatu (four loans
amounting to $11 million}, Cook Islands (three loans
‘mounting to $5 million} and Kiribati (four loans amounting
fo 54 million).

Eighteen technical assistance grants were provided
‘during the year for a total of $4.3 million. Three were for
‘project preparation and 15 for advisory and institutional
rengthening purposes,

  
  
  
   
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
  

 

. ‘Project Implementation: Of the 53 loans approved
for the smaller South Pacific DMCs, 38 had been closed and
15 were under administration by the end of 1989, including
‘ane walting to become effective. Contract awards during the
year totalled $15 million bringing the cumulative total of
“coritracts awarded to $97 million, or 66 per cent of the total
net, effective loan amount. Disbursements totalled $10.4
iilion in 1989, which brought cumulative disbursements to

$90 million, or 62 per cent of the total amount of all net
effective loans.

Project implementation problems in the smaller South
Pacific DMCs are largely related to the geographical remoteness or the small size of the countries. In response to
suggestions made during the Twenty-Second Annual
Meeting of the Board of Governors in Beijing, the Bank set
up an internal Task Force to review and improve Its operations in the region.

The Task Force submitted its report in October 1989
and came to the conclusion that the Bank’s operations in
the SPDMCs should remain flexibie, with a strong emphasis
on technical assistance, and that its South Pacific Regional
Office in Vanuatu should have greater authority in matters
relating to procurement and contract approvals.

The report suggested a greater reliance on sector
lending and a bigger effort to promote the private sector and
financial services. Equity financing by the: Bank, including
small amounts of seed capital for small-scale entrepreneurs,
was recornmended as a useful step and micro-credit projects
were seen as essential for the development of agro-industrial

and service enterprises. It also proposed the establishment °

of special South Pacific funds administered by the Bank to
channel project and technical assistance funds to the
SPDMCs. The Board discussed the recommendations of the
report and the issues involved are still under consideration.

. Project Administration

AT the end of 1989, there were 388 projects under implementalion, compared with 405 in 1988. Of these, 359
were classified as "satisfactory" and 29 as “unsatisiactory".
Eighty-seven projecis were completed in 1989, compared
with 60 in 1988, bringing the total number of completed
projects to 536, or 59 per cent of the 906 projects approved
as of 31 Decernber 1989,

To help executing agencies expedite and improve the
implementation of projects, the Bank fielded missions to
review progress and discuss actions necessary to remedy any
-problems. A total of 341 project administration missions
went out during the year, covering 499 projects. These
missions utilized 4,133 man-days, which worked out at an
average of 8.3 man-days per project..

-Project implementation support to execniing agencies
was also provided by the Bank’s resident offices in
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and the South
Pacific Regional Office in Vanuatu. The resident offices in
Pakistan and Nepal were established in 1989.

The Bank pursued a country-specific approach towards
improving the implementation of Bank-financed projects.
‘Missions led by senior Bank staff form an essential part of
this approach, and are intended to discuss country-specific
Implementation problems, cross-sectora] issues and necessary remedial measures with senior DMC officials -at the
national level.

Enhancing the project implementation capabilities of
executing agency staff through seminars and workshops
continued to be emphasized, and a number of regional
seminars on project implementation management were
held. The accompanying table details the Bank’s seminar
activities during 1989.

The Bank continued to focus on simplifying and strearnlining internal procedures for project implementation.
Revised guidelines were issued on how best to respond if
circumstances change during project implementation, and
for utilizing savings from a Bank loan to meet additional
Project cost; reviewing procurement aclions by borrowers
under local cornpetitive bidding; handling the disbursement

 

of outstanding contracts after the loan closing date; and
administering technical assistance projects, Also, a comprehensive review was made of the type and flow of project
administration reports and documents with a view to achieving greater efficiency in project administration decisions. For
the South Pacific borrowing countries, a Task Force, consisting of senior operational staff, recommended simplification of procurement procedures and delegation of greater
authority to the South Pacific Regional Office in procurement matters,

A training program was instituted for appraisal mission
leaders to enhance their knowledge of project implementation matters that need to be addressed during project appraisal.

The Bank continued its practice of holding business
opportunity seminars for suppliers, manufacturers, contractors and consultants from its member countries. These
seminars seek to make potential bidders aware of business
opportunities offered under Bank financing and advise them
on how to prepare substantially responsive bids and
proposals. Five such seminars were conducted in 1989, one
each in Indonesia, France, Netherlands, Spain and United
States. Additionally, trade representatives and cormmercial
attachés of ihe Bank’s member countries located in Manila
were briefed on business opportunities offered by Bank
financed projects and the Bank's procedures and practices
in approving coniract awards.

The total value of contracts awarded during the year
under Bank-financed projects totalled $2,101 million, of
which $1,387 million was from ordinary capital resources
(OCR) and $714 million was from the Asian Development

Tund (ADF). ‘This was 9 per cent above the $1,929 million

in contracts awarded in 1988 and represented a record level
of performance. At the end of the year, cumulative contract
awards amounted to $14,858 million, of which $14,023
million were for goods, related services and civil works,
Consultancy services are an important input in project
implementation. A total of 101 consulting firms and 37
individual consultants were engaged by borrowers for assisting them in project implementation. The. total value of
consultancy contracts under Bank-financed projects
awarded during the year totalled $68 million. At the end of

8788

the year, the cumulative value of contract awards for consultancy services totalled $836 million. For technical assistance projects, the Bank employed 198 consulting firms and
141 individual consultants. ‘here was a rapid increase in
technical assistance operations, partly due to the availability
of resources from the Japan Special Fund (JSF). The number
of technical assistance projects increased from 187 in 1988
to 235 in 1989.

The program to assist borrowing member countries in
developing their own consultant capabilities continued,
mainly through in-country serninars for domestic consul
_ tants. The Bank assisted the Government of Thailand in

establishing a domestic consultant data base and making an

inventory of such resources available within the country.
The Bank’s own data bases on consulting firms

(DACON) were revised and simplified in response to the

were also made in the Bank’s selection procedures for a
more efficient selection of individual consultants under lechnical assistance projects and to make the selection process
more transparent.

Loan Disbursements

Loan disbursements rose by $586 million to $2,235
million [rom $1,649 million in 1988. OCR disbursements
increased to $1,347 million from $957 million while ADF
disbursements rose to $888 million from $692 million.

Program loans played a significant role in the irmproved
disbursement. Program loan disbursements rose 136
per cent to $451 million from $191 million in 1988 and
accounted for 44 per cent of the increase in total disburse
ments.

Project loan disbursements rose 22 per cent to $1,784

per cent of the increase in tolal disbursements.

The DMCs contributed to the increase in disbursements
through their efforts Lo speed up project implementation and
undertake policy reforms to improve economic efficiency
and resource allocation.

On its part, the Bank continued to streamline project
administration procedures and organization, and maintained
close coordination with borrowers through its Resident
Offices. To facilitate the flow of loan funds, it made use of
imprest accounts, the staternent of expenditure mechanisrn
and retroactive financing, sent out regular projects review
and country loan disbursement missions, and continued to
organize procurernent, disbursement and project implementation seminars ,

Project Benefit Monitoring
and Evaluation

Important modifications were Introduced during 1989
in the Bank's Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation
(PBME) program to keep pace with new areas of operalion.
Components which monitor and evaluate the impact of

NETTING fish at a reservoir buill in Thailand under the Bank-assisted Medium Scale Irrigation Package Project which

policy and investment activities were included in eight program loans. Efforts continued to further integrate project
benefit monitoring with systems to monitor project jmplementation and wilh othey management information systems of various executing agencies. In this regard, the
Agriculture and Infrastructure Departments selected 23 executing agencies in eight DMCs for special attention. Six of
these agencies are implementing loans in which special
assistance has been provided. The need for assistance in the
remaining 17 is being assessed in the preparation of several
projects.

An interdepartmental task force reviewed continuing
difficulties in the timely completion of PBME Review Studies
for use in the assessment of project benefits in preparing
Project Completion Reporls. On the basis of this review, it
was decided that coordination and monitoring of the arrangements to prepare these studies should be intensified. In
addition, necessary technical assistance support may be
provided lo selected agencies.

Work was substantially completed to develop and test
a computerized PBME system for development finance
institutions. A framework for a monitoring system for
projects in the industry and minerals sector was also
developed.

loan ofTHE post-evaluation system has evolved from simpie beginnings in the 1970s to a more mature and complex operation
today. Involving a broad range of activities that support
- developrnent initiatives, the systern is designed to review the

Bank’s operations with a clear objective: How to improve,
- qualitatively, the design, implementation and operation of
. developrnent projects, and enable the Bank to better account
to member governments for the effectiveness of ils assistance, This continuing exercise is the function of the PostEvaluation Office (PEO), which reports directly to the
“President.

x During 1989, 34 projects, including two programm
© Joans, were evaluated. Thirty of these projects were assessed
in depth and were covered by Project Performance Audit
Reports (PPARs), For the remaining four, the Project Com‘pletion Reports (PCRs) were reviewed to ensure that they
adequately fulfilled the necessary accountability and lessonlearning functions of post-evaluation.

By the end of the year, PEO had prepared 298 PPARs
-covering 313 projects in 19 countries and all major sectors
They represented 61 per cent of completed projects for
which PCRs had been prepared as of December 1988.

The 34 projects evaluated in 1989 covered 12
countries and 14 subsectors, All but one of them had been
approved between 1974 and 1984, with 50 per cent of
them being approved between 1979 and 1981. About 88
per cent of the projects had been completed during 19861988, with the remaining 12 per cent finished between
1984 and 1985.

Of the projects evaluated last year, 18 or 53 per cent,
were considered successful according to PEO criteria, com
TFwelye projects, or 35 per cenl, were assessed as partly
successful, while four (12 per cent) were rated unsuccessful.

Several factors affected last year’s: results. For one
thing, there were more agricultural projects/programs
among the cases evaluated last year than In the year before,
_ and agricultural projects, historically, are more difficult to
implement. For another, a number of DFl projects evaluated
also performed relatively poorly. A high proportion of the
evaluated projects were in low-income DMCs, where irr
frastructure and institutions are weaker.

POST-EVALUATION

The period of approval of projects also affected outcomes. Projecis approved in and after 1980, being better
prepared and having the benefit of lessons learned from
experience, performed better than those prepared and approved earlier. As high as 71 per cent of such projects

9192

(12 out of 17) were rated as successful. In contrast, of the
17 other evaluated projects (50 per cent of the total)
approved before 1979, only 35 per cent were assessed as
successful. In some cases, they had been inappropriately
designed, in others the institutional infrastructure was inade
quate or macroeconomic policy had not been conducive.

In addition-to the PPARs and selective evaluation of
PCRs, PEO completed two impact evaluation studies and
three special studies during the year. One of the impact
evaluation studies concerned the Bank’s lending to DFls in
Pakistan and found thai, in order to channel loans effectively
to end-users, vigorous government aciion was required on
institutional reforms. It recommended strengthening the
legal system to speed up debt recovery, developing the
capital market as a source of financing industrial enterprises,
and improving support facilities in order to upyrade industrial technology. At the same time, the need for the DFls
to develop a comprehensive credit rating system, strenglhen
institutional capabilities and restore client confidence was
emphasized.

The second impact evaluation study was actually a
te evaluation of the Gohor Lama Palm Oil Processing

Project in Indonesia — the first time PEO reviewed lhe
performance of a project evaluated previously, The objective
was to get some insights inte the long-term sustainability of
the project. At the time of the previous audit in 1983,
pollution caused by untreated effluent discharged from the
mill had been identified as a major problem. The reevaluation disclosed that the project had succeeded in resalying this issue and underscored tts viability.

The study suggested that the cormmercial and social
objectives of the slate-owned corporation, Perseroan
Terbatas Perkebunana II (PTP I), should be clearly
delineated, and concluded that fair and orderly competition
between private and public sector estates should be encouraged to ensure efficient development of the oil palm
subsector in Indonesia. The country’s competitive exchange
rate system, orchestrated by the Government, was identified
as a favorable factor for the agriculture sector's performance, particularly that of the tree crops segment.

The three special country studies reviewed and consolidated the major findings of post-evaluation studies undertaken by the Bank and the World Bank in Bangladesh, Nepal
and Sri Lanka.

PEO continues to be actively associaled with project
processing by reviewing and commenting on drall Board
documents as well as participating in loar: processing meetings. To ensure that findings of post-evaluation studies lead

The Bank Management and the Board's Audit Committee continue to closely monitor the post-evaluation process
to see that lessons learned from the past are adequately
reflected in the design of new projects and in the implementation of ongoing ones. The Audit Committee reviewed
selected PCRs and PPARs during the year, as well as the

Financial Policies

PREPARATORY work was undertaken in: 1989 on certain
financial policy matters relevant to the next general capital
increase (GCI TV). This work will continue in 1990.

in accordance with the income policies approved by the
Board in 1987, the Bank ensures that its interest coverage
ratio (CR), which measures the extent to which the Bank’s
financial expenses are covered by its net income, does not
fall substantially below 1.25 in the long run and its long-term
reserves to outstanding loans ratio (RLR) is within a range
of 20 to 25 per cent, As of 31 December 1989, the ICR
stood at 1.91 and the RLR at 40 per cent.

Variable Lending Rate

The Bank's pool-based variable lending rate, which is
adjusted on J January and 1 July each year, applies to all
ordinary operations loans approved after 30 June 1986 and
to nearly all such loans approved between 24 September
1985 and 30 June 1986. The lending rate is determined by
adding a spread (currently 0.4 per cent per annum) to the
average cost of a pool of outstanding Bank borrowings.
Reflecting developments. in the international capital
markets, the lending rate has progressively declined from its
initial level of 7.65 per cent per annum set on 1 July 1986.
The rate was reduced on 1 January 1989 from 6.53 per
cent per annum to 6.42 per cent per annum and was further
reduced on 1 duly 1989 to 6.37 per cent per annum. !

Under the old lending rate system, which applied before
the variable lending rate system was Introduced, rates were
fixed al the time of loan approval for the entire life of the

‘Joan. As of 31 December 1989, the variable lending rate
applied to $1,373 million of disbursed and outstanding loans
and to $4,761 million of undisbursed loans, representing
about 22 per cent and 82 per cent of the respective totals.

4 The rate as from 1 January 1990 is 6,33 per cent per annum,

Borrowings

In 1989, the Bank undertook five borrowings amounting to $644.5 million. The total amount of borrowings would
have been larger had it net been for loan prepayments
during. the year,

The first two borrowings were undertaken in January
in the Swiss capital market, where the Bank floated a public
bond issue and made a private placement,each for SwF100
million. The yen borrowing, in March, was a public bond
issue in Japan for ¥40 billion. The issue, with special
settlement features, was the Bank’s second such issue. The
borrowing in US dollars, in April, was a public bond issue in
the Euredollar capital market amounting to $100 million,
the proceeds of which were swapped [or yen under related
currency liability swap transactions. The final borrowing of

The average original life of the year's borrawings,
weighted by amount, was 9.80 years compared with 9.65
years in 1988. At the end of 1989, the remaining average
life of the Bank's outstanding borrowings, weighted by the
amount of each borrowing, was 7.45 years.

The liabilily management program for 1989 consisted
of calls on four high-coupon issues. The total amount
prepaid was $504.3 million, Consequently, the Bank's
1989 borrowing and liability management prograrns had the
net effect of increasing liquidity by $140.2 million.

Capitalization

The capital stock is defined in the Bank's Articles of
Agreement in terms of United States dollars of the weight
and fineness in effect on 3] January 1966. Since the coming
into effect of the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the Internalional Monetary Find (IMF) on 1
April 1978, currencies no longer have par values in terms
of gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate
successor to the 1966 dollar, the value of the Bank's capital
stock has been expressed in terms of the SDR on the basis
that each share has the value of SDR10,000, The mutual
obligations of each member and the Bank wilh respect to
maintenance of the value of curreney holdings have alse
beer measured by the same standard, but settlement of such

obligations has been held in abeyance. For purposes of the
financial statements, the SDR has been translated into
current United States dollars at the current rate as computed
by the IMF. As of 31 December 1989, the rate was
$1.31416 per SDR. Further information on the Bank's
current praclice regarding valuation of capital and maintenance of value is given in Notes A and I of the Notes to
Financial Statements of Ordinary Capital Resources, OCRq

Two working papers on valuation of the Bank’s capital
and maintenance of value were considered by the Board in
1988. During Board discussions, a proposal to denominate
the Bank's capital in terms of the current SDR was considered, A third working paper focusing or maintenarice of
value was submitted to the Board in September 1988 for
consideration in due course.

In September 1988, the Board of Governors adopted
Resolutions No. 193, 194 and 195 authorizing special
increases in the capital subscriptions of Japan, Sweden and
United States, to take effect in accordance with the
provisions of those Resolutions. he Governors also
adopted Resolution No. 192 authorizing an increase of
62,194 shares in the Bank's capital stock to be made
available for these special increases, As of 31 December
1989, Japan, Sweden and United States had not subseribed
to their entitlements.

At the end of 1989, the Barik’s authorized capital stack
amounted to $22,111 million (SDR16,825.2 million). The
subscribed capital stock stood at $21,137.6 million
(SDR16,084.5 million).Future Resource Requirements

In May 1986, the Board of Governors adopted Resolution No. 179 requesting the Board of Directors to undertake
a study of the Bank's future resource requirements for
fmancing its ordinary operations. The study will lead to the
formulation of specific proposals for a further general capital
increase (GCI IV}. A report providing an updated review of
progress on Lhe study was approved by the Board of Directors in March 1989 for submission to the Board of Governors, The report was considered by the Board of Governors
at the 22nd Annual Meeting. In accordance with the. program envisaged in the report, a working paper on the Bank's
ordinary capital resources operational program for 19901996 was under preparation as of year-end and was ex
pected to be considered by the Board of Directors in early
1990. A further report of the Board of Directors on the
progress of the study has been submitted to the Board of
Governors for consideration at the 23rd Annual Meeting. A
number of papers on related matters, including a preliminary
GCI IV proposal, are expected tobe considered by the Board
of Directors during 1990.

Investments

At the end of 1989, ihe Bank's OCR investments were
denominated in 20 currencies and amounted to the
equivalent of $3,785 million ($3,947 million at the-end of
1988), Of the total investments, 60 per cent (compared with
57 per cent at the end of 1988) was held in securities issued
or guaranteed by member governments and obligations of
other multilateral development banks. The remainder was
invested in deposits and other bank instrumenis in member
countries. The realized vate of teturn on the Bank's OCR
investments over the year was 9.39 per cent, compared with
8.11 per cent in 1988. .

Loan Disbursements and Repayments

OCR loan disbursements in 1989 amounted to $1,347
million, an increase of $390 million over the previous year.
Cumulative disbursements reached $9,089 million at the
end of the year. Repayments by the Bank’s borrowers
amounted to $678 million, bringing cumulative loan repayments to $2,955 million.

‘The Bank has no problems with arrears in its OCR lean
repayments. [t has not suffered any loan losses to date and
follows a policy of not taking part in debt rescheduling
agreements.

Income, Expenses and Reserves

The net income of the Bank in 1989 was $435 million,
an increase of 16 per cent over the preceding year, The

CAMPUS dormitories are part of the Vocational Educa
tion Project in Malaysia. Assisted by a Bunk loan of $20
million, the project is aimed at providing nine vocational
schools in eight Siates.

gross income of $1,036 million showed an increase of $13
million from the year-ago level,

The improvement was accounted for by a $40 million
increase in income on investment and other sources, offset
by a $27 million decrease in income on loans.

‘The Bank’s expenses in 1989 totalled $601 million,
showing a decrease of $48 million, or 7 per cent, from the
previous year. inancial expenses and the cost of services to
member countries decreased by $54 million and $4 million.
respectively, while administrative expenses rose by $10
mitlion.

in 1989, the Bank’s Ordinary Reserve rose lo $2,315
million after the transfer of $374 million net income for the
year ended 31 December 1988 and the net credit of $12

* authorized by Governors’ Resolution No. 182 in October
1986, was intended to finance the Bank’s concessional
lending program aver the four-year period 1987-1990,
while $72 million was for allocation to TASE for technical
assistance to poorer developing member countries (DMCS)
and for regional technical assistance. At the exchange rates
specified in the Resolution, the total amount authorized was
$3.6 billion,

By the end of May 1989, all donor countries had
deposited their ADF V instruments of Coniribution. The
contributions of Canada and the United States are qualified,
whereby, as permitted by the Resolution, all instalment
payments except the first are subject to subsequent
budgetary appropriations, Under the ADF V “trigger” arrangemenis, the availability for operational comrnitments of the
second, third and fourth tranches of the unqualified contributions is subject to the availability of the first, second and
remaining Iwo tranches of the qualified contributions, The
arrangements for ADF V envisaged that the second tranches
of the unqualified contributions would be released on 1
January 1988 and the third tranches on 1 January 1989.

By the beginning of 1989, budgetary appropriations
had been obtained for the first two tranches of Canada's
qualified contribution, while the United States had made
available $107.5 million, representing 73.59 per cent of its
first tranche. Accordingly, pursuant to the provisions of the
Resolution, the second tranches of all contributions other
than that of the United States were available to the Bank for
operational cormmitments to the extent of 73.59 per cent.

During 1989, budgetary appropriations were obtained
for the full amount of Canada’s third tranche. In December
1989, the United States made available a further $175
million, consisting of $38.6 million for the remaining
balance (26.41 per cent) of its first tranche and $136.4
million for a portion (93.38 per cent) of its second tranche.
In accordance with the Resolution, this triggered the release
of the remaining 26.41 per cent of the other donors’ second
tranches and 93.38 per cent of their third tranches

Future Resource Requirements

The four-year period covered by ADF V is scheduled to
end on 31 December 1990. Negotiations with ADF donor
countries on a further ADF replenishment (ADF VI}, which
would be expected to provide resources for ADF lending
during the period beyond 1990, would normally have commenced by the middle of 1989. However, in view of the
continuing favorable exchange rates and relatively comfortable resource situation, the negotiations are now planned to
commence in the first half of 1990, Work began in the latter
half of 1989 on studies to determine the concessional
financing needs of the Bank's low-income DMCs during the
ADF VI period and the projected ADF operational program.

Availability and Utilization of ADF Resources

At the beginning of 1989, uncommitted ADF resources
totalled about $2,265 million and, after allowing for a
provision of $634 million for exchange rate fluctuations, the
nel resources available for loan commitments amounted to
about $1,631 million. Releases of further arnounis of ADF
V contributions during 1989 added about $1,308 million to
resources {at the exchange rates applicable at the time of
such releases), while net income for the year added about

$73 million. On the other hand, resources were adversely
affected by depreciations of the currencies of several contributions against the US dollar. ADF loan approvals during
the year totalled $1,363 imillion (al the exchange rates
applicable at the time of loan negotiation). After taking
account of repayments, cancellations and exchange rate
adjustments, total uncommitted resources declined by $127
million to $2,138 million. During the year, the provision for
exchange rate fluctuations increased from $634 million to
$723 million. After deduction of this latter amount, the net
resources available for further loan commitments at the end
of 1989 amounted to about $1,415 million.

Disbursements from ADF resources during 1989
totalled $888 million ($692 million in 1988), bringing
cumulative disbursements at the end of the year to $4,503
rnillion, ADF loan repayments during the year amounted to
$38 miltion, with curnulative repayments as of end-1989
amounting to $207 million.

ADF Revenue and Expenses

The excess of revenue over expenses (net income) of
ADF for 1989 amounted to $73 million, bringing the

accumulated surplus at the end of the year to $405 million,

Expenses, principally administration charges paid to
ordinary capital resources, totalled $45 milion.

At the end of 1989, the Bank’s investments of ADF
resources were denominated in 18 currencies and amounted
to the equivalent of $797 million ($607 million at the end
of 1988). Of the total investments, 20 per cent (18 per cent
at the end of 1988) was held in securities issued or guaranteed by member governments, The balance was invested in
deposits and other bank instruments in member couniries.
The realized rate of return on ADF investments over the year
was 9.89 per cent, compared with 7.55 per cent in 1988.

Technical Assistance Special Fund

As of 31 December 1989, an aggregate amount of

regular professional staff positions during 1990. It is
proposed to recruit five young professionals in 1990.

During 1989, the Bank implemented a Job Rotation
Scheme for selected professional staff to broaden their
exposure and to enhance their development for higher
responsibilities. .The Bank's early separation scheme
proved useful in 1989 in. assisting the effective management
of the institution and it was decided to continue it in 1990.
A program was also initiated to promote career developiment for supporting staff.

The terms and conditions of service for professional
staff assigned to the Bank’s Resident and Regional Offices
in the field were reviewed and improvernents were made to
establish a more standardized systern of allowances and
benefits consistent with the different situations in the various
locations.

Based on developments in the compensation levels and
practices of the Bank's comparator organizations, and also
on cost-of-living considerations, salaries of professional and
supporting staff were reviewed and adjusted upwards in
1989. Professional sial{ salaries were increased by 7.7 per
cent and the rental subsidy scheme was reviewed and revised
to provide greater relief [rom rapidly rising housing costs in
Manila, Supporting slaff were awarded a salary raise of 5
per cent and a year-end bonus payment of one month's
salary in addilion to the mid-year bonus of a similar arniount.

sional and supporting staff covering both active staff and
retirees was also implemented,

system in the Bank’s main comparator organization, the
World Bank, a study has been initiated of a new professional
staff salary policy and structure. It is planned that Board
consideration of this will occur during 1990.

contractor's schedule. These are, however, being kept
under constant review.

to $106.3 million against the original Budeet of $109.4
million, represeriling a utilization rate af 97 per cent. The

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits,

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial staternents are
free of material misstatement. An audit inchides examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the finaricial statements. An atxiit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Asian Development Rank - Ordinary Capital Resources at 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1988 and

the results of its aperations-and its cash flows for the years then ended In conformity with generally accepted

ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK - ORDINARY CAPITAL RESOURCES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1989 and 31 December 1988

NOTE A —- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Functional Currencies and Reporting Currency

The currencies of members are functional currencies. The
reporling currency is the United States dollar, and the financial
statements are expressed in thousands af currebt United States
dollars.

Valuation of Cupital Stack

The capital stock is defined in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the

Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank (ihe Charter) "in
terms of United Slates dollars of the weight and fineness in
effect on 31 January 1966" {ihe 1966 dollar) and the value of
each share is defined as 10,000 1966 dollars. The capital
stock had historically been translated into the current United
States dollar fthe Bank’s unit of account) on the basis of its par
value in terms of gold. From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the
rale arrived at on this basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar.
Since 1 April 1978, at which time the Second Amendinent to
the Articles of Agreernent of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF} came into effect, currencies no longer have par vahies in
terms of gold. Pending the Bank's selection of the appropriate
successor to the 1966 dollar, the capital stock has been valued
for purposes of these financial sialements in terms of the
Special Drawing Right (SDR) at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMP, with each share valued
ai SDR 10,000,

As of 31 December 1989, the value of the SDR in terms of
the current Uniied States dollar was $1.31416 ($1,34570 —
1988) giving a value for gach share of the Hank's capital
equivalent to $13,141.60 ($13,457,00 ~ 1988), However, the
Bank coukl decide to fix the value of each share at $12,063.50
based on the 31 March 1978 par value of the United States
dollar in terms of gold. .

Translation of Currencies

Assets and abilities are translated from their functional
cunrencies to the reporting currency generally at the applicable
rates of exchange at the end of a reporting period. Income
and expense amounts are translated for each semi-monthly
period generally at the applicable rates of exchunge at the
beginning of each period; such practice approximates the
application of average rates im effect dusing the period.
Translation adjustments other than those relating lo maintenance
of value of currency holdings (see Notes F and J), are charged
or credited to “Accumulated trarslavon adjusiments”, Exchange
gains or jJosses on currency transaclious amang functional
currencies are included in income. Currency swaps made in
connection with borrowings are hedged by forward exchange
commitments and, accordingly, do not result in any net
exchange gain or loss.

Investments

Investment securities are reported: at cost or amortized cost.
Gains and losses on sales of investments are measured by the
difference between average cost or amortized cost and the net
proceeds of sales, ¢

Loans

The Bank's loans have been made te or guaranteed by
members or their governments, with the exception of loans to
the private sector, and have maturities ranging between 10 and
30 years. The Bank requires its borrowers to absorb exchange
tisks attributable to fluctuations in the value of the curreticies
which it has disbursed. The Kank has not suffered any loan
losses to date: and follows a policy of not taking part in debt
tescheduling agreements,

Prior to 1 duly 1986, the lending rate of the Bank was based
on a fixed lending rate system under which loans carried interest
rates fixed at the time of loan approval for the entire life of the
loans. Effective 1 duty 1986, the Bank adopted a pool-based
variable lending rate system for those loans approved on or after
that date plus certain others at the option of the borrowers.

For loans to the private sector, interest is charged at negotiated
rates.

Equity Investments

The Bank's equily investments are made in-privale enterprises
located in developing member countries and include the Bank's
investment in 1989 of $34,984,000 in Asian Finance and
Investment Corporation Ltd. (AFIC},

Equity investments are reported at cost, net of allowance for
possible losses. Such allowance is determined annually based
on managernent's evaluation of potential losses in the equity
investments portfolio,

Property, Furniture and Cquipment

The headquarters buflding of the Bank, including land, facilities
and fixtures and the initial cost of necessary staff amenities and
other related furnishings have been provided to the Bank by the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 1989 and 31 December 1988

investments resulted in a net loss of $53,000 ($308,000 1988). The annualized rate of return on the average investrnents
held during the year, based on the portfolio held at the
beginning and end of each month, including realized gains and
losses, was 9.89% (7.55% - 1988}.

NOTE D ~ ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES
: AND ADMINISTRATION CHARGE

Administrative expenses inchide an administration charge
amounting to $44,975,000 ($45,729,000 - 1988). The charge
represents an apportionment of all administrative expenses of
the Bank (other than those appertaining directly to ordinary
operations and special operations) based on the number of loans
and equity investments approved for the year

NOTE E - SET-ASIDE RESOURCES

Pursuant to the previsions of Article 19, paragraph 1 (I) of the
Articles of Agreement Establishing the Bank, the Board of
Governors has authorized the setting aside of 10% of the
unimpaired "paid-in" capital paid by members pursuant to
Articla 6, paragraph 2 {a) and of the convertible currency
portion paid by members pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 2 {b)
as of 28 Apri! 1973, to be used as 2 part of the Special Funds

of the Bank. The capttal so set aside was allocated and
transferred from the Ordinary Capital Resources to the Fund as
Set-Aside Resources.

The capital stock of the Bank is defined in Article 4,
paragraph 1 "in terms of United States dollars of the
weight and fineness in effect on 31 January 1966" {the 1966
dollar). Therefore, Set-Aside Resources had historically been
translated into the current United States dollar (the Bank's unit
of account}, on the basis of its par value in terms of gold.
From 1973 until 31 March 1978, the rate arnved at on this
basis was $1.20635 per 1966 dollar. Since 1 April 1978, at
which time the Second Amendment to the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came into
effect, currencies no langer have par values in terms of gold.
Pending the Bank’s selection of the appropriate successor to the
1966 dollar, the Set-Aside Resources has been valued for
purposes of the accompanying financial statements in terms of
the Special Drawing Right (SDR), at the value in current United
States dollars as computed by the IMF. As of 31 December
1989, the value of the SDR in terms of the current United
States dollar was $1,31416 ($1.34570 - 1988). On this basis,
Set Aside Resourcas amounted to $62,567,000 ($64,068,000
~ 1988). If the capital stock of the Bank as of 31 Decemher
1989 had been valued in terms of $12,063.50 per share, SetAside Resources would have been $57,434,000Deloitte &

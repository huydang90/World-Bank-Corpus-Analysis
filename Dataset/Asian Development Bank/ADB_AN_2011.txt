About the Asian Development Bank

ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing
member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the
region’s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world’s poor: 1.8 billion people
who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is
committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally
sustainable growth, and regional integration.

Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main
instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity
investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.

from the President

significant progress has been made in reducing income poverty, large pockets of deprivation
remain, and disparities both within and across countries continue to grow.

Nearly half of Asia’s citizens—about 1.8 billion people—still live on less than $2 a day.
Many reside in megacities with populations of over 10 million, where pollution compounds the
problems associated with mass urbanization.

Low-income countries struggle to sustain economic growth and reduce poverty. At the same
time, a substantial proportion of the region’s poor today live in middle-income countries. So while
Asia’s rapid expansion over the past 2 decades has led to fewer people living in poverty, we are
increasingly concerned that the benefits of economic growth have not been equally shared. Large
gaps in income, services, and opportunities must be bridged, given that the region is far behind
several key Millennium Development Goals targets.

Meanwhile, economic uncertainty still hovers over the global economy, and it has potential
implications for ADB’s developing member countries. In 2011, many developing Asian economies
were affected by slowing exports. Given the significantly increased role of Asia in the global
economy, it is all the more imperative for the region to do everything in its power to foster
sustainable and inclusive growth. To do this, Asia must rebalance its growth paradigm toward
more reliance on domestic and regional demand, while still maintaining its openness within the
global economy. In this way, Asia can also build its own markets and increasingly contribute to
global growth.

To make the process of economic expansion more conducive to reducing poverty,
ADB focuses on three primary strategic agendas: inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable
growth, and regional integration. We support our developing member countries in pursuing these
strategies with all the instruments at our disposal—from project finance and technical assistance
to knowledge products and policy dialogue.

To help meet the region’s ongoing and emerging development challenges, ADB’s operations
in 2011 grew to $21.72 billion. Of this total, $14.02 billion was financed by ADB and Special
Funds, and $7.69 billion by cofinancing partners. ADB’s operations in 2011 addressed various
development issues, including energy efficiency, urban infrastructure, road connectivity, regional
cooperation, and education.

As demand for ADB’s assistance continues to grow, it is critical to ensure we mobilize
the resources needed to respond. In 2011, ADB’s cofinancing operations continued to extend
the impact of each dollar of development assistance, and support private sector development.
Official cofinancing increased by 13.2% to $3.5 billion. Meanwhile, commercial cofinancing
grew sharply from $2.3 billion in 2010 to $4.2 billion, and our private sector operations targeted
support for critical infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the promotion of
renewable energy.

ADB assistance is particularly needed in our poorer member countries. To this end, the Asian
Development Fund (ADF) XI replenishment was undertaken, and strong commitment was shown
by donors. This is encouraging and vital for implementing our long-term strategy.

Pp overty reduction remains the greatest challenge for developing Asia and the Pacific. AlthoughMessage from the President

 

In addition to boosting resources, we must continue to improve our institutional effectiveness,
development results, and operational efficiency. ADB’s ongoing transformation is a top priority.
Given the size of the challenges and the limits on our resources, it is essential that we continue
to reform ourselves to better respond to the needs and voices of all the stakeholders.

 

Since its founding in 1966, ADB has been driven by

an inspiration and dedication to improving people’s lives
in Asia and the Pacific. By targeting our investments
wisely, in partnership with our developing member
countries and other stakeholders, we can alleviate
poverty and help create a world in which everyone can
share in the benefits of sustained and inclusive growth.

 

ADB continues its endeavor toward a more results-oriented and transparent organization.
We are now more selective in our operations to ensure a better alignment between clients’ needs
and ADB’s strengths. The Public Communications Policy and the Accountability Mechanism will
help ADB stay at the forefront of transparency and accountability. Measures to improve project
performance and outcomes optimize our local presence and allow ADB to be more responsive
to clients.

Since its founding in 1966, ADB has been driven by an inspiration and dedication to improving
people’s lives in Asia and the Pacific. By targeting our investments wisely, in partnership with our
developing member countries and other stakeholders, we can alleviate poverty and help create a

approval of policies, loans, grants, and guarantees. As their representative, the Board plays a
vital role in ensuring that ADB shareholders’ guidance is implemented.

Rapid growth in Asia and the Pacific in recent decades has led to a dramatic reduction in
poverty, but inequalities remain and have worsened in a number of countries. In 2011, the Board
continued to direct the implementation of Strategy 2020—the long-term strategic framework that
charts the course for ADB to become an even more effective development institution and meet
the region’s development challenges. To this end, the Board’s priorities included promoting rapid
but sustainable and inclusive growth, improving ADB’s portfolio management, and enhancing
human resources management.

Reflecting ADB’s strategic direction, the Board focused in particular on capacity development,
private sector development, good governance, knowledge management, food security, gender
equity, environmental sustainability, and regional cooperation and partnerships. The Board also
provided comments and suggestions on operational plans for the water and finance sectors. To
support regional integration, it approved an equity contribution of $150 million for the innovative
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Infrastructure Fund.'

To improve ADB’s development effectiveness, the Board approved a new policy on ADB’s

crisis response instruments. The Board also approved mainstreaming nonsovereign public sector
financing. By enabling direct financial assistance to subsovereign entities, the new modality will
help support decentralization processes in Asia and the Pacific.

To reaffirm ADB’s commitment to inclusion, transparency, and accountability, the Board
approved a new Public Communications Policy. This revised policy, which refines disclosure
requirements for ADB documents, aims to enhance stakeholders’ trust in and ability to engage
with ADB, thereby increasing the effectiveness of ADB operations. The Board also approved
refinements to ADB’s corporate results framework and suggested areas to consider during the
2012 comprehensive review.

Working to improve portfolio performance, the Board approved the establishment of a project
design facility on a pilot basis to provide quick-disbursing resources for the formulation of projects,
allowing for detailed engineering design and broader project and program preparatory work.

The Board reviewed ADB’s liquidity policy and considered a comprehensive review of the
competitiveness of compensation for national and administrative staff. It also reviewed ADB’s
sovereign loan charges for ordinary capital resources lending, leading to the introduction of
maturity-based loan pricing.

The review of the Accountability Mechanism, initiated in 2010, continued during the year.
The mechanism provides a forum where people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects
can be heard, seek solutions to their problems, and report ADB’s alleged noncompliance with its
operational policies and procedures. ADB expects the review to be completed in 2012.

The Board facilitated the election process of the President, resulting in the Board of Governors
electing Haruhiko Kuroda as ADB President and Chairman of the Board of Directors for another
term of 5 years, starting 24 November. The Board approved the appointments of Stephen Groff and
Thierry de Longuemar as vice-presidents and a new role for Vice-President Bindu Lohani overseeing
knowledge management and sustainable development. It also approved the appointment of
Vinod Thomas as director general of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED).

Country Partnership Strategies

The country partnership strategy sets out the ways in which ADB can most effectively work with its
developing member countries, with specific consideration of each country’s challenges and priorities.
It also enables ADB to evaluate a country’s development performance over the strategy period.

The Board endorsed six country partnership strategies: Bangladesh, Cambodia,
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste. It also
endorsed an interim country partnership strategy for Malaysia and a regional cooperation strategy
for South Asia.

Meetings

The Board held 51 formal meetings, 2 executive sessions, and 33 informal seminars. To continue
assisting the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region, Board members attended
the donors’ meetings on the 10th replenishment of the Asian Development Fund held in Manila
in September and in Dhaka in December. In October, the Board and Management participated
in a 1-day retreat to discuss inclusive growth and ADB’s portfolio management and measures
for improvement.

reduction in poverty, it still remains a tremendous development challenge. At the same time,
widening inequalities have become an emerging concern. In recognition of this, ADB’s longterm strategy, Strategy 2020,' calls for a focus on inclusive growth to be one of ADB’s three
strategic agendas along with environmentally sustainable growth and regional integration. The

ADF XI Replenishment

The Asian Development Fund (ADF) has been a major instrument of concessional financing for
ADB since 1973. It offers loans at very low interest rates, as well as grants, to respond to development
challenges in ADB’s poorest borrowing countries. ADF resources come from the contributions of
ADB’s member countries, periodically replenished, and from reflows from ADF loan repayments.

At the 2011 Annual Meeting in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, ADF deputies and ADB Management held
their annual consultation to prepare for the negotiations of the 10th replenishment of the ADF
(ADF XD), which will cover the period 2013-2016.

Two ADF XI replenishment meetings were held in 2011. The first took place in Manila on
8-9 September, followed by a meeting in Dhaka on S—6 December. At both these events, ADB
highlighted the urgent need for ADF countries to intensify their efforts to achieve the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) and called for continued support and generous contributions to ADF XI,
as it will be the last replenishment before the MDG target date of 2015. Participants recognized
the continued need for ADF support, given the development challenges still facing ADF countries.

To maximize the efficiency and impact of the ADF, donors noted that it should continue
to pursue Strategy 2020 priorities—inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth,
and regional integration—under ADF XI. To support these priorities, ADB will give special
consideration to three particularly relevant themes: gender, fragile and conflict-affected situations,
and food security. Deputies emphasized the role the ADF can play in promoting private sector
development and investment, and good governance in ADF countries.

Deputies welcomed the two evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Department of ADF
operations and of managing for development results, noting that ADB had undertaken substantial
reforms, which have resulted in improved internal governance and stronger focus on results.
A number of areas for improvement remain, including project sustainability and achievement
of outcomes.

With respect to replenishment scenarios, deputies recognized the need for continued strong
support for the ADF while also acknowledging the difficult economic and financial environment.
Deputies recognized the challenges of working in ADF countries, in particular the need to
enhance capacity. In view of this, they called for a strong replenishment of the Technical Assistance
Special Fund.

Deputies expressed general satisfaction with the implementation of the performance-based
allocation system. They supported ADB’s proposals to maintain the Pacific set-aside at 4.5% of
total performance-based allocation resources, to continue earmarking 10% of ADF resources for
the Regional Cooperation and Integration set-aside, and to bring forward the end of the postconflict phaseout for Timor-Leste from 2014 to 2012. ADB also presented preliminary scenarios
of financial capacity and a number of options to further enhance ADF XI internal resources.

Deputies expressed broad support for the various financial enhancement options. These
included seeking the approval of the Board to exercise the accelerated repayment clause for
outstanding loans to ADF graduates, except for the Cook Islands; hardening lending terms to blend
countries, which have access to both the ADF and ADB’s ordinary capital resources; and adjusting
the prudential minimum liquidity to 81%. There was broad consensus among deputies that pro rata
rights do not achieve their intended effect. However, views were mixed about alternative measures.

The ADF XI replenishment negotiations are expected to conclude in 2012.

Policy Reviews

Public Communications Policy Review

ADB completed a review of its 2005 Public Communications Policy (PCP) in October 2011.
The revised policy incorporates comments received from various stakeholders, including
beneficiaries and people otherwise affected by development activities, through surveys and
extensive consultation. The new PCP, which will take effect on 2 April 2012, keeps ADB at the
cutting edge of transparency best practices.

 

18Policy and Strategy Overview

 

While the main thrust of the 2005 PCP is unchanged, in particular the presumption in favor
of disclosure, the new PCP includes key revisions to expand and speed up access to information.
These include the release of more information, such as audited project accounts of ADB-financed
sovereign projects; earlier release of documents (simultaneous disclosure of information circulated to ADB’s Board of Directors for a decision); creation of an independent appeals panel (with
three international experts) as a second tier of the appeals process; clarification of the exceptions
to disclosure; and strengthened project communications.

ADB will continue to engage with various stakeholders to ensure successful implementation
of the new PCP. To this end, a communications plan is being formulated and the translation
framework is being reviewed. A report will be prepared on an annual basis to assess the progress
of the implementation of the new policy.

Accountability Mechanism Review

A Joint Board—Management working group is overseeing the ongoing review of ADB’s 2003
Accountability Mechanism. The review is assessing the effectiveness of the Accountability
Mechanism as an independent forum to allow people adversely affected by ADB-assisted projects
to voice problems, seek solutions, and report alleged violations by ADB of its operational policies
and procedures. Extensive multi-stakeholder and web-based consultations have been carried out
since June 2010. Feedback has been systematically integrated into the review process, which
has included two consultation papers and two working papers. The consultation papers were
completed in February and June 2011. The working papers were considered by the Board in
April and October 2011. The review is expected to be concluded in early 2012.

Operational Plans

To facilitate the implementation of Strategy 2020, ADB is gradually introducing operational
plans to guide ADB operations in specific sectors and thematic areas. In 2011, ADB approved
operational plans for the finance? and water’ sectors. (See Chapter 5, Sector and Thematic
Highlights.) ADB has also initiated preparation of operational plans for the environment, public—
private partnerships, social protection, and the urban sector, which are expected to be completed
in 2012.

Enhancing ADB’s Financing Instruments
Establishing the Project Design Facility

On 12 April 2011, the Board approved, for a 3-year pilot implementation from 2011 to
2013, the project design facility that will provide loan advances to fund design and project
preparation activities.* Its aim is to fund detailed design activities and feasibility studies
(if needed) before an ADB project is approved. This will contribute to total project readiness and
help avoid start-up and disbursement delays in ADB-funded projects. Since detailed engineering
design is key to infrastructure development, the project design facility is expected to facilitate

Review of ADB’s Policy-Based Lending

The Board approved reforms to ADB’s policy-based lending (PBL) on 14 July 2011.5 The PBL
reforms comprise two main elements: mainstreaming medium-term programmatic budget support
and enhancing ADB’s short-term crisis response capacity.

The former incorporates the latest best practices in general budget support in international financial
institutions (and development partners) aligned with structural reforms in developing countries.
The refined PBL policy emphasizes the importance of country ownership and flexibility in design and
implementation of reforms in a number of the Strategy 2020 priority areas—including finance and
private sector development, governance, and institutional development.

The PBL mainstreamed the countercyclical support facility established at the time of the
global economic crisis in 2009,° to provide budget support to DMCs’ fiscal stimulus packages.
The PBL reforms also improved flexibility in term setting of countercyclical support facility and
special PBL for balance-of-payments support. The PBL reforms took effect on 14 October 2011.

Mainstreaming Nonsovereign Public Sector Financing

The nonsovereign public sector financing facility (NSP) enables ADB to provide to the public
sector financial assistance, which is not guaranteed by a central government. The instrument was
introduced in 2005 for a pilot phase.” The Board mainstreamed the facility in September 2011.8
Eligible public sector entities are subnational governments (including municipalities) and their
companies, as well as state-owned enterprises. The mainstreaming of NSP allows ADB to support and
cater to the needs of its expanded client base. It aims to support decentralization processes in many
DMCs, which are increasingly divesting greater responsibility and autonomy for public services to
subnational governments, their companies, or state-owned enterprises. ADB can play a catalytic role
in assisting them to access new funds, particularly for activities that have strong development impacts.

Review of ADB’s Loan Charges

ADB has introduced maturity-based pricing on new London interbank offered rate-based loans
to sovereign borrowers or with sovereign guarantees, and local currency loans with sovereign
guarantees, for which loan negotiations are completed on, or after, 1 April 2012. The introduction
of maturity-based pricing reflects ADB’s continuous commitment to safeguard ADB’s financial
strength based on sound banking principles, while striving to provide resources for development
lending at the lowest, most stable funding costs and on the most reasonable terms.

20Policy and Strategy Overview

 

 

Incorporating Inclusive Growth into ADB Operations

ADB's long-term vision for the region, Strategy 2020, identified inclusive growth as one of its
three strategic agendas. This is supported by three mutually reinforcing pillars. There should
be high and sustainable growth that creates and expands economic opportunities. There
should be broad access to these opportunities to ensure everyone can participate in and
benefit from growth. In addition, there should be a strong social safety net to assist the poor

and vulnerable.

In 2011, ADB actively promoted the inclusive growth agenda in its operations. Of the
seven country partnership strategies (CPSs) prepared during the year, six emphasized inclusive
growth and incorporated inclusive growth indicators. All CPSs approved in 2010 and 2011
included gender strategies and sector gender diagnostics.

In 2011, the Financial Sector Operational
Plan and the Water Operational Plan
2011-2020 were approved. Both plans
provide strategic directions for promoting
inclusive growth in sector operations,
emphasize the targeting of investments in
poorer regions and rural areas, and aim to
provide poor households with affordable
access to services. These include clean
water and inclusive financial services, such
as microfinance, mobile banking, housing
finance, and financing for small and

 

  

medium-sized enterprises.

Projects that support inclusiveness
continued to comprise a significant
proportion of overall operations.

In 2011, 43.8% of all approved projects
supported inclusiveness. They address
poverty reduction directly or indirectly through social protection/safety nets, inclusive finance and
microfinance, and support for rural development and technical education and skills development.

A number of research and analytical studies were also undertaken in 2011 to boost ADB's
understanding of how inclusive growth can be promoted and how it relates to other strategic
objectives. For example, the joint ADB-United Nations Development Programme-Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific Regional MDG Report 2011/12, Accelerating
Equitable Achievement of the MDGs, was finalized and will be launched in early 2012.

The ADB report Women and Labour Markets in Asia: Rebalancing for Gender Equality
points to a transition to a job-creating, sustainable, and inclusive growth trend that will
promote gender equality in the labor market. In addition, ADB and Social Protection:
Challenges and Opportunities takes stock of ADB’s support for social protection from 1996
up to 2013 and the progress with implementing ADB's Social Protection Strategy.

Several other measures were initiated in 2011 to improve monitoring of inclusive growth
in ADB's developing member countries, as well as better assess how ADB itself supports it in
the region. The Economics and Research Department has established a set of 35 indicators
to monitor countries’ progress on inclusive growth. ADB’s overall contribution to inclusive
growth is monitored through its corporate results framework. A review of the results
framework initiated in 2011 will be completed in 2012.

Development Effectiveness Review 2010 continued

 

After 4 years of reporting on ADB’s performance, the annual Development Effectiveness Review
(DEfR) has become an established instrument by which Management can track performance
and analyze key factors that support it. Through the DEfR process, ADB uses the Strategy 2020
results framework to monitor performance, identify issues, and solve problems.

The 2010 DEfR demonstrated that ADB’s developing member countries continued to reduce
income poverty, improve gender equality, and achieve other development results. Despite the
progress, the Asia and Pacific region is unlikely to meet 6 of the 12 Millennium Development
Goal targets.

ADB continued to improve many aspects of its operational and organizational effectiveness
while pointing out areas requiring further attention. ADB was on track to achieve 2009-2012
output targets for the core sectors—infrastructure (energy, transport, and water), education,
and finance.

However, effectiveness of recently completed projects fell short of targets, particularly
in water and finance. The review cited complex designs, inadequate supervision, and
implementation shortcomings as reasons behind weaker performance. In response,

ADB examined the causes of poor outcomes and adopted further corrective actions,
including the development of operational plans for finance and water to improve performance
in these sectors.

ADB improved the design quality of new operations, accelerated project start-ups, disbursed
funds rapidly, and expanded overall cofinancing. To capture emerging risks better and drive
timely actions, it also adopted a new portfolio performance rating system.

ADB won the prestigious 2011 Asian Most Admired Knowledge Enterprises (MAKE) award,

a testament to the way it has improved its knowledge management. ADB also made good
progress in ensuring that staff are engaged, and staffing levels in operations and field offices are
on track to meet 2012 targets.

Budget adequacy remained offtrack as the size of operations continued to grow.

In response, ADB increased its budget for internal administrative expenses while expanding

eight countries.' In addition, to improve the quality of project design and monitoring frameworks,
ADB continued to implement quality assurance mechanisms and develop staff capacity.

The ADB-supported Asia—Pacific Community of Practice on Managing for Development
Results (APCoP) continued to support the efforts of developing member countries (DMCs) in
improving their public sector management systems’ focus on delivering results. In September,
APCoP, together with the communities of practice on MfDR from Africa and South America,
endorsed the Seoul Statement on Results. This statement concluded that an effective public
sector, supported by appropriate management systems, reinforces a country’s capacity to achieve
development results, boosts accountability for doing so, and improves ownership of donorfinanced development projects.

The 2011 special evaluation study by the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) on the
implementation of ADB’s MfDR agenda concluded that ADB has achieved most of the intended
results of the MfDR Action Plan. Its overall rating was successful.

Progress on Aid Effectiveness Agenda

ADB played a significant role in ensuring that Asia and Pacific perspectives formed an integral
part of the agenda and outcomes of the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness (HLF-4),
held on 29 November—1 December 2011 in Busan, Republic of Korea.

The HLF-4 reviewed progress made since the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness
and determined the general direction of the future aid framework. ADB’s main contributions were
to highlight the role of aid in catalyzing resources from the private sector, and the importance
of strengthening country systems and institutions to improve development effectiveness. ADB
supported discussions on the evolving role of some large DMCs in building capacity of developing
countries and facilitating South-South economic links.

The main outcome of HLF-4 was the endorsement of the Busan Partnership for Effective
Development Cooperation by all stakeholders, including civil society organizations, and the providers
of private funds. This outcome document reiterates the commitments and actions set out in the 2005
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action, particularly those on
country ownership of development priorities and use of country systems, while increasing the focus
on results, transparency and accountability, and broader development partnerships.

ADB would work closely with the development community to agree on global-level indicators
and a process for monitoring the Busan partnership agreement.

Ensuring Accountability and Compliance

The ADB Accountability Mechanism provides an independent forum for people adversely affected
by ADB-assisted projects to voice complaints and seek solutions to their problems. This takes
place through consultation and facilitation. Affected people may also request an investigation
of whether ADB has complied with its operational policies and procedures. The mechanism is
designed to contribute to ADB’s development effectiveness and to improve project quality.

The mechanism has two phases: consultation and problem solving conducted by the Office of
the Special Project Facilitator (OSPF), and compliance review led by the independent Compliance
Review Panel (CRP).

ADB received seven complaints in 2011 through the OSPF, two of which met its eligibility
criteria (the eligibility of two is pending). It closed three complaints. Through the Office of the
Compliance Review Panel (OCRP), it received two requests for compliance review, which were
declared eligible, and five requests, which were outside the scope of the Accountability Mechanism.

The CRP concluded its annual monitoring of remedial actions for the Sri Lanka Southern
Transport Development Project and issued the fifth and final annual monitoring report.

ADB conducted joint outreach missions through OSPF and OCRP (with the participation of the
NGO and Civil Society Center) to Fiji, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea,
Tonga, and Viet Nam. Under a regional technical assistance, OCRP financed a comparative analysis
of international accountability mechanisms and cosponsored an event at the annual meeting of these.
It also commissioned a series of studies of Pacific DMC indigenous accountability mechanisms.

The review of the Accountability Mechanism continued during the year and is expected to
be concluded in early 2012. (See also Chapter 3, Policy and Strategy Overview, which discusses
the Accountability Mechanism review in more detail.)

Independent Evaluation

Independent Evaluation for Development Effectiveness

IED helps ADB to continuously improve its development effectiveness and accountability to
stakeholders. ADB’s new policy-based lending policy incorporates many recommendations and
lessons from the 2011 real-time evaluation of ADB’s response to the global economic crisis.
The findings on the development effectiveness of Asian Development Fund (ADF) operations
provided important inputs for ADB’s ADF replenishment proposals and were discussed at the
Second ADF XI Replenishment Meeting in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Country assistance program evaluations for Uzbekistan and the Maldives assessed that ADB
support to these countries had been successful and less than successful, respectively.

The evaluations found that strong government commitment to institutional changes and
policy reforms, together with adequate support from executing and implementing agencies,
is essential for improved development outcomes. Continued ADB engagement and long-term
focus within a sector, the use of demonstration projects that focus on economically feasible
innovations, and support for sector analyses based on government priorities and commitment to
reform contribute to the success of programs.

The validations of the final reviews of country partnership strategies confirmed assessments
that ADB support had been successful in Indonesia, Solomon Islands, and Sri Lanka, and partly
successful in Kazakhstan and Timor-Leste. Appropriate sector selections for ADB interventions,
sound technical designs and innovation, strong government commitments, and good coordination
with development partners contributed to successful outcomes.

The less-than-successful performance of ADB support was due to underestimation of
operational complexities of domestic conflicts and crises in Timor-Leste; as well as relatively
weak government ownership of the ADB country strategy and programs, changing country
circumstances, and international coordination issues in Kazakhstan.

An ADB-wide client perception survey of IED has shown that clients consider it to be
trustworthy and that they value its independence. However, IED could boost its effectiveness by
providing more directly operational and clearly evidence-based recommendations.

Learning from Independent Evaluation

The evaluation of ADB’s response to the global economic crisis showed that there can be a
trade-off between crisis-related and regular operations. ADB’s future response to crises could
be improved by reinforcing surveillance in more countries and timeliness of support, creating a
separate concessional crisis support window, having a standby crisis support facility, and making
eligibility assessment more rigorous. Building social protection systems in collaboration with
development partners will enhance DMCs’ resilience to crises.

The development effectiveness of the ADF can be enhanced by a stronger focus on efficiency and
sustainability issues during implementation, strengthening the capacity of DMC institutions in key
sectors, adopting a more holistic approach to project design with a sharper focus on inclusive growth,
introducing new approaches to address environmental challenges, strengthening regional cooperation
and integration, and countering the effects of the global economic and financial crises more flexibly.

Noticeable improvements in energy efficiency can be achieved through rational energy
pricing and regulation to address technology issues, build awareness, and mitigate other barriers—
such as unreliable power supply and weak supply chains.

ADB’s progress in MfDR compares well with that of other multilateral development
banks (MDBs). ADB’s DEfR has evolved into a valued tool for reporting corporate results and
driving the results agenda. Better quality of design and monitoring frameworks and systematic
data collection will further improve results at the project and strategic levels. Placing a greater
emphasis on MfDR capacity building in DMCs could also improve results orientation at the
corporate, country, and sector and thematic levels.

The Asian Development Bank Institute will benefit from carrying out periodic self-assessments
to make midcourse changes to its products and services as required, and by strengthening its
institutional networks through more formal partnership frameworks.

The inclusiveness of ADB operations could be enhanced through better targeting, improved
access, and promotion of complementary activities for better results.

Capacity Development and Knowledge Dissemination

In 2011, IED introduced a new 5-month program to provide on-the-job training to evaluators from
DMC governments. Three government officials from the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia,
and the Philippines, respectively, completed the program, and the aim is to continue it until 2014.

In addition, IED agreed to provide continued support to the Shanghai International Program for
Development Evaluation Training in collaboration with the World Bank Independent Evaluation
Group (IEG) and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, and the Regional Centers
for Learning on Evaluation and Results Program, administered by IEG, where IED supports the
development of monitoring and evaluation capacity in South Asia.

IED’s expanding dissemination activities included external dissemination and outreach
through social sites and information gateways, greater engagement with the media, hosting of
knowledge sharing and learning events in ADB in collaboration with other institutions, as well
as internal dissemination.

An Asian perspective on energy efficiency and the need to balance supply-side and demandside management was disseminated at the 17th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change in Durban, South Africa.

Strengthening Learning

Knowledge and Learning for Organizational Effectiveness

The Knowledge Management Framework crafted in 2004 began ADB’s evolution into a learning
institution that delivers knowledge for development effectiveness in Asia and the Pacific. In 2011,
these 7-year efforts were rewarded with global recognition.

With a citation for collaborative, enterprise-wide knowledge sharing, ADB’s first-ever win
in the prestigious Asian Most Admired Knowledge Enterprises award—in which it was one of
20 top Asian entities (and one of only four from the public sector) picked by a panel of Fortune 500
executives and knowledge management experts—confirms ADB’s progress.

One of the main reasons for the accolade was ADB’s successful completion of the Knowledge
Management Action Plan, 2009-2011. This comprised a succinct set of actions and outputs
organized into four priorities: sharpening the knowledge focus in ADB’s operations, empowering
communities of practice (CoPs), strengthening external knowledge partnerships, and further
enhancing staff learning and development.

To sharpen focus on, and improve understanding of, knowledge in its operations, ADB
completed three studies in 2011. The first investigated demand for ADB knowledge products

Ensuring Better-Targeted Loans for Housing in Sri Lanka

To assess the client welfare impacts of its housing loans, the Independent Evaluation
Department (IED) undertook an evaluation study of the housing finance component of ADB's
Urban Development and Low-Income Housing Project in Sri Lanka. This $103 million project,
completed in 2005, set out to improve the living conditions and quality of life and increase the
access of low-income families to formal housing finance, providing 28,378 loans to households
around the country. The project had four components, including urban infrastructure of 62% and
housing loans of 26% of the total project cost. For the housing loans, IED discovered that only 1%
of loan beneficiaries were from the lowest 10% of the income distribution, because market-based
conventional loan terms and proceeds and standards made the loans not affordable to the very
poor. Impacts on education and health in project areas were positive but limited to groups with
relatively higher education of the household heads. The evaluation recommended better targeting
of poorer households to improve the socioeconomic impact of low-income housing finance
projects. It also recommended loans with higher ceilings and longer tenor for more beneficial
education and health impacts on children. (PHOTO: BINH NGUYEN)

through resident missions and regional offices and pointed to the need to better identify audiences
and prepare matching products. The second identified learning issues that might be resolved with
better knowledge classification, enabling efficient retrieval and sharing of data, information,
and knowledge. The third revealed the increasing emphasis in country partnership strategies,
reports and recommendations to the President, and technical assistance reports on knowledge
management and communications.

To further empower the 14 CoPs it hosts, ADB engaged CoP members in the peer review
process for country partnership strategies and lending products. It involved CoP leaders in

for learning, from flash animations to
e-learning modules. Complementing
these were new avenues for bringing knowledge closer to staff. One example is i.prompt.u,
the first-ever e-newsletter for CoPs. It is database-driven, with each issue harvesting for wider
impact the news, events, and knowledge products promoted by individual CoPs.

ADB’s work on building a living archive, initiated in 2008, proceeded with the construction
of an interactive multimedia platform showcasing ADB’s accomplishments in sustainable
development. The platform is based on an ADB and a world sustainable development timeline,
ADB historical milestones, and a timeline of ADB-hosted CoPs. It highlights firsts and fosters
learning. It is intended to energize staff recruitment and induction, enrich conferences and other
events, and boost ADB’s profile externally.

ADB’s drive to broaden understanding of tools, methods, and approaches for knowledge
management and learning continued through the Knowledge Solutions and Knowledge
Showcases series.

 

Dissemination, Disclosure, and Transparency

ADB continued to strengthen its external and internal relations activities to boost its profile as a
knowledge leader and an organization that delivers results. Key messages about ADB’s development
impacts and knowledge solutions were widely disseminated through a variety of communication
channels. These included speaking engagements, media, multimedia, the web, and publications.

In 2011, ADB Management spoke at 183 events, compared to 166 in 2010, representing an
increase of over 10%. ADB’s profile and reputation were sustained via more than 3,100 mentions
in target media, including 15 front-page articles in major international newspapers and about 340
interviews with international newspapers, magazines, and TV and radio stations. ADB’s flagship
economic report, Asian Development Outlook, which focused on the growing importance of
South-South economic links, was covered in more than 650 news articles and news analyses when
it was released in April.

 

30Delivering an Effective Organization

 

After extensive internal and external reviews, the public website (www.adb.org) was comprehensively revamped to improve its look and feel, information architecture, website technology,
and search capabilities.

In June, the introduction of social media guidelines paved the way for a more visible and
strategic ADB presence on the most widely used social media, Facebook, Scribd, Twitter,
and YouTube. To share its knowledge and demonstrate its work in the region, ADB also made
use of channels such as direct marketing to broadcasters, and global distribution platforms, such
as Newsmarket.

ADB print publications are available through 28 international distributors, the Public
Information Center, and direct orders to the Department of External Relations. Nearly all
publications are available on adb.org as free electronic downloads. Printing and shipping costs
of publications were reduced.

Another vehicle for establishing ADB as a knowledge leader is the quarterly magazine,
Development Asia, which analyzes development challenges in Asia and the Pacific. The magazine
maintained a circulation of 6,000 readers, including 3,000 dedicated subscribers, many of whom
are key decision makers in development organizations, governments, multilateral organizations,
corporations, banks, and investor groups.

Internally, ADB boosted efforts to create awareness of its policies and issues through a variety
of communication platforms, such as the intranet.

To improve access and understanding of ADB’s operations, and in accordance with ADB’s
2005 Public Communications Policy (PCP), the number of documents posted on ADB’s website
has increased each year since 2005, with more than 12,000 posted. A total of 7,348 external
requests for information have been received since 2005, and it has been provided in 96% of cases.
To communicate more effectively with people affected by ADB operations and non-Englishspeaking stakeholders, ADB has increased translations fivefold since 2007.

As discussed in Chapter 3, the revised PCP was approved by the Board in October.

Making the Most of ADB Resources

Improving Human Resources Management

The implementation of Our People Strategy—which sets out ADB’s employee value proposition
(or what ADB offers of value to its staff)—and the associated Human Resources Function
Strategic Framework and Action Plan continued during 2011.

Among the more important human resources reforms were the introduction of the new
grading system for national and administrative staff; the approval of the Ombuds Function and
the recruitment of the first ADB Ombudsperson; the introduction of a new rewards and recognition program, based on a mix of annual performance and “spot” awards; the introduction of
a technical skills registry; and increased support for staff career development through various
training and learning approaches, including the conduct of a career fair for field office positions.

Anew coaching program for managers provided additional support for leadership development,
while the Third Gender Action Program was extended for 2 years. A review of compensation and
benefits for international, national, and administrative staff to align staff pay and benefits more
closely with those of comparators was undertaken, and a new competency framework, which will
be used in the assessment of staff performance and in recruitment, was adopted.

Streamlining Business Processes

Initiated in 2010, streamlined business processes (SBPs) aim to address Strategy 2020 priorities
to enhance ADB’s responsiveness to clients and organizational effectiveness. ADB’s DEfR 2010
reports a decline in sovereign loan delivery time from the pre-SBP record of 19 months in 2009
to 16 months upon introduction of SBPs in 2010.’ The loan delivery time target of 16 months
(for ADB as a whole and ADF) set for 2012 has, therefore, been achieved ahead of schedule.

In 2011, initiatives under ADB’s SBPs centered on further refining lending instruments to
include reforms to ADB’s policy-based lending instruments, which mainstreamed a countercyclical
fund to provide flexibility in ADB’s crisis response. A project development facility was established
so that detailed design can be completed before a project is approved to ensure more accurate cost
estimates and quick start-up. (See Chapter 3, Policy and Strategy Overview.)

Strengthening Risk Management

ADB faces various kinds of risks in its operations, including financial, operational, and other
organizational risks. ADB actively manages these by developing a comprehensive risk management
framework that is designed to develop a risk-aware culture throughout the organization and puts
in place business processes that allow its departments and offices to act cohesively in monitoring,
mitigating, and managing a variety of risks.

In line with Strategy 2020, which envisages a greater role for ADB in financing private
sector development, ADB has made a concerted effort to further strengthen its risk management
capabilities. This is essential to allow ADB to manage the higher risks associated with additional
private sector lending. Key activities in 2011 included

* Budgetary approval in 2010 by the Board for the development of a comprehensive risk

management technology platform to monitor and manage risks more efficiently. Acquisition
and implementation were ongoing during 2011 and will continue into 2012.
+ Implementation of an operational risk management framework in several departments.
+ Close monitoring of developments (such as the European sovereign debt crisis, and
consequent market volatility, including stresses at bank counterparties) and adjustment
of risk exposures accordingly where necessary.
+ Increased staffing for the Office of Risk Management, including establishment of a
Corporate Recovery team.

Audit

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) provides independent and objective audit and advisory
services designed to add value and improve ADB operations. OAG provides assurance that
ADB’s financial and operational controls designed to manage risks and achieve development
objectives are operating efficiently and effectively. By maintaining a complement of professionally
accredited staff, OAG applies a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving
the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.

OAG completed 24 audits in 2011, covering sovereign and nonsovereign operations, treasury
operations, risk management, finance and administration activities, and information systems
and technology activities. OAG monitors the progress of its high and medium risk-rated audit

recommendations and reports on progress on a semiannual basis to Management and the Audit
Committee of the Board.

In 2011, OAG introduced the Diagnostic Reviews of Field Offices, an advisory service
designed to assist field offices in strengthening controls in finance and administration. OAG
visited eight field offices. The results of these reviews were compiled in an annual thematic
report to facilitate learning.

OAG also provided advisory support to address the audit requirements of donors and
cofinanciers; completed three advisory reports on the use of statement of expenditures in technical
assistance, integrated disaster recovery tests, and the Treasury Department’s business process;
conducted a workshop on quality external audit reports in Cambodia in collaboration with the
World Bank; and participated in inventory proceedings of the Office of Administrative Services.

To ensure effective planning and implementation of audit activities, OAG coordinated its
work with ADB’s external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP (D&T), and provided support to
D&T in line with the fiscal year 2011 audit of ADB’s financial statements and the attestation
process, and agreed-upon procedures on three ADB bond offerings.

OAG also collaborated with D&T on the audits of 21 technical assistance trust/grant funds
undertaken at the request of the Office of Cofinancing Operations.

In addition to providing audit and advisory services, OAG has been implementing a program
designed to strengthen its alignment with Strategy 2020 while, at the same time, ensuring that
internal audit provides value to ADB.

Building on work done in 2010, OAG made significant progress in 2011. Its efforts included
the revision of Terms of Reference for the Office of the Auditor General approved in September;
preparation of technical guidance covering audit processes and tools; revamp of the reporting
format; finalizing of a communication strategy, including development of OAG’s intranet portal;
and the implementation of a Quality Assurance and Implementation Program, including time
reporting system and client feedback mechanism.

OAG continued to collaborate with other MDBs and United Nations agencies, sharing
experiences, identifying good professional practice in internal audit, and harmonizing approaches.
OAG hosted the 2011 Heads of Audit Meeting at ADB headquarters in Manila on 6—7 July, which
was chaired by the Auditor General and participated by seven MDBs.

An external quality assessment of OAG was conducted in November by the Institute of
Internal Auditors (IIA) to assess its conformance with the ILA’s International Standards for the
Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (Standards), evaluate OAG’s effectiveness in carrying
out its mission, and identify opportunities to enhance its management and work processes.
The assessment concluded that “OAG generally conforms’ to the Definition of Internal Audit,
the Standards and the Code of Ethics.”

Integrity and Anticorruption Activities

ADB’s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) deals with allegations of fraud, corruption,
coercion, collusion, obstruction, conflict of interest, and abuse (collectively, integrity violations)
in ADB-financed or -supported activity. OAI investigates misconduct at the request of the Budget,
Personnel, and Management Systems Department (BPMSD).

3 “Generally conforms” is the top rating and means that an internal audit activity has a charter, policies, and processes
that are judged to be in conformance with the Standards.

OAI received 225 complaints related to ADB-financed projects and its staff members
(20% more than in 2010) and presented 28 cases to the Integrity Oversight Committee (IOC).*
ADB sanctioned 31 firms and 34 individuals. ADB’s IOC consists of one external voting member
and two internal members.*

ADB also declared 45 entities debarred by the World Bank and 4 entities debarred by the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ineligible to participate in ADB-financed
or -supported projects, pursuant to the Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment
Decisions.* It submitted the names of 10 firms and 4 individuals to participating MDBs.’ During
the year, OAI coordinated closely on investigations with participating MDBs to ensure smooth
implementation of cross-debarment. Discussion among participating MDBs is ongoing to further
consolidate the basis for debarments and debarment periods.

OAI proactively conducts project procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) of ongoing ADBfinanced projects to confirm compliance with applicable ADB policies, guidelines, and the loan
agreement, and to prevent and detect integrity violations.

Five PPRRs were conducted in 2011 in Bhutan, India, the Kyrgyz Republic, Samoa, and
Viet Nam. Three of these reviews were performed jointly with the DMCs’ supreme audit institutions.
Common findings from PPRRs are shared ADB-wide and published on ADB’s website.

In 2011, OAI delivered 59 fraud-awareness training programs internally and in DMCs to
further implementation of ADB’s policy of zero tolerance to fraud and corruption, and to support
Strategy 2020’s vision of ADB as a knowledge institution.

Based on close collaboration between OAI, the Regional and Sustainable Development
Department, and BPMSD, and in conjunction with International Anticorruption Day celebrations
on 9 December 2011, ADB launched iACT, a weeklong campaign that emphasized the role and
professional obligation of each ADB staff member in preventing fraud and corruption in ADB’s
operations and activities.

ADB highlighted the importance of addressing the risks of fraud and corruption in its projects
with a series of learning events and the launch of a guide for staff that answers frequently asked
questions on anticorruption and integrity. Banner and signature campaigns within ADB were also
held in the lead-up to International Anticorruption Day.

OAI routinely assists ADB to conduct due diligence,* and acts as a resource for staff on all
aspects of anticorruption. In recognition of the importance of this role, ADB enhanced OAI’s
terms of reference to include assessment of integrity risks associated with identified red flags°
and conduct of in-depth due diligence checks."

The IOC is the authority that determines whether ADB’s anticorruption policy has been violated and decides on the

appropriate remedial action.

ADB approved the participation of an external member on the IOC in June 2011.

Effective Implementation

The automation initiatives of ADB in 2011 resulted in significant efficiency gains in procurement.
By December, the average time to recruit firms was reduced from 160 to 99 calendar days, with
individual consultants recruited in less than 1 week despite a 10% rise in contracts since 2008.
ADB streamlined its loan-financed consultant recruitment procedures and provided high-quality
and consistent advice, faster. More than 95% of responses were provided within 5 days, compared
with fewer than 50% previously.

Poor quality proposals and noncompliant bids by contractors and weak executing agency
and resident mission procurement can cause delays. The posting of five procurement specialists
to resident missions and more frequent assessments of procurement implementation contributed
to a 20% drop in noncompliance and accelerated processing with reduced procurement risk.
The Procurement Accreditation Skills Scheme was piloted with the Central Operations Services
Office (COSO) staff, to be rolled out in 2012.

In addition to providing regular reports to Management and the Board on the status of ADB’s
portfolio, COSO prepared the 2010 Annual Portfolio Performance Report after the transfer of
this assignment from IED to COSO.

ADB also supported regional departments’ use of eOperations, finalized the Operations
Management Procurement module for procurement planning and implementation for rollout in
2012, revised project administration instructions, and assessed the quality of all approved project
design and monitoring frameworks. The regional and support departments also collaborated
with the staff development group to develop and conduct a new project design and management
course for ADB staff.

Education. ADB approved a total of six loans and grants amounting to $647 million in 2011 for
Bangladesh, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam.
These loans aim to provide benefits such as classrooms, scholarships, and block grants and will
support governments’ priorities for improving students’ results and completion rates in education.
ADB financing for higher education reform increased. Events held included the International
Forum on the Changing Face of Higher Education in Asia, the Conference on the Role of
Private Higher Education, and the International Consultative Forum on Skills for Inclusive and
Sustainable Growth in Developing Asia—Pacific. All were held in the Philippines. Knowledge
products produced were Higher Education across Asia: An Overview of Issues and Strategies,
Non-State Providers and Public—Private Partnerships in Education for the Poor, and The National
Qualifications Framework for Skills Training in Sri Lanka.

Health. Public—private partnerships (PPPs) in health have been promoted in the Philippines and
Thailand, resulting in new health PPP projects. In Mongolia, social health insurance and the
hospital sector are being developed to increase equity and efficiency of the health care system.
New Guidance on Preventing HIV/AIDS was approved, and additional support of $5 million
mobilized from the Government of Sweden. The Asia Pacific Observatory on Health Systems and
Policies was launched to improve information on health systems. A loan was made to Papua New
Guinea to strengthen its rural health system. In addition, ADB produced studies and held policy
dialogue on tobacco taxation, out-of-pocket expenditures for health, climate change and health,
and human resources for health.

Social protection and social dimensions. ADB began preparing a Social Protection Operational
Plan aligned with Strategy 2020 and other operational plans in support of the strategic agenda of
inclusive growth. Social protection programs were strengthened in Nepal and Tajikistan through
grants, particularly social assistance for the poor and vulnerable population. A regional technical
assistance project supported capacity building of the government statistical offices in three
countries and development of an updated Social Protection Index. This has enabled systematic and
rigorous monitoring and impact assessment of social protection programs in developing member
countries (DMCs). Conferences were held on community-driven development and institutional
sustainability in Asia in June and on policy responses to climate-induced migration in September.

Gender Equity

ADB extended its Gender and Development Plan of Action through 2011 and intensified gender
mainstreaming efforts. For the second consecutive year, gender mainstreaming targets’ were
attained in 51% of ADB public sector and 67% of Asian Development Fund projects. More
“hard sector” projects in, for example, the energy and transport sectors, included gender design
features to promote women’s access and employment opportunities. ADB also organized a
regional seminar on urban development and water supply and sanitation to facilitate learning
among project managers from DMCs on how to mainstream gender during the implementation of
projects. To better track and document gender results during these projects, ADB initiated project
gender review missions in three DMCs.

2 Forty percent of all ADB public sector and 50% of Asian Development Fund projects by 2012.

 

38Sector and Thematic Highlights

 

The Millennium Development Goals

ADB strongly supports the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and financing for DMCs
in areas such as education, water and sanitation, gender mainstreaming, HIV/AIDS prevention,
and social protection contribute to progress being made in achieving the goals. In 2011, about
one in six ADB public sector investment projects and 9% of technical assistance projects were
classified as targeted interventions addressing the MDGs.

Through a long-standing partnership with the United Nations Development Programme and
the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, ADB monitors, reports on, and
advocates for the MDGs. During 2011, ADB joined with partners to undertake an analysis of
disparities in country performance against MDG targets across Asia and the Pacific, especially
in relation to health and nutrition, where the region is underperforming.

Even countries that have made rapid economic progress lose large numbers of children before
their fifth birthday, as well as thousands of mothers who die in childbirth. The analysis revealed
many opportunities for improving health outcomes, showing that policies and programs backed
by commitment and adequate resources could contribute significantly to the global achievement
of all the MDGs. The analysis will be published in the partnership’s next regional monitoring
report, due for release in the first quarter of 2012.

ADB also provided support to the 2011 International Conference on MDG Indicators,
hosted by the National Statistical Coordination Board of the Philippines. The meeting served as
a platform for countries and international organizations to exchange knowledge and share best
practice on MDG data collection, compilation, analysis, and dissemination.

Agriculture and Food Security

Consistent with the Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific,
support for sustainable food security in the region was supplied on two fronts—investments and
knowledge. In 2011, food security-related investments amounted to $2 billion. More are envisaged
as several regional and country partnerships have made food security commitments. Knowledge
support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations contributed to the establishment of a
regional emergency rice reserve and the piloting of a rice trade forum for policy dialogues.
Other strategic knowledge products included innovations for reducing rice losses before and
after harvests, deeper understanding of the changes taking place in Asia’s food supply chains,
and an action plan for improving coordination on food and water security among multilateral
and regional development banks.

Inclusive and Sustainable Infrastructure

Energy. Guided by the 2009 Energy Policy, ADB’s clean energy investment has grown steadily
since 2009. Clean energy investments in 2011 hit $2.1 billion, exceeding the investment target of
$2.0 billion by 2013. It resulted in an expected additional renewable energy generation capacity
of 875 megawatts per year, fuel savings of 91,800 terajoules per year, electricity savings of
3.3 terawatt-hours per year, renewable electricity generation of about 3.3 terawatt-hours per year,
and greenhouse gas emission reduction of 13.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Accessto-energy projects totaled $1.0 billion, up from $950 million in 2010, providing access to
electricity and modern fuels for 7.7 million households and adding to the 1.27 million households
connected during 2003-2010. Several events were held, including the Asia Solar Energy Forum

in Bangkok in May, and the sixth Asia Clean Energy Forum and the first Energy for All Investor
Forum at ADB headquarters in June.

Transport. Transport remains ADB’s largest sector, with $3.5 billion in loans, $55 million in
technical assistance, and $366 million in grant funding. Guided by the Sustainable Transport
Initiative Operational Plan, assistance has increased significantly in the rail and urban transport
subsectors, with more projects including social dimensions and the tackling of environmental
concerns. In the road transport subsector, targeted investments will help construct and rehabilitate
3,460 kilometers of roads, providing communities with better access to markets, economic
opportunities, and social services. Planned road network improvements in Cambodia, Papua New
Guinea, and Viet Nam will benefit over 6 million people in rural areas. ADB continues to play a
lead role among multilateral development banks on road safety and adopted a Road Safety Action
Plan. Partners were engaged to push the international agenda for more sustainable transport that
supports inclusive development.

Urban development. Urban areas account for 65% of ADB’s investment by location and
25% of operations by loan value ($2.78 billion). Urban operations are moving into new areas.
For example, a $100 million project in the People’s Republic of China will increase district
heating coverage by 11 million square meters, directly benefiting 640,000 urban residents in
one of the poorest and least-developed western provinces, as well as contributing to reducing
greenhouse gas emissions. To guide future investment, ADB in 2011 initiated preparation of its
Urban Operational Plan to promote an integrated approach to financing green, competitive, and
inclusive cities, and fostering PPPs. To share knowledge, Competitive Cities (monograph and tool
kit) and Jnclusive Cities were published, and the first Asian Urban Forum was held in November
at ADB headquarters. The Cities Development Initiative for Asia approved applications from
32 cities, leading to an estimated $4.5 billion in investments. The Urban Financing Partnership
Facility approved six projects for $13.0 million in funding, with the Government of Sweden
providing additional financing of $7.5 million for the facility.

Water. Guided by the Water Operational Plan 2011-2020, approved in October 2011, water
will remain a key investment area for ADB through the Water Financing Program (WFP),
supported by the Water Financing Partnership Facility. Both will continue for the next 10 years.
Under the WFP, ADB seeks to sustain its annual water investment at $2.0 billion—$2.5 billion
during 2011-2020, and a total of $20 billion—$25 billion by 2020. Investments from 2006 to
2010 totaled $11.44 billion, exceeding the $10.0 billion target of the WFP. Approvals for water
loans in 2011 totaled $2.33 billion, with 27 million people expected to benefit through improved
access to safe drinking water supply and improved sanitation. An additional 20 million people are
expected to gain from more efficient and productive irrigation and drainage services, and another
200,000 will benefit from a reduced risk of flooding in river basins, and cities within river basins,
as part of integrated water resources management. Increased support for sanitation and wastewater
management, a priority thrust of the operational plan, was sustained in 2011, with loans to more
than eight countries.

Environmental Sustainability and Climate Change

Environment. Fifty-nine projects with environmental sustainability as a theme and totaling about
$7.0 billion were approved—representing 51% of the total financing and 50% of the total number
of projects in 2011. Compared with 2010, there was an increase of 11% in the number of such

 

40Sector and Thematic Highlights

 

projects in 2011, and 50% in financing. ADB’s 2011 record of projects with environmental
sustainability as a theme pushed up the proportion of these projects to 43% from 2009 to 2011,
exceeding ADB’s 3-year rolling average target of 25% from 2010 to 2012.

More than 135 technical assistance projects totaling about $182 million and 16 grants totaling
nearly $160 million were approved with environmental sustainability as a theme. ADB supported
regional preparatory meetings for the 2012 Rio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development and prepared the report Green Growth, Resources, and Resilience as an input.

Three new Global Environment Facility programs will enhance the environmental
sustainability elements of ADB investments: the Asian Sustainable Transport and Urban
Development Program, the Greater Mekong Subregion Forest Biodiversity Program, and the
Pilot Asia—Pacific Climate Technology Network and Finance Center in partnership with the
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

Climate change. In line with the strategic priorities set out in Addressing Climate Change in Asia
and the Pacific: Priorities for Action, and as indicated in the preceding sections covering the energy
and transport sectors, the number and value of clean energy and sustainable transport investments
continued to rise during 2011, including 15 transport projects addressing climate change.

With 2011 clean energy investments reaching $2.1 billion, ADB has already exceeded its
$2 billion annual target for 2013. A total of $1.2 billion in mitigation cofinancing has been
endorsed through the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) for clean energy, sustainable transport,
and land-use projects. With support from CIF and ADB’s Climate Change Fund (CCF), the
reengagement with forest and land-use management efforts continued, focusing on mobilizing
financing through the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation scheme,
referred to as REDD+.

Climate change adaptation assistance was expanded, with ADB expected to implement projects
receiving a total of $277 million in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan,
Tonga, and the Pacific regionally—all under the CIF Pilot Program for Climate Resilience.

Guidelines for Climate Proofing Investments in the Transport Sector was published,
and five adaptation activities, totaling $3.7 million and meant to leverage further support,
have been funded through the CCF. ADB joined UNEP and other partners in supporting the
Asia Pacific Adaptation Network. ADB staff participated in design teams organized under the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for the Green Climate Fund and
the Technology Mechanism.

At the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP 17) to the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change in Durban, South Africa, ADB shared its knowledge and exchanged views
on the needs and options for promoting low-carbon and climate-resilient development in Asia
and the Pacific. This included presentation of preliminary findings on the economics of climate
change in Northeast Asia and the Pacific.

Emergency assistance and disaster risk management. In 2011, ADB approved $2.19 billion
in technical assistance, loans, and grants for disaster-related projects. To further innovation
in integrated disaster risk management (IDRM), ADB initiated technical assistance totaling
$3.7 million on disaster risk financing (DRF) solutions for cities and risk-sensitive land-use
planning. ADB approved $15 million in Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund grants to support
responses to disasters in Cambodia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. New
knowledge products included a regional portal of disaster-related projects, practitioner handbooks
on disaster risk management in Asia, and IDRM/DRF papers to guide ADB assistance to DMCs.

Safeguards

ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement became effective in January 2010. Implementation in
2010-2011 was smooth, with more than 30 staff positions for safeguard work created, 700 staff
participating in workshops, 16 in-country briefings held, and technical assistance projects totaling
$15 million being implemented to strengthen country safeguard systems.

ADB screened and reviewed all projects for potential impacts related to the environment,
involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, and assisted borrowers to adopt mitigation
measures to address such impacts. Of the 108 projects approved in 2011, 84 (78%) were deemed
to have potential environmental impacts, 62 (58%) to have potential involuntary resettlement
impacts, and 19 (18%) to have potential impacts on indigenous peoples. Thirteen projects were
classified as financial intermediaries, representing about 12% of approvals.

Regional Cooperation and Integration

ADB promotes regional cooperation and integration (RCI) through a broad spectrum of
activities. It supports subregional programs, such as the Greater Mekong Subregion Program.
In 2011, ADB approved 18 RCI-related investments amounting to $2.3 billion (through five
regional departments) and 49 technical assistance projects on RCI amounting to $96 million
(through five regional departments and the Office of Regional Economic Integration).

ADB provided technical assistance financing through three trust funds: the Regional
Cooperation and Integration Fund, Japan’s Investment Climate Facilitation Fund, and the
People’s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund. Since their
establishment, 109 projects, amounting to $82 million, have been funded. Activities of ADB and
knowledge on RCI are disseminated through studies and portals, such as the Asia Regional
Integration Center (aric.adb.org) and AsianBondsOnline (asianbondsonline.adb.org) websites.

Governance and Capacity Development

Governance. In 2011, ADB approved public sector management and governance loans and
grants totaling $2.7 billion. Major knowledge partnerships with the ADB-—Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development Anti-Corruption Initiative and with the Lee Kuan
Yew School of Public Policy were expanded and deepened. Knowledge products, including policy
notes, governance stocktake, and a sector governance learning lessons series, were developed.
A conference on international tax policy and role of tax treaties was organized. Country-level risk
assessments for Cambodia, the Maldives, Solomon Islands, and Sri Lanka were completed across
four sectors. Procurement capacity assessments were completed for the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic and the Federated States of Micronesia, and institutional capacity assessments for Bhutan
(anticorruption) and Cambodia (audit firms).

Nongovernment organization and civil society cooperation. Against a target of 80%, 91% of
2011 approved sovereign ordinary capital resources and/or Asian Development Fund loans and
grants included elements of civil society organization (CSO) participation. These figures continue
the significantly increasing trend from 2009 and 2010 CSO participation levels. A record 205 CSO
representatives from 32 countries participated in an expanded Civil Society Program at ADB’s
44th Annual Meeting. Other activities included updating ADB’s Guide to Participation for use
in operations, issuing 10 civil society country briefs, and redesigning the Civil Society website.

 

42Sector and Thematic Highlights

 

Capacity development and outreach programs with governments and nongovernment organizations
were conducted to promote improved participation and stronger partnerships with CSOs.

Information and communication technology (ICT). In 2011, ADB approved 13 loans,
18 technical assistance projects, and 4 grants involving ICT for $3.7 million. This includes three
ICT infrastructure projects and various sector projects with ICT components. For instance, the
Tonga—Fiji Submarine Cable Project—a $34 million grant project cofinanced by the World Bank
Group—is a notable ICT infrastructure undertaking that provides broadband internet access to
DMCs. To support government-led ICT projects, ADB also developed knowledge products on an
E-Government Capability Maturity Model, including an ICT project guidebook. In partnership
with the International Telecommunication Union, ADB also concluded a 2-year study of rural ICT
policy in nine DMCs, producing in-depth reports on rural ICT policy guidelines and case studies.

Finance Sector Development

Sovereign lending approvals in support of finance sector development in DMCs amounted
to $15 million. Nonsovereign investments amounted to $265 million, technical assistance to
$16 million, and grants to $7 million, with investments largely supporting banks, access to
finance, disaster risk financing, and capital and bond market development. The Financial Sector
Operational Plan was approved, which provides guidance on aligning finance sector work with
Strategy 2020 priorities. Knowledge products on the global financial crisis and in the areas of
pension, microfinance, and infrastructure finance were produced.

Private Sector Development

ADB’s nonsovereign operations are integral to the objectives of Strategy 2020, which aims
to scale up private sector development and private sector operations in all operational areas,
targeting 50% of annual operations by 2020.

Public—private partnership (PPP). To enhance infrastructure development in the region through
PPP, work on the preparation of the PPP Operational Plan continued in 2011, which is scheduled
for approval in 2012. In partnership with the Korea Development Institute, volumes | and 2 of
Public-Private Partnership Infrastructure Projects: Case Studies from the Republic of Korea
were launched. Program partners of the Multilateral PPP for Infrastructure Capacity Development,
a joint initiative of ADB, the Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank Institute,
organized the Second Asia PPP Practitioners’ Network Training in Seoul.

Department—in tandem with the regional departments and 14 communities of practice
ADB hosts—upheld that commitment by generating and sharing knowledge to support
Strategy 2020 objectives.

Inclusive Growth

To foster inclusive growth, ADB creates and expands economic opportunities, promotes broader
access to these opportunities, and puts in place social safety nets to mitigate risks and prevent
extreme deprivation.

Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: An Update showed that despite the number of poor declining
significantly—with 150 million people exiting extreme poverty between 2005 and 2008—poverty
reduction across the region has remained uneven. This finding was affirmed and further explored
in the larger flagship study Asia 2050, which examined a number of multigenerational challenges
requiring innovative thinking as Asia moves toward greater prosperity and strategic policy choices.
The study assumed two possible scenarios of Asia’s future growth trajectory, the Asian Century
and the Middle Income Trap, and drew attention to the longer-term implications of broad trends
and policy actions.

The Asian Development Outlook 2011, which offers a comprehensive analysis of the past
year’s economic performance and the next 2 years’ forecasts, highlighted rising consumer prices
and the need to foster new sources of growth as other key challenges for policy makers. South—
South economic links, particularly in trade and investment, were identified as a potential new
engine of global economic growth and contributor to global economic stability by promoting
global rebalancing. Having generated significant online traffic of about 25,000 page views in the
last quarter of 2011 alone, the report continues to attract readers and has been cited in prominent
publications and news releases.

Toward Higher Quality Employment in Asia, a special chapter of Key Indicators for Asia and
the Pacific 2011, highlighted that Asia had outstripped other regions in growth and employment
creation since 1990. The pattern and rate of job creation across the region, however, have been
sharply mixed, and growth on its own is not enough to guarantee quality jobs with decent
wages and conditions. The report, which attracted about 35,000 page views from August to
December, argued that creating higher value-added jobs and increasing labor productivity are keys
to quality employment, and that higher quality employment is the critical link between growth
and poverty reduction.

Health and education are important enablers of inclusive growth. At the 10th International
Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in the Republic of Korea, ADB announced fresh
initiatives in HIV prevention. Covering 2011-2015 operations, these directions are critical to
achieve—and sustain—progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.

The milestones of ADB’s $8.2 billion educational support for its DMCs were featured in
Education in Asia and the Pacific, which chronicled its 4 decades in the sector. In line with the
private sector being identified as a driver of change in Strategy 2020, ADB also produced Non-State
Providers and Public-Private Partnerships in Education for the Poor, which highlighted issues,
opportunities, challenges, risks, and benefits for public—private partnerships in the sector.

Interest in social protection has grown as a result of the global financial crisis. In 2011, ADB
brought policy makers together to brainstorm on social protection systems that can assist people
to deal with adverse economic shocks and personal conditions. The results were featured in the
publication Enhancing Social Protection in Asia and the Pacific, which offered potential solutions
dealing with health and unemployment insurance, pensions, the informal sector, measures targeting
children, and measuring and monitoring social protection.

 

46Generating and Sharing Knowledge

 

Environmentally Sustainable Growth

The 201] Asian Development Bank Sustainability Report offered insights on ADB’s ongoing
work on promoting environmentally sustainable and inclusive growth and reducing its corporate
footprint. The Environment Program: Greening Growth in Asia and the Pacific discussed
emerging environmental challenges in the region and previewed ADB’s strategies to strengthen
its environment operations.

During its 3-day forum, Financing Future Cities, ADB launched its publication Competitive
Cities in the 21st Century: Cluster-Based Local Economic Development, which highlighted the
urgent need for Asian cities to become livable, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. It
argues that half the world’s megacities with populations of over 10 million are in Asia, but their
extraordinary rise has come at a cost. With over 200 million urban dwellers living in poverty,
pollution worsening, and climate change presenting a threat with the onset of increasingly
severe natural disasters, the publication offers governments, businesses, the private sector, and
communities a blueprint for planning competitive, sustainable, and inclusive urban economies.

Climate change was widely addressed in 2011. The publication Guidelines for Climate
Proofing Investment in the Transport Sector: Road Infrastructure Projects presented a step-bystep methodological approach to assist project teams to incorporate climate change adaptation
measures into transport sector investment projects. It argued that an improved understanding of
climate change impacts should be used in infrastructure design and policy/strategy development.

Food Security and Climate Change in the Pacific: Rethinking the Options assessed the
region’s food security prospects amid the growing threats and likely impacts of climate change,
and presented potential areas for greater assistance from ADB and other development partners.

Accounting for Health Impacts of Climate Change focused on the human health dimensions
of climate change and how projects in areas other than health—such as agriculture, water
financing programs, and disaster risk reduction—need to account explicitly for the health impacts
of their interventions.

Regional Integration

Regional cooperation and integration narrows development gaps between DMCs by building
closer trade integration, intraregional supply chains, and stronger financial links. It is an important
platform on which countries can work together to unlock their economic potential and achieve
sustained, rapid, and inclusive growth.

Role of Key Emerging Economies—ASEAN, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and
India is a major study analyzing the relationship between Asia’s economic powerhouses. As they
continue to expand, these countries will need to ensure their growth is accompanied by good
environmental management and improvements in the quality of life. A subset of this project,
ASEAN 2030: Growing Together for Shared Prosperity, discussed challenges for the economic
development and growth of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries
individually and as a group, and defined means by which the region can become resilient,
competitive, and harmonious by 2030. Reports for these will be published in 2012.

CAREC 2020, a framework for intensified regional cooperation that builds on the early
achievements of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program,
provided member countries with insights on how to expand international trade and boost their
competitiveness in the global economy, specifically through investments that open access to
major external markets and increase trade within the region.

The Conference on Regional Cooperation and Integration Knowledge Sharing held in
the Maldives on 8 October showcased research by South Asian academia and policy makers
backed by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Important policy
recommendations of the conference served as inputs during the SAARC Summit held in the
Maldives in November.

To build ADB and DMC capacity on trade, ADB brought together over 70 trade officials,
ASEAN Secretariat officials, and ADB staff to learn and share experiences on the dynamics of trade
and production networks and online trade policy tools. Another training program strengthened the
capacity of finance ministries and central banks in ASEAN, the People’s Republic of China (PRC),
the Republic of Korea, and South Asia, as well as staff of the ASEAN Secretariat, in regional
economic and financial monitoring.

The Asia Regional Integration Center continued to serve as a knowledge and information portal
on regional cooperation and integration in Asia and the Pacific, providing high-frequency economic
and financial data. Likewise, the AsianBondsOnline website supported bond market participants
with data, analysis, and original content on bond market developments in emerging East Asia.

Stimulating Knowledge Uptake and Citation

Devising and disseminating knowledge solutions is also the focus of ADB’s Knowledge Sharing
Program, established in May 2011. It supports knowledge sharing among DMCs by connecting
people and coordinating efforts. It has organized ADB’s first conference on knowledge sharing
and development effectiveness; designed a comprehensive framework to structure demand-driven
knowledge sharing; initiated model cases and training programs for knowledge sharing; and
deepened knowledge partnerships with development agencies, research and training institutions,
and the private sector.

Multimodal means of dissemination, and extensive country consultations in the case of major
publications and studies, resulted in valuable insights and perspectives from key stakeholders—
including finance ministers, central bank officials, policy makers, academics, and researchers—
and led to greater media exposure.

For instance, Asia's Free Trade Agreements: How Is Business Responding? (copublished
with Edward Elgar Publishing) was quoted in international and regional media, including
The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, Kyodo News, Xinhua News, The Jakarta Post, and India’s
The Economic Times. The World Trade Organization’s flagship publication devoted five pages
to the findings of the study. In response to demand from the PRC, a Chinese translation of the
book is under way.

Another paper, How the iPhone Widens the United States Trade Deficit with the People’s
Republic of China, generated several articles in The Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal,
The New York Times, Time Magazine, and Foreign Policy. The People’s Bank of China used the
iPhone paper to emphasize the structural factors that underlie the trade imbalance between the
United States and the PRC. PRC Vice-Premier Wang Qishan used the iPhone trade to explain the
nature of the bilateral trade relationship in an interview.

Official Cofinancing

Inaddition to ADB’s own resources, $3.5 billion was generated in 2011 in official cofinancing from the
development assistance windows of external partners, such as government agencies and international
organizations, to cofinance 170 ADB projects. This total official cofinancing comprised $3.3 billion
for 37 projects and $0.2 billion for 133 technical assistance activities (Tables 7a and 7b). This amount
increased by 13.2% from $3.1 billion in 2010 and marked a record year for grant cofinancing.
In 2011, external partners provided $971.5 million in grants for components of investment projects,
an increase of more than 600% compared to $127.3 million in 2010; and $211.4 million in grants
for technical assistance activities, an increase of 41.1% compared to $149.9 million in 2010. While
loan cofinancing decreased by 17.7% in 2011, from $2.8 billion in 2010 to $2.3 billion in 2011,
it nevertheless remains the largest contributor to ADB’s overall official cofinancing operations.

Of particular relevance to 2011 grant cofinancing are two education projects that also attracted
strong financing support from several external partners. The Third Primary Education Development
Project, in which ADB extended a $320.0 million loan to help Bangladesh continue to improve
the quality and reach of its primary education system, is expected to receive $435.5 million in
grants from seven other development partners, including the Australian Agency for International
Development, the Canadian International Development Agency, the European Union, the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency,
the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the United Nations
Children’s Fund. The World Bank also extended a loan of $300.0 million to this project.

In Nepal, the School Sector Program, which supports the government’s ongoing education
reform initiatives, was supported by ADB with a $65.5 million grant. A $264.5 million grant
from eight other development partners, namely, the governments of Australia, Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and the United Kingdom; the European Union; the United Nations Children’s Fund;
and the Fast Track Initiative, has been committed.

ADB also administers a number of thematic trust funds. Additional grant resources from
external partners totaled $253.6 million in 2011, comprising $82.6 million in new contributions”
and $171.0 million in replenishments? to existing trust funds. In 2011, ADB established the Fourth
High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness Trust Fund to support some key activities under the related
technical assistance to improve aid effectiveness policies and development partner approaches.

? New contributions totaling $1.3 million were provided to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness Trust
Fund by the governments of Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
and Switzerland; the African Development Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; $56.3 million by the Government of the United Kingdom and $20.0 million
by the Government of Japan to the Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund; and $5.0 million from the Government of
Switzerland for the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility.

> Replenishments were provided by the following governments: Australia for $6.8 million for the Multi-Donor Clean Energy
Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and $15.5 million for the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the
Water Financing Partnership Facility; Austria for $3.4 million for the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing
Partnership Facility and $0.55 million for a technical support under the Carbon Market Initiative; Japan for $9.0 million for
the Asian Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, $58.5 million for the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction, and $9.5 million for the Japan Scholarship Program; the Republic of Korea for $6.0 million for the e-Asia

ADB participates in the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) as a supervising entity and project implementer. The GAFSP is a multilateral mechanism established at the
request of the Group of Twenty (G-20) to support the implementation of pledges for agriculture
and food security initiatives made by the G8+ in the L’Aquila Summit held in July 2009.

Efforts in improving predictability of cofinancing in 2011 led to ADB’s signing of two new
framework cofinancing agreements: with the Nordic Development Fund and with the OPEC Fund for
International Development. In addition, two cofinancing framework agreements with the Republic
of Korea were extended and the framework agreement with the Islamic Development Bank was
renewed. ADB has nine agreements with bilateral and multilateral financing partners for a total
program of about $9.0 billion for cofinancing with ADB projects.

To further raise public awareness of the results of external donors’ partnerships with
ADB, ADB launched the donor-specific Partnership Brief series at its 2011 Annual Meeting in
Ha Noi, Viet Nam. Partnership briefs for 11 partners* have been published as of end-2011.

Commercial Cofinancing

In 2011, ADB clarified the definition of direct value-added (DVA) commercial cofinancing by
providing detailed criteria for qualification of DVA cofinancing. As a result, apart from B loans,
DVA cofinancing now includes (i) a revised calculation for parallel loans, the debt portion of
project costs financed by third parties provided that ADB’s presence has been instrumental in
mobilizing the third-party debt evidenced by a common terms agreement, common security
arrangement, or a memorandum of understanding or other framework agreement; (ii) cofinancing
for TFP transactions, including the amount of risk assumed by partner banks and risk distribution
partners; (iii) third-party debt (net of guarantees) provided by ADB, unfunded risk participation
by banks rated A and AA, and amounts reinsured with entities rated A and AA; (iv) parallel
guarantees, third-party debt guaranteed by a co-guarantor of ADB, provided that ADB’s presence
has been instrumental in mobilizing additional capacity by other guarantors; and (v) parallel equity
investments in funds where ADB acts as a general partner in the fund.

Based on the clarified definition, ADB generated DVA cofinancing for TFP of $2,381 million
in 2011 and $1,549 million in 2010, and commercial parallel loans of $1,623 million in 2011
and $479 million in 2010. The figures in Tables 7a and 7b reflect the new definition as applied
to 2010 and 2011.

Resource Transfers

During the year, there was an overall net transfer of $3.2 billion from ADB to its developing
member countries, including loans, equity investments, and grants. Of these, net resource transfers
of $2.7 billion ($2.9 billion in 2010) went to OCR borrowers and/or investees, and $510 million
($358 million in 2010), and $34 million ($102 million in 2010) were provided from ADF grants
and other ADB Special Funds, respectively. There was a net inflow of $4 million from ADF
borrowers (net transfer of $379 million in 2010). The four countries with the largest net resource

Portfolio Management

Regular portfolio reviews ensured effective and efficient performance across the board, while an
improved management information system tracked project performance. Portfolio performance
also benefited from greater readiness; simpler designs; and proactive work on procurement,
safeguards, and counterpart finance. ADB continued to use multitranche financing facilities,
which contributed to up-front, quality due diligence, a high level of preparedness, financing
predictability, and longer-term partnerships. Project implementation is on track for 69% of the
total portfolio of 92 active projects, while 16% experienced implementation challenges.

Regional Cooperation

The 10 country partners of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program
marked 10 years of collaboration, resulting in 120 projects since 2001 worth more than $17 billion.
CAREC 2020 was endorsed as the strategic framework for 2011-2020 at the 10th Ministerial
Conference held in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November. Ministers agreed on steps for priority projects
over the 10-year period.

ADB approved financial assistance for nine CAREC transport projects, worth $1.1 billion,
which will improve connectivity. In December, the ADB-assisted Hairatan to Mazar-e-Sharif
railway began hauling cargo from and to the Uzbekistan border. Meanwhile, the Kyrgyz Republic
and Tajikistan ratified the Cross-Border Transport Agreement, and a protocol was signed as a first
step for Afghanistan to accede to the agreement as well.

Knowledge Management

ADB continued to invest in a range of knowledge products (see Appendix 14). Sector and
thematic assessments informed the country partnership strategies in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan. Road maps were being developed for transport, energy, and urban services
in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Finance and public sector and governance assessments for
Turkmenistan, and transport master plans for Armenia and Tajikistan were prepared. Environment,
governance, poverty, and private sector assessments were conducted for Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan. A social development analysis was conducted for Turkmenistan, and a gender analysis
was undertaken of the damage and needs assessment in Pakistan.

A study on the ombudsman institution in Asia was published, as was one on pension reform

missions and CAREC shared knowledge on transport, energy, and trade. Two videos on climate
change in Tajikistan were produced.

Publications and a video highlighted CAREC’s accomplishments to mark the program’s
10th year. A website (www.carecprogram.org) was launched to showcase the full spectrum of
CAREC’s work.

Country Highlights
Afghanistan

Partnership priorities. In line with the 2009-2013 Country Partnership Strategy, ADB, one of the
country’s largest development partners, is active in energy, transportation, and natural resources
management, with 19 sovereign loan and grant projects totaling $2.7 billion since 2002. Projects
focus on regional connectivity, energy security, and food self-sufficiency. The ADB-managed
Afghanistan Infrastructure Trust Fund is leveraging cofinancing for critical infrastructure projects.
The last section of the crucial national ring road was contracted, and work continued on the north—
south corridor and the road from Kabul to Jalalabad. ADB completed the transmission link from
Tajikistan, augmented distribution networks in the north and east, and began preparing a power
sector master plan and possible power link with Turkmenistan. ADB also started to prepare three
infrastructure projects in Helmand in Afghanistan and extended technical assistance to seek ways
to expand commercial lending in rural areas.

Impact of operations. The ADB-assisted rail link from Hairatan on Afghanistan’s border with
Uzbekistan to Mazar-e-Sharif—the first in Afghanistan—began commercial operations, and
reduced time and freight costs while increasing trade. Strengthened power links stimulated

economic activity, reducing the cost of doing business, improving the environment and security,
and cutting poverty. The flagship CAREC program promoted trade and competitiveness, linking
Afghanistan with Central Asia, the Middle East, and South Asia.

Armenia

Partnership priorities. The 2006-2009 interim operational strategy identified rural development,
private sector development, and promotion of regional cooperation as indicative and not exclusive
priorities. ADB focused on transport, finance, and urban services. Consultation with the government
in September confirmed the overall validity of ADB’s strategies and the shift from rural to urban
development in response to the government’s post-crisis priorities. The shift is reflected in the
2012-2013 country operations business plan, and the first country partnership strategy (CPS) will
be prepared.

The $400 million Sustainable Urban Development Investment Program targets the transport
sector in urban areas to improve connectivity, reduce traffic congestion, and make transport safe
and efficient. About $50 million are earmarked to construct a 5.3-kilometer ring road in the capital,
Yerevan, to divert traffic from the center and encourage economic development in the outer areas
and to support institutional strengthening of public transport.

Impact of operations. The $48 million reconstruction of 268 kilometers of rural roads reduced
average travel time by 47% and vehicle operating costs by 40%; improved access to social services
and jobs; and benefited 171,180 people, of whom 36% are poor. Trade finance agreements with
six local banks extended access to trade credit to businesses, including small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), and a $65 million nonsovereign loan to four local banks increased their ability
to lend to SMEs. ADB cofinanced a new two-story terminal at Zvartnots International Airport,
the country’s main air gateway in Yerevan, with a $40 million nonsovereign loan, which will
increase connectivity.

Azerbaijan

Partnership priorities. Continuing the work under the 2000 interim operations strategy and
subsequent country strategy program updates, ADB was guided by the 2010 country operations
business plan. Public sector loans comprise $255 million for roads, $105 million for water supply,
and $160 million for energy. ADB started preparing a CPS for 2012-2016.

Impact of operations. Four projects were completed during 2000-2011. The project to integrate
internally displaced people rehabilitated four schools and improved living conditions of more
than 400 families, some of whom, including women, were provided with small loans. The flood
mitigation project prevented estimated average annualized losses of $13.2 million in 2009 prices—
much higher than the $5 million losses originally estimated. The reconstruction of 94 kilometers
of the primary east-west highway increased freight and passenger traffic by about 10% annually
between 2006 and 2010; served more than 4,000 vehicles per day in 2010 (originally estimated at
3,600); and reduced passenger travel time by 50% and vehicle operating cost by 20%, benefiting
702,000 people, of whom 37.2% were poor. The water supply and sanitation project brought
24-hour nonpotable water supply to about 70% of the population in one of the two project towns.

The Trade Finance Program supported almost $41 million in trade through 52 transactions for
SMEs, intraregional trade, and trade between Azerbaijan and another developing member country.

ADB’s first private sector loan for infrastructure in Azerbaijan financed the replacement of a
cement plant’s wet-type kilns with a single modern dry-type kiln, reducing fuel consumption by
nearly 50% per ton of clinker and improving environmental standards.

Georgia

Partnership priorities. ADB operations have expanded rapidly since Georgia joined ADB in
2007. Consistent with the 2008-2009 interim operational strategy, ADB focuses on enhancing
sustainable economic growth by improving municipal service delivery, reducing road constraints
on economic activity, and upgrading and developing energy infrastructure. Ongoing assistance
supports road corridor improvements, urban water and sanitation, and urban transport. Private
sector operations have focused on investments in trade finance and SMEs.

Impact of operations. Ongoing assistance through the Municipal Development Fund has
improved roads, water supply, and sanitation for municipalities and districts. More than 387,000 people
have better access to water supply, while more than 150,000 people have access to rehabilitated and
expanded sanitation. Nearly 200 kilometers of roads were renovated or paved. In total, more than
2 million people have benefited from ADB-financed improvements through the fund.

The rehabilitated 43-kilometer road from Zugdidi to Mestia, a United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization heritage site, has guaranteed year-round transport to local
communities and encouraged tourism; it reduces travel time by half. Financing for a 1.5-kilometer
Tbilisi Metro extension will serve university students and 150,000 district inhabitants. ADB
assistance to the United Water Supply Company of Georgia has facilitated the piloting of a spatial
planning and geographic information system. It targets 24-hour access to safe potable water
supply and sanitation services for more than 11,000 residents and visitors in Anaklia and Mestia.
A 32-kilometer bypass road around the coastal city of Kobuleti will reduce traffic congestion
and improve road safety.

Kazakhstan

Partnership priorities. ADB supported the government’s efforts to sustain a higher growth
rate, promote environment-friendly development, encourage the private sector, and connect
the country with its neighbors. It engaged selectively in infrastructure, SMEs, and finance,
with regional cooperation a key theme. ADB is preparing a new partnership strategy to guide
operations from 2012 to 2016.

Impact of operations. ADB restored almost 40,000 hectares of irrigated land in the south,
improving nutritional standards and increasing crop yields and jobs; brought safe drinking water
to about 65,000 people in the north and south; and helped the central bank create a macroeconomic
management tool that provides economic decision makers with realistic growth forecasts and debt
rescheduling. ADB, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European
Union, cofinanced the construction and rehabilitation of the 245-kilometer Almaty—Bishkek road,
speeding up the movement of goods and people, cutting travel time from 5 hours to 2 hours and
bringing down fuel costs. The $500 million countercyclical support loan to help mitigate the impact
of the global economic crisis helped create 247,822 temporary jobs; complete 5,261 road, school,
and health projects; retrain 70,668 workers; and provide 51,186 internships.

Partnership priorities. The CPS, prepared jointly with other development partners, supports public
infrastructure and institutional reforms, which will promote sustainable growth with broader private
sector participation. Of the international financial institutions, ADB has provided the most support for
road transport and education. A $55 million Asian Development Fund loan was approved to improve
a highway connecting the Kyrgyz Republic with the People’s Republic of China. The route is part of
CAREC Corridor | and critical to regional trade. ADB also began work on a new CPS for 2013-2017.

Impact of operations. In education, ADB-supported reforms developed a new student-centered,
skills-oriented curriculum for grades | to 11, and introduced a new curriculum in grades | to 4.
More than 500,000 textbooks were distributed and over 17,000 teachers trained. Hardware and
laboratory equipment were delivered to 90 rehabilitated schools and 7 teacher training institutes.

ADB continued improving customs services and revenue administration by introducing up-todate software systems and hardware. Budget support helped the government maintain essential
public expenditures. Progress was made in rebuilding houses damaged during unrest. ADB
assistance improved tax collection, and rural water supply and sanitation.

Pakistan

Partnership priorities. Recurrent floods, energy shortages, and security and economic uncertainty were challenges. In line with the 2009-2013 CPS, ADB continued to give priority to energy,
transport, irrigation, urban services, flood rehabilitation, and the finance sector. A loan portfolio
of $1.1 billion financed energy efficiency, renewable energy, and transmission and distribution
projects, and $76 million were disbursed to increase energy efficiency and reduce losses. ADB also
led the Water Sector Task Force, preparing an integrated approach to ensuring adequate resources
for the future, released $200 million to strengthen the institutional framework for capital markets,
and supported improvements to the national highway system and critical road networks.

ADB supported agriculture, including rural development in the Federally Administered
Tribal Areas, irrigation in Punjab, and coastal development in Sindh. ADB also engaged in policy
dialogue with the government on macroeconomic issues to promote sustainable job creation,
power sector restructuring, and railway sector reforms.

Impact of operations. The Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project rehabilitated 800 kilometers
of roads, rebuilt 400 schools and 27 rural and 3 major hospitals, and constructed 16 power stations,
substantially improving the lives of people affected by the earthquake that killed 73,000 people.
The Flood Emergency Reconstruction Project directly helped repair infrastructure throughout
Pakistan, and irrigation and provincial roads in Sindh.

Sustained, long-term investments improved energy efficiency, reliability, and service
coverage. The capital market project resulted in the removal of some legal and regulatory
constraints on domestic bond markets, paving the way for improved governance of securities
markets by strengthening the institutional framework. The Sindh coastal development project
helped families increase their incomes and access services through better community participation,
institutional capacity development, and management of coastal resources.

New Afghan Rail Line Boosts Trade and Aid

Until late 2010, border bottlenecks at Hairatan in the north and security concerns on the southern
and eastern frontiers were choking off trade and aid for Afghanistan. Now, thanks to a $165 million
ADB grant, a new 75-kilometer railway line from Hairatan to the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif
is helping improve the flow of goods into the country, cutting transport costs, boosting regional
trade, and making it easier to deliver humanitarian relief to conflict-affected Afghans. As a result
of creative planning and good project management, the line was built in less than a year. About
5 million people in total will benefit. (PHOTO: ADB)

Tajikistan

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2010-2014 is aligned with national strategies for development
and poverty reduction. ADB helps develop energy and transport infrastructure, provide renewable
energy, and support the private sector. It also promotes regional cooperation; capacity building
and governance, especially public financial management, procurement, and anticorruption
activities; climate change mitigation and environmental protection; and inclusion of gender in
policies and projects. The Strengthening Public Resource Management Program supports key
expenditures, such as social protection for about 10,000 poor households in two pilot districts,
and promotes reforms to improve tax administration, creating more effective and efficient social
safety-net programs, and better public financial management.

Impact of operations. The 220-kilovolt power transmission line constructed under CAREC allows
the export of up to 300 megawatts of summer surplus power to meet shortfalls in neighboring
Afghanistan. Through CAREC, ADB helped rehabilitate a 350-kilometer highway linking
Dushanbe with the Kyrgyz Republic—a significant trade route connecting Tajikistan and the

Cleaning Up Armenia’s Water Supply

In the former Soviet republic of Armenia, inadequate funding and maintenance had led to water
shortages and poor quality drinking water. In 2007, ADB approved a $36 million loan to the
country’s government to help it upgrade and rehabilitate water supply and sanitation systems in
many towns and villages. The project is close to completion and almost a year ahead of schedule.
Some 600,000 people—about 20% of the population—have already benefited. Like these school
children in the community of Artashat, residents of 21 towns and 97 villages now have access to
safe water supply for an average of 13.5 hours a day. In addition, the collaboration between the
water utility company and a private operator has improved operational and financial management
of the sector. (PHOTO: INNA MKHITARYAN)

Kyrgyz Republic with the People’s Republic of China and beyond. The road reduces travel time
by an average of 5 hours and significantly cuts transport costs, helps increase incomes, creates
jobs, improves access to social services, and ultimately increases regional trade and cooperation.
The Regional Customs Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project improved the
efficiency and transparency of customs services, reinforced ongoing customs legal reforms, and
promoted trade and regional cooperation by developing a unified automated information system,
and building five and rehabilitating eight customs border-posts. ADB also helped mitigate the
effects of climate change through the Flood Risk Management Project in Khatlon Province
by rehabilitating 8.3 kilometers of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River, and
strengthening flood warning and preparedness systems.

to modernize 311 kilometers of the North-South Railway Project, which will improve connectivity
with neighboring countries and contribute to regional cooperation, trade, and investment.

An interim CPS is under preparation. It will prioritize infrastructure development that
supports regional integration. Investments in energy and transport will increase Turkmenistan’s
importance in regional cooperation efforts in the CAREC framework. Capacity-building programs
and development of key sector strategies will be incorporated into the CPS and country operations
business plan.

Impact of operations. ADB started its operations only in 2010.
Uzbekistan

Partnership priorities. The country operations business plan for 2011-2013 follows the country
strategy and program for 2006-2010. The plan supports sustaining inclusive economic growth
through industrial modernization, infrastructure development, and rural development. Priorities
include transport, energy, water supply and sanitation, multisector rural development, and small
and microenterprise support. Direct investment in the private sector started, supporting energy.

Impact of operations. With $63 million in loans, the Western Uzbekistan Rural Water Supply
Project and the Kashkadarya and Navoi Rural Water Supply Project brought clean water to
950,000 people in 300 villages in Karakalpakstan, Kashkadarya, Khorezm, and Navoi. With a
$73 million loan, the ongoing Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project improved 19,000 hectares
of agricultural land by rehabilitating a pumping station and irrigation channels. Rehabilitation
of two other pumping stations will further enlarge the improved land by 80%. The project also
brought $2.5 million worth of farm machinery and equipment to farmers.

Overview

nclusive growth is a key operational objective for ADB in East Asia. The current

People’s Republic of China (PRC) country partnership strategy (CPS) emphasizes inclusive

growth and balanced development, resource efficiency and environmental sustainability,
regional cooperation and public goods, and private sector development. The current Mongolia
CPS supports stable, broad-based growth and inclusive social development. In 2011, Mongolia
was reclassified from an Asian Development Fund (ADF)-only to a blend country, providing it
access to ADF as well as ordinary capital resources. Both the PRC and Mongolia are currently
preparing new CPSs broadly in line with Strategy 2020.

In both countries, ADB continued to provide technical assistance to support fiscal reforms,
improve access to financial services, support urban development and social services, promote
private sector participation, enhance energy efficiency, facilitate trade and logistics development,
and strengthen regional cooperation. Inclusive growth was a dominant theme in a number of
knowledge products and services (KPS) produced for the PRC and Mongolia.

Total lending operations in the PRC consisted of 12 sovereign loans for $1.34 billion.
Nonsovereign approvals for the PRC totaled $225 million, including $25 million in equity
investments and $100 million in B loans. For Mongolia, financial assistance included two ADF
loans for $65 million. Grants and technical assistance for the PRC and Mongolia including
regional totaled $35.3 million, of which $4.2 million for Mongolia was financed from the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction.

Portfolio Management

Through its East Asia Department, ADB manages a sovereign portfolio comprising 85 loans,
37 ADF and other grants, and about 143 technical assistance projects in East Asia. All ongoing
loan and grant projects have been rated satisfactory. Maintaining the quality and development
impact of the portfolio is a key objective in portfolio management, and challenges remain with
the increasing number of smaller and more innovative and complex projects.

Project administration was enhanced with the greater involvement of executing and implementing agencies during project preparation. Mandatory assessment of procurement and financial
management capacities when preparing projects enabled better targeting of capacity-building
support. Monitoring of contract awards, disbursements, consultant recruitment, compliance with
safeguard requirements, and other project implementation milestones were given high priority
and have contributed to further improvement in portfolio management. The capacity of resident
missions to administer the growing number of projects was further strengthened by additional
sector, safeguard, and procurement specialists.

Knowledge Management

Knowledge management remained an important pillar of ADB’s assistance program in the PRC
and Mongolia, with knowledge and innovation as core themes and with increased emphasis on
generating knowledge from loan and technical assistance operations, and policy research work.
Quality assurance measures, including joint country programming of KPS and peer reviews, were
strengthened. In 2011, 40 KPS were completed and widely disseminated through publications,
7 international conferences, 29 workshops, and 2 book launches. Knowledge sharing on middleincome transition and sustainable development were held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
ADB-PRC partnership and the 20th anniversary of the ADB—Mongolia partnership, respectively.

Progress toward Inclusive Growth in East Asia

* ADB provided about $60 million in lending and technical assistance to increase water-use
efficiency in the PRC's Qinghai Province by converting irrigation schemes, improving
agricultural extension services and institutional capacity, and empowering farmer
associations for irrigated agricultural services and management.

* Technical assistance was provided to improve access to financial and social security
services to poor and vulnerable households in the PRC. Assistance was provided to
study the sustainability of the new rural pension scheme, to design the database
system for monitoring the operation of rural pensions, and to strengthen rural pension
administration and services.

* A $20 million loan was approved to provide much-needed higher education reforms
in Mongolia.

* Mongolia’s Agriculture and Rural Development Project developed value chains,
which helped deliver unique, premium value agro-processing products to foreign
niche markets.

« ADB successfully demonstrated an energy-efficient district heating project in rural towns
in Mongolia, achieving a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and improving access of
residents, schools, and hospitals to a reliable heating service.

 

 

 

KPS produced for the PRC and Mongolia are in response to country demand. Priority themes
for the PRC are macroeconomic management, energy efficiency and environmental protection,
poverty reduction, and interprovincial cooperation. In the PRC, core KPS were completed on
industrial transfer policies (from coastal to inland regions, and from international to domestic
markets) and the development of the secondary loan market.

The brief policy notes series covered topics on the 12th Five-Year Plan, middle-income
transition, natural resource taxation, electricity sector challenges, and provincial development
strategies. In Mongolia, KPS focused on economic growth (especially increasing productivity)
and poverty reduction (including food security). Core KPS completed include good cases for
university—industry collaboration and livestock-based manufacturing.

ADB continued to explore knowledge partnerships with the PRC’s centers of excellence
to expand mutual learning experiences between the PRC and other developing member
countries in urban development, the transport sector, water security, and agricultural and rural
development. The PRC-ADB Knowledge-Sharing Platform was presented as a case study at the
Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Republic of Korea, in November as an
innovative example of South-South knowledge cooperation. ADB presented at the 17th session
of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
in Durban, South Africa, the early findings of the study on Economics of Climate Change in
Northeast Asia covering the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia.

Regional Cooperation

Regional cooperation and integration has become integral to ADB’s operations in the PRC. ADB
facilitates an increasing number of engagements with the PRC through subregional cooperation
programs for Central Asia (Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation [CAREC]), the
Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), the PRC—Mongolia partnership, and the Pan-Beibu Gulf.
The PRC continued to be an active participant in regional cooperation and made notable progress
in both GMS and CAREC activities. It strengthened cooperation with Mongolia by concluding
an amended road transport agreement and expanding the pilot of joint customs to a new pair
of border-crossing points. In 2011, the government expressed its commitment to replenish the
PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund with $20 million.

In Mongolia, regional cooperation is providing an opportunity to change from a landlocked
country into a land bridge for trade, to gain greater access to international markets, and to further
tap its growth potential. ADB’s regional cooperation and integration-related support to Mongolia
is delivered through the CAREC program and country lending operations. Major achievements
include start-up of a $45 million project to develop a regional multimodal logistics center in Zamyn
Uud, establishment and full operation of a customs automated information system with financial
support from ADB, pilot-testing of joint customs control with the PRC, and construction of a
central transport corridor linking Mongolia with the PRC.

With support from ADB and other development partners, Mongolia completed a master plan
and feasibility study on the development of a national single window, a facility that allows parties
in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents via a single entry point.

Country Highlights
The People’s Republic of China

Partnership priorities. The strategic thrusts of the current CPS remain valid and are aligned with the
key priorities of the PRC’s 12th Five-Year Plan and ADB’s Strategy 2020. Knowledge and innovation
are core themes of the ADB-PRC country partnership strategy. Further greening of the PRC portfolio
was achieved with the approval of projects covering reforestation, energy efficiency, environmental
improvement, and integrated urban transport development. The inclusive dimension of operations
was strengthened by supporting urban infrastructure development, natural resource conservation,
and rural livelihood development in the less affluent central and western provinces. Private sector
operations complemented public sector operations by supporting private sector participation in the
provision of water supply and distribution in small and medium-sized cities.

Impact of operations. ADB is supporting the government in its efforts to fulfill the strategic
priorities of inclusive and regionally balanced development, natural resource conservation, and
environmental protection, including climate change adaptation and mitigation. Investments in
clean energy and energy efficiency are helping the PRC to achieve the 12th Five-Year Plan target
to reduce energy intensity of gross domestic product by 16%.

Against this background, ADB made substantial progress in 2011 in constructing the first
commercial-scale integrated gasification combined cycle power plant (i.e., clean-coal technology

ADB-PRC Knowledge-Sharing Platform Showcases Ideas in Sustainable Agriculture

Useful ideas in sustainable agriculture and rural development were shared at the third High
Level Regional Knowledge-Sharing Platform workshop in Beijing on 8-11 November. More than
70 officials, researchers, and academics from 13 developing member countries (DMCs) attended
the event, whose theme was “Agricultural and Rural Development: Improving Farm Productivity
and Rural Livelihoods.” Discussions included successful policies and practices, as well as possible
future cross-border collaboration in communicating knowledge between the People’s Republic
of China and other DMCs. Participants went on a 2-day field visit to the Biogas Cooperative
at Dongjiecun Village in Anyang County and to the Henan Yongchang Feitian Starch Sugar
Company, where the production of renewable energy from agricultural wastes and sustainable
agro-processing were showcased. (PHOTO: KAN LEI)

and retrofitting existing equipment with more energy-efficient equipment. These efforts will
help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and, therefore, reduce greenhouse gases and improve air
quality. Urban infrastructure development projects for the Xinjiang Uygur and Guangxi Zhuang
autonomous regions helped to align the country program’s work with the GMS and CAREC
programs by improving the enabling environment in cities in regional economic corridors.
Technical assistance complemented lending by supporting sector policy reforms and climate
change-related initiatives, particularly voluntary carbon trading schemes being pilot-tested
by Beijing and Tianjin. Continuing the impetus on knowledge sharing, the third KnowledgeSharing Workshop on Agriculture and Rural Development was organized with 13 DMCs
participating. The delegates discussed emerging issues and challenges and shared best practices,
and hailed the ADB—PRC Knowledge-Sharing Platform as an effective networking vehicle
on South-South cooperation.

Upgraded Mongolia Road Link Supports Regional Trade

Zamyn Uud is a town of 15,000 in southeastern Mongolia, on the PRC border (the border
crossing area is pictured here). Trade and tourism are expected to rise sharply in coming years
once a paved road, which currently stops at the western edge of town, extends northward to
Sainshand and Ulaanbaatar. The upgrading of the road from the city of Choir to Sainshand,
financed by ADB, has already shortened journey times, facilitating trade. When rehabilitation of
the 430-kilometer stretch between Choir and Zamyn Uud is finished, the corridor will support
further development and facilitate the flow of goods between Siberia and the PRC, increasing
Mongolia’s importance as an Asian transport hub. The development is part of an initiative being
undertaken by the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, in which ADB is a
major partner. (PHOTO: LILIAN VALERIO)

Mongolia

Partnership priorities. For 2 decades, ADB has been Mongolia’s largest source of official
development assistance, playing a key role in the country’s impressive transformation to a marketbased economy. The current country operations business plan for 2009-2012 focuses on health,
education, the finance sector, and infrastructure. Thanks to vast mineral resources, Mongolia
has become one of the fastest-growing countries in the world and finds itself on the threshold
of prosperity. It was reclassified in August, making it eligible for funding from ADB’s ordinary
capital resources, while maintaining access to concessional financing from the ADF.

Despite breakaway growth, Mongolia faces severe development challenges, including
persistent unemployment and growing inequality, rapid urbanization, and isolation from
international markets. In 2010, 39% of the population was poor, with households headed by women
and recent urban migrants most affected. Mining will generate revenues but not many jobs, and

 

76East Asia

 

could reduce competitiveness of other exports. Poverty reduction and inclusive growth, therefore,
remain formidable challenges. Substantial investment in human and physical infrastructure is
needed to realize Mongolia’s full potential.

Impact of operations. ADB assistance is helping ensure that benefits from the country’s rapid
growth accrue to all citizens. Investments in education and health have kept Mongolia on track
to meet the related Millennium Development Goals. In an economy increasingly dependent on
mining revenue and related services, appropriate skills training is critical. ADB is supporting
reform of higher education and will help modernize vocational training. ADB has also made
major investments to improve primary health services and health insurance, and is supporting
policy reforms and investments in the hospital sector and drug safety.

With high food prices adversely affecting the poor, ADB developed a food stamp
program that accurately targets the most vulnerable households, using a new means-testing
system. More than 50,000 beneficiaries have entered the program, and the goal is to reach
100,000. Targeted social assistance marks a major shift in Mongolia’s social welfare strategy
and is a key component of the recently approved social welfare law. More progress was made
in 2011 in providing a unique safety net to ensure food security for the poor through a food and
nutrition social welfare program.

Faced with high levels of migration to towns and cities from rural areas, ADB is supporting
investments in water, sewerage, roads, and pathways in low-income neighborhoods. In the energy
sector, ADB assisted in drafting Mongolia’s energy conservation policy. The government also
appointed ADB as the public—private partnership transaction adviser for a new combined heat and
power plant in Ulaanbaatar. This project will support economic growth and improve residents’
access to reliable heating services.

Overview

technical assistance was $12.95 million. Reflecting ADB’s Pacific Approach 2010-2014,
programming in 2011 supported Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) in focusing
on projects for engaging women and youth, rural and outer islanders, and other disadvantaged and
vulnerable people. Programming also supported regional cooperation and integration in response
to the challenges facing Pacific island countries. ADB continued to strengthen coordination and
cooperation with development partners and government agencies through high-level consultations.
Another mechanism employed has been the establishment of joint development coordination
offices servicing Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu.!
ADB’s approach to fragile and conflict-affected situations continued to guide its response to
the special circumstances of the region.

T otal new lending to countries in the Pacific subregion was $238.02 million and total nonregional

Knowledge Management

ADB contributed to the sharing of knowledge through a variety of initiatives incorporating
publications, reports, policy briefs, workshops, and conferences. For example, The Political Economy
of Economic Reform in the Pacific was published under the Pacific Studies Series, providing insights
into the challenges of economic reform in the South Pacific and Timor-Leste and pointing to ways
in which ADB and development partners can provide more effective assistance to Pacific DMCs.

ADB has documented the experiences from a pilot climate change adaptation project, Protecting
Island Biodiversity and Traditional Culture in the Cook Islands, to provide a better understanding
of how to help communities identify and address climate and disaster risks. In November, ADB
organized a Regional Inception and Launching Workshop for Strengthening Coastal and Marine
Resources Management in the Coral Triangle of the Pacific (Phase 2), in Nadi, Fiji. At the workshop,
key government counterparts and development partners discussed potential synergies and partnerships
on effective management of coastal and marine ecosystems.

Regional Cooperation

ADB maintained a strong commitment to the Pacific’s own strategic planning documents—
the Pacific Plan and the Cairns Compact. It contributed to regional mechanisms for coordinating
development, such as the Forum Economic Ministers’ Meeting and Pacific Island Countries—
Development Partners’ meeting. High-level consultations with donor partners, including Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and the United States, as well as multi-party consultations with Australia,
the European Commission, International Monetary Fund, the Japan International Cooperation
Agency, New Zealand, and the World Bank Group, helped strengthen regional cooperation
and coordination.

ADB supported the Pacific to register some significant successes in the provision of services
across the region. The Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF), a partnership between ADB,
Australia, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, New Zealand, and the World
Bank Group, has approved projects with a cumulative value of $541 million.? ADB is leading PRIF
investment projects in the transport, water and sanitation, and energy sectors in four Pacific DMCs,
as well as through several major regional initiatives. ADB also manages the Pacific Infrastructure

$20.0 million from Asian Development Fund resources and $51.2 million cofinanced by
the Government of Australia, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the OPEC Fund
for International Development, and the World Health Organization), approved by the
ADB Board in 2011, will promote greater access to health services by improving the
quality of primary health care.

* In Samoa, the Economic Recovery Support Program, backed by two subprogram loans
totaling $26.8 million, is facilitating the nation’s recovery from the combined impact
of the global financial crisis and the 2009 tsunami. Policies being implemented by the
government will build greater resilience to human-made and natural disasters, benefiting
communities and businesses.

* In Vanuatu, the Interisland Shipping Support Project ($10.8 million) is enabling the
government to connect rural populations to markets and provide economic opportunities
by improving wharves and reestablishing outer island shipping routes.

* In Palau, the Water Sector Improvement Program ($16.0 million) is providing a more
reliable supply of treated water to communities in Babeldaob and Koror.

* A policy and advisory technical assistance ($0.5 million funded by the Japan Fund for
Poverty Reduction) is supporting the Government of the Cook Islands to introduce wideranging, cost-effective reforms to the public sector, including changes that will improve
the delivery of essential services to communities in the outer islands.

 

 

 

Advisory Centre, which provides rapid-response technical assistance in all infrastructure sectors
on behalf of the PRIF partners.

Issues common across the Pacific are being addressed cooperatively. ADB regional technical
assistance ($17.68 million approved in 2011) helped improve national auditing, results-based
management systems, public financial management, and strengthened regional capacity to collect
and compile data relating to the Millennium Development Goals. Regional projects to promote
access to renewable energy, strengthen disaster preparedness, and manage coastal and marine
resources improved the capacity of Pacific DMCs to respond to climate change.

Portfolio Management

ADB’s portfolio in the Pacific region, comprising 35 loan and grant-funded projects, and
77 technical assistance projects, was managed through regular review missions and close
coordination with the governments’ executing agencies. For Papua New Guinea, with a portfolio
of 11 projects amounting to 55% of the total Pacific portfolio value, an annual high-level country
portfolio review with government helped resolve implementation issues.

ADB’s four field offices in the Pacific region played a key role in portfolio management as
55% of the project portfolio and 27% of the technical assistance portfolio have been delegated
to them. Training of executing agency staff and capacity development of institutions were
undertaken through ADB’s project implementation and loan disbursement seminars. These were
supplemented by regional technical assistance targeting specific countries.

Budget Support

ADB's main support to countries most affected by the global economic crisis was through
policy-based loans provided as general budget support. The total package of loans and grants
under these Economic Recovery Support Programs to the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Tonga was close to $80 million. ADB and the respective
governments had initially agreed on actions the respective administrations would need

to take in key policy areas before ADB could release funds under the program.

In 2011, ADB approved the second tranches of policy-based loans to Samoa, Solomon
Islands, and Tonga, totaling $20.8 million. By supplementing government funds, the loans
facilitated infrastructure investment, helped protect basic social services, strengthened fiscal
governance, and allowed governments to pursue priority structural reforms.

An emphasis on protection for the poor and vulnerable was an innovative feature of these
programs. Budget support provided under the Solomon Islands program allowed a higher level
of social expenditure than would otherwise have been possible. In fact, in 2011, the government
allocated more of its own funds ($19.5 million above the 2009 level) to non-payroll costs for
education, health, and infrastructure services.

The programs in the Cook Islands and Tonga supported analytical work to identify vulnerable
groups. As a result, action is now being taken to target the vulnerable, including the elderly and
people with disabilities. In Tonga, basic health and education expenditures were safeguarded
from the impact of significant across-the-board budget cuts. In the Cook Islands, the program
allowed the government to adjust social welfare allowances of vulnerable people for inflation.

In Samoa, the program supported the rebuilding of infrastructure damaged by the September
2009 tsunami, which led to an early pickup in domestic economic activity and employment.

 

 

 

In 2011, 60% of the Pacific Department’s projects were rated satisfactory. Problem projects
reflected start-up, contracting, and procurement delays.

There were 29 ongoing loans for $894.5 million and 14 ongoing grants for $177.7 million in
13 countries. Contract awards reached $106.5 million and disbursements totaled $110.8 million.

Country Highlights
The Cook Islands

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership strategy (CPS) 2008-2012 supports
Te Kaveinga Nui, the Cook Islands’ National Sustainable Development Plan 2007—2010, and is closely
aligned with ADB’s Pacific Approach 2010-2014. The strategy focuses on developing infrastructure,
renewable energy, and improving public finance management and public service performance.

Impact of operations. Through the Avatiu Port Development Project, trade, connectivity, and
service delivery to the outer islands is being strengthened. ADB technical assistance supported a
functional review of the public service, including outer island administration. Cabinet has approved
some recommendations which, once implemented, will improve delivery of public services.

Fiji
Partnership priorities. All ADB operations are guided by the April 2007 Approach to

Reengagement. Ongoing projects address roads upgrading and water supply and sanitation, and
respond to the devastating floods of 2009.

 

82Pacific

 

Impact of operations. Under the Third Fiji Road Upgrading Project (Supplementary), due to
end in 2012, nearly 6,000 people gained access to sealed roads in 2011 with the completion of
the Kings Road subproject. Vehicle operating speeds increased to more than 50 kilometers per
hour. People in local communities benefited because the project gave them regular and cheaper
access to markets and services, including health and education.

Kiribati

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2010-2014 supports improved public financial management
and delivery of sustainable infrastructure services.

Impact of operations. With support from ADB technical assistance, the government continued
reforms to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and reduce the drain
they place on public finances. The loss-making Kiribati Supply Company Limited was sold to a
private company. Improved cash flows and financial recording helped enable Kiribati Shipping
Services Limited vessels to continue operations, which included the transportation of 3,000
students back to their homes from schools in the capital, and delivery of food to the outer islands.

The Marshall Islands

Partnership priorities. The country operations business plan (COBP) 2012-2014 focuses
on macroeconomic and fiscal management, private sector development, human capacity
development, and environment and climate change.

Impact of operations. The electricity supply for businesses and communities improved as a
result of an ADB program loan approved in 2010 to support the Marshalls Energy Company in
repaying a high-interest loan. Using the cash-flow savings, the company overhauled a generator
that now has a significantly higher output, uses less fuel, and has resulted in fewer power outages.

The Federated States of Micronesia

Partnership priorities. Support for governance reform and strengthening infrastructure in the
energy, water, and transportation sectors remain priorities.

Impact of operations. ADB energy projects are improving electricity services to businesses and
the community while lessening the country’s reliance on imported oil by developing renewable
energy options. Improved water supply and sanitation services ensure schools and hospitals
have easy access to drinking water, and to sewerage systems. Communities, especially women,
are important beneficiaries of tapped potable water. ADB expects that levels of disease, such as
outbreaks of cholera which have resulted in deaths in some states, will be reduced.

Nauru

Partnership priorities. The COBP 2012-2014 includes operations in public sector management
and the energy sector. This is the first COBP approved since ADB reengaged Nauru in 2008.

Impact of operations. ADB supported reform of the key SOEs that dominate Nauru’s economy
to make them more efficient. This included the introduction of a performance management

system for senior management, a new corporate structure, and the recruitment of an external
chief executive officer for the SOE that exports phosphate. ADB also advised on options for
corporatizing SOEs. As a result of this advice, the Nauru Utilities Corporation Act was passed
in June 2011, paving the way for significant reform of the Nauru Utilities Authority.

Palau

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2009-2013 focuses on improving public sector effectiveness,
facilitating private sector development, delivering safe water and sanitation services, and managing
the threats of climate change.

Impact of operations. A medium-term program to improve water supply and sanitation
commenced in 2011. The program is expected to improve the reliability of access to water and
ensure that Palauans, and the 100,000 tourists who visit annually, have access to water even
during times of drought. Improvements in sanitation infrastructure and management will prevent
overflows of sewage into low-lying communities. Palau was assisted in creating a national health
savings account and insurance scheme, which is giving greater access for all Palauans to health
services in Palau and overseas.

Papua New Guinea

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2011-2015 focuses on infrastructure to improve access to jobs,
markets, and services; to strengthen electric power generation; and to open finance, telecommunications, and business opportunities. The partnership also commits ADB to helping the government
deliver rural primary health services under its new National Health Plan.

Impact of operations. Two new subsidized community shipping franchises financed by ADB
were established during 2011. As a result, growers along the south coast of East New Britain
Province ramped up production of copra, cocoa, and palm oil because of the cheaper and more
reliable access to markets afforded by the new shipping arrangements. The ADB-supported
Nationwide Microbank welcomed its 100,000th account holder during 2011, making it the largest
microbank in the Pacific. ADB financed the reconstruction of 115 kilometers of national roads
under difficult conditions in the Highlands Region, improving access to markets and education and
health services. An ADB technical assistance supported PNG Power Limited to complete power
factor correction improvements at 11 major consumers in Port Moresby, saving 180,000 kilowatthours annually. Approximately 900,000 people benefited from health facilities and services
provided by the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control project. The newly approved Rural Primary
Health Services Delivery Project (cofinanced by the Government of Australia, the Japan
International Cooperation Agency, the OPEC Fund for International Development, and the World
Health Organization) will promote greater access to health services by improving the quality of
primary health care in selected provinces.

Samoa
Partnership priorities. ADB’s CPS 2008-2012 includes support for improved public services

delivery, the removal of infrastructure constraints, and promotion of private sector development.
The CPS aligns with the Strategy for the Development of Samoa 2008-2012.

Bringing Banking Services to Remote Regions of Papua New Guinea

Before opening an account with Nationwide Microbank (NMB) in 2011, Tommie Seriate kept her
earnings buried under her fireplace. Until then, saving had proved difficult for the 49-year-old Papua
New Guinea widow and subsistence farmer. NMB (formerly Wau Microbank) was established as
part of the Microfinance and Employment Project, supported with a $9.6 million ADB concessional
loan to the Government of Papua New Guinea. NMB today has branches in 13 provinces and aims
to have a branch in all 20 provinces by the end of 2012. Meantime, in partnership with ADB's
Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative and the government, it is working on complementary
programs that will further strengthen microfinance in the country—such as offering financial
services through the use of mobile phones—benefiting more people like Ms. Seriate. She is seen
here, at center, receiving her account book from NMB staff. (PHOTO: NATIONWIDE MICROBANK)

Impact of operations. ADB’s Economic Recovery Support Program, Subprogram 2 loan of
$10.8 million, approved in 2011, continued to support the government’s investment in infrastructure
and an enabling business environment, building greater resilience to natural disasters and economic
shocks. Rehabilitation and civil works for six schools supported by the Education Sector Project II
were completed. The Sanitation and Drainage Project, which closed in May, contributed to
significantly improving the environment and public health in Apia, the capital, by reducing flooding
in the town center, establishing a large, reticulated wastewater collection and treatment system, and
upgrading skills on wastewater and sanitation services of personnel in the Samoa Water Authority.

Solomon Islands
Partnership priorities. The COBP 2012-2014 includes operations in transport infrastructure and
information and communication technology, public sector management, and renewable energy.

Private sector development is promoted in all these sectors as a cross-cutting theme.

Impact of operations. Since 2004, ADB’s assistance to develop integrated transport systems in
remote islands has improved connectivity and facilitated trade by rehabilitating 335 kilometers

model of joint government—development partner coordination in the Pacific.

Timor-Leste

Partnership priorities. ADB’s support concentrates on infrastructure development and
management, and is designed to promote the private sector as a driver of inclusive growth.
A new engagement in education will deliver training in construction and automotive trades
by strengthening public and private training providers. ADB will also continue to support the
development of the finance sector and regional cooperation and integration.

Impact of operations. Construction of 130 kilometers of road upgrades commenced, funded by a
$46 million grant. Ten years of ADB support for the Instituigao de Microfinangas de Timor-Leste
culminated in its inauguration in July 2011 as the Banco Nacional de Comércio de Timor-Leste,
the country’s first locally owned commercial bank. The new bank opened with branches in 11 of
Timor-Leste’s 13 districts, $4.5 million in savings from almost 40,000 depositors, and $8.0 million
in loans from more than 10,000 borrowers, 4,000 of whom were women.

Tonga

Partnership priorities. ADB’s CPS 2007-2012 focuses on poverty reduction through integrated
urban infrastructure development, prudent macroeconomic and fiscal management, and the
development of the private sector. The CPS remains relevant to the objectives of the Tonga
Strategic Development Framework.

Impact of operations. The Integrated Urban Development Project supported improved
community sanitation and road widening, which benefited 32% of the population in Nuku’alofa
and other project areas. The $5 million second tranche of the Economic Support Program
grant, disbursed in 2011, enabled the government to retain adequate budget allocations for
primary education and health, despite reduced revenue and remittances as a result of the global
economic crisis. ADB technical assistance to economic and strategic management facilitated
strengthening of the government’s corporate planning process, and preparation of a medium-term
budget framework.

Tuvalu

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2008-2012 supports priorities and strategies for public
enterprise management identified in Ze Kakeega II, the Tuvalu National Strategy for Sustainable
Development 2005-2015.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to focus on improving management in the public sector
and strengthening the development of the private sector. A public expenditure and financial
accountability assessment was undertaken, helping government identify weaknesses in public
financial management systems, which is guiding the design of a reform program to allow for better
expenditure decisions and usage of limited resources in the delivery of social services. Release of

Rebuilding Tonga’s Infrastructure

In Tonga, in the capital Nuku'alofa and on the main island of Tongatapu, health and social services
have been deteriorating along with sanitation, drainage, roads, and waste disposal facilities.
To upgrade the islands’ infrastructure, ADB is supporting the government with an $11.3 million
grant for its Integrated Urban Development Sector Project. Under this program, all-weather roads
with proper drains (like this one at Sopu Village) are being built in low-income and low-lying
residential subdivisions affected by recurring floods. As part of the project, too, workers have built
wells to enable the monitoring of pollution levels in groundwater round the capital. Checks are
made monthly to see if sewage from septic tanks is getting into the sea with implications for health.

the second tranche ($2.0 million) of the Improved Financial Management Program allowed the
government to further reduce its debt with the National Bank of Tuvalu and improved the ability
of the bank to operate commercially.

Vanuatu

Partnership priorities. The CPS 2010-2014 continues to focus on transport, urban development,
and energy. It aims to strengthen the private sector through an improved regulatory environment,
better access to finance, and the reform of SOEs.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to improve access for rural businesses and communities
to financial services. Establishment of the ADB—World Bank Development Coordination Office
in Vanuatu in 2010 significantly strengthened ADB’s relationship with the Government of Vanuatu
and its development partners. This was reflected through two successful loan negotiations in
late 2011 for the Interisland Shipping Support Project (cofinanced by the New Zealand Aid
Programme) and the Port Vila Urban Development Project (cofinanced by the Australian Agency
for International Development). The Interisland Shipping Support Project will provide enhanced
access to markets and social services through improved water transport infrastructure to and
from rural areas.

Overview

growth. Regional cooperation and integration initiatives achieved major milestones in 2011,
including the approval of the new South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy.

Through the South Asia Department, ADB continued to deliver a program fully aligned with
the priorities of Strategy 2020. Efforts to foster private sector development in core operations were
strengthened. Particular attention was given to ensuring that assistance was sustainable and inclusive
by mainstreaming climate change initiatives aggressively, persisting with a focus on green growth, and
supporting social inclusion. Assistance was also provided for addressing education and skills constraints,
water scarcity, energy inefficiency, and poor transport connectivity, and for tackling finance sector and
public sector management challenges. Efforts at regional cooperation and integration emphasized
improvements to transport connectivity, trade facilitation, and energy cooperation.

A DB’s operations in South Asia are aimed at accelerating sustainable development and inclusive

Knowledge Management

In 2011, ADB developed a department-wide knowledge management approach to promote the
effective generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge in and from the operations of
the South Asia Department. ADB continued to produce many products that provide regular avenues
for knowledge creation and sharing, promote discussion, and enhance understanding of current
economic and development issues in South Asia, and facilitate policy dialogue and reforms.

As of 31 December, a total of 123 knowledge products had been completed. These include
working papers, sector/thematic papers, and country briefs. Topics range from finance, such as
the working paper Product Innovations for Financing Infrastructure, to climate change, such as
the report Adapting to Climate Change: Strengthening the Climate Resilience of Water Sector
Infrastructure in Khulna, Bangladesh.

Portfolio Management

Through its South Asia Department, ADB manages a portfolio comprising 193 projects (loans
and grants) and 209 technical assistance projects in the six South Asian countries. About 73% of
the ongoing projects are on track.

During 2011, ADB focused attention on further improvements in portfolio performance in
the subregion, to address systemic issues. Backed by strong client engagement, regular high-level
country and tripartite portfolio performance reviews played a key role in identifying key measures
and actions. Continued capacity development and training complemented clients’ own efforts to
improve performance and deliver results.

Portfolio results were also strong in 2011. Loan disbursements reached $2.2 billion, and
contract awards reached $2.9 billion.

Regional Cooperation

Under the auspices of ADB, in October 2011, the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation
(SASEC) working groups on transport, trade facilitation, and energy met and forged important
agreements. The working groups endorsed investment projects worth $2.0 billion and demonstrated
a strong commitment of SASEC countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal) to strengthen
transport connectivity, trade facilitation, and energy cooperation.

Progress toward Inclusive Growth in South Asia

* In Bangladesh, the Northwest Crop Diversification Project (2001-2011) raised the
average income of more than 3.2 million farmer households by up to 56% and cropping
intensity by 28%. The project generated over 4.2 million days of additional employment
opportunities per year.

* In Bhutan, ADB’s Road Network Project and the Road Network Project II expanded
accessibility to rural areas and improved economic prospects, living conditions, and the
quality of life for communities near the project by providing jobs, shortening travel times,
decreasing transport costs, and improving access to health services and education.

* In Nepal, the ADB-supported Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women Project
provided income-generating and entrepreneurship training to 9,700 women. More than
71,189 households benefited from community infrastructure schemes relating to
drinking water, irrigation, water mills, and roads. Nearly 46,000 women have accessed
microfinance services through women’s saving and credit cooperatives.

* In India, the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Program approved in 2005 has
adopted a participatory irrigation management approach to rehabilitate and upgrade
minor and medium-sized irrigation systems and improve water resources management.
Nearly 200 water users’ associations have been strengthened through capacity building,
and inclusivity has been ensured through one-third participation of women. Holistic
agricultural interventions covering about 100,000 hectares have resulted in 100% increase
in paddy yield benefiting about 150,000 farm families.

* In Sri Lanka, ADB's support for the North East Coastal Community Development Project
(2005-2010) helped people affected by conflict and the 2004 tsunami. The project
assisted in rebuilding schools, health facilities, local access roads, community
infrastructure, and livelihoods with targeted assistance to households headed by women.
In the city of Batticaloa, the project helped more than 25,000 households headed by
women to rebuild their lives.

 

 

ADB assisted South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) members in
studies on regional economic integration, data collection on trade in services, and development
of capital markets. The studies will provide inputs for conceptualizing a South Asia Economic
Union. ADB also provided assistance to SAARC for the Indian Ocean Cargo and Passenger Ferry
Project, which aims to strengthen sea connectivity in South Asia. An interim report examining the
economic viability of the ferry services was submitted to the 17th SAARC Summit in November.

Aknowledge-sharing conference on regional cooperation, along with a consultative session
on the institutional strengthening of SAARC, was jointly organized by the Government of
the Maldives, the SAARC Secretariat, and ADB in Malé, Maldives, in October. Discussions
focused on knowledge products prepared by two think tanks, the South Asia Centre for Policy
Studies and the South Asia Network of Economic Research Institutes, with the support of ADB.
The consultative session provided valuable inputs for debate on strengthening the institutional
architecture of SAARC.

On 8 December, the Board endorsed the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy
(RCS) for 2011-2015, which has four distinct features. These are a high degree of ownership
by the concerned governments; sharper focus on transport, energy, and trade facilitation;

a flexible implementation framework; and strong synergy between the new RCS and country
partnership strategies.

The RCS will adopt a two-pronged approach: assistance for project implementation and
for capacity development. Effective gender mainstreaming, greater private sector participation,
and promotion of green technologies will be the main cross-cutting themes embedded in project
designs. Progress will be tracked through design and monitoring frameworks and results matrices.

Country Highlights
Bangladesh

Partnership priorities. Under the country partnership strategy (CPS) for Bangladesh 2011-2015,
which is closely aligned with the government’s Sixth Five Year Plan, ADB is contributing to
making the growth process greener and more inclusive. The strategy focuses on energy, transport,
urban, education, agriculture, and finance. ADB is promoting public—private partnerships for
closing infrastructure-financing deficits, and making greater efforts to enhance cofinancing from
other development partners.

Five loans totaling $900 million were approved in 2011. Jointly financed with eight other
development partners, the Third Primary Education Development Project will support government
priorities to improve student learning and completion rates and to reduce disparities across
the country. The Power System Efficiency Improvement Project, cofinanced by the Islamic
Development Bank, will help replace aging, energy-inefficient power plants.

Impact of operations. The ADB-assisted Second Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project
made social services and economic opportunities more accessible to rural people, including
poor women, in various districts. The Post-Literacy and Continuing Education Project helped
about 700,000 people, half of them women, acquire functional literacy and social and incomegenerating skills. The West Zone Power System Development Project nearly tripled the capacity
for transferring power from eastern to western regions, and improved the voltage profile of the
west. The Chittagong Port Trade Facilitation Project contributed to enhancing container terminal
capacity and port and customs management through the introduction of modern automated systems.

Bhutan

Partnership priorities. The current CPS and the country operations business plan for 2012-2014
continue to guide ADB’s operations for the remainder of the country’s current Five Year Plan.
ADB provides program and project assistance in four sectors (energy, transport, urban sector
development, and finance and private sector development) along with capacity development in
operational sectors and support for overall management of the development process. In 2011,
ADB provided $19.9 million for the Urban Infrastructure Project, which will provide urban
infrastructure facilities in Thimpu, Pheuntsholing, and other towns. Five technical assistance
grants, worth a combined $2.7 million, were approved to support projects in the energy, finance,
public sector management, and transport sectors.

Impact of operations. Accessibility is Bhutan’s key development challenge. A series of road
projects contributed to increased passenger and freight transport by supporting better transport

The Children of Bangladesh Look to a Brighter Future

In Bangladesh, inadequacies in the primary school education system have resulted in low levels of
teacher—pupil interaction, poor teacher training, and high dropout rates. To improve achievement
levels, the government put $1,161 million into the Second Primary Education Development
Program. As the lead agency coordinating 10 development partners’ support for the initiative,
ADB contributed $109.8 million. Nationally, about 45,000 new teachers were recruited under
the project and more than 526 million textbooks were distributed free of charge to 113 million
students. As a direct result of this ADB-supported program, more and more children are
completing school, getting good grades, and winning scholarships. (PHOTO: RICHIE ABRINA)

efficiency on the trunk road network, and expanded accessibility in rural areas. The Road Network
Project connected the main east-west highway at Trongsa to the Indian border at Gelephu, while the
Road Network Project II integrated the southern region with India, Bhutan’s largest trading
partner. The provision of electricity in rural areas through rural electrification projects has helped
more than 17,000 households and micro industries since 2004. It has also helped make education
more accessible.

ADB Loans Transform Indian Microbusinesses

A $50 million ADB credit line for entrepreneurs running micro- and small businesses is directly
assisting hundreds of Indian artisans involved in manufacturing goods ranging from furniture,
handicrafts, and jewelry to machinery and clothing. The loans are provided via the Small Industries
Development Bank of India, the implementing agency for ADB’s Micro, Small, and Medium
Enterprise Development Project, which is aimed at businesses that are too small to access formal
banking services. About 1,089 entrepreneurs in eight states have so far received funds under the
project. By the time it ends in 2015, ADB expects it to have benefited about 4,000 enterprises like
those of Vijaya Lakshmi (right), seen here with her sister in Bhubaneswar, Orissa. Ms. Lakshmi’s
garment-manufacturing business, Vijaya Handicrafts, supplies to 52 institutions across the state.

India

Partnership priorities. ADB continued to support India’s efforts to achieve inclusive and
environmentally sustainable growth, as emphasized in ADB’s CPS for India 2009-2012. While
infrastructure development remained a key priority, the 2011 program focused on assisting India
in promoting clean and renewable energy and balanced regional development through operations
in economically weaker and remote states.

 

94South Asia

 

India’s loan approvals in 2011 were $2.3 billion (excluding nonsovereign operations).
Contract awards amounted to $1.75 billion and disbursements were over $1.4 billion.

Many projects were innovative and met the government’s “Finance Plus” criterion whereby
projects undertaken with funding from multilateral development agencies should make significant
contributions in addition to the provision of finance. For instance, the Madhya Pradesh State
Roads Project III introduced the concept of “green highways” by incorporating bioengineering
designs, the use of extensive vegetative cover, structural measures to combat erosion, and the
adoption of compensatory reforestation beyond the minimum statutory requirement.

The Gujarat Solar Power Transmission Project, approved on 12 September, supports the
development of dedicated common infrastructure for solar power generation that will help
scale up cost-effective generation; promote public—private partnerships; and support vocational
training and skills development for the local population, including women. The Himachal Pradesh
Clean Energy Transmission Project, also approved on 30 September, uses an approach for gasinsulated substations that occupy less space, and are technologically advanced and well suited
to the state’s mountainous and snow-covered terrain.

Impact of operations. Through the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sectors Development Program
and the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Project II, ADB has helped to modernize and build the
capacity of the Madhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation and rehabilitate and reconstruct
nearly 1,700 kilometers of state roads. The project has helped reduce traffic congestion, travel
time, and travel costs while enhancing road safety. A traffic survey conducted after the opening
of the project roads indicated an average vehicle speed on rehabilitated roads of between 40 and
60 kilometers per hour, more than double the average speeds before rehabilitation. By improving
connectivity with the state’s rural road and national highway network, ADB has helped to improve
access to markets and public service facilities, reducing travel time.

The Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project (2000-2011) significantly helped to
improve the overall environment, public health, and hygiene conditions in Kolkata. More than
1 million people have benefited from sewerage and drainage facilities constructed under the
project, with over 300,000 slum dwellers experiencing better sanitation and hygiene.

Through the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project (2005-2013), ADB has helped
rehabilitate and upgrade 147 medium-sized and minor irrigation schemes, including lining of
canal; repairs of damaged structures and cross-drainage works; and construction of new structures,
sluices, and outlets to improve water distribution and reduce water losses. ADB support has
encouraged the mobilization of water users’ associations and contributed to strengthening the
participation of women and vulnerable sectors of the community. By improving agriculture
practices, the project also helped diversify the crop mix and raise yields.

The Maldives

Partnership priorities. The Maldives’ operations continue to be guided by the CPS for 2007—
2011, which concentrates on increasing human resource capacity, strengthening economic
management, improving development effectiveness, and assisting private sector development
through public-private partnerships. The three priority sectors of the strategy are finance
(small and medium-sized enterprise development), energy, and transport. ADB formulated an
interim CPS for the Maldives covering 2012-2013, which will continue to support the priority
sectors. It approved technical assistance projects in 2011 to address capacity constraints in policy

Impact of operations. The Outer Islands Electrification Project implemented for the period
2002-2010 provided 19 islands with power supplies, and the Information Technology Development
Project implemented for the period 2002-2010 improved access to computers in remote atolls.
The Capacity Development for Economic Recovery Project is helping expand micro-, small, and
medium-sized enterprises. The ongoing Economic Recovery Program has assisted in sustaining
the recovery and contributed to sustainable economic growth over the medium term. Meanwhile,
technical assistance attached to the program is enhancing government capacity to achieve policy
and institutional reforms supported by the Program.

Nepal

Partnership priorities. Nepal’s operations continue to be guided by the four strategic pillars of
the CPS for 2010-2012, namely, broad-based and inclusive economic growth, inclusive social
development, governance and capacity building, and climate change adaptation and environmental
sustainability. ADB’s $532.5 million commitment in 2010-2011 consisted of $262.5 million in
2010 and $270 million in 2011. The assistance was aimed at expanding electricity transmission
lines, reforming the school sector, creating better access to finance, improving water supply in
the Kathmandu Valley, and strengthening agriculture and rural livelihoods, and transport and
urban development. In addition, support for mainstreaming climate change and disaster risk
management, gender development, the private sector, and good governance was continued.

Impact of operations. ADB is the main development partner in the agriculture sector, which
represents one of the largest components of its assistance to Nepal. It has supported increased
production of crops and livestock, higher agricultural incomes, better agriculture marketing
infrastructure, and greater employment opportunities for rural people. Increased commercialization
of agriculture with programs linking farms to markets has been achieved through the construction
and rehabilitation of rural roads, which are particularly important in Nepal’s remote mountainous
areas. Between 2004 and 2010, ADB helped build or upgrade 1,015 kilometers of national
highways, as well as provincial, district, and rural roads, benefiting an estimated 5.5 million
people. The ADB-assisted Teacher Education Project has provided preservice training to 15,000
potential teachers—so far offering scholarships to 2,500 female candidates from the disadvantaged
Dalit community in 12 districts—and helped promote equality and inclusion by increasing the
number of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged communities.

Sri Lanka

Partnership priorities. In line with Sri Lanka’s CPS 2009-2011, ADB projects in Sri Lanka
supported the development of sustainable power, water supply, road development, and local
government infrastructure. ADB provided $120 million for strengthening the power transmission
and distribution system and rural electrification in four provinces, including the former conflictaffected Eastern Province. The water supply project targets rural and urban supply in several

 

96South Asia

 

districts spread over the eastern, northern, north central, and southern provinces of the country.
In 2011, ADB provided $85 million as additional financing for the National Highways Sector
Project and $59 million for improving infrastructure and services delivered by local governments
in less-developed areas of seven provinces. The Local Government Enhancement Sector Project
aims to strengthen the capacity of those governments.

Impact of operations. A total of 202,467 households were connected to electricity through
ADB projects by 2010, and 3,932 kilometers of transmission lines were installed or upgraded.
Rehabilitation of national, provincial, and local authority roads within, and leading to, the Northern
Province increased connectivity for returning displaced people, facilitated the provision of basic
services and livelihood recovery, and will encourage increased investment. ADB assistance
to education improved 1,200 secondary schools, strengthened provincial education, and allowed
a stipend program for up to 50,000 disadvantaged students to continue.

Overview

n support of inclusive growth aligned with country priorities and ADB’s Strategy 2020,

ADB formulated country partnership strategies (CPSs) and strategic documents on regional

cooperation. ADB operations in the region focused on creating productive jobs, widening
economic opportunities, and promoting social inclusion.

To create more market opportunities and jobs, ADB supported development of a climateresilient and cost-effective road network in Cambodia, infrastructure for rural poverty
enhancement in the Philippines, and strengthening of institutions in irrigation management in
Viet Nam, among others. To strengthen infrastructure project financing in the near future, ADB and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states established the innovative
ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF). The fund will unlock ASEAN’s untapped resources,
especially foreign exchange reserves and other fund sources, to promote Asia-wide infrastructure
financing requirements. (See box on page 102.)

To promote social inclusion, ADB continued to invest in quality education in the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Programs to eliminate market and institutional
failures and promote good governance are under way in Viet Nam, with the active involvement
of the Women’s Union.

Justice sector reforms in the Philippines place special emphasis on poor and vulnerable sectors.
Social safety nets continue to be implemented in community-driven development programs in the
Tonle Sap Basin of Cambodia and smallholder development projects in the Lao PDR. In addition,
microfinance programs in the Philippines and Thailand promote financial intermediations for
the poor and for small businesses.

Regional Cooperation

ASEAN. In addition to supporting the establishment of the AIF in 2011, a renewed ADB—ASEAN
partnership memorandum of understanding 2011-2015 was prepared, which is expected to
be signed in 2012. Future cooperation activities will be in the areas of connectivity, financial
and capital market integration, environmental sustainability, macroeconomic surveillance and
monitoring of regional economic integration, and trade and investment.

Brunei Darussalam—Indonesia—Malaysia—The Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-—
EAGA) and Indonesia—Malaysia—Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-—GT). ADB assisted
in the preparation of the implementation blueprints 2012-2016 for BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT
as strategic guiding documents, to follow their respective road maps to development. The
overarching objectives of the implementation blueprints are to focus on projects and activities in
hardware and software to quickly demonstrate the impact of development. The associated changes
in institutional structure and operational processes will enable sustainable project development
from 2012 onward. The BIMP—EAGA and IMT-GT implementation blueprints are due to be
launched at the BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT summits, respectively, in mid-2012.

Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). Support for GMS connectivity and competitiveness
reached a new level as the GMS Ten-Year Strategic Framework (2012-2022), prepared with
ADB assistance, was formally endorsed and adopted by GMS leaders at their fourth summit
held in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, in December. The strategic framework, based on an enhanced
economic corridor approach, provides broad directions for surmounting the challenges of the

*« Acommunity-managed irrigation project in five northern provinces of the Lao PDR was
approved, boosting rice yields and expanding the areas under irrigation through innovative community and government partnerships in planning and implementation of projects.

* The construction and rehabilitation of farm-to-market roads, irrigation infrastructure,
and potable water systems under the Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement
Sector Project has helped increase income of small farmers and reduce poverty in farming
communities in the Philippines.

* The Environmental Management Project in Cambodia's Tonle Sap Basin helped to raise
incomes among poor communities by empowering 178 community organizations to
manage flooded forests and fish sanctuaries.

* The Second Education Quality Improvement Project in the Lao PDR involved community
participation in education, particularly in repairing schools and encouraging parents to
send their children, especially girls, to schools. This resulted in improved gender parity
in primary education.

* In Viet Nam, the government adopted ADB's safeguard policy procedures in its preparation

of a resettlement strategy and ethnic minorities development plan for the Northern Chu and
Southern Ma rivers irrigation project. The project, which covers 41 communes in six districts
of Thanh Hoa Province, will benefit about 120,000 households through improved irrigation

cilities and water supplies.

* Microfinance programs in the Philippines and Thailand support strengthening of inclusive

next decade. The summit also reviewed and formally recognized achievements in the various
GMS sectors during the year, among which are the launching of the second phases of the
GMS Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative and of
the Core Agriculture Support Program. Initial consultations were also undertaken to pilot a
new $25 million Government of Japan-supported initiative for trade facilitation in Asia.

Knowledge Management

In 2011, greater emphasis was placed on the “knowledge first, and investments will follow”
approach. Three CPSs and an interim CPS (ICPS) were endorsed, and three more were under
preparation: Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. As part of CPS/ICPS preparations and dialogue,
country, thematic, and sector assessments, strategies, and road maps were prepared. A total of
85 CPS-related studies were completed. Greater emphasis was placed on the importance of
knowledge support being relevant and responsive by ensuring strong ownership and demand
from developing member countries.

To this end, country knowledge strategies are currently under preparation in Cambodia and
Thailand. Country-specific, grant-financed knowledge technical assistance in the education sector

ASEAN Infrastructure Fund

The ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF) was established by members of the Association

of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ADB for a total equity contribution of about

$485 million, with additional capital to be raised through hybrid capital and debt issuance.
The AIF represents an innovative initiative on infrastructure financing to further promote
regional cooperation and integration. Through the AIF, and with ADB's investment, technical,
and operational support, ASEAN’s untapped resources, especially the foreign exchange
reserves, will be catalyzed, representing an important effort at South-South economic links.
This will be achieved through the expected debt issuance (bonds) from the AIF, which can be
purchased by the region's central banks using their foreign exchange reserves.

The AIF is expected to combine its resources with those from ADB and other development
partners to enhance infrastructure development and physical connectivity within the ASEAN
region. With projected lending approval of $300 million, and lending approval growing
to an annual level of about $450 million by 2018 and thereafter, maintaining such a level
would result in the outstanding loan balance of about $2.1 billion by 2020 and about
$4 billion by 2026. The AIF can also finance the public portion of public-private partnership
projects to catalyze additional resources from the private sector. While the AIF will engage
only in sovereign operations during its initial operations, once a strong track record has been
developed, it is expected to expand to nonsovereign (private) operations.

 

 

 

continues to play an important role in Indonesia. ADB’s knowledge role and value addition is
being emphasized in middle-income country partnerships, with quick-response knowledge support
being provided, as exemplified after the 2011 floods in Thailand.

Portfolio Management

The Southeast Asia Department manages a portfolio comprising 136 projects (loans and grants) and
214 technical assistance projects. About 66% of the ongoing projects are on track. Contract awards
reached $2.4 billion and disbursements totaled $1.89 billion. Measures to further improve portfolio
performance increasingly focused on addressing systemic issues affecting project implementation
and on achieving results. These included intensified use of project readiness filters, regular sector
and country-based portfolio performance reviews, improved project implementation arrangements
through enhanced coordination between ADB headquarters and its resident missions, strengthened
staff capacity through training and mentoring, and rationalized project extensions based on their
relevance and cost benefits.

Country Highlights

Brunei Darussalam

Brunei Darussalam’s participation in BIMP—EAGA gained further momentum in 2011 through its
active role in transport, infrastructure, information and communication technology development
clusters, progress in trade facilitation, and strengthening actions in environmental sustainability and
project development. The country’s contribution to BIMP—EAGA and its initiatives are closely aligned
to enhancing ASEAN connectivity, as well as building the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015.

 

102Southeast Asia

 

Brunei Darussalam has contributed to the AIF and, with the finalization and approval of the
AIF’s equity contribution, it is expected to take an active role in its implementation.
In addition, the country has requested that ADB review its membership classification status.

Cambodia

Partnership priorities. ADB’s CPS is aligned with the government’s National Strategic
Development Plan Update 2009-2013. The strategy supports inclusive economic growth
through integrated interventions in agriculture and rural development; provincial and rural
roads; education; finance; water supply, sanitation, and urban development; decentralization
and deconcentration; regional economic integration; private sector development; and a significant
program to mainstream climate resilience into a number of ADB-financed projects. ADB is also
substantially strengthening efforts to ensure safeguards compliance in projects.

Impact of operations. ADB approved the $52 million Provincial Roads Improvement Project.
Its expected outcome includes a safe, climate-resilient, and cost-effective road network that
provides all-year access in agricultural areas of the project provinces. The Environmental
Management Project supported government reform in fisheries and natural resources management
in the Tonle Sap Basin by empowering 178 community fisheries organizations (CFO) to
control illegal fishing, protect and maintain over 16,000 hectares of flooded forests, set up over
1,000 hectares of fish sanctuaries, and initiate 31 community-driven projects. This resulted in
improved protection and management of over 438,000 hectares of the CFO areas.

Indonesia

Partnership priorities. ADB’s partnerships are aligned with the government’s medium-term
development plan and economic development priorities. ADB’s current strategy focuses on
fostering pro-poor, sustainable economic growth and social development. In 2011, the preparation
of the new CPS continued in close consultation with the government. ADB is rebalancing its
support to Indonesia, leaning toward project investments and redoubling its efforts to support
private sector investment through its private sector operations.

Impact of operations. ADB provided support through a $151 million project loan to improve
the quality of the road infrastructure on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan. The project
rehabilitated over 1,200 kilometers of road links that serve interregional trade and local traffic.
The upgrades along these vital routes opened up access to markets, investments, job opportunities,
and social services for many poor communities. ADB supports the Education Sector Analytical
and Capacity Development Partnership (ACDP), which is a facility under Indonesia’s Education
Sector Support Program, and manages the ACDP financial resources on behalf of the government.

The Lao People’s Democratic Republic

Partnership priorities. The CPS for 2012-2016 aligns with the Seventh National SocioEconomic Development Plan 2011-2015 and focuses on four core sectors: energy, education,
urban development, and agriculture and natural resources. The CPS will support the country in
diversifying its economy, with an emphasis on public financial management.

Delivering a Better, Healthier Life for Indonesia's Urban Poor

In the Indonesian city of Palembang, many slum dwellers have traditionally used the Musi River
for washing and waste disposal. ADB’s $73 million Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector
Project has helped improve the lives of these riverside dwellers. By the time the project was
finished in 2011, 152 hectares of Palembang’s slum areas had been transformed, benefiting about
7,000 families. Existing roads, pathways, and drainage channels were upgraded, and new clean
water supply, sanitation, and solid waste management facilities were built. In total, the neighborhood
upgrading project—set up to support the government's urban poverty reduction strategy—has
improved the quality of life for more than 3 million people in 32 cities.

Impact of operations. The Second Education Quality Improvement Project involved
9,800 community members, including Lao Women’s Union representatives. The project encourages
parents to send their children, especially girls, to school. It resulted in an increase of the national
enrollment rate to 92.7% in 2010.

The Northern Community-Managed Irrigation Sector Project has improved food security,
contributing to poverty reduction in rural communities in five northern provinces of the Lao PDR.
Local communities participated fully in planning and implementation, which supports longerterm sustainability. Family food security improved as the areas under irrigation expanded and
rice yields increased.

Malaysia

Partnership priorities. An ICPS between ADB and Malaysia was endorsed by the Board in
November. The country-based engagement signals an expansion in cooperation over regional
initiatives and subregional programs. Designed to support the Tenth Malaysia Plan 2011-2015,
the ICPS prioritizes areas in which ADB has comparative advantage. National operations

 

104Southeast Asia

 

will thus support ADB’s regional initiatives. The ICPS is based entirely on nonsovereign
operations with a reimbursable country developmental technical assistance.

Impact of operations. Though it is too early at present to report the impact of the ICPS initiatives,
ADB expects that the Sarawak—Kalimantan Transmission Link, for example, will promote
regional energy security as large reserves of clean hydropower in Sarawak are utilized. Planned
assistance to development financial institutions will help promote private sector investments
and enable private enterprises to foster regional trade and investment.

Myanmar

Partnership priorities. ADB intensified its monitoring of economic developments in Myanmar,
in coordination with development partners, including participation in the International Monetary
Fund Article IV consultation.

Impact of operations. As a participating member of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program,
Myanmar participates in major GMS meetings and some regional technical assistance projects.
Under the GMS program, ADB undertook analytical work in Myanmar on the railway and
energy sectors. In December, Myanmar hosted the Fourth GMS Summit meeting, at which
ADB participated in a closed-door leaders’ retreat.

The Philippines

Partnership priorities. ADB’s 2011-2016 CPS for the Philippines is aligned with the priorities
of the government’s Philippine Development Plan 2011-2016 and ADB’s Strategy 2020. It aims
to improve the investment climate and boost private sector development, improve social services
delivery, reduce environmental degradation and vulnerability to climate change and disasters,
strengthen governance, and reduce corruption. ADB is also supporting government efforts to
achieve energy security and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by transforming the tricycle industry
through large-scale adoption of locally made, energy-efficient electric tricycles.

Impact of operations. The recently completed Infrastructure for Rural Productivity Enhancement
Sector Project has helped improve socioeconomic conditions in poor rural areas through
the construction and rehabilitation of 1,435 kilometers of farm-to-market roads, irrigation
infrastructure for 1,454 hectares of lands, and the installation of 37 potable water systems.

Through the Social Support Protection Project, ADB is supporting the government’s
implementation of the conditional health and education cash grants provided to about 582,000
poor households in 436 municipalities and 37 cities in 53 provinces. Thus far, the project has
increased the rates of beneficiary households’ compliance with health and education conditions
for cash grants.

ADB provided a $3 million grant to support relief and rehabilitation efforts for families
affected by Tropical Storm Sendong in December.

Thailand

Partnership priorities. The CPS for 2007-2011 focused on infrastructure, environmental
sustainability, and capital market development to enhance economic competitiveness. Policy
dialogue catalyzed public—private partnerships, strengthened regional cooperation, and reinforced

Farming Smarter in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic

A decade ago, life for the villagers of Pak Xong in the southern Lao People’s Democratic Republic
was difficult. Families ate what they could grow and little else. But signs of modernity, like satellite
dishes and mobile phones, have come to these highlands. Much of the transformation is owed to
the Smallholder Development Project, funded by a $15.2 million ADB loan, to modernize farming
techniques. Pak Xong once produced about 200 tons of cabbage a year. The average is now roughly
2,500 tons. Improved roads connect local producers to newly built markets on the Thai-Lao border,
and farmers have learned basic market economics and techniques to negotiate with faraway buyers
using text messaging. (PHOTO: GERHARD JOREN)

government efforts to promote inclusive economic growth. In 2011, preparations started for the
2012-2016 CPS. It will be consistent with priorities in the government’s 11th National Economic
and Social Development Plan 2012—2016 and in ADB’s Strategy 2020.

Impact of operations. ADB technical assistance helped the government mainstream public—
private partnerships, boost private sector investment, and decrease the rate of greenhouse gas
emissions by promoting energy efficiency in Thai municipalities. It has also increased support
for public—private partnerships in Thailand through its private sector operations. ADB has
financed two large solar farms, which are now under construction, and a 1,600-megawatt natural
gas power project.

Viet Nam

Partnership priorities. In line with Viet Nam’s lower-middle-income country status, ADB’s
current CPS supports economic growth, social inclusiveness, and environmental management.
It focuses on infrastructure improvement, education and training, and policy support.
To meet development challenges and maintain the growth momentum, ADB, in partnership
with other development partners—Agence Frangaise de Développement, Japan International
Cooperation Agency, KfW (Germany), Korea Eximbank, and the World Bank—also plays
an active role in supporting government reforms and providing advice on macroeconomic
management. Preparation of the new CPS 2012-2015 was officially launched in 2011.

ADB has been working with partners to improve portfolio performance, ensure safeguard
compliance, and address project management issues through policy dialogue. Ongoing activities
include, among others, the piloting of advance actions, revisions to the decree on official
development assistance management, and study of land valuation. Impacts of these operations
include improved disbursements, harmonization of common feasibility guidelines, reform of
cost norms, and improved circulars and guidelines.

Impact of operations. The recently completed Central Region Urban Environmental Improvement
Project upgraded water supply and sanitation in six towns. A gender plan was successfully
carried out with active involvement of the Women’s Union. This enabled women’s participation,
improved well-being through public health programs, and participation in household sanitation
credit schemes in which more than 12,000 women participated and over 75% of credit recipients
were women. The Second Red River Basin Project improved conditions in communities through
irrigation, watershed management, and flood protection, and by building community capacity in
project management. A total of 4.7 million households benefited from the project.

more important in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. ADB works with governments

in designing strategies that meet growth and development objectives by improving the
environment for private investment. Through nonsovereign operations, ADB helps catalyze private
investment in developing member countries (DMCs) that contributes to such growth.

ADB’s assistance to the private sector is provided through several products. These include
loans without sovereign guarantees, equity investments, credit enhancement products, and
B loans, where ADB acts as the arranger of a complete financing package for a project in which
local and international commercial banks and other financial institutions participate. Companies
receiving assistance benefit both from the funds and from the expertise and guidance of ADB.
In addition, ADB provides assistance to public sector entities without a central government
guarantee. Such assistance, together with private sector operations, is collectively defined as
nonsovereign operations.

ADB’s nonsovereign operations are integral to the objectives of Strategy 2020, which aims to
scale up private sector development and private sector operations (PSOs) in all operational areas,
targeting 50% of annual operations by 2020. In 2011, 33% of approved projects (12% from PSOs
and 21% from public sector operations) supported private sector development.

- DB recognizes that private investment is a key driver of economic growth and has become even

Private Sector Operations

PSOs accounted for the majority of ADB’s nonsovereign operations in 2011, with $1,000 million
in loans, $89 million in equity investments, $100 million in B loans, $417 million in guarantees,
and $12 million in technical assistance. PSOs cover 23 DMCs. Projects were approved in Armenia,
Bangladesh, the People’s Republic of China, India, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
Pakistan, Thailand, and Uzbekistan.

Portfolio Management

The total value of projects supported by ADB’s private sector investments ranged from a factor 3.1 to
33.5 times the amount of its own funding. In infrastructure, the total estimated project cost of private
sector projects was approximately 7.4 times ADB’s funded participation. The total committed capital in
equity funds was 7.03 times ADB’s investment, and total trade supported by the Trade Finance Program
(TFP) was 3.08 times the amount of loans and guarantees provided under the program.

Excluding TFP accounts, commitments for the private sector portfolio had outstanding
balances of $3.82 billion and undisbursed commitments of $676.74 million. This represents a
3.4% increase over the total commitments of $4.35 billion in 2010.

PSOs contribute to inclusive growth by creating productive work opportunities directly and
indirectly. They support environmentally sustainable growth, which is particularly critical for
low-income countries, by financing infrastructure to improve the environment (clean energy, water
and wastewater treatment, and waste to energy) and to improve service delivery.

PSOs also invest in banks and nonbank financial institutions to channel financial resources
into priority areas, such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), infrastructure, clean
energy, and trade. In 2011, 43% of the approved assistance by number was for renewable energy,
energy efficiency, and climate technology funds, while 14% supported hydropower. The balance
financed water, transport, telecommunications, SMEs, and conventional energy projects.

The Private Sector Operations Department exceeded its commitment to have 40% of
its projects approved (by number) in Group A (countries only eligible for ADF funding) and
Group B (countries eligible for both ADF and OCR funding) countries (excluding India).

Support for Inclusive Growth through Private Sector Operations

* The focus of private sector operations (PSOs) has been on catalyzing investment for the
development of capital markets and infrastructure. Promoting broad-spectrum financial
sector development includes increased financing for small and medium-sized enterprise
(SME) development, an area that has enormous potential for employment and income
generation. In infrastructure, ADB is promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency,
particularly in energy-deficient developing member countries, thus helping generate
jobs through the development of industries. In telecommunications, ADB-supported
investments generated employment opportunities for 135,000 vendors.

* ADB has introduced an annual report detailing development outputs and outcomes
associated with its private sector transactions. The Development Effectiveness Report 2010:
Private Sector Operations reviews how PSOs have fared in promoting ADB's development
effectiveness agenda. To date, all targets for development of infrastructure and for private
equity funds are on track or have been met or exceeded.

* Some of the more notable outputs and outcomes of PSOs in low-income countries are from
investments in telecommunications. For example, ADB, through its Private Sector Operations
Department, supported Grameenphone in Bangladesh, whose customer base has reached
23 million. An additional 2.7 million mobile telephone customers are anticipated from
telecommunication projects in Afghanistan and Papua New Guinea by 2012.

* Power projects have provided a total capacity of 13,800 megawatts. Expected outputs
of projects in the energy sectors by 2016 include 7,800 megawatts of additional power,
9,500 kilometers of energy distribution lines, and reduction of 22 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide emissions per year.

* In all, 593 loans with a corresponding total amount of $244 million were extended to SMEs
by banks supported by ADB PSOs. By 2016, these banks are expected to provide $152 million
in credit to approximately 1,200 SME borrowers. ADB-supported private equity funds had
invested $2.75 billion in 295 companies. A total of $461 million (including $80 million
from ADB) is expected to be further invested in 75 companies until 2016.

 

 

 

Seven of the 14 projects (50%) approved in 2011 were for assistance in Group A and Group B
countries (excluding India).

The department further enhanced its support to the SME sector. In Armenia, a program
was approved to provide funding to SMEs through four local banks. Another project targeting
assistance to the SME sector is a $15 million private equity fund that will invest in a balanced
and diversified portfolio of SMEs in target countries in Southeast Asia. In addition, innovative
financing in the capital markets sector included equity investments of $40 million in two venture
capital funds involved in financing projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation
technologies, and environmental protection.

ADB’s value addition lies in helping bridge the financing gap faced by private sector
investors through the commitment of ADB resources and through the mobilization of resources
from other cofinanciers. In general, ADB’s private sector policy restricts direct funding to
25% of any project’s total cost. Cofinancing that could directly be attributed to ADB’s PSOs
amounted to $4.1 billion in 2011, consisting of $100 million in B loans and $1.62 billion from
parallel loans, as well as $2.38 billion from the TFP.

Knowledge Management

ADB’s PSOs also promote knowledge transfer and sharing. In 2011, 11 technical assistance
projects were approved, totaling $12.4 million. Approved technical assistance spanned seven
countries and covered a variety of sectors, including clean energy, energy efficiency, the social
sector, health, and trade finance.

ADB provided advisory support to the Government of Mongolia to structure and tender
to private sector investors a $750 million combined heat and power plant for Ulaanbaatar, the
country’s largest infrastructure project to date outside the mining sector.

In sharing knowledge with other multilateral development banks, ADB collaborated with
the African Development Bank (AfDB) to help it set up a trade finance program to boost
African trade and, more broadly, South-South trade. ADB shared templates, operations manuals,
information technology, and know-how related to its own TFP with AfDB. ADB also took the
lead in harmonizing development indicators for infrastructure among multilateral development
banks with PSOs.

 

Trade Finance Program

Cross-border trade is a key contributor to economic growth and job creation, and trade finance
keeps such trade functioning smoothly. However, smaller firms can find it difficult to obtain
trade finance support. The Trade Finance Program (TFP) aims to fill that gap by providing
guarantees and loans to banks in support of trade in the most challenging markets.

ADB's ongoing TFP provides guarantees and loans through banks in support of trade.
In 2011, TFP supported over $3.5 billion in trade, $2.4 billion of which was cofinancing
from commercial banks, as well as TFP exposures shifted to risk distribution partners
(insurance companies, export credit agencies, and development entities). TFP supported
1,803 transactions, of which 1,063 supported intraregional trade and 728 supported trade
between developing member countries (DMCs). TFP supported 668 small and medium-sized
enterprises in the year. While TFP operated in 16 DMCs in 2011, its five most active markets
were Viet Nam, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

approved by the Board in previous years is the maximum exposure TFP can assume at any one point in time. This limit
has never been breached. Because maturities under TFP transactions tend to be short—on average less than 180 days—
TFP exposure can revolve (be reused) within a year. This explains how TFP’s exposure in the course of 2011 was greater
than its $1 billion limit without actually breaching the limit at any one point in time.

Reliable, Affordable Power for Cambodian Villagers

A steady supply of electricity is still a novelty in the Cambodian provinces of Banteay Meanchey,
Battambang, and Siem Reap—perhaps because a few years ago the cost of power here was
prohibitively high. A reliable supply from Thailand, transmitted to urban and rural consumers
at affordable rates under a project supported by an $8 million ADB loan to a private company,
has made all the difference. Before the imports, a private supplier could provide electricity only
4 hours a day. Now it is available at all times. It is especially welcomed by entrepreneurs who
once depended on expensive generators, such as Chhy Kimyea, pictured, in her hairdressing
business in the Ek Phnom District. (PHOTO: PRING SAMRANG)

In addition, ADB continued to provide capacity building and knowledge management
support to DMCs on the use of credit enhancement products (CEPs), including guarantees and
B loans funded by technical assistance. To date, ADB has conducted 14 workshops in 10 DMCs,
attended by more than 600 senior government officials representing a variety of economic sectors.
The workshops introduced participants to CEPs available from ADB, other multilateral
development banks, export credit agencies, export-import banks, and private insurance
companies. Follow-up workshops on ADB CEPs were held in the People’s Republic of China at the
request of its national export credit agency and export—import bank to explore potential
areas of cooperation with ADB. ADB also organized a high-level panel discussion in Ha Noi,
Viet Nam, during its 44th Annual Meeting on the use of guarantees to catalyze private capital
for investment in infrastructure.

Back in 2002, having determined that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) were crucial for
creating jobs and reducing poverty, ADB completed an investment of $4 million in the Mekong
Enterprise Fund. Managed by Mekong Capital, the fund has since been fully invested in 10 SMEs
in Viet Nam involved in industries such as manufacturing, information technology, textiles, and
printing, providing capital and business assistance. The Mekong Enterprise Fund has helped revive
and grow the private equity industry in Viet Nam. According to data tracked by Mekong Capital,
investees have created 3,000 jobs over the fund’s holding period, and their annual tax payments
have increased by about $1.5 million. Pictured is one of the restaurants operated by Golden Gate,

Public Nonsovereign Operations

Public nonsovereign operations cover technical assistance and lending without sovereign guarantee
to public sector entities that are structurally separate from the sovereign or central government.
The National Grid Improvement Project and the Bangalore Metro Rail Transit System in India,
and Indonesia Eximbank were approved in 2011.

The National Grid Improvement Project in India will strengthen the interregional transmission
connections for 15,000 megawatts of bulk power supply from 14 private independent power
producers in the western region of the country to demand centers in the north. ADB’s support
consists of a $500 million loan with a sovereign guarantee and $250 million without sovereign
guarantee to the Power Grid Corporation of India.

The Bangalore Metro Rail Transit System is among the first major metro rail systems in
India to use a leveraged finance model combining government funds with commercial loans. It
is a critical model for infrastructure development in other cities in India given the accelerating
demand for infrastructure. ADB approved a $250 million loan for this project.

China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3), paving the way for regional integration.
CGIF is a trust fund established to guarantee bonds in the region. In 2011, ADB laid the organizational groundwork to support the operations of the facility, as key executives began to design
the business plan and risk management framework.

 

115Human Resources,
Finance, and
AdministrationADB continued to prioritize programs to
expand the knowledge and skills of its
people in 2011. Departmental studies and
reviews identified process improvement
opportunities to maximize the cost
effectiveness of operations. Market studies
helped align staff compensation and
benefits schemes to meet the needs of an
expanding bank. Several initiatives were
undertaken to create a greener environment
in the headquarters building.

 

Human Resources

Staffing. ADB’s staff as of 31 December totaled 2,958 from 59 of its 67 member countries:
6 members of Management, and 1,055 international and 1,897 national and administrative staff,
of whom 612 (about 20.7%) were in field offices. Appointments and departures numbered 118 and
87 among international staff and 191 and 96 among national and administrative staff, respectively.
Women accounted for 31.47% of the international staff.

The 2012 Budget concluded with an allocation of 90 new positions in 2012 (44 international
staff, 23 national staff, and 23 administrative staff). These were provided to address the remaining
gaps in delivery of ADB’s key outputs and results, further enhance skills in priority sectors and
themes, and strengthen resident missions (RMs).

Initiatives. The prime aims of ADB’s human resources initiatives and interventions in 2011 were
to ensure staffing with the right skills and diversity mix, and to improve the work environment.
All undertakings to this end were guided by Our People Strategy and the Human Resources
Function Strategic Framework and Action Plan, which were approved in 2010 to provide ADB
with the right people, leaders, and environment.

ADB hosted and expressed
continued support to the
Philippines at a reception,
held in March, to show
appreciation to its host
country. The President

of the Philippines,

Benigno S. Aquino III (left),
attended the event.

The adoption of proactive recruitment of international staff, implementation of the revised
selection assessment tools, a refined competency framework, increased involvement of communities
of practice and hiring departments, the extension of the Third Gender Action Program, and the
Young Professionals Program supported greater balance and diversity and contributed to improved
staff quality at entry. The Internship Program and other recruitment marketing initiatives raised
awareness of career opportunities at ADB and contributed to a broader pool of candidates.

Developmental assignments, a staff exchange program, and secondment increased opportunities for career progression and staff development. ADB’s improved performance review and
reward and recognition program were introduced to provide meaningful appreciation for teams
and individuals whose achievements, activities, and behaviors have had a valuable impact in
contributing to ADB’s goals. The mandatory annual declaration of compliance and briefings
on staff conduct, harassment, and corruption ensured greater focus and awareness on ethics and
values required from the workforce.

The impact of ADB undertakings to deliver an effective human resources strategy will be
assessed in the forthcoming 2012 Staff Engagement Survey.

Compensation and benefits. A total remuneration study covering headquarters and three RMs
(the People’s Republic of China, India, and Indonesia) was undertaken in 2011 to assess the
competitiveness of ADB’s compensation system for national and administrative staff. The Board
approved the retention of the market-based approach and asked ADB to continue conducting
similar reviews in the remaining RMs over the next 2 to 3 years. As a result of the review,
Management approved several changes to unify benefits policies, where feasible, and align
benefits with those in similar organizations.

The Board approved the following salary increases as recommended by Management:
a 2.0% weighted average increase in the salary structure, and a 2.9% average salary increase for
international staff. The reallocated bonus pool will be used to provide additional salary increases
for high performers. A 2.3% weighted average increase in the salary structure and a 6.0% average
salary increase were approved for national and administrative staff at headquarters. For RM
national and administrative staff, an average salary increase of 12.5% was approved.

With the endorsement of the Pension Committee, the Board also approved several changes to
the Staff Retirement Plan that will help keep the plan sustainable while providing some flexibility
to participants. As in 2010, ADB made an additional contribution of $44.7 million to the Staff
Retirement Plan to improve its funded status and potentially reduce ADB’s contribution rate in
future years.

Staff development. All staff development programs and approaches are designed to support
Strategy 2020 and Our People Strategy, enabling staff to have the necessary knowledge and
skills to implement operational programs and/or projects successfully. Several learning and
development opportunities were made available to staff to help support ADB’s evolving business
and organizational needs.

In consultation with client departments, new programs to strengthen staff knowledge of
ADB’s business processes were developed and delivered. Management and leadership development
continued to be a priority, supported by a variety of coaching and training programs. As a result,
staff members at headquarters and RMs were offered 106 training programs with 2,091 staff
members participating in 232 learning sessions. Also introduced in 2011 was the technical skills
registry—a tool designed to capture the skills and proficiency level of staff in technical skills that
are relevant to ADB.

Organizational and Business Review

ADB continues to manage its program of organizational reviews of individual departments. These
reviews focus on business process improvement opportunities to optimize the cost of operations,
identify opportunities for savings, and enhance the efficiency and quality of service.

ADB undertook departmental reviews of the Office of Information Systems and Technology
(OIST), Controller’s Department (CTL), and Office of Administrative Services. All identified
opportunities for efficiency improvements.

Internal Administrative Expenses

Internal administrative expenses for 2011 totaled $484.50 million including the administrative
expenses for the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) of $8.52 million, compared with the
budget of $496.35 million (including the budget for IED of $8.95 million). Of the total savings
of $11.86 million, about 2% of the 2011 internal administrative expenses budget amounting
to $9.60 million is being carried forward to 2012. Savings in the Board of Governors budget
were attributed to lower-than-budgeted utilization for (i) travel, (ii) administrative expenses, and
(iii) seminars. Savings in the Board of Directors category were realized in the Accountability
Mechanism and Independent Evaluation. Savings for the Accountability Mechanism were due to
slightly lower utilization for salaries, professional fees, and relocation costs. These savings were
partly reallocated to meet overrun in benefits items such as staff retirement contribution, medical
insurance, dependency allowance and education assistance, severance payment, consultants, and
business travel. The savings for IED were mainly due to lower utilization in salaries because of
lower staff-years than projected, home country travel, and business travel. These savings were
partly reallocated to meet overrun in rental assistance, education assistance, and consulting
services because of enhanced media outreach activities and some of the activities originally
scheduled for 2012 such as external peer review and advisory services that were advanced to
2011. The overruns in certain budget items in the operational and administrative expenses budget
categories were fully met through inter-item transfers or reallocations within the same budget
categories. Savings in the operational expenses budget category were mainly attributed to lowerthan-budgeted utilization for (i) salaries, (ii) education assistance and special allowances, and
(iii) other expenses such as staff development, relocation, staff consultants, and business travel.
These savings were partly offset by overruns in staff benefits, mainly because of additional
contribution to the staff retirement fund to meet increasing funding requirements, medical
insurance, dependency allowance, home country travel, rental assistance, severance payment,
and health services. The savings in the administrative expenses were realized due to lower-thanbudgeted utilization for communications, library, office supplies, equipment, maintenance and
support, contractual services, insurance, and miscellaneous expenses. These savings were partly
offset by overruns in depreciation, primarily because of earlier-than-projected capitalization of
some information technology (IT) projects completed in 2011 under the Information Systems and
Technology Strategy (ISTS), capitalization of the costs of retrofitting the 30th floor at Oakwood
Premier Joy~Nostalg Center, part of office expansion for headquarters, and completion of office
expansions in some of the field offices.

The internal administrative expenses budget for 2012 is $544.80 million, including a general
contingency of 1% ($5.47 million) and after deducting $7.12 million of service charges estimated to
be recoverable from administering trust funds of multilateral and bilateral institutions. The increase
of $48.50 million or 9.8% over the 2011 budget reflects a price increase of 5.3% and a volume

growth of 4.5%. The 2012 net internal administrative expenses budget of $544.80 million
consists of $9.88 million for IED and $534.92 million for ADB excluding IED.

In addition to internal administrative expenses, the 2012 budget also includes an annual capital
budget of $7.47 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital expenditures for headquarters and field offices.

Administrative Services

In 2011, through the Office of Administrative Services, ADB prioritized the greening of the
headquarters building while addressing the needs of an expanding bank. ADB was granted a gold
certification in Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and is the first existing
building in the Philippines to be given this award by the US Green Building Council. Two smoking
lounges were built, and the solar power project was initiated to supply 613,000 kilowatt-hours
annually, or 3.5% of the headquarters’ energy needs, in early 2012.

Other conservation initiatives were sustained through the reuse of water processed by
the sewage treatment plant and collected from the rainwater harvesting facility; through the
International Organization for Standardization resource conservation program that delivered
cumulative savings of $130,000 in reduced consumption of energy, paper, and water and solid
waste segregation; and through green procurement and use of recycled products for building
services and printing.

Bidding for the construction of the extension of ADB’s main headquarters building was
initiated for construction to start in 2012. Spaces were optimized and converted to office spaces
with savings of $167,000 in lieu of rental fees, while a third floor was leased at the Joy~Nostalg
Building for OIST personnel. A 305-vehicle, multistory car park was built and the cafeteria servery
was rehabilitated.

ADB strengthened support to RMs in building rehabilitation, crisis management and security,
records and inventory management, and procurement. A new memorandum of understanding was
signed with the United Nations for the coordination of security arrangements at ADB field offices.

ADB undertook a business impact analysis to support its business continuity strategy and to
strengthen mitigation plans. It allows ADB to reduce the impact of risks in the event of natural
or other disasters and ensure timely recovery of critical business functions with minimal or no
interruption to time-sensitive operations. The business continuity management was integrated
with security and emergency services, and multiple backup systems for critical applications were
further developed.

Information Systems and Technology

ADB continued to deliver, through OIST, several major projects under the ISTS, Phase II (ISTS II).
These include a web content management and governance tool enabling staff to easily publish
content, rollout of an accounting system to all field offices, an integrated procurement management
system, and administrative projects supporting the decommissioning of the obsolete Sybase system.
IT security has been improved across all areas, from strengthening of policy to the implementation
of additional technical security.

ADB also focused its efforts on user service improvements through the review and enhancement
of service processes, engagement of a new IT service desk provider under stringent service-level
agreements, upgrade of the service desk tool, and commissioning of a new service desk team.

Through OIST, ADB has embarked on a reorganization following a review covering all areas
of IT operations and organization. These include strategy and planning, governance mechanisms,
IT procurement and sourcing, IT effectiveness, enterprise architecture, IT organizational structure,

 

120Human Resources, Finance, and Administration

 

and IT skills and talent management. Initial steps included the implementation of IT metrics and
scorecards, and pilot outsourcing of development contracts.

While closely monitoring the progress of ISTS II, OIST has initiated work on the development
of the next IT strategy in coordination with the IT Committee and stakeholders. The development
of an IT project management framework and enhancement of the project management tool have
helped in monitoring and managing IT projects. IT training for ADB staff is now managed by
OIST, synchronizing the development of new IT skills with evolving business requirements.
ADB has conducted regional training for field offices in RMs, delivering the expertise required
to optimize the use and rollout of IT systems and enable easier participation for field office staff.

Several infrastructure projects addressed the continued demand for IT services and the
provision of these services to field offices. Mobile communications were enhanced to improve the
access of ADB staff from any location. Storage, network infrastructure, and higher performance
servers have been commissioned, all taking into account ADB’s expansion requirements. Field
office communications capabilities from headquarters have increased with backup links in place
to ensure connectivity and access to ISTS II applications.

ADB continued to successfully obtain Sarbanes—Oxley attestation over internal controls
by external auditors, while embedding these controls and their review into regular IT activities,
improving efficiency and sustaining ADB’s commitment to standards and compliance.

Financial Reporting

Through CTL, ADB realigned its organizational structure in 2011 in line with core functional
responsibilities aimed at achieving more efficient use of staff resources, facilitating improvements
in its business processes, and better service for internal and external clients.

ADB continued to update accounting policies to comply with changes in global accounting
standards, especially those stemming from the accounting standard setters’ project to converge
international accounting standards. ADB continued to monitor market developments and assess
the implications of a possible future transition to international financial reporting standards from
those based on the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

In 2011, ADB rolled out the Time Management System as part of a pilot program. This is
an important initiative that can potentially improve reliability, allowing better monitoring and
tracking of staff costs and improving accountability to shareholders and Asian Development
Fund donors.

Supporting Disbursement Operations for Loans and Grants

In 2011, to further enhance ADB’s efficiency in managing the expanding loans and grants
portfolio, the CTL loan administration division separated its fiduciary control function and
the client service and portfolio management function from the ordinary disbursements
processing function.

A dedicated team provided adequate control and service in processing and authorizing loan
and grant disbursements. The team also supported ADB’s decentralized disbursement operation
by providing adequate oversight and training to the disbursement units established in seven RMs.
The team provided a number of capacity-building workshops for developing member country
participants in coordination with the RMs.

For all the loan and grant projects processed for approval, a separate dedicated team provided
effective support and guidance to internal and external clients in designing disbursement and
financing mechanisms to ensure all fiduciary requirements were fulfilled.

To further improve the service level for clients and efficiency in disbursement processing,
a team focusing on client service and portfolio management implemented a series of efficiency
and control improvement measures through enhancements of the existing systems and business
processes for disbursement.

Supporting Technical Assistance Disbursements

In 2011, technical assistance disbursement and accounting gained additional impetus through the
reorganization of CTL by its core functional areas. The reorganization enabled ADB to empower
national staff further and realign its resources to improve technical assistance administration and
portfolio management.

ADB’s technical assistance projects are funded by ADB’s core resources from the Technical
Assistance Special Fund and external resources. In 2011, funding from external resources increased
significantly, while the funding from ADB’s core resources remained around the 2010 level.
Technical assistance disbursements, excluding the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, increased
marginally in 2011. ADB’s scalable staff resourcing strategy helped meet the resulting increase
in demand for its services. In addition, the collaborative efforts of CTL, the Central Operations
Services Office, and the operations departments helped improve the quality of the technical
assistance portfolio.

Fiduciary compliance and internal control over its financial reporting are paramount for
technical assistance disbursement operations. While ensuring full compliance with these
requirements, CTL consistently met the expected service-level standards in 2011.

ADB continued work on the P3M Financial system project in 2011 to replace the legacy
systems supporting technical assistance disbursements and accounting. Its successful completion
will help improve ADB’s services to clients, mainly developing member countries and
project consultants.

(administered by ADB), this should not be included in the cofinancing figure under the ADB loan line item, as there is a separate line item for the ADB grant.

(ii) For ADB-financed or -administered grant, official cofinancing figure will include both collaborative and contractual (meaning grant is administered by ADB).

ADB's vision is an Asia and Pacific region free of poverty. Its mission is to help its developing
member countries reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of their people. Despite the
region’s many successes, it remains home to two-thirds of the world’s poor: 1.8 billion people
who live on less than $2 a day, with 903 million struggling on less than $1.25 a day. ADB is
committed to reducing poverty through inclusive economic growth, environmentally
sustainable growth, and regional integration.

Based in Manila, ADB is owned by 67 members, including 48 from the region. Its main
instruments for helping its developing member countries are policy dialogue, loans, equity
investments, guarantees, grants, and technical assistance.

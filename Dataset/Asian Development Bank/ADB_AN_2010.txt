MESSAGE FROM
THE PRESIDENT

 

If Asia’s vast potential is to be fulfilled, it must rebalance growth to reduce
reliance on external markets, which will strengthen resilience against future
crises. Developing Asia must also promote public-private partnerships to meet
infrastructure needs and to ensure that development is both inclusive and
environmentally sustainable.Annual Report 2010 7

 

eveloping Asia moved beyond the economic

crisis to emerge as a new engine of global growth

in 2010. Our estimates show that the region’s
gross domestic product increased by 9.0% in 2010, more
than double the global growth rate during the same period
and well above the 5.9% rate recorded in the region a year
earlier.

While the speed and strength of its economic recovery
surprised many, the region still faces daunting challenges.
Asia and the Pacific remains home to millions of the
absolute poor. Widening income and non-income disparities
among and within countries further accentuated the contrast
between the two faces of Asia—one that has emerged as
a beacon of hope and one that is being left behind. While
the region as a whole is likely to achieve the Millennium
Development Goal (MDG) of halving extreme poverty
by 2015, several countries are lagging on the non-income
MDG targets.

As the region moves beyond economic recovery
to sustained growth, it must ensure that the evolving
growth paradigm becomes more inclusive to benefit as
many people as possible. According to an ADB study,
14 out of 20 developing Asian economies saw their Gini
coefficients—a measure of inequality—increase in recent
years as economic growth accelerated. Ensuring growth
is inclusive will require greater investment in education
and health, particularly for the poor; expanded social
protection, including in the informal sector and rural
households; and developing rural infrastructure to connect
the poor to markets and enable them to participate in the
growth process.

Asia also needs to focus on environmentally sustainable growth. In a world of scarce and finite resources,
it is critical to ensure that we leave a sustainable environment and development legacy to future generations.
Climate change and climatic volatility are serious threats
to the region’s development. Rising sea levels and higher
temperatures can have dramatic effects, forcing large
numbers of mostly poor to migrate. Sustainability cannot
be achieved unless the region moves onto a low-carbon,
climate-resilient development path that embraces both
mitigation and adaptation.

ADB is committed to supporting these efforts. In
2010, ADB prepared plans to guide operations in climate
change, sustainable transport, and education. ADB’s
totaled $17.5 billion,

operations including

$3.7 billion from cofinancing partners. In addition,
ADB’s ongoing Trade Finance Program supported
$2.8 billion in trade. Business processes were
simplified and restrictions lifted on additional financing
so that well-performing projects can be prioritized and
expanded—reflecting ADB’s focus on operations that
deliver the best results. In addition, a midterm review
of the Asian Development Fund concluded that solid
progress had been made on implementing its strategic
agenda. This included stronger assistance for countries in
fragile and conflict-affected situations, as well as increased
support for regional cooperation and integration to reap the
benefits of increased intra-regional trade and commerce.

Of course, much remains to be done to reduce
disparities within and among the region’s developing
economies. Massive investments will be necessary in
both the social sector and—crucially—infrastructure. We
estimate that $8 trillion will be needed to support
infrastructure development during the coming decade,
according to the ADB—ADBI publication, /nfrastructure
for a Seamless Asia. That figure far exceeds current investment levels; it will require innovative methods of resource
mobilization from development partners across the region.

Given the several years of high growth Asia has
enjoyed and its increasing influence in the global economy,
many are saying that the 21st century belongs to Asia. But
I always stress that success is never preordained. If Asia’s
vast potential is to be fulfilled, it must rebalance growth to
reduce reliance on external markets, which will strengthen
resilience against future crises. Developing Asia must also
promote public—private partnerships to meet infrastructure
needs and to ensure that development is both inclusive and
environmentally sustainable.

The historic Millennium Declaration of 2000 promised
a better life for millions of poor in Asia and the Pacific.
How well this promise is fulfilled depends on our steadfast
efforts. ADB remains committed to working tirelessly with
its developing member countries and development partners
to ensure greater progress in the years ahead.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

Asian Development Bank (ADB) approvals, including cofinancing, totaled
$17.51 billion in 2010. The Board of Directors continued to seek new ways
for ADB to assist its developing member countries in addressing challenges
and making progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. The Board
undertook wide-ranging strategic initiatives, including the appointment of a
vice-president for private sector and cofinancing operations. The Board also
endorsed a comprehensive new human resources policy, assessed a proposal
to streamline additional funding to successful projects, and endorsed country
partnership strategies for Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Tajikistan.Annual Report 2010 9

 

OVERVIEW OF THE BOARD’S
ACTIVITIES IN 2010

he Board of Directors is responsible for the overall

direction of ADB operations, including the approval

of policies, loans, technical assistance, grants, and
guarantees. The Board also approves the annual budget
and borrowing program. As their representative, the Board
plays a vital role in seeing ADB shareholders’ guidance is
implemented.

In 2010, the Board of Directors addressed the challenges facing Asia and the Pacific by continuing to guide
and support the implementation of Strategy 2020, while
overseeing execution of the reform agenda that emerged
from the fifth general capital increase and the ninth replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. The Board took
steps to position ADB to improve its development effectiveness, especially in the core areas of Strategy 2020, and
to strengthen institutional governance.

To support the strategic objective of expanding private
sector operations, the Board approved the appointment of
Lakshmi Venkatachalam to the newly created post of vicepresident for private sector and cofinancing operations.

A Board—Management working group was set up to
review the Accountability Mechanism, which was established in 2003 to give people affected by ADB-assisted
projects a forum to seek solutions to problems. The review
is expected to be completed in 2011.

The Board discussed the 2009 Development
Effectiveness Review, the third annual assessment of
ADB’s corporate performance. Executive directors also
discussed a proposal to refine ADB’s results framework,
which is at the core of the annual review, to make it a
better management tool in guiding the implementation of
Strategy 2020. The Board continued to monitor ADB’s
performance through its oversight of the Independent
Evaluation Department (IED).

The Board reviewed a proposal to streamline additional
financing to projects that are being successfully implemented in order to boost ADB’s development effectiveness.
Executive directors also discussed and provided feedback
on the review of ADB’s policy-based lending program.

The Board approved the capital expenditure for a
new risk management system intended to more efficiently

measure, consolidate, and evaluate market and credit risk
exposures—a key area as ADB expands private sector
operations.

To improve ADB’s institutional effectiveness and
accountability, the Board continued to focus on internal
reforms. The executive directors discussed and endorsed Our
People Strategy, a comprehensive plan to recruit, retain, and
develop the staffADB needs to carry out its mission of reducing
poverty. This followed an ADB-wide consultation process
guided by the Human Resources Committee of the Board.

The Board discussed the comprehensive review of
salaries and benefits of international staff, the first such
appraisal in 5 years. Executive directors also guided the
review of ADB’s Public Communications Policy (2005);
the review was launched in February 2010 and is expected
to be completed by mid-2011.

In 2010, total approvals by the Board, including loans,
grants, technical assistance, credit enhancements, and cofinancing, exceeded $17.51 billion. The Board also approved
12 new multitranche financing facilities totaling $4.4 billion.

The Board deliberated on ADB’s budget and borrowing
program for 2011; the rolling Work Program and Budget
Framework (WPBF), 2011-2013; and the 3-year rolling
work program and 2011 budget of the Asian Development
Bank Institute (ADBI).

It approved loan charges and the allocation of 2009 net
income, and reorganized its work to improve sequencing
of key elements of ADB’s work program and budget cycle.

In addition, the Board endorsed country partnership
strategies for Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Tajikistan.
The country partnership strategy maps out ways for ADB
to most effectively assist its developing member countries, given each country’s challenges and priorities. It also
enables ADB to evaluate their development performance
over the strategy period.

BOARD GROUP VISITS
AND OTHER MEETINGS

Members of the Board made three visits around the region
to get firsthand views of ADB projects and their impacts,
and to meet senior government officials, development
partners, private sector leaders, and other stakeholders.10 Asian Development Bank

 

From 27 January to 10 February, a group visited India
and the Maldives. Another group visited Nauru and TimorLeste from 5 to 15 June. A third group went to Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Georgia from 22 September to 6 October.
These visits strengthened ADB’s relationship with development partners and generated valuable feedback.

In September, the Board and Management participated
in a l-day retreat covering two important topics: Asia’s
water crisis and public-private partnerships.

BOARD COMMITTEES

Audit Committee

The committee assists the Board with oversight of financial reporting and audits, including internal controls and
audits, risk management, and ADB-related anticorruption
and integrity efforts. In 2010, the Board approved revisions
to the committee’s terms of reference to reflect its expanded role in risk management and to strengthen its oversight
of internal audit and investigation functions.

The committee closely monitored the separation of
ADB’s internal integrity function from the Office of the
Auditor General (OAG) and the establishment of the
Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. It was also regularly
briefed on the work of those two offices, as well as on the
work of the Office of Risk Management.

The committee made recommendations to the Board
on the principles for selection of an outside auditor, a
commitment made during discussions on the fifth general
capital increase. The committee reviewed the key findings
of the outside auditor and OAG.

The committee reviewed ADB’s financial statements
and attestation process. It sharpened its focus on information technology audits. The committee also discussed the
audits of resident missions and representative offices.

The committee met 14 times.

Budget Review Committee
The committee discussed the President’s planning direc
tions to prepare the WPBF, 2011-2013, and noted the
imperative for ADB to refocus on key long-term challenges

for Asia and the Pacific—inclusive growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration—while
continuing to monitor the impacts of the financial crisis on
poverty and social aspects. The committee also discussed
the progress of 2010 programs of operations.

The committee met with the vice-presidents on the
highlights of the draft WPBF, 2011-2013. The committee
acknowledged the need for further work and additional
funds for climate change mitigation and adaptation
operations in the Pacific, and welcomed the significant
increase in resources for education. It recommended that
ADB focus more on achieving the target of having private
sector development and private sector operations account
for 50% of annual operations by 2020. The committee also
recommended support for mainstreaming gender initiatives, and suggested more attention be paid to the health
sector, where needed.

The committee discussed in detail for the first time the
draft WPBF, 2011-2013, and appreciated more in-depth
discussion on issues concerning the Millennium Development Goals. The committee discussed the 2011 draft
budget document and noted that ADB has strongly pursued
efficiency. The committee confirmed that the 2011 budgets
for ADB, IED, and ADBI are consistent with the work
plans and appropriate for consideration by the Board.

The committee met 11 times.

Compliance Review Committee

The committee consists of six Board members: four
regional members, at least three of whom are from
borrowing countries, and two nonregional members. It is
responsible for clearing the Compliance Review Panel’s
proposed terms of reference and the schedule for each
review authorized by the Board, as well as the panel’s draft
reports monitoring the implementation of any remedial
actions approved by the Board. During 2010, the committee
cleared the fifth and final annual monitoring report for
the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project (Stage III)
in Pakistan and the fourth such report for the Southern
Transport Development Project in Sri Lanka.

The committee considered the content of its 2008—
2009 annual report, and it convened a meeting with
the Compliance Review Panel and another with externalAnnual Report 2010 ll

 

experts assisting the ongoing review of the Accountability Mechanism (see also Chapter 4). The chair of
the committee also leads the joint Board—-Management
working group conducting that review.

The committee met three times.

Development Effectiveness Committee

The committee continued to support the Board of
Directors in assessing the quality and impact of ADB’s
country and sector operations by discussing selected major
evaluation reports produced by IED. At the country level,
the committee deliberated on IED’s recommendations on
assistance to Bhutan and the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic. For a more comprehensive assessment, it also
discussed related sector assistance program evaluations
for energy and transport. These discussions aimed to
provide inputs for the preparation of the next country
partnership strategies.

The committee remained focused and supportive of
the priorities of Strategy 2020, discussing IED evaluation
of crosscutting issues related to gender and development,
and climate change. It also discussed special evaluations
of operations in fragile and conflict-affected situations, and
on water policy and related operations, with the view that
ADB should continue to improve its policies and strategies
in these areas.

To ensure that ADB’s policies and procedures, and
projects and programs, reflect the lessons learned from
evaluation activities, the committee noted IED’s annual
report on 2009 portfolio performance. To supplement this,
the committee discussed IED’s evaluation of the sustainability
of ADB’s projects after completion. In monitoring how IED
recommendations are implemented, the committee noted IED’s
2010 annual evaluation review, and its 2009 annual report
concerning actions taken on its advice.

The committee met nine times.

Ethics Committee

The Board established the committee, in compliance
with the Code of Conduct adopted in September 2006, to
address matters of ethics under the code. The code’s provisions apply to directors, alternate directors, temporary
alternate directors, and the President. The committee is
responsible for advising them when they request guidance
on actual or potential conflicts of interest or other ethical
aspects of conduct. The committee also considers allegations of misconduct relating to the performance of directors in official duties, and recommends appropriate action
to the Board of Directors.
The committee met twice.

Human Resources Committee

In its second year of operation, the committee successfully
established its role and relationship with Management in
ensuring that the human resources of ADB are managed
according to the organization’s goals and staff welfare.

In its first annual report to the Board of Directors,
the committee noted the significant milestones of ADB in
improving human resources management. The committee
monitored the implementation of Our People Strategy and
noted timely updates to the Human Resources Strategic
Function and Action Plan.

The committee extensively monitored and made
recommendations on two major human resources activities completed in 2010: the comprehensive review of the
professional staff compensation and benefits, and the
2010 staff engagement survey. Further, the committee
continued to monitor major developments in various human
resources functions.

The committee met seven times.BOARD OF DIRECTORS

OVERVIEW

 

ADB's timely response to the global economic crisis and progress in driving
internal reforms were among topics discussed at the midterm review of the
10th cycle of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) in November. To guide the
implementation of Strategy 2020, ADB approved operational plans for climate
change mitigation, sustainable transport, and education. ADB is continuing
efforts to upgrade and widen its menu of financing instruments, including
support to help develop local-currency bond markets as an alternative source
of funding to bank loans.Annual Report 2010 15

 

ADF X MIDTERM REVIEW

he midterm review of the 10th cycle of the Asian

Development Fund (ADF X) was held in Manila,

Philippines, on 18-19 November 2010. Representatives from ADF donors, and recipient countries, ADB
Management and staff, and observers from ADB’s Board of
Directors and other international development institutions
met to review the progress made in implementing ADF X.

Participants expressed satisfaction with the performance of the ADF X in its first 2 years. They appreciated
ADB’s proactive and timely response to the global economic
crisis, with significantly increased levels of approvals and
disbursements. They acknowledged that resources had been
allocated effectively through the performance-based allocation system, which balances country needs and performance.
Under the system, ADB has been able to simultaneously
allocate a greater share of resources to the poorest countries and the stronger performers.

ADB has also made good progress in implementing
the ADF X strategic agenda, particularly in promoting
inclusive economic growth, prioritizing efforts to combat
climate change, supporting regional cooperation and integration, and strengthening its support for conflict-affected
countries.

ADB has implemented many initiatives to improve its
operational effectiveness and has made significant progress
on all internal reforms agreed with ADF donors—such as
managing for development results, responding more efficiently and quickly to clients, and better management of
human resources.

Deputies confirmed the decision to temporarily finance
the additional allocation to Afghanistan for 2011-2012 as
a result of the suspension of the post-conflict phaseout
from internal resources. They supported ADB’s proposal
to continue with the agreed approach to the post-conflict
phaseout in Timor-Leste and the proposal to postpone the
release of the remaining usable liquidity. These issues will
be revisited during the ADF XI replenishment.

Overall, there was broad support for ADB’s proposal
to further study how the institution could respond even
better to crises, learning from its recent experience with
economic crises and natural disasters. Participants recognized the difficulties faced by ADF countries after the
global economic crisis. According to recent data, as many
as 26 of the 28 ADF countries could fail to achieve at least
one-fourth of the non-income Millennium Development

Goals (MDGs). Therefore, demand for ADF resources will
continue to be strong to the end of ADF X and beyond.
ADB must continue to play an important role in helping
ADF countries address their medium- and longer-term
development needs.

ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM

At the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of
ADB in Tashkent in May, the ADB President announced
that ADB would undertake a review of its Accountability
Mechanism. (See Chapter 4, page 21.) A joint Board of
Directors and Management Working Group was formed to
undertake the review, with two international experts engaged
to provide independent advice. A wide-ranging public
consultation process took place, including face-to-face
discussions with stakeholders and gathering of comments
from the public through a dedicated website.' In-country and
regional consultations were conducted between September
and November 2010 in Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the
Philippines, Sri Lanka, and the United States. A workshop
was held with Canadian participants via videoconference.
The experts’ final report was submitted in December 2010
and posted on the ADB website. A revised policy paper is
scheduled to be presented to the Board for approval in 2011.

The Accountability Mechanism review seeks to assess
the accessibility, credibility, efficiency, and effectiveness
of the Accountability Mechanism, taking into account
ADB’s experience since 2003 and those of similar mechanisms in other multilateral and financial institutions. The
review covers a wide range of issues, such as the approach
to site visits, the level of independence of the mechanism,
accessibility of the mechanism by affected people,
eligibility criteria for filing a complaint, the effectiveness of
public outreach, cost implications for bringing projects into
compliance, and benefits of the Accountability Mechanism

Millennium Development Goals and Infrastructure Development

in Asia and the Pacific

he scale of the task of achieving the Millennium
“ metermen Goals (MDGs) is daunting. The region

is home to more than 900 million poor comprising
more than two-thirds of the world’s population in extreme
poverty. It contains 470 million people who have no clean
water, which is more than half of the world’s population
without clean water. It also has 70% of the developing
world’s people who have no basic sanitation, two-thirds of
the world’s undernourished children, and more than 60%
of people infected with tuberculosis.

Overcoming such huge challenges will require stronger basic infrastructure, particularly road transport, water
supply, sanitation, electricity, information technology,
telecommunications, and urban low-income housing. The
MDG framework has no specific goals or targets for basic
infrastructure except for water and sanitation, and information and communication technology.

However, a number of empirical studies have validated
the direct connection between basic infrastructure and
MDG outcomes. Access to water and sanitation can substantially reduce infant and child mortality rates, access to
electricity allows more study time and improves education
outcomes, and better transportation and all-weather roads
increase school attendance and access to health services.*

Yet the availability of basic infrastructure remains
relatively poor in Asia and the Pacific. Bridging the infrastructure gaps will require about $8 trillion over the period

2010-2020. More than half of this would be required to
supply energy, and about 30% would be for roads.»

While scaling up infrastructure spending to achieve the
MDGs is essential, three issues need special attention:

First, the region must raise quality and maintenance
standards for infrastructure. A recent World Economic
Forum business survey (with scores of 1-7) found the
Asia and Pacific region to be 2 points or more behind the
G7 countries* in infrastructure quality.

Second, infrastructure design must consider environmental impacts and climate change. Basic infrastructure
must be designed with the environment and climate
change in mind. Roads and bridges may have to be
built to withstand more frequent floods. In addition,
environmentally-friendly technology and options must
be promoted and encouraged, including propagation
of clean energy technologies, energy conservation, and
demand management.

Finally, potential benefits exist for regional cooperation
in infrastructure, including basic infrastructure. It has been
estimated that regional connectivity in energy, transport,
and telecommunications can bring about an increase in
Asia’s net income of $13 trillion over the 2010-2020
period and beyond.’ For poverty-stricken areas in adjacent
countries, cooperation in building basic infrastructure can
help expand their economies and bring mutual benefits
through trade.

efficacy and recommend changes as necessary to strengthen
it. The 2010 review of the policy was guided by a steering
committee chaired by the Managing Director General.
ADB solicited views from its staff on their experiences
with the policy and how it could be improved. The review
also engaged interested individuals, organizations, and other
external stakeholders to provide feedback and suggestions

for enhancements. In addition to seeking written comments
on the current PCP and two consultation drafts that were
released in June and November 2010, ADB held 20
in-country consultation workshops in 12 member countries
within and outside Asia and the Pacific to seek the views of
a broad range of stakeholders. These included government
officials, civil society organizations, the private sector,Annual Report 2010 17

 

academia, media, international organizations, and projectaffected people. More than 500 people participated in the
workshops. The review also took on board the findings of
two global surveys of its stakeholders in 2006 and 2009
to gauge their perceptions of ADB’s performance and
communications.

The review concluded that the policy is fundamentally
sound and has been well implemented. While its thrust
will not change, the review identified five areas in which
changes to the policy are needed to keep ADB at the forefront of best practices.

A revised policy addressing key issues raised during
the review will be considered by ADB’s Board of Directors
in mid-2011.

OPERATIONAL PLANS

To facilitate the implementation of Strategy 2020, ADB
is gradually introducing operational plans to guide ADB
operations in specific sectors and thematic areas. In 2010,
ADB approved three operational plans for climate change,
sustainable transport,> and education.* (See Chapter 13 for
more details.) ADB also started developing new operational
plans for the finance, urban, and water sectors, as well as
environment and public—private partnerships, which will
be completed in 2011.

ENHANCING ADB’S FINANCING
INSTRUMENTS

Efforts are continuing to offer ADB’s borrowing clients
a wider menu of financing instruments. In 2010, ADB
reviewed the role of supplementary financing as a way to
improve the development effectiveness of its operations.
The review proposed renaming “supplementary financing”
as “additional financing” and introduced policy changes
to reduce the processing time and incremental costs of
repetitive processes for projects. The potential to scale up
well-performing projects was enhanced by the introduction
of simple business processes and the easing of restrictions
on the use of additional financing for such projects.
Second, a differentiation was made between cost
overruns resulting from external reasons and those due
to design and implementation problems and between projects that are performing well and those that are not. Third,
the additional financing policy was linked with ADB

policies on emergency assistance, cofinancing, and changes
of scope.

The new policy was approved by the Board in
December and will become effective in February 2011. It
should improve services to developing member countries,
harmonize ADB’s financing policies with those of its
development partners, and contribute to ADB’s shift
toward results-focused operations.

Work is also ongoing to update and/or develop business
instruments on policy-based lending, project development,
cross-border investment (for regional cooperation and
investment), and results-based lending.

REGIONAL COOPERATION
INITIATIVE: CREDIT GUARANTEE
AND INVESTMENT FACILITY

The 1997 Asian financial crisis accentuated the need for
local currency bond markets as an alternative to thendominant bank loans. With inadequate hedging, banks
were vulnerable to foreign exchange vagaries, and much
short-term borrowing was done for long-term investments.
A regional bond market would help to ensure availability
of long-term domestic currency funding, to prevent
maturity and currency mismatches, and to better channel
the region’s savings into regional investment.

For those reasons, the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) and the People’s Republic of China,
Japan, and Republic of Korea—or ASEAN+3—launched
the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in 2002 to
foster local-currency bond markets. Though the ABMI
has achieved much—local currency denominated bonds in
emerging East Asia grew to nearly $5 trillion in 2010 from
less than $1 trillion in 2001—much more needs to be done
to give corporations better access to bond markets and to
offer a variety of maturities to meet issuers’ financing needs.

To address these issues, ADB worked with ASEAN+3
in 2010 to establish a credit guarantee and investment
facility (CGIF) as a trust fund of ADB to guarantee bonds
in the region. Access to local bond markets will make
corporations less dependent on short-term foreign loans
and less vulnerable to foreign exchange risks. CGIF also
promotes harmonization of standards and practices for
bond issuance within ASEAN+3, paving the way for
regional financial market integration.

DELIVERING AN

 

ADB continued to sharpen its focus on results in all aspects of its performance
in 2010. ADB's corporate results framework is used as a management tool to
monitor its performance and promote continuous institutional improvements
to expand its development effectiveness. While continuing to ensure
accountability and compliance throughout its operations, ADB has introduced
streamlined business processes for country partnership strategies and loan
delivery, tightened its integrity and anticorruption protocols, and improved the
dissemination of high-quality knowledge.Annual Report 2010 19

 

OVERVIEW

ound business practices, more efficient use of
resources, better aid delivery, and good governance
have been areas of special focus for ADB in 2010.
ADB’s corporate results framework continues to shape its
performance and to promote improvement in its activities.

In-depth assessment of strategies, policies, and operations by the Independent Evaluation Department (IED)
continued during the year, while ADB’s Accountability
Mechanism continued to provide an independent forum for
affected parties seeking to resolve problems arising from
ADB projects. A joint Board—Management working group
initiated a review of the 2003 Accountability Mechanism
Policy, which will be completed in 2011.

As in previous years, ADB has stepped up support
for its promotion of knowledge, such as incorporating
knowledge components in new partnership agreements. In
2010, demonstrating a commitment to greater transparency,
ADB began a review of its Public Communications Policy,
seeking new ways to improve its effectiveness. In addition
to streamlining business processes, ADB boosted its riskmanagement, integrity, and anticorruption protocols.

MANAGING FOR DEVELOPMENT
RESULTS

Guided by its managing for development results (MfDR)
action plan for 2009-2011, ADB sharpened its focus on
results in managing its entire business. It continued to use
its Strategy 2020 results framework regularly to monitor
its performance, identify issues, and take action.

During the year, ADB completed its third Development Effectiveness Review to report its performance, and
used the findings to prepare its work plans and budgets.
(See box on page 20.) In addition, ADB refined its results
framework in early 2011 to increase its value as a management tool, and cascaded the Strategy 2020 goals to work
priorities at all levels of the organization.

ADB refined its guidelines on country and sector
results frameworks to better align these with the objectives

of developing member countries and to improve the ways
results are monitored. Eleven development effectiveness
briefs' were produced to describe ADB’s contributions to
countries’ development outcomes.

ADB upgraded its MfDR learning and development
program and implemented a new communications plan to
systematically disseminate messages on MfDR.

Throughout the year, ADB worked closely with several of its developing member countries—Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
and Viet Nam—to strengthen their capacities in MfDR. It
also supported the Asia—Pacific Community of Practice on
Mf£DR, the first regional network on results management.

PROGRESS ON AID
EFFECTIVENESS AGENDA

ADB monitors the progress of its commitments in the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness through regular
annual surveys. In January, ADB conducted its fourth
annual survey incorporating 2009 data from 25 developing
member countries. The results showed that ADB continued
to meet the targets for five of the nine quantitative indicators
in 2009. These were (i) aligning aid with national priorities,
(ii) coordinating technical assistance, (iii) using country
public financial management systems, (iv) reducing the
number of parallel project implementation units, and
(v) coordinating missions.

The joint country analytical work ADB undertook
grew in 2009 and is on track to meet the target by the 2010

2009 Development Effectiveness Review

ADB's third Development Effectiveness Review monitored
progress made in 2009 on the corporate results framework. The report was discussed by the Board of Directors in
April 2010 and presented to ADB’s Board of Governors in the
Annual Meeting in May.

At Level 1, the review assessed only development
outcomes preceding the 2008 global economic crisis, as
there was insufficient current data on poverty to properly
analyze the impact of the crisis in 2009. While some progress
was noted in reducing income poverty, there was too little
improvement in the performance of most of the nonincome poverty indicators. This suggests it is unlikely that
the non-income Millennium Development Goal targets will
be met in 2015 (see 2009 Development Effectiveness Review
Summary of Performance below).

The corporate performance report noted areas in
which ADB results are on track or not. ADB made good
progress toward its targets in many areas, including sustaining the quality of its operations, delivering funds and
services to its clients efficiently, and aligning its operations
with Strategy 2020 priorities.

ADB worked closely with other development partners
to maximize benefits to its developing member countries.
However, a few areas failed to improve significantly, an
indication of the challenges involved in each case. Human
resource and budget constraints remained a concern, given
ADB's expansion in operations. Gender mainstreaming
results achieved over the past 3 years, though improving,
are still below the level of those of the baseline year.
Knowledge management progress continued to lag, as
did cofinancing of Asian Development Fund operations.
New concerns emerged with regard to the outcomes of
completed projects.

ADB's action plan commits to a number of remedial
steps, notably expediting improved reporting systems on the
performance of projects; introducing a pilot results scheme
linking budget allocations to performance in cofinancing,
education, and gender mainstreaming; and increasing staff
resources and intensifying efforts to improve ADB’s gender
balance. ADB also significantly increased its staff and budget
in 2010 to strengthen organizational capacity.

deadline. However, ADB must improve its performance in
the use of country procurement systems, in program-based
approaches, and in aid predictability to meet the Paris
Declaration targets in these areas.

While the level of ADB assistance disbursed through
program-based approaches was below target in 2009,
the number of new projects employing such approaches
increased over 2008. The decline in the aid predictability
indicator was mostly attributable to approvals for major
crisis response operations, which are by nature unpredictable. To improve the use of country procurement systems,
ADB is facilitating policy dialogue, knowledge sharing,
and capacity development, and strengthening of national
procurement systems through the Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative.

ENSURING ACCOUNTABILITY
AND COMPLIANCE

The ADB Accountability Mechanism provides an independent forum for people adversely affected by ADBassisted projects to voice complaints and seek resolution of
problems. This takes place through consultation and facilitation. Affected people may also request an investigation
into allegations of noncompliance by ADB with its operational policies and procedures. The mechanism is designed
to contribute to ADB’s development effectiveness and help
improve project quality.

The mechanism has two phases: consultation and
problem-solving conducted by the Special Project Facilitator, and compliance review led by the independent
Compliance Review Panel (CRP).

The Office of the Special Project Facilitator received
seven new complaints in 2010, of which two met its eligibility criteria. Four previous complaints were closed. The
Office of the Compliance Review Panel received five
inquiries for compliance review in 2010. All were considered to be outside the scope of the CRP’s mandate and
had been referred to the concerned operations department.

The CRP completed the first full 5-year annual monitoring program (for the Chashma Right Bank Irrigation

Project in Pakistan) and conducted the fourth annual monitoring for the Southern Transport Development Project
in Sri Lanka. The CRP reported? to the Board that it was
unable to complete the compliance review and make any
determination as to ADB’s accountability for the Fuzhou
Environmental Improvement Project in the People’s
Republic of China due to the government’s lack of consent
to the CRP to visit the project site.

The Office of the Special Project Facilitator and the
Office of the Compliance Review Panel finalized the first
formal strategy for Accountability Mechanism outreach, an
annual program to promote awareness of the Accountability Mechanism, and continued to work together to disseminate information about the Accountability Mechanism, both
internally in ADB and externally. As part of that strategy,
ADB approved the first funding for Accountability Mechanism outreach in the form of a small-scale regional technical
assistance to pilot outreach on a regional basis.’ The first
program will be conducted in the Pacific developing member
countries in early 2011.

ADB initiated a review of the Accountability
Mechanism Policy in 2010. (See Chapter 3, page 15.)

feedback during loan processing and implementation;
(iii) building capacity of developing member countries to
evaluate development projects and train ADB staff on selfevaluation of ADB projects and programs; and (iv) contributing to knowledge solutions. In 2010, IED delivered the
planned program of evaluations, knowledge products, and
capacity development.

IED evaluations aim to promote accountability for results
and learning. To promote accountability, evaluations assess
whether ADB is allocating and using resources properly and
achieving planned outcomes. IED relies on a number of evaluations of sector assistance programs and individual projects
to evaluate country partnership strategies. These evaluations
contribute to the formulation of country strategies and provide
timely feedback on what worked and what did not, and why.

In 2010, IED evaluated the country partnership strategies
for Bhutan and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic to

assess their performance. The strategy for Bhutan was rated
successful. The evaluation found, for example, that ADB
has made major contributions to rural electrification and the
development of basic infrastructure in two major centers.

In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, too, the
ADB country strategy was rated successful in achieving
its objectives. ADB helped the country in its transition to
a market-based economy and assisted the government to
formulate development strategies and plans, though it could
have done better to strengthen public sector management
and the finance sector.

To add value to the quality of new ADB projects,
programs, and country partnership strategies, IED provided
detailed comments on project design at the early stages of
their preparation during the year. It commented on about
462 operational documents and participated in 65 management review meetings.Annual Report 2010 =. 23

 

IED collaborates with other evaluation agencies mainly
through the Evaluation Cooperation Group to improve its
own effectiveness. In 2010, IED led the subgroup on good
practice standards for evaluation of policy-based lending
and contributed to good practice standards for evaluation of
sovereign and private sector operations. It also participated
and/or remained abreast of the evaluation network activities
of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

LEARNING FROM INDEPENDENT
EVALUATION

IED produced higher-level evaluations and knowledge
products in a number of strategically important areas to
promote learning. The products relate to a diverse set of
issues, including special evaluation studies of ADB support to
countries in fragile and conflict-affected situations, financing
partnership facilities, and gender and development.

IED also evaluated the sustainability of ADB projects
and programs after completion of their implementation. The
study found that about 65% of ADB-funded projects are
rated likely sustainable at completion. A project producing
its rated output efficiently at the time of its completion does
not guarantee its long-term sustainability. Making projects
sustainable during their entire lifetime is a complex
process and depends on many factors. It takes collective
efforts of stakeholders in ADB and governments at different
stages of the project cycle to ensure project sustainability.
Good project design, proper implementation, and efficient
operation are essential.

The regulatory and managerial environment should be
conducive to support rational output pricing and adequate
operations and maintenance. Dependence on government
for operations and maintenance and a weak political will
for cost recovery generally make projects unsustainable.
In the case of non-revenue earning projects, fiscal
affordability of operations and maintenance is an imperative
for their sustainability. ADB needs to pay particular attention
to ensure post-completion project sustainability. It should
assess the risks to project outputs and outcomes and mitigate them during project preparation and implementation,
and monitor them during operation working closely with
the client governments.

ADB assistance contributed
to water policy development
in Asia in areas including
governance, tariff reforms,
and water conservation

Using rigorous methods, IED assessed development
outcomes of two ADB-funded rural electrification projects
in Bhutan on quality of life in rural areas, and the sustainability of the projects. (See “Electrification Study Sheds
New Light on Bhutan Households” on page 24.)

In addition, IED published an evaluation knowledge
brief on reducing carbon emissions from transport projects
and suggested measures to reduce the carbon footprint of
ADB’s transport sector assistance. The study developed
tools to monitor and evaluate the carbon footprint of
ADB’s transport sector projects. The study estimated gross
carbon dioxide emissions from the construction and operations of ADB-funded transport projects approved during
2000-2009 at 792 million tons. That would be an average of
39.6 million tons/year in a project’s 20-year lifetime. Transport
sector investments and strategies that reduce carbon footprint
also help reduce local air pollution. Hence, investments
in railways and public transport could reduce both carbon
dioxide emissions and air pollution over the long term. The
study recommended that ADB adopt carbon emissions as a
consideration for project design, review, and appraisal.

The evaluation of ADB technical assistance to India,
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka for building
capacity to manage the environment has found that continued ADB assistance is required for strengthening country
environment safeguard systems, with particular attention
given to provincial environment offices.

After carrying out a special evaluation study to assess
the implementation of ADB’s 2001 Water Policy and related
operations, IED found the policy to be relevant to ADB’s
corporate strategy and developing member countries’
national priorities. It found, moreover, that ADB assistance
contributed to water policy development in Asia in areas
including governance, tariffreforms, and water conservation.
However, the study found that more remains to be done,
particularly in integrated water resources management.24 Asian Development Bank

 

Electrification Study Sheds New Light

on Bhutan Households

An investigation by ADB’s Independent
Evaluation Department of households in the
kingdom provides insights into how electricity
improves the lives of rural people

two of the five rural electrification projects ADB

has carried out in Bhutan since 1996. The study,
which assessed the projects’ impact on economic,
environmental, and social aspects of rural people’s
quality of life, found that electrification has had quantifiable, visible, and positive results.

Households electrified under the two projects and
villages where electrification is planned were compared in the study. To allow conditions in disparate
and diverse communities to be assessed, 106 villages
from 10 of 15 districts (dzonkhags) in the project area
were carefully selected. The sample included more
than 2,000 households, representing about 18% of
households in the 10 study districts. On average, the
electrified households had received electricity for
4 years.

The assessment found that while the flow of
benefits is slowly emerging, electrified households
enjoy a better quality of life and earn more. However,
most economic, social, and environmental outcomes
are modest because household consumption of electricity is limited to lighting, cooking, and water boiling.
The use of electricity for generating incomes is confined to weaving in central and western Bhutan and
poultry production in the south.

Ts Independent Evaluation Department examined

Evaluation capacity development in developing
member countries and in ADB is an important mandate
of IED. In 2010, the department supported training of
government officials from selected countries in Central Asia
and Southeast Asia at the Shanghai International Program
for Development Evaluation Training. IED also organized
training and learning events for ADB staff on preparing

project completion reports and related self-evaluation.

Members of electrified households devote less
time to collecting firewood, spend less on fossil fuel,
and enjoy substantially fewer smoke-induced health
problems—and fewer sick days—than those burning
solid fuels. Children, particularly girls, in electrified
households complete comparatively more years of
schooling. Women play more significant roles in
decisions regarding the education and health of
household members and tend to be better informed
on these issues than their male counterparts.

Although electrification benefits are mostly realized in the long run, the study saw a modest positive
impact of electrification on fertility, migration, and
food security. It concluded that Bhutan should build
on the success achieved so far and strive to enhance
electricity use for activities that raise incomes.

TRANSFORMING ADB’S
KNOWLEDGE AGENDA

Knowledge underpins development effectiveness. In 2004,
the Knowledge Management Framework signaled ADB’s
concerted efforts to become a learning organization. The
framework pursues two mutually supportive outcomes:
(i) increased assimilation of and dissemination by ADB of
relevant, high-quality knowledge to developing member
countries and other stakeholders, and (ii) enhanced learning
within ADB.

Prominent among ADB’s efforts was the establishment
or strengthening of knowledge management units in IED
and regional departments. Strategy 2020 boosted this
commitment by indicating that ADB should play a bigger
role in putting the potential of knowledge solutions to work
in the region. Specifically, the Knowledge Management
Action Plan 2009-2011 identified four desired outcomes:
a sharpened knowledge focus in ADB’s operations,
empowered communities of practice (CoPs), strengthened
external knowledge partnerships, and enhanced staff
learning and skills development. In 2010, ADB stepped up
supportive actions.

To sharpen the focus on knowledge in ADB’s
operations, new sector peer review procedures were
incorporated into ADB’s business processes for country
partnership strategies and lending products, including
Asian Development Fund grants. ADB strengthened
the terms of reference of its knowledge management
champions and conducted an assessment of the demand
for knowledge products through resident and regional
missions. Efforts to transform sector- and theme-related
information into knowledge were boosted, and ADB’s
drive to broaden understanding of tools, methods, and
approaches for knowledge management and learning
continued through the Knowledge Solutions and Knowledge

Showcases series.

To empower CoPs, ADB
added staff positions and
increased tenfold the budgets
allotted for their activities

In 2010, ADB hosted 13 communities
of practice:

¢ Agriculture, rural development,
and food security
* Education
* Energy
* Environment
¢ Financial sector development
* Gender equity
* Social development and poverty
* Public management and governance
* Health
* Regional cooperation and integration
* Transport
* Urban
* Water
Communities of practice are groups of like-minded
individuals who keep know-how in sector and
thematic domains alive by continuously sharing

what they know, building on that, and adapting
knowledge to specific applications.

 

 

To empower CoPs, ADB added staff positions and
increased tenfold the budgets allotted for their activities.
This helped them design and deliver customized courses
for their members, conduct self-assessments of their
effectiveness, participate in global conferences and other
forums, and collaborate with fellow CoPs and external
partners in joint research undertakings and knowledge
sharing.

New collaboration mechanisms for cross-departmental
and multi-disciplinary knowledge generation and sharing
were set up, among them the CoP web pages in ADB’s
intranet and links to sector and thematic resources, such as
urban and energy portals.

To foster stronger partnerships, ADB began to incorporate knowledge components in new partnership agreements,26 Asian Development Bank

 

such as those with Agence Francaise de Développement,
the Australian Agency for International Development, and
the United Nations Children’s Fund. It also built a database
of strategic partnerships for use across ADB and is now
designing a platform to enable ADB-wide management and
monitoring of partnerships. A new course on learning in
partnerships was developed for delivery in 2011, and
Guidelines for Knowledge Partnerships were formulated.

Courses to promote awareness of, and action on,
knowledge generation and sharing were delivered under
the Knowledge Management and Learning Series and
Learning for Change Primers, with e-learning applications
planned for 2011. The Budget, Personnel, and Management
Systems Department (BPMSD) reviewed and enhanced its
program for staff learning and development to better cater
to the needs of CoP and regional departments. This provided CoPs with the opportunity to develop their members’
technical capacity. The Water CoP, together with BPMSD,
developed and delivered 10 training courses.

As in previous years, ADB promoted further understanding of knowledge management and learning. In
June 2010, it introduced the Learning for Change Survey
to collect staff feedback on four drivers of learning
(organization, people, knowledge, and technology). This
survey complemented the Most Admired Knowledge
Enterprises (MAKE) survey, conducted annually the past
6 years, which reveals fast-improving staff perceptions
of knowledge management. The 2010 MAKE survey
attracted a greater number of respondents and highlighted
ADB’s improvements in developing and delivering client
knowledge-based projects and services, creating a collaborative knowledge sharing environment, and promoting
individual and organizational learning and sharing.

DISCLOSURE AND
TRANSPARENCY

Experience with 2005 policy. When adopted in April
2005, the Public Communications Policy was considered
progressive and at the forefront of best practices among
multilateral development banks. Since then, ADB has
made significant strides in its public communications.
The policy brought about a major cultural change within

ADB such that disclosure is now considered standard
operating procedure for all ADB projects. In general,
ADB has successfully adopted a presumption in favor of
disclosure.

Disclosure compliance, including timeliness of
disclosure and handling of external requests, has continually improved. In the 2007 Global Accountability Report
published by One World Trust, ADB received a score of
100% on transparency good practice. ADB’s external relations strategy, which supports the policy, has led to more
proactive and targeted efforts to raise ADB’s profile and
share information about its work. ADB has significantly
raised its profile in top-tier media through outreach activities and public speaking engagements by Management and
staff at major international forums and conferences.

In addition, most of the information required to be
posted on the ADB website is now available: the number
of documents posted on the ADB website has increased by
125% since 2005. Accessibility to information on the website also increased. Of the nearly 5,000 external requests
for information received since 2005, the information was
provided in 95% of the cases. Overall, staff recognize the
many benefits of transparency and are conscientious about
disclosure.

The review of the 2005 policy in 2010 has shown that
overall ADB’s Public Communications Policy remains
relevant and that ADB compares well against other
multilateral development banks in terms of information
disclosure good practices. While internal and external
reviews have generally found that the aim and direction of
the policy is good and it has served ADB and its members
well, ADB is committed to even greater transparency
in future.

IMPROVING HUMAN RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT

A milestone in 2010 was the approval in January of
Our People Strategy, which sets out ADB’s employee
value proposition (or what ADB offers of value to its staff).
Three key goals were highlighted in this paper, summarized by the words: good people, capable managers, and a
supportive work environment.Annual Report 2010 = 27

 

The paper was followed by the preparation of its
implementation plan—the Human Resource Function
Strategic Framework and Action Plan, completed in April.
These two documents serve as the medium-term road map
for improving human resource management in ADB.

This was also the first full year of operation of the
Human Resources Committee of the Board, which met
seven times and provided practical and timely guidance
on human resource policies and programs. At the end of
the year, the Human Resources Committee issued its first
annual report. A key theme was diversity and inclusiveness, with gender balance in international staff and
increased value placed on the role of resident mission
staff remaining important goals.

STREAMLINING BUSINESS
PROCESSES

To improve service delivery and increase internal
efficiency, ADB introduced new streamlined business
processes for country partnership strategies* and loan
delivery® on 1 January 2010.

Under the new business processes, ADB introduced
several important changes in the way it conducts its business, including more concise and streamlined documentation for product delivery, and stronger quality assurance
processes. In 2010, three country partnership strategies
were finalized using the new streamlined business process
for Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, and Tajikistan.

For loan delivery, reforms included (i) enhanced
quality assurance through risk-based project categorization
of operations, (ii) more strategic and sector-focused peer
reviews, (ili) greater focus on implementation and project
readiness, and (iv) simplified documentation. With the
introduction of these reforms, ADB expects the average
time for loan processing to be reduced significantly while
improving the quality at entry.

Along with business process improvements, ADB
has been strengthening the use of information technology.

It upgraded its information technology system, especially
the one used for preparing country partnership strategies
and projects and portfolio management. This means ADB
can now more effectively monitor project information
throughout project cycles.

In response to the 2009 Development Effectiveness
Review, which revealed a downward trend in project quality
indicators (the success rates of completed investment and
technical assistance operations), Management established
in June a project implementation working group with a
mandate to identify key issues and regional department
good practices that could be replicated or applied more
widely. The working group made recommendations under
three headings: (i) achieving total project readiness;
(ii) enhancing organization, staff skills, and incentives; and
(ili) ensuring effective project implementation.

STRENGTHENING RISK
MANAGEMENT

In line with Strategy 2020, which envisages a greater
role for ADB in financing private sector development,
ADB has made a concentrated effort to strengthen its risk
management capabilities further. This is essential to allow
ADB to manage the higher risks associated with additional
private sector lending operations.

In 2010, ADB’s Board of Directors approved a special
capital expenditure budget for developing a comprehensive
risk management system that will provide an information
technology platform to monitor and manage risk more
efficiently. Acquisition and implementation will be
ongoing during 2011 and 2012.

Meanwhile, ADB has continued to increase staffing
for the Office of Risk Management and has initiated
steps to develop an operational risk management framework. Significant methodological developments during
2010 included the introduction of a pricing tool that
provides a reference point for the pricing of nonsovereign
transactions.

AUDIT

The Office of the Auditor General (OAG) conducts independent audits of ADB’s loan, grant, and technical assistance operations; financial, accounting, risk management,
and administrative processes; and information systems.
The audits are based on risk assessments and geared to
strengthen internal control, risk management, resource
utilization, and governance processes; ensure compliance with ADB policies, procedures, and regulations; and
enhance effectiveness, efficiency, and economy.

OAG completed 22 audits in 2010. Audits of loan,
grant, and technical assistance portfolios were conducted in
selected headquarters departments, resident missions, and
representative offices. Treasury and nonsovereign reviews
included borrowings and associated hedge swaps, and
commercial and official cofinancing guarantee operations.
Financial and administrative audits included audits of
selected consultant contracts and commissary operations.
Information system reviews covered the mainframe,
data center, and projects under the Information Systems
and Technology Strategy Il program. Audit management
software has similarly been implemented in OAG to
automate internal audit processes.

Based on an internal assessment, OAG was found to
be broadly compliant with the Institute of Internal Auditors’ International Professional Practices Framework. The
office has started a phased realignment approach to further
improve its processes, reporting formats, and communications, and is establishing a quality assurance program.

OAG coordinated its work with ADB’s outside auditors
(Deloitte & Touche) to ensure effective planning and

implementation of audit activities. OAG provided support
to Deloitte & Touche in line with the fiscal year 2010
audit of ADB’s financial statements and the attestation
process, and agreed procedures on three ADB bond
offerings. OAG also collaborated with Deloitte & Touche
and PricewaterhouseCoopers on the audits of 32 technical assistance trust/grant funds undertaken at the request of
the Office of Cofinancing Operations. Several consultant
contracts were audited by OAG to ensure the authenticity
of consultant claims. The principles for the selection of the
outside auditor were approved by the Board.

OAG monitors the progress of its outstanding recommendations, and those made by the outside auditor, with an
emphasis on high-risk items.

INTEGRITY AND
ANTICORRUPTION ACTIVITIES

The ADB Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAT)
receives and investigates allegations of fraud, corruption,
coercion, collusion, obstructive practices, conflict of interest, misconduct, and abuse (collectively known as integrity violations) in ADB-financed activity. The office also
conducts project procurement-related reviews of ongoing
ADB-financed projects, to confirm compliance with ADB’s
policies, guidelines, and loan agreements, with a focus on
preventing and detecting integrity violations. Working
with other offices, OAI also improves staff and stakeholder
awareness of Anticorruption Policy requirements.

During the year, OAI facilitated ADB’s signing of the
Agreement for Mutual Enforcement of Debarment Decisions
(the
multilateral development banks (African Development

Cross-Debarment Agreement) with participating

Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank
Group). The agreement enforces each other’s prospective
debarment actions with respect to corruption, fraud,
coercion, and collusion. ADB has cross debarred six firms
and two individuals sanctioned by the World Bank since the
agreement came into force. ADB has submitted requests for
the cross-debarment of 4 firms and 10 individuals.

ADB publishes on its website the names of firms and
individuals who have been sanctioned for having breached
any earlier sanction imposed by ADB, who have beenAnnual Report 2010 29

 

sanctioned for second or subsequent integrity violations,
whom OAI could not notify of sanction after reasonable
efforts, and who are cross-debarred by ADB under the
Cross-Debarment Agreement. The complete list of firms
and individuals, which includes first-time violators, is also
published on ADB’s website, restricted to authorized users
with a demonstrated need to know.

ADB received 188 new allegations related to ADBfinanced projects and ADB staff members, and sanctioned
47 individuals and 37 firms. Five project procurement
related reviews were carried out on projects in Bangladesh,
the People’s Republic of China, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
and Nepal. OAI held anticorruption training sessions in
Cambodia, Nepal, and Uzbekistan under two regional
technical assistance projects. The office also conducted
27 mandatory briefings to ADB staff, 17 orientation seminars, and 9 fraud and corruption awareness workshops
as part of ADB’s continuing endeavors to ensure that all
ADB staff members observe the highest standards of
integrity and ethics.SECTOR AND THEMATIC

Fresh initiatives in education, health, clean energy, governance and
anticorruption, and sustainable transport helped maintain the momentum of
ADB's Strategy 2020. This long-term agenda focuses on priority sectors and
thematic areas that align with the commitment to eradicate poverty through
inclusive, environmentally sustainable economic growth and regional integration.
ADB also worked to raise awareness of the region’s progress in achieving

the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).Annual Report 2010 31

 

POVERTY REDUCTION
AND MDGs

nder its overarching goal of poverty reduction,

Strategy 2020 aims to ensure operations focus

on sectors that align best with ADB’s long-term
agenda for inclusive growth, environmental sustainability,
and regional cooperation and integration. ADB continued
to oversee the implementation of strategies for each sector,
to promote learning and knowledge management, and
to encourage the uptake of innovative practices in ADB
operations. Selected work is reported.

Millennium Development Goals. With the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific
and the United Nations Development Programme, ADB
worked to disseminate knowledge, promote policy advocacy, and build capacity for statistics programs. Several
events were held, including a forum on improving vital
statistics and civil registration and regional ministeriallevel meetings in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The
tripartite partnership produced a number of publications,
one of which, Paths to 2015, was launched by President
Kuroda at the UN World Summit on the Millenium Development Goals. ADB also engaged in strategic discussion
with development partners and governments in the context
of projects to fast-track MDG achievements by 2015.

GENDER EQUITY

Guidelines for the Gender Mainstreaming Categories of
ADB Projects were also updated. The increase in gender
mainstreaming—the inclusion of gender-related analyses
in the design of programs and projects—continued for the
third year. ADB reached its 2012 numerical targets for gender mainstreaming of 40% of all ADB public sector and
50% of Asian Development Fund projects.

The Gender and Development Plan of Action 2008—
2010 ended with progress in core areas, including infrastructure, environment, and education. To further improve
ADB’s performance, the plan will be continued through
2011-2012. Meanwhile, the number of gender specialists

nearly doubled to 25 staff and staff consultants. More
than 200 staff members were trained in gender-responsive
project design and implementation.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT

Education. ADB finalized Education by 2020: A Sector
Operations Plan. The plan addresses challenges in human
resource development confronting Asia and the Pacific,
and presents ADB’s response in meeting them, including
increased support for workforce skills development and
higher education. The plan stresses the importance of
inclusive, equitable education and pro-poor public—private
partnerships. ADB also prepared knowledge products
in these areas. Eight loans and grants ($611.7 million)
included, among others, ADB’s response to the demand
for workforce skills development in the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic and Viet Nam. The Higher Education
in Dynamic Asia Project focused on improving knowledge
and capacity for developing member countries to plan and
implement critical higher education reforms.

Health. Sector-specific health programs and projects were
supported in eight countries. ADB produced studies and
held policy dialogue on the implications for human health
of climate change as it affects the agriculture and water
sectors and disaster-risk reduction, and on the health impacts
of traffic-related air pollution. The regional AIDS data hub
disseminated best practices, and ADB supported efforts at
controlling communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS
and dengue fever, in the Greater Mekong Subregion. New
information was provided to back investment in maternal,
newborn, and child health; and the Asia Pacific Health
Observatory was initiated.

Social protection, inclusive growth, and the environments of the poor. Loans were provided to expand the
conditional cash transfer program in the Philippines
($400 million) and to sustain expenditure on social services
and social protection in Georgia ($100 million). Grants
($3 million) were made to alleviate the impact of the global
economic crisis on vulnerable individuals in three Pacific
countries. Technical assistance was provided to devise an32 Asian Development Bank

 

action plan for ADB’s involvement in social protection.
ADB also prepared several knowledge products, including
The Environments of the Poor in the Context of Climate
Change and the Green Economy.

FINANCE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT

Sovereign lending of $893.4 million supported general
finance sector and capital market develo ment for microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory
reforms. Nonsovereign investment reached $1,035 million,
largely supporting housing finance, microfinance, and
regional guarantees. Most technical assistance was for
preparing lending programs/projects, and implementing
policy reforms and building capacity, while the remainder
backed efforts by developing member countries to promote
regional economic and financial integration. An operational
plan for Finance Sector Development was being prepared
and approval is expected in 2011.

GOVERNANCE AND CAPACITY
DEVELOPMENT

Since the approval of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II) in 2006, risk assessments and risk management plans have been implemented
in 20 countries and across seven sectors. Two sector guidance
notes (education and road transport) were prepared to help
staff identify governance risks. Detailed capacity assessments were implemented with procurement agencies
in three developing member countries and with an anticorruption agency. In 2010, a Stocktake and Strategic Review
of ADB’s Governance and Public Sector Management
Policies and Operations was initiated.

SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

Energy. ADB incorporated its Energy Efficiency Initiative
into the Clean Energy Program to double an annual
clean-energy-investment target of $1 billion (2008-2012)
to $2 billion from 2013. Clean energy investments in
2010 reached $1.76 billion, which is expected to result in

additional 1,871 MW renewable energy generation
capacity, 3,246 GWh electricity savings per year, and annual
greenhouse gas emission reduction of 13 million tons carbon
dioxide equivalent. Investments in access-to-energy projects
exceeded $950 million, from $418 million in 2009. The
investment will provide access to electricity and modern
fuels for 1.5 million households, adding to 1.27 million
households connected during 2003-2009.

of the
Initiative Operational Plan placed ADB at the forefront of

Transport. Approval Sustainable Transport
sustainable transport in developing member countries. The
ADB Transport Forum 2010 discussed issues related to
urban transport, mainstreaming climate change, crossborder transport and logistics, and road safety, and
social sustainability. The Kathmandu Sustainable Urban
Transport Project was approved, serving as a showcase

for support in urban transport.

Urban development. Urban Day 2010, held in Manila,
stimulated discussion on core areas of the Urban Operational Plan, for which approval is expected in 2011. Implementation guidelines for the Urban Financing Partnership
Facility, established in late 2009, were finalized to make
the facility operational. The Cities Development Initiative
for Asia (CDIA) approved applications from 23 cities in
13 countries—with a target of 50 cities by the end of 2012.
These interventions used $7.7 million of initiative funding and $1.6 million in counterparty contributions. These
are leading to an estimated $4.4 billion in additional urban
infrastructure investments, which may come from goyernment funds, CDIA official partners (including ADB),
international private sector infrastructure finance organizations, external international development organizations
and foundations (e.g., Global Environment Facility), and
existing strategic partners.

Clean energy investments
reached $1.76 billion, against
a target of $1 billion. Doubling
that goal from 2013 will boost
renewable energy generationAnnual Report 2010 33

 

Water. The Water Financing Program 2006-2010 delivered
$11.44 billion in investments as of the end of 2010,
exceeding the $10.0 billion target. Approvals for water
loans in 2010 totaled $2.32 billion. The Water Financing
Partnership Facility, which was established to support the
Water Financing Program implementation, continued to
provide resources during the year. The Water Financing
Program will continue beyond 2010, guided by priorities
set out in the Water Operational Framework 2011-2020,
for which approval is expected in 2011. Increased support
for sanitation and wastewater management remained a
priority, with loans to the People’s Republic of China,
Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, among others. Support for
climate change adaptation in the sector was boosted with
the approval of two regional technical assistance projects.

ENVIRONMENT, CLIMATE
CHANGE, AND SAFEGUARDS

Environment. Fifty-one projects with environmental
sustainability as a theme and totaling about $5 billion
were approved—tepresenting a 55% increase over 2009
in terms of projects, and the highest since 1995. Environmental lending in 2010 pushed up the proportion of
projects supporting environmental sustainability to 37%
from 2008 to 2010, exceeding ADB’s target for a 3-year
rolling average of 25% in 2010-2012. More than 63 technical assistance projects totaling about $79 million, and
19 grants totaling nearly $188 million, were approved with
environmental sustainability as a theme.

Climate change. An institution-wide plan was approved to
help developing member countries address climate change.
It covers five priorities: expanding the use of clean energy;
encouraging sustainable transport and urban development;
managing land use and forests for carbon sequestration;
promoting climate-resilient development; and strengthening related policies, governance, and capacity.

ADB strengthened collaboration with development
partners in mobilizing additional resources for climate
actions, such as through the Climate Investment Funds and
Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. A $10 million
replenishment of ADB’s own Climate Change Fund was
approved. ADB was formally accredited by the Adaptation

Fund Board in June of 2010 as one of the Multilateral
Implementing Entities for the Fund.

ADB allocated $1.76 billion to clean energy investments.
New initiatives to promote technology innovation, transfer,
and diffusion were advanced, including the Asia Clean Technology Exchange, the Asia Climate Change and Clean Energy
Venture Capital Initiative, the Climate Public—Private Partnership Fund, the Asia Solar Energy Initiative, and Quantum
Leap in Wind Power. Its Carbon Market Program continued
to help developing member countries access financing and
technology for low-carbon investments through the Kyoto
Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism.

ADB expanded efforts to climate-proof projects,
including those for road improvements in Cambodia,
Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam; for water
projects in Bangladesh; and for port facilities in the
Cook Islands. It stepped up policy, research, knowledge,
and capacity building, to build climate resilience, as
exemplified by a climate impact assessment for Ho Chi
Minh City, which identifies alternative solutions to flooding
threats due to climate change. The Asia Pacific Adaptation
Network was launched in 2010. ADB, a founding member
of the network, is collaborating with partners to enhance
knowledge generation and dissemination on climate
change adaptation in the Asia and the Pacific region.

Safeguards. Under the Safeguard Policy Statement that
came into effect in January 2010, ADB screened all projects
for potential impacts related to the environment, involuntary
resettlement, and indigenous peoples, and assisted borrowers
and clients to adopt safeguards to address environmental
and social risks. To ensure sound implementation of the
Safeguard Policy Statement, an operations manual section
aligned with new business processes was issued. Workshops
were attended by 680 staff, 19 new staff were recruited,
more than 10 in-country briefings were held, technical assistance projects totaling $11.3 million were implemented to
strengthen country safeguard systems, and several ADB—
World Bank country safeguard reviews were conducted.

CROSSCUTTING INITIATIVES

Public—private partnership (PPP). The PPP Practice
Group, which functions as the community of practice
for all PPP-related matters within and outside ADB,34 Asian Development Bank

 

was established, and a PPP Operational Plan was being
prepared for which approval is expected in 2011. The
Multilateral Public-Private Partnership for Infrastructure
Capacity Development (MP3IC) Program partners, a
joint initiative of ADB, Inter-American Development
Bank, and World Bank Institute, continued to develop
learning products for PPP practitioners.

Agriculture and food security. Investments and technical assistance projects for food security of $2.2 billion
were approved, against a $2 billion target. The Investment
Forum for Food Security in Asia and the Pacific resulted

in regional and country partnerships toward food security
among ADB, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, and the Food and Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations. ADB led the initiative to expand
rice trading and establish an emergency rice reserve in
Asia through its support for ASEAN+3. In coordination
with other multilateral development banks, ADB engaged
in technical discussions on actions to address increasing
volatility in the global food market.

Emergency assistance and disaster risk management.
An integrated disaster risk management framework was

COFINANCING OPERATIONS

Total direct value-added (DVA) cofinancing for investment and technical assistance projects amounted to
$3.67 billion for 155 projects (Tables 9a and 9b). An additional $3.36 billion in discrete (non-DVA) cofinancing was
realized in the form of parallel loans for 11 ADB-assisted
projects and programs. ADB projects with cofinancing are
in Statistical Annexes 7 and 27.

In addition to project-specific cofinancing, additional
resources in the form of grant contributions from external
partners to trust funds totaled $147.4 million in 2010,
comprising $40.5 million in new contributions! and
$106.9 million in replenishments? to existing trust funds.
Trust funds are key instruments to mobilize and channel
grants to finance technical assistance and components of
investment projects to complement ADB’s own resources
in various sectors or for specific themes, for example,

Infrastructure Trust Fund to support infrastructure projects
in Afghanistan.

ADB also continued efforts in integrating cofinancing
upstream in its operations, including early and regular
engagement of cofinanciers in the planning and processing
stages. Through the establishment of framework agreements with its cofinancing partners, ADB aims to effectively create a pipeline of future cofinancing operations:
such a programmatic approach gives predictability
to ADB’s cofinancing operations, and allows the use of
standardized, project-specific cofinancing agreement
templates that streamline cofinancing operations.

There are now seven cofinancing framework agreements? signed with ADB for a program of up to $9.6 billion
for sovereign and nonsovereign operations within the next
3 years. In March 2010, the ADB—Agence Frangaise de
Développement (AFD) Partnership Framework Agreement
and the Framework Cofinancing Agreement were signed
to provide assistance for development projects through
programmatic cofinancing and stronger linkages with the
private sector, along with new research and knowledgebased activities. In addition to framework agreements, a
memorandum of understanding between ADB and the
Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) was
signed in May 2010 to facilitate cofinancing under JBIC’s
new initiative: the Global Action for Reconciling Economic Growth and Environment Preservation (GREEN).

To further promote ADB’s commercial cofinancing products, ADB continued its knowledge management

have been conducted in eight developing member countries,
and attended by more than 400 national and subnational officials. These workshops introduced the participants to the use
and availability of credit enhancement products from ADB,
other multilateral development banks, export credit agencies, export—import banks, and private insurance companies.
In addition, ADB facilitated the Asian EXIM Banks (AEB)
Forum training program on risk management. This was
aimed at helping the AEBs to take a harmonized approach to
credit risk assessments and to gain a common understanding
on the underlying transaction risk and risk pricing.

During the year, there was an overall net transfer of
$3.7 billion from ADB to its developing member countries,
including loans, equity investments, and grants. Of these,

Improved connectivity through investments in transport and logistics, energy
security and efficiency, upgraded urban services, and public sector reforms
are at the heart of the ADB strategy in the subregion. More than $1.2 billion
has been directed at energy supply and transmission, with the same amount
or transport infrastructure. The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation
Program reached major milestones in 2010.Annual Report 2010 45

 

OVERVIEW

ocus and selectivity characterize ADB’s strategy

in Central and West Asia. This targets investments

in transport and logistics, energy security and
efficiency, urban services, and public financial management and reforms. ADB is also active in private sector
development work, including reforms, public—private
initiatives, and the opening up of access to credit for people
and businesses and for building infrastructure.

The strategy is delivered through debt and equity
financing operations, guarantees, and grants, in tandem with
technical assistance, to train client staff on planning, project
management, monitoring, and reporting. ADB has a strong
operational emphasis on regional cooperation and integration,
environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation.

Total new lending and grants to the public sector
reached $2.9 billion in 2010, reflecting growing demand
from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and the Caucasus, compared
with $2.6 billion of lending and grant approvals in 2009.
Contract awards reached $1.6 billion and disbursements $1.5 billion. Private sector finance totaled almost
$350 million, from zero in 2009.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The quality of the ADB portfolio in the subregion continued
to improve, mainly due to renewed commitment to effective
and efficient project management and stronger cooperation
and engagement with clients. A “workout” function is in place
for transactions in need of restructuring or at risk. Project
extensions are based on agreed milestones. Simplification
of design features, the use of stricter readiness filters, and
advance actions on procurement and safeguards also help.
ADB continues to use programmatic funding modalities,
including multitranche financing. Because these involve
up-front analytical work and a sharper focus on project
implementation, their use has resulted in quality due
diligence, high client responsiveness, financing predictability,
and longer-term partnerships across different sectors.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC)
Program achieved yet again significant milestones in 2010.

 

HIGHLIGHTS

* More than $1.2 billion invested in energy supply
and transmission, including $442 million under
multitranche financing for energy efficiency in
Pakistan, and $350 million for the Talimarjan
Power Project in Uzbekistan

¢ About $1.3 billion provided for transport
infrastructure, mostly under multitranche
financing, including a $340 million regional road
project in Afghanistan, and $456 million for
CAREC corridors in Kazakhstan and $115 million
in Uzbekistan

* Presentation of a 10-year stocktaking of CAREC
Program achievements to the Ninth CAREC
Ministerial Conference, which will serve as
the basis for refining the program's strategic
directions for the next 10 years

* Improved portfolio quality, with 26 sovereign
loans, 4 grants, and 32 technical assistance
projects closed; contract awards were $1.6 billion,
while disbursements reached $1.5 billion

 

 

 

ADB and its partners—including the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Islamic
Development Bank, and the World Bank—approved subregional transport and energy projects worth $2 billion. These
covered the CAREC Corridor (Zhamby] Oblast Section) in
Kazakhstan and the Talimarjan Power Project in Uzbekistan.
Under an agreement signed by the Kyrgyz Republic
and Tajikistan in December to facilitate the cross-border
transport of goods and people, trade facilitation bodies were
established, including the CAREC Federation of Carrier
and Forwarder Association. At their ninth conference held
in Cebu, Philippines, in November, CAREC ministers
discussed possible strategic directions for subregional
cooperation in the next decade. Pakistan and Turkmenistan
joined CAREC, bringing membership to 10 countries.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

Knowledge management activities informed and supported
ADB’s strategies and operations. Analytical work on
strengthening of competitiveness and on_ structural
transformation that began in Pakistan was extended to
Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. A regional technical assistance
was approved to bring innovation to the construction of

country-specific and regional sector road maps in key46 Asian Development Bank

 

infrastructure sectors. Technical assistance to support a
new welfare improvement strategy in Uzbekistan and
prepare background analytical assessments for a new
country partnership strategy was also approved. The
Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) continued
to invest in a range of knowledge products, including
those on climate change and the country development
effectiveness briefs. Regular monitoring of and reporting
on the region’s economies continued with resident missions
in a lead role. A macroeconomic model for Pakistan was
operationalized to project key economic variables and
assess the impact of specific policy measures. A workshop in
Almaty, Kazakhstan, brought together CWRD economists
to debate important regional economic developments,
share lessons on key knowledge products such as country
performance assessments, and agree on systematic
frameworks for analyzing economies in the region.

The CAREC Institute invested significantly in capacity building and research programs to enhance knowledge
and skills for promoting regional cooperation. Its website
continued to serve as a knowledge and information hub on
economic cooperation in the CAREC region.

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

Afghanistan

Partnership priorities. ADB is strongly committed to
the Afghanistan-owned development agenda endorsed at
conferences in 2010 in London (January) and in Kabul
(July). Development partners agreed to align financing
behind Afghanistan-led priority programs, and to increasingly implement them through the country’s own systems.
The Board of Directors agreed to temporarily suspend the
planned phaseout of the exceptional Asian Development
Fund country allocation to Afghanistan in 2011 and 2012 in
order to continue supporting the assistance program, which
covers mainly transport, energy, and irrigation. The 2009—
2013 country partnership strategy focuses on solving one of
the government’s key problems—the infrastructure deficit.
ADB provides all its financing through Afghanistan’s budget
system. ADB approved the ADB-managed Afghanistan
Infrastructure Trust Fund to secure harmonized cofinancing
for core infrastructure projects. Work on the final segment

 

Progress of the MDGs in Central
and West Asia

¢ Environment. The first tranche under the
multitranche financing facility for energy
efficiency (Pakistan), the Talimarjan Power Project
(Uzbekistan), and the Janub Power Project
(Azerbaijan) will improve energy efficiency and
reduce carbon emissions. The Sindh Cities Project
(Pakistan) advanced recycling and waste disposal
will improve water quality. The Bishkek—Torugart
Road Project and Issyk Kul Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (Kyrgyz Republic) and the
Aktau-Beyneu Road Project (Kazakhstan) include
internationally recognized natural resource
management components that will improve
ecosystem protection and management.

* Gender. ADB helped its developing member
countries move toward gender equality by
mainstreaming gender in projects to create
jobs for women and improve their participation
in development and decision making. ADB’s
technical assistance improved sex-disaggregated
data collection of national statistics offices,
which is important for gender-sensitive planning.

 

 

 

of the ADB-financed Ring Road will start in 2011. ADB
is also completing work on a north-south corridor and has
advanced the preparation of a road project between Kabul
and Jalalabad. In energy, ADB is completing a transmission
line from Tajikistan and extending distribution in and around
Kabul. ADB also advanced the preparation of projects in
Helmand, and technical assistance is planned to increase
commercial bank lending in rural areas.

Impact of operations. ADB is the largest development
partner in infrastructure. Its portfolio consists of 19 sovereign loan and grant projects for a total $2.01 billion.
Despite security threats, ADB completed a flagship
75-kilometer (km) railway line from Hairatan on the
Afghanistan border with Uzbekistan to Mazar-e-Sharif.
It will become operational in early 2011. The CAREC
Program continues to underpin investment in transport
connectivity. The same goes for energy security. In the
meantime, CAREC is promoting regional trade between
Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. Afghanistan
is fast becoming a “transit country” for the region. This
will create security and, ultimately, jobs and development.Annual Report 2010 47

Georgia

Partnership priorities. Since Georgia joined ADB in
2007, loans worth $524 million have been approved
for urban transport, municipal services, and economic crisis support. ADB approved an $85 million loan
under a $300 million multitranche financing facility to
improve urban transport services and the environment,
and a $100 million loan to maintain government funding
for essential social services. Private sector financing of
$88 million was also approved.

Impact of operations. A $70 million loan for the Municipal
Services Development Project, approved in two phases
in 2008 and 2009, improved the quality and coverage of
water supply and sanitation, and road rehabilitation. The
capacity of municipal governments to implement projects
increased significantly as a result.

Impact of operations. ADB assistance is expected to
show significant development impact. At the macro level,
a risk management system—a central bank inflationtargeting model developed with ADB technical assistance—
helped the government manage inflation during the recent
global financial and economic crisis. The $500 million
loan was approved in September 2009 under the Countercyclical Support Facility. Transport and urban services also
improved as a result of ADB assistance.

The Kyrgyz Republic
Partnership priorities. Public infrastructure—transport,

energy, and urban services—remained a priority, as did public
sector management and regional cooperation. ADB approved

$45 million in assistance to improve transparency and efficiency in energy and $100 million in emergency assistance
to help with recovery and reconstruction in Osh, following
political disturbances in April and a conflict in June.

Impact of operations. ADB financing has improved
transport infrastructure, urban services, tax collection, and
customs services. ADB completed 78 km of the Osh—Gulcha
road and supported policies to reduce barriers to investment,
loweringcompliancecostsandincreasingaccesstofinanceinthe
process. ADB upgraded rural drinking water supply systems.

Pakistan

Partnership priorities. Energy, transport, urban services,
irrigation, and the finance sector remained priority areas.
To increase energy efficiency and energy security, ADB
financed various transmission and generation projects. It
also led the formation of the Energy Sector Task Force,
which is preparing an integrated energy sector recovery
plan. ADB mobilized international financing for Pakistan’s
first private sector wind farm and expanded lending to
the Uch Power Project. The first tranche of $60 million
under the Energy Efficiency Investment Program will cut
losses and reduce consumption. At the provincial level,
ADB supported public management efficiency measures,
including improvements to social service delivery and the
role of the private sector in manufacturing and trade. The
Punjab Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Program
for $150 million focused on health-related MDG targets.
A post-crisis needs assessment helped the government
develop a strategy for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. With the World Bank, ADB
led an assessment of damages and needs after the floods of
July. To ease a potential post-flood surge in imports of critical items, ADB increased Pakistani bank limits under the
Trade Finance Facilitation Program by $500 million.

Impact of operations. A series of long-term investments
in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution
have begun to improve energy efficiency. Reliability and
quality have increased, and service coverage has been
raised. Two road sector projects rehabilitated national and
provincial highways and rural links in the provinces of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, improving people’s
access to markets and basic services. A rural developmentAnnual Report 2010 = 51

Bitter Fruits Turn into Sweet Harvest

Farmers affected by water shortages

in Tajikistan have doubled their incomes
thanks to an ADB initiative to upgrade
irrigation systems

hen a scarcity of water blighted the quality
Wi his crops, Sohboi Dodoboev saw yields

from his 75-hectare (ha) farm in Tajikistan
sink to a quarter of normal output and he was forced
to sell his produce at prices barely covering costs.

Times of desperate shortage for his mixed crops
of cotton, apricots, and vegetables are now a thing
of the past. ADB’s Agriculture Rehabilitation Project,
implemented during 2003-2010, has brought vast
improvements to the lives of Tajikistan’s rural poor
by improving water supply infrastructure. The project
benefited an irrigation area of 85,000 ha with a
population of 471,500, and indirectly improved
another 67,500 ha, helping a further 359,000 people.
At the same time, reconstruction of potable water
supply systems in selected communities was supported for another 87,000 beneficiaries who, previously,
had no safe source of water.

Of the $43.75 million cost of the project, ADB
provided $35 million in an Asian Development
Fund loan while the government and beneficiaries
contributed the rest.

Part of the project was undertaken in the Sughd
Region on Kayrakum Reservoir, where floating pontoon

project improved rural livelihoods and increased agricultural productivity. ADB project implementation and
administration seminars helped more than 35 representatives
from various executing agencies build capacity in the
procurement of goods, services, and works.

The Punjab Devolved Social Services Programme
contributed to improved health and education indicators for
equality and access and introduced public-private partnerships
in social service delivery in Punjab. Literacy rates for the age
of 10 years and above in the province of Punjab improved
from 47% in 2001-2002 to 59% in 2008-2009.

Tajikistan

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy for
2010-2014 focuses on transport connectivity, energy security,
and private sector development. Regional cooperation is

This pump station supplies precious water for rural poor

stations pump water up to a storage area for irrigation
for over 25,000 ha of farms.

Construction of the floating pump stations and
other infrastructure has brought about some dramatic
changes, ensuring that Dodoboev and his neighbors
have all the water they need.

Now Dodoboev plans to buy apricot-drying equipment, which will bring four times the price of his fresh
crop in added value. He sees the money farmers are
spending on improving their businesses and homes
filtering out into other sectors of the community. “Our
incomes have doubled,” he says. “I was able to build
our son and his wife a home last year.”

   

a binding theme. A major electricity transmission project
approved for the period will increase system reliability and
ensure greater efficiency and energy security. A new road
project cofinanced with EBRD will improve connectivity
between Dushanbe, the capital city, and the Uzbekistan border.

Impact of operations. The Crisis Recovery Support
Program provided a $40 million grant in 2009-2010 to
maintain pre-crisis level budget financing for key social
expenditures. An ADB project will make power trade
possible between Tajikistan and Afghanistan.

Urban Fixes Transform Georgian Towns

Rehabilitation of dilapidated water
and road infrastructure has brought relief
for many citizens

amage caused by sewage leaking onto the street
contributed to making the 2-kilometer (km)

stretch of road in the Georgian town of Akhaltsikhe impassable, while in the nearby town of Keda,
dilapidated roads and poor drainage made transportation difficult.

ADB intervention has transformed these thoroughfares. Rehabilitation of the road and sewage pipes in
Akhaltsikhe has significantly improved living conditions
by increasing access and producing savings in fuel and
car repairs. The ADB-financed rehabilitation of about
2 km of roads in Keda under the same Municipal Sector
Development Project included replacing a muddy track
and a broken asphalt surface with a modern road and
drainage system. Today, residents have easy access to
the local hospital and kindergarten.

Meanwhile, ADB assistance has helped upgrade
roads elsewhere in Georgia. In the town of Adigeni,
for instance, the main 3 km access road was in such
bad condition that cars could hardly pass through it.
A new road, built thanks to ADB funds for municipal
infrastructure, has effectively reopened the community
to the outside world.

accessibility to neighboring countries and trade. ADB
opened the resident mission in Ashgabat in September.
Turkmenistan joined CAREC. A heads of state agreement
was signed in December for a gas pipeline into Pakistan
and India via Afghanistan. ADB is the project’s secretariat.

Impact of operations. ADB has yet to start its lending
operations in Turkmenistan.

Uzbekistan

Partnership priorities. ADB provided $655 million
in new loans and a $600 million multitranche financing
facility to support power generation, regional highway
corridors, water supply and sanitation, and access to credit
for small businesses. ADB signed agreements with local
banks to expand trade finance. ADB supported the preparation of a welfare improvement strategy for 2011-2014

  

ADB has supported infrastructure upgrades in Adigeni

In the city of Ambrolauri, the water system had
been in a state of complete dysfunction. Pipes leaked
and water was contaminated. About a third of the
people had no access to supplies while the rest were
receiving unsafe water 3 hours a day. ADB-funded
repairs have brought safe supplies to the population of about 3,200 and leaks have been minimized.
Now everyone in the city receives good quality water
14 hours a day.

 

and began work on a new country partnership strategy for
2012-2016.

Impact of operations. A $36 million loan for the Urban
Water Supply Project brought drinking water to the cities
of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi. ADB’s first project in
the Uzbekistan health sector, the Woman and Child Health
Development Project, with a $40 million loan, reduced the
national maternal mortality rate by retraining 1,600 doctors
and 20,000 nurses nationwide. The CAREC Regional

ADB's operations in East Asia are aimed at sustainable development and
inclusive growth. In the People’s Republic of China (PRC), increased lending
for energy conservation and clean energy, urban environment improvement,
and natural resource protection has achieved a greener portfolio. In Mongolia,
investments in basic infrastructure and social services are being supported.Annual Report 2010 55

 

OVERVIEW

n the PRC during the year, a strategic reorientation—

based on the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)

2008-2010—facilitated inclusive and environmentally
sustainable development with increased lending for energy
conservation and clean energy, and urban and rural development. For Mongolia, the CPS under preparation for 2011—
2015 builds on sustainable, regionally integrated growth
and inclusive social development focusing on support in
transport, energy, urban development, and social services.

In both countries, ADB continued to provide technical
assistance to increase access to financial services, support
fiscal priorities and social services, promote clean technology, facilitate trade among neighboring countries, and
enhance regional cooperation.

Total lending operations (Table 19) in the PRC consisted
of 11 sovereign loans for $1,320.88 million. Nonsovereign
approvals for the PRC totaled $586.6 million, which included
$10 million in equity investments and $320 million in
B-loans. For Mongolia, financial assistance included two
loans for $48 million and four Asian Development Fund
grants totaling $50 million, including the supplementary
funding for the Regional Road Development Project.

Mongolia also received $2.5 million from the Japan
Fund for Poverty Reduction and $2.5 million from the Asia
Pacific Disaster Response Fund to mitigate the devastating
impact of dzud, an extreme weather phenomenon. ADB
provided $34.32 million in technical assistance, including
supplementary financing, consisting of $22.17 million for
the PRC, $7.38 million for Mongolia, and $4.78 million for
regional technical assistance.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ADB continued its efforts to promote development
effectiveness and portfolio management that focuses on
results in East Asia. Project readiness was improved by
aligning ADB’s procedures with government procurement
and approval processes. The environmental and social
safeguards assurance process was enhanced to respond
more effectively to ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement.

ADB further strengthened its resident missions to
assume increased portfolio management responsibilities.
Meanwhile, within ADB, the East Asia Department
pioneered the delegation of technical assistance projects
to selected executing agencies. The portfolio continued
to perform well, with projects at risk kept below 3% of
ongoing loans. Loan contract awards and disbursement
targets were met. Efforts were made to ensure timely
closure of technical assistance projects. As of end 2010,
the portfolio included 28 ongoing grants, 16 of which were
from ADF and SF resources.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

Knowledge management is an integral part of operations
in East Asia. Priority themes for the PRC are macroeconomic management, energy efficiency and environmental

¢ ADB is helping the PRC ensure environmental
sustainability. In energy, investments in
advanced technology (Tianjin Integrated
Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant
Project) and renewable energy (Gansu Heihe
Hydropower Project) will reduce carbon dioxide
emissions and promote energy efficiency.
Natural resource management projects will
conserve one of the world’s most important
wetlands, the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands in
Heilongjiang; improve biodiversity conservation
and management in Shaanxi Qinling
Mountains; and prevent further pollution and
improve the quality of key bodies of water, such
as the Hai River and Chao Lake.

* To promote gender equality and empower
women, new economic opportunities for women
from poor ethnic minority villages are being
created through technical assistance associated
with the Yunnan Integrated Road Network
Development Project.

* The PRC has met its national goal of poverty
reduction but a large number of rural poor
are still found mainly in the inland provinces.
Agriculture projects, such as the Henan
Sustainable Agriculture and Productivity
Improvement Project, Dryland Sustainable
Agriculture Project, and Shanxi Integrated
Agricultural Development Project, will assist the
government in improving life for the rural poor.

Mongolia

* The Third Education Development Project and
Education Sector Reform Project have helped
develop an effective 12-year education system.
ADB also provided a grant for the Education for
the Poor—Financial Crisis Response Project to
help safeguard achievements, including universal
primary education.

* Several ADB projects include measures to
promote gender equality and empower women.
The Third Education Development Project
includes gender and development training for
executing/implementing agencies and local
consultants on gender sensitization in textbooks
and in curricula for training teachers.

 

 

protection, poverty reduction, and inter-provincial cooperation. In Mongolia, the focus is on inclusive economic
growth (especially increasing productivity) and poverty
reduction (including food security). Measures for quality
assurance were sustained such as screening of knowledge
proposals at entry, peer reviews, and joint programming
of knowledge products and services (KPS). Focus was on
policy advisory support to the PRC and Mongolia. The KPS
program included two policy studies for the preparation of
the PRC’s 12th Five-Year Plan, and policy research support
for the advisory team at Mongolia’s National Development
and Innovation Committee.

Under its knowledge-sharing platform, ADB set up
knowledge hubs on the urban development and transport
sectors to facilitate cooperation between the PRC and
other developing member countries. In 2010, 44 KPS were
completed. These were widely disseminated through the
annual KPS Compendium of the East Asia Department,
29 workshops, 3 book launches, and 18 international conferences. A partnership on a regional knowledge hub for
sustainable urban development was established with Tongji
University in Shanghai to improve knowledge exchange
and capacity development in response to rapid urbanization in Asia and the Pacific.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

Regional cooperation remains a key priority in the
country program strategies of the PRC and Mongolia. Trade
and economic cooperation was facilitated among countries
participating in the Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion
regional initiatives. ADB also continued to make progress
in building cross-border infrastructure and through a
transport agreement to foster trade. The implementation of
the CAREC trade facilitation program is on track. Notable
progress included strengthened customs cooperation
between Mongolia and the PRC, institution-building
through the newly established CAREC regional joint
transport and trade facilitation committee, and effective
transport corridor performance monitoring.

Partnership priorities. The current country partnership
strategy focuses on inclusive growth, environmental protection, private sector development, and regional cooperation,
while emphasizing innovation, knowledge cooperation, and
capacity development to add value and enhance development impacts. All lending and nonlending support has
been screened through the lens of environmental protection
(including climate change) and social impacts to respond
to PRC’s redoubled efforts to promote environmentally
sustainable and inclusive growth. ADB and the PRC jointly
launched the preparation of the next CPS for 2011-2015,
which will support priorities of the PRC’s 12th Five-Year Plan
that are aligned with ADB’s Strategy 2020.

Impact of operations. Further greening of the PRC
portfolio was achieved with the approval of eight sovereign
and three nonsovereign projects covering energy efficiency,
environmental improvement, and urban development. ADB
continued its strategic reorientation to facilitate inclusive and
environmentally sustainable development with increased
lending for energy conservation and clean energy, urban
development, and agriculture and rural development.

The technical assistance program supported analytical work on issues pertaining to fiscal and tax reform,
urbanization, environment, and climate change. Capacity
development was pursued through showcase workshops
that disseminated lessons learned from past and ongoing
projects, and through extensive training programs for new
counterpart agencies and project staff.

Mongolia

Partnership priorities. Following an extensive consultative process, the CPS (2011-2015) is expected to be
approved mid-2011. It is aligned with Mongolia’s National
Development Strategy and builds on two strategic pillars:58 Asian Development Bank

Grant Gives Children a Chance in Mongolia

Quick distribution of funds, textbooks, and
essential learning materials have helped poor
parents keep their children in school

the parents of Chuluun, a 9th grader in Mongolia’s
Zavkhan province, could purchase textbooks for
only three of the 18 subjects taught at a middle school.

“Last year we bought textbooks for math, Mongolian,
and English, but this year, with the prices for food
commodities and school items increasing, we are unable
to afford even three textbooks,” said Chuluun’s parents
in 2009.

School surveys revealed that textbooks were considered the most important determinant of student
performance and were the largest school expense for
most parents.

Chuluun’s story is an all-too familiar one in this part
of Asia. The poverty rate in Zavkhan, 1,000 kilometers
from Ulaanbaatar, has risen to 51%, well above the
35.2% national average. Chuluun’s parents were
worried that he might have to work as a store clerk,
cobbler, or collector of cans and plastic bottles—like
some other teenagers had—to supplement the family’s
rapidly declining real wages .

Mongolia is among the nearly one-third of developing countries in which poverty rates climbed rapidly in
the financial crisis, partly due to its reliance on volatile
mining revenues and the large percentage of existing
poor people. The crisis followed severe spikes in food
and oil prices in 2008 that triggered inflation as high as
33%. Poor households coped by cutting down on food
and, in some cases, withdrawing children from school.

Maintaining vulnerable citizens’ access to quality
education during the financial crisis became a major

E ven before the global financial crisis hit the country,

Impact of operations. ADB operations in Mongolia
contributed to restoring fiscal stability with support for
the new fiscal stability law; restoring primary education enrollment rates; improving transport connectivity;
providing access to essential municipal services in secondary cities; improving water supply infrastructure; supporting agro-enterprises; and supporting the social protection

 

challenge. However, ADB responded quickly to help
the government ease the pressure. Under a $17 million
grant from ADB to support the Education for the
Poor—Financial Crisis Response Project, about 150,000
preschoolers received free meals, about 100,000 were
allocated free secondary textbooks in school years
2009/10 and 2010/11, and over 300 schools got block
grants so parents wouldn't have to fill gaps in the
budget.

Quick disbursements addressed immediate needs,
helping reduce malnutrition among children and
prevent an increase in school dropouts.

Quick action is addressing Mongolia children’s needs

system during the financial crisis. In the health sector, ADB
assisted the preparation of draft legislation to reform the
state health insurance and helped with the introduction of a
network of primary health care providers, improvements in
the efficiency of rural health facilities and in strengthening
the governance of public hospitals.Annual Report 2010

 

Win-win as Wetlands Go Back to Nature

Efforts to revert farmland back to nature
in the PRC’s largest wetlands have raised
incomes in local communities and spread
the message that conservation is good

ong Yubo can never forget the severe drought
S= affected northeast Heilongjiang province,
home to the Sanjiang plain wetlands, in 2007.

In Jixian County, it was so dry that corn leaves could
easily be lit. “But the neighboring county, Baoging was
barely affected, because the wetlands created a small
wet climate in this area,” says 48-year-old Yubo, who
has made daily patrols for many years to help prevent
damage to the Sanjiang wetlands which at 11 million
hectares are the largest in the PRC.

Wetlands—some call them kidneys of the earth—
are natural reservoirs critical for counterbalancing
floods and droughts and, ultimately, mitigating climate
change. In the PRC, they are shrinking dramatically,
mostly because of global warming, agricultural development, and exploitation of rivers. According to the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, nearly 30% of the PRC’s
wetlands vanished between 1990 and 2000, with huge
losses in the Sanjiang plains.

 

Today in the People’s Republic of China, wetlands are being protected

Guided by the National Wetland Conservation
Action Plan, Heilongjiang issued the PRC’s first wetland
regulations in 2003. Wetland restoration was then a
new concept in the PRC. But from 2005, the Sanjiang
Plain Wetlands Protection Project helped entrench the
practice and integrate efforts to improve the wellbeing of local communities with conservation plans.

ADB supported the project with a $15 million loan
and assisted Heilongjiang in obtaining a $12.14 million
grant from the Global Environment Facility.

As farmland was being restored to wetland, several
models for creating new ecologically sustainable livelihoods, such as the introduction of greenhouse farming
and clean-energy biomass plants, were implemented,
boosting farmers’ profits. Meantime, ecotourism
projects are also producing income and raising awareness in local communities of the role they can play in
protecting an important natural resource.

Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Guangdong,
Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia have followed
Heilongjiang’s example. By 2010, the PRC had placed
18 million hectares of natural wetland—almost half
the wetlands area in the country—under protection
and established 550 reserves holding over 2.7 trillion
tons of fresh water.CHAPTER 9

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS

The Cook Islands

Partnership priorities. ADB has aligned its country
partnership strategy with Te Kavenga Nui, the National
Sustainable Development Plan (2007-2010), by focusing
on environmentally sustainable economic development.
The intended country partnership strategy outcomes are
improved economic and social infrastructure, and better
public sector service delivery.

Impact of operations. An ADB technical assistance is
supporting the government in implementing the infrastructure
governance framework to improve delivery of infrastructure services to the whole country. The design for the Avatiu
Port Development Project was completed and the contract
awarded in 2010. Through the Economic Recovery Support
Program, ADB supported structural and governance improvements and maintenance of fiscal responsibility, while plans to
boost economic activity through increased government capital
works in the water sector will commence soon, maintaining
the delivery of essential public services to the poor and
vulnerable. Regional technical assistances have enabled the
Cook Islands to strengthen its financial management capabilities through the development of the Financial Management
Model and improved internal auditing.

Fiji

Partnership priorities. All ADB operations are guided
by the April 2007 Approach to Reengagement. Ongoing
projects are in roads, water supply, and emergency response.

 

Progress of the MDGs in the Pacific

¢ With the Secretariat of the Pacific Community
and other development partners, ADB has helped
the Pacific developing member countries manage
progress toward achievement of the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Household income and
expenditure surveys and demographic and health
surveys across the Pacific have helped policy makers
monitor achievement of the MDGs. The survey
reports also provided key policy guidance on how to
improve the health and well-being of the islanders
and particularly of the most vulnerable.

¢ In Timor-Leste, ADB has contributed to MDG7
by rehabilitating (i) Dili’s water supply system
and improving the access of approximately
35,000 people to 24-hour water supply services;
and (ii) two towns’ water supply systems and
improving the access of up to 30,000 people
to water and sanitation services. For MDG1,
ADB has contributed by increasing job
opportunities for approximately 4,000 people
in fish farming and small-scale dam
construction and maintenance.

¢ In Tonga, ADB is contributing to MDG7
by improving the quality of urban water,
sanitation, and drainage systems in Nuku’alofa
and improving the access of approximately
35,000 people to such services.

¢ In Samoa, ADB is contributing to MDG7 by
(i) establishing the first sewage system and
wastewater treatment plant serving Apia’s
central business district and improving
flood mitigation and drainage in Apia,
a city of approximately 60,000 people;
and (ii) supporting the implementation
of the water supply, sanitation, and drainage
master plan for Apia and improving residents’
access to such services. For MDG1, ADB
is providing subsidized on-site sanitation
solutions to approximately 1,000 low-income
households.

* HIV prevalence, however, remains a problem
in Papua New Guinea and here ADB is also
providing assistance.

 

 

 

Impact of operations. The Suva—Nausori Water Supply and
Sewerage Project continued to improve service provision.
In an effort to reduce losses from water leakage, 56 kilometers (km) of mains, 8,000 service connections, and 10,000
water meters have been either repaired or replaced.Annual Report 2010 = 65

Kiribati

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
for 2010-2014 between ADB and the government
supports improved public financial management and
improved delivery of sustainable infrastructure services.

Impact of operations. Technical assistance is building
capacity to improve the management and performance of
public enterprises, and enhance fiscal planning through the
adoption of the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. This is
helping improve the delivery of public services to over
42% of the population. Project assistance will rehabilitate
and upgrade the road network from the airport through the
administrative capital of Bairiki and to the port of Betio.

The Marshall Islands

Partnership priorities. The government cleared its loan
arrears with ADB in March 2009 and has maintained
subsequent repayments. The approved country operations
business plan 2010-2012 includes one program loan, and
technical assistance projects to support macroeconomic
and fiscal management, development of the private sector

and human capacity, and environment protection and
climate change mitigation.

Impact of operations. An ADB program loan supported
the Marshalls Energy Company with its recovery plan
by repaying a high-interest loan with a commercial bank.
This gave the company fiscal breathing space to carry out
much-needed repairs and maintenance, thereby maintaining
and improving electricity services to the majority of
households on the main island of Majuro. ADB provided
financial and technical support for a development partners’
meeting in December 2010.

The Federated States of Micronesia

Partnership priorities. Economic management and
accountability, including public sector capacity building,
and community consultation and participation programs
to promote public sector reform, remained priorities. ADB
increased dialogue at the federal and state levels to strengthen
the focus on infrastructure, for energy and renewable energy
in particular, in the states of Yap and Chuuk. The approved
country operations business plan 2011-2013 includes a loan

to support energy sector development in those states and66 Asian Development Bank

technical assistance for capacity building, while continuing
to enhance policy dialogue.

Impact of operations. The Omnibus Infrastructure
Development Project helped to restore critical water
supply, sanitation, and power infrastructure. Technical
assistance in support of improved economic management and accountability provided training to Finance
Department staff in all four states, strengthening the government’s ability to manage its financial and budgetary
performance. As a result of technical assistance, the Chuuk
Department of Education is leading all stakeholders in a
concerted program to reform the state’s education system.
Consultation and participation in support of public sector
and education reforms have included community groups
and school children on the island of Weno.

Nauru

Partnership priorities. After its reengagement in May
2008, ADB stepped up activities in improving infrastructure
and public sector management, areas closely aligned with
the updated National Sustainable Development Strategy.

Impact of operations. The technical assistance program
strengthened the government’s ability to manage its financial
and budgetary performance, improve the service delivery of
state-owned enterprises, and prioritize infrastructure needs.

Impact of operations. Technical assistance helped Palau
introduce a health insurance and medical savings plan. This
has improved health services delivery. Technical assistance
has also built capacity in ministries’ budget plans and
financial management to implement the country’s
development strategy. This has helped the government

deliver services to its people more efficiently.
Papua New Guinea

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy for
2011-2015 is aligned with the government’s Development
Strategic Plan 2010-2030 and will scale up support for infrastructure, including in the power sector, as well as expanding
operations in health and microfinance. A commitment to
improving public financial management remains in place.

Impact of operations. During 2010, ADB financed the
rehabilitation and upgrade of 117 km of main roads in
the Highlands region. It is estimated that approximately
400,000 people have benefited from reduced travel time
from their communities to markets, schools, and health facilities. An innovative and successful ADB-supported health
project continued to support private sector participation in68 Asian Development Bank

In Samoa, a $28 million ADB loan is helping the nation recover from the financial crisis and 2009 tsunami

delivering rural health services, including HIV prevention
and control. Over 100 rural health facilities have been
improved (40 with HIV testing facilities) and more than
50 health workers trained in 2010. This has enabled the
number of patients accessing primary health care services
to be significantly increased. The incidence of new HIV
cases among pregnant women has also fallen by 0.85% in
2007 and 0.54% in 2010.

Samoa

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership strategy is aligned with the Strategy for the Development of
Samoa 2008-2012. This includes support for improved
public services delivery, the removal of infrastructure
constraints, and promotion of private sector development.

Impact of operations. In 2010, ADB approved the
Economic Recovery Support Program loan of $16 million
to help Samoa recover from the combined impact of the
global financial crisis and the September 2009 tsunami.
The program will protect vulnerable groups, including
women and the unemployed, by maintaining social services
expenditure. The government is continuing with structural
and public financial management reforms. Despite heavy
rainfall in 2010, Apia did not experience the usual flooding
thanks to the drainage work undertaken as part of the Sanitation and Drainage Project. This supported the installation of
100 septic tanks, as well as connecting over 100 central Apia
customers to a new pressure sewer system.

Solomon Islands

Partnership priorities. The interim Country Partnership
Strategy 2009-2011 continued to focus on improving
transport infrastructure and private sector development.

Impact of operations. Rehabilitation work under the
emergency assistance program (in response to the 2007
earthquake and tsunami) progressed well in Gizo and the
affected areas in Western Province and Choiseul. A
franchise shipping project started, and the Solomon Islands
Maritime Safety Administration became operational.
National Transport Fund regulations were gazetted and
civil works started on Makira under the Solomon Islands
Road Improvement Project. ADB continued to help the
government implement company laws and established the
new companies registry.

Timor-Leste

Partnership priorities. ADB priorities include infrastructure, access to finance, public administration, and ongoing
support for cross-border linkages between Timor-Leste
and Indonesia. Technical assistance was also approved for
an aid information management system and the facilitation
of major infrastructure projects.

Impact of operations. An overseas scholarship program
was initiated for staff of the Ministry of Infrastructure as
part of the 4-year, $18 million technical assistance for70 Asian Development Bank

 

Boost for Banking in Timor-Leste

ADB is helping Instituigao de Microfinancas
de Timor-Leste become the country’s first
locally owned commercial bank

hen Clemento de Araujo started his carpentry
VV joinery business in 2002, he had only $500

in savings. A loan from Instituigao de Microfinangas de Timor-Leste (IMfTL) proved to be the catalyst he
needed to make his enterprise a success.

Today, the business boasts Australian-made electric saws
and other high-powered machines, with six workers, four
full-time and two part-time.

“Running my own business is far better than...working
for others,” 40-year-old de Araujo, a former hotel janitor,
says through his interpreter, Isaias Pereira Nunes, a field staff
officer for IMfTL.

IMfTL was established in 2001 under the ADBmanaged Microfinance Development Project. In December
2008, ownership was transferred to the Government of
Timor-Leste, which is currently upgrading its status from a
quasi bank to a full commercial bank. This will make IMfTL
the first locally owned bank in Timor-Leste.

After 2 years of independence from donors, IMTL is in
a sound financial position, says Pat Lisk, the consultant who
produced the organization’s business plan. The value of
loans at the end of June 2010 was $6.5 million, and deposits
totaled about $3.4 million.

step toward becoming the first locally owned commercial
bank. (See “Boost for Banking in Timor-Leste” above.)
Preparations continued for the rehabilitation of more than
200 km of national roads and water supply infrastructure in
the capital, Dili, with civil works scheduled to start in 2011.

Tonga

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership strategy
focuses on poverty reduction through integrated urban
infrastructure development, prudent macroeconomic and
fiscal management, and the development of the private
sector. The country partnership strategy remains relevant to
the objectives of the National Strategic Planning Framework.

 

Women’s groups are well represented among
borrowers. Virgia da Costa still remembers her first
$50 loan in 2004 from a women’s savings group
that funded her grocery shop at Becora village on the
outskirts of Dili. “It was from the savings group that |
learnt of IMfTL's microloan scheme,” she says. Da Costa
and her husband, Juvinal de Jesus, were then able to get
an IMfTL loan to expand the business.

In 2010, the couple moved their store from rented
space into a newly constructed and self-financed building.
The shop has spacious storage.

“If it wasn’t for my wife, | would not have known of the
assistance IMfTL offers small business people like us,” says
de Jesus. “Now we're able to pay for our seven children’s
education, and we're thinking of expanding our business
into a mini-supermarket.”

This factory is expanding, thanks to an IMfTL loan

Impact of operations. ADB’s Integrated Urban Development Project contributed to improving the environment
through provision ofjet/vacuum and street sweeper trucks to
clear drainages and clean streets around Nuku’alofa. Work
to widen roads and construct drainages and footpaths has
started, which will benefit about 32% of the population
living in Nukw’alofa and other project areas. The $5 million
first tranche of the Economic Support Program grant was
disbursed in 2010 and helped the government maintain
a good standard of social services to primary education
and health in response to the global economic crisis. ADB
continues to support economic management through
technical assistance to strengthen policy and planning, as
well as supporting the budget process through developing
a medium-term budget framework.Annual Report 2010 71

 

Backyard Stash Gives Way to Cash in the Bank

ADB has helped Vanuatu’s national bank bring
services and credit to remote communities

fter operating his grocery business on the southern
Aw island of Tanna for a year, Harry Nikiau
needed a loan but didn’t rate his chances.

“| had just opened my retail shop,” says Nikiau. “I didn’t
have a lot of assets to show as collateral.”

Fortunately for Nikiau, he was able to get help from the
National Bank of Vanuatu (NBV), which was expanding its
microfinance services in remote islands, and took his first
loan in 1993.

Borrowers like Nikiau are steps ahead of many who—
confronted with the scarcity of local banks and vast
distances to branches—often resort to depositing money
in empty tins of Milo, a chocolate flavored health drink,
which they bury near their houses.

Photos of money damaged from Milo tin deposits
were published in a manual for a financial literacy
program launched by NBV in May 2010. An education
program, sponsored by ADB and the Commonwealth
Secretariat, is teaching people to use better business and
banking practices.

“There seems to be a lot of appreciation for the banking
advice and education we offer,” says John Aruhuri, head of
rural banking for NBV. “People now understand the logic
of saving, and that in order to access credit, one has to first
open a bank account.”

Tuvalu

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership strategy
is aligned with Tuvalu’s National Strategy for Sustainable
Development 2005-2015. The country partnership strategy
is focused on strengthening public financial management
and supporting reforms of public enterprises.

Impact of operations. In 2010, ADB continued to provide
technical assistance in public financial management and
public enterprises reforms to help the government respond
to the global economic crisis. This focus will also ensure
that policy makers are better able to respond to future
external shocks.

ADB granted $600,000 to the Government of Vanuatu
to improve rural people’s access to financial services. The
grant, which forms part of NBV’s overall rural outreach
effort, is an extension of a successful project that expanded
rural and microfinance services in the island nation from
2004 to 2006. NBV is establishing more branches and has
154 microfinance officers working across Vanuatu.

In 2008, ADB funding also helped NBV introduce
a mobile-phone banking system for rural communities
beyond the reach of NBV branches.

Stretching NBV’s net across the archipelago to give
more people access to the financial system is a challenge
that Aruhuri says ADB helped resolve. And Milo-tin deposits
may soon be a thing of the past.

Vanuatu

Partnership priorities. The Country Partnership Strategy
2010-2014 focuses on transport, urban development, and
energy. It aims to strengthen the private sector through an
improved regulatory environment, better access to finance,
and the reform of state-owned enterprises.

Impact of operations. ADB continued to improve
access to financial services by increasing rural access to
finance, strengthening the Financial Services Commission’s institutional framework, reforming company and
bankruptcy laws, modernizing the registry of companies,
and establishing a framework for secured transactions.SO | | | H AS lA Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,

and by greater emphasis on gender and private sector participation. In addition,

 

B implemented important initiatives that boosted regional cooperation.Annual Report 2010 73

 

OVERVIEW

he South Asia Department delivered an innova
tive, strategic, and substantive assistance program

targeted at the most critical development challenges
of developing member countries.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Loan disbursement totaled $2.62 billion in 2010 while
contract awards and commitments reached $2.68 billion.

 

HIGHLIGHTS

* Delivery of innovative schemes continued
through projects such as the highly complex
Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project to build
Bangladesh's longest bridge, a sustainable
urban transport project in the Nepalese capital
Kathmandu, and projects to improve energy
efficiency in India and bring renewable energy
to rural areas in Bhutan. Projects in Sri Lanka
helped advance the reconstruction of north and
eastern provinces

* Continued attention in project design was paid
to climate-change impacts and the fostering of
green growth. The Climate Investment Funds
endorsed the Bangladesh Strategic Program for
Climate Resilience with $110 million allocated
for climate-resilient development, which is the
first such program in the world

¢ Under the South Asia Subregional Economic
Cooperation framework, the approval of the
India-Bangladesh energy project accelerated
regional cooperation and integration

* Significant enhancements were made to gender
mainstreaming and cofinancing in South Asia
Department projects

¢ Substantial contributions were made to
enhance opportunities for private investment
in the subregion’s fast-growing market
economies; and continued promotion of private
sector development was achieved by efforts to
build capacity, set up institutional frameworks,
and make use of public-private partnerships

 

 

 

 

Progress of the MDGs
in South Asia

* South Asia has made good progress on seven
indicators of Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), namely, indicators on gender equality,
HIV prevalence, tuberculosis prevalence,
forest cover, protected areas, ozone-depleting
substance consumption, and safe drinking water.

* Performance in primary school enrollment
has improved, and India, the Maldives, and
Sri Lanka are on track or likely to exceed the
MDGs. However, much remains to be done
in other South Asian countries, particularly in
relation to primary education cycle completion.

* In Bangladesh, ADB is helping revitalize
education through the Second Primary Education
Development Program (PEDP II), which began
in 2003. The program's thrust is to address
shortcomings that lead to poor achievement and
high dropout rates. A follow-on to PEDP Il, the
Third Primary Education Development Project, is
at an advanced stage of preparation to support
reduced disparities, higher cycle completion, and
better student achievement.

¢ In Nepal, ADB’s support for the Education for All
program helped bring significant improvements
in quality and access to basic education. Net
enrollment rate in primary education increased
from 72.4% in 2004 to 93.7% in 2009. School
facilities have been continuously upgraded since
2001, and the percentage of trained teachers
has increased almost threefold.

* Providing sustainable access to safe drinking
water and basic sanitation continues to be
important for ADB's operation in South Asia.

In Bangladesh, the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural
Development Project provided 180 villagers
with tap water. In Nepal, the Small Towns Water
Supply and Sanitation Sector Project brought

a clean, 24-hour supply of drinking water to
nearly 2,000 households. In Sri Lanka, the Third
Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project gave
1.4 million people better services.

In August 2010, ADB approved the Bangladesh—India
Electrical Grid Interconnection Project. This will establish
a cross-border link between the western electrical grid of
Bangladesh and the eastern grid of India for the exchange
of power.

Toward the end of 2010, ADB convened a regional
meeting in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on Transport Connectivity
in Northeastern South Asia. This provided a forum for
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal to exchange views
on regional transport connectivity. The vision for meetings
such as this is to help the continued expansion of South
Asian markets and to increase opportunities for development that leads to balanced regional growth and poverty
reduction.Annual Report 2010

COUNTRY HIGHLIGHTS
Bangladesh

Partnership priorities. Under its program for 2011-2013,
ADB will strengthen its focus on economic growth that is
inclusive and environmentally sustainable, and on regional
cooperation and integration. Efforts to deepen private
sector operations and to promote public-private partnerships in key infrastructure sectors will be pursued. In 2010,
ADB also initiated preparation of the country partnership
strategy for 2011-2015.

Ten loans totaling $1.25 billion were approved in
2010. In partnership with the World Bank, ADB secured
$110 million from the Climate Investment Funds for the
country’s climate-resilient development. ADB’s partnership with the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Islamic Development Bank is helping
mobilize substantial resources needed for building the
Padma Multipurpose Bridge.

Impact of operations. Under the ADB-assisted Teaching
Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project, as
of June 2010, 295,000 teachers were trained using modern
classroom teaching techniques. The Gas Transmission and
Development Project is building a 353-kilometer (km) gas
pipeline to take about 360 million cubic feet of natural gas

per day to the country’s less developed western region. The
Road Maintenance and Improvement Project contributed
to cutting bottlenecks on the strategically important south—
east road corridor and connected rural people to the port
city of Chittagong.

Bhutan

Partnership priorities. The Country Partnership Strategy,
2006-2010, continued to guide ADB’s operations for the
remainder of the Government of Bhutan’s Tenth Five-Year
Plan, covering 2008-2013. It aims to promote broad-based
economic growth, inclusive social development, and good
governance through improvements in transport and energy,
and the development of urban areas and the finance and
private sectors. The country assistance program evaluation
(2010) confirmed the close alignment of the partnership
strategy with ADB’s Strategy 2020 and the government’s
current 5-year plan.

Impact of operations. The introduction of electricity in
rural areas through a series of projects helped thousands
of people and micro industries and also made education
more accessible. The Road Network Project increased
passenger and freight transport by connecting the main
east-west highway at Trongsa to the Indian border at78 Asian Development Bank

 

Gelephu, and expanded accessibility in rural areas. The
Financial Sector Development Program helped Bhutan’s
Royal Monetary Authority to strengthen its capacity,
particularly in licensing new banks. This led to improvements in services, including the quality of customer service, offered by banks. Under a Japan Fund for Poverty
Reduction grant, ADB helped restore earthquake-damaged
schools in eastern Bhutan.

India

Partnership priorities. As emphasized in the Country
Partnership Strategy 2009-2011, ADB continued to
support India’s efforts in making growth inclusive and
environmentally sustainable. The India program set new
highs in loan approvals and portfolio performance in 2010.
Loan approval exceeded $2 billion not including nonsovereign operations while contract awards and disbursements reached record levels of $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion,
respectively. A number of projects approved in 2010
showcased innovative approaches, such as incorporating
private—public partnership elements into project design,
and focusing on new and challenging sectors, such as
agribusiness infrastructure, coastal zone management,
flood control and protecting rivers from erosion, support
for microenterprises, and tourism development. ADB
continues to support India in addressing climate change
issues. Work to achieve this has included the preparation
of strategies to mainstream adaptation concerns in the
management of the Cauvery, Chambal, and Satluj river
sub-basins; support for integrated water resources
management in states, such as Himachal Pradesh and
Karnataka; and improvements to coastal zone management in a number of states. Technical assistance is being
provided to the Ministry of Water Resources to operationalize key priorities of the National Water Mission. ADB is
also increasing support for the development of renewable
energy, including solar power, to help India move along a
low-carbon growth path.

Impact of operations. Through the Rural Roads Sector I
Project (2003-2009), ADB supported construction of
9,757 km of all-weather roads connecting rural areas in
Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Better connectivity
has helped to create employment opportunities. It has also

been associated with improvement in indicators, such as
maternal and infant deaths, and primary school attendance.
The Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Project
(2001-2007) helped to establish the State Electricity
Regulatory Commission and restructure the State Electricity
Board into six companies according to their function. ADB
also funded construction of several transmission lines and
substations, which has led to a substantial reduction in
transmission losses.

Through the Karnataka Urban Development and
Coastal Environmental Management Project (1999-2009),
ADB helped to increase drinking water supplies, expand
the drainage network, build quality sewage treatment
plants, and improve basic urban facilities and services in
10 coastal towns. It also supported capacity building to
improve transparency and accountability in 47 towns of
Karnataka. The Assam Governance and Public Resource
Management Sector Development Program (2004-2007)
helped the state turn a $288 million fiscal deficit in 2003/04
into a $311 million surplus by 2008/09.

The Maldives

Partnership priorities. Under the Country Partnership
Strategy 2007-2011, ADB operations focus on increasing human resources capacity, strengthening economic
management, improving development effectiveness, and
assisting private sector development through public—
private partnerships. Special areas of focus in the second
half of the strategy period were small and medium
enterprise development, energy, and the transport sector.
Under the Economic Recovery Program loan, ADB is
helping macroeconomic

the government implement

structural reforms.

Impact of operations. The Outer Island Electrification
Project provided 19 islands with power supplies, and the
Information Technology Development Project improved
access to information in remote atolls. The ongoing
Regional Development Project (Phase IL) will improve
water supply, sanitation services, and solid waste management in three islands, while the Domestic Maritime
Transport Project will improve connectivity. A Private
Sector Development technical assistance loan helped
expand micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.Annual Report 2010 79

 

 

ADB-supported programs are generating fresh opportunities for Nepalese people

Implementation of the Economic Recovery Program and
technical assistance approved in December 2009 facilitates
reforms to correct underlying economic distortions and
put the economy on a footing to sustainable medium-term
growth and reducing its vulnerability to external shocks.

Nepal

Partnership priorities. Nepal is in the midst of a historic
transformation. While this poses an opportunity for the
country to redefine its future, it continues to face longstanding development challenges. The thrust of ADB’s
Country Partnership Strategy 2010-2012 is to help Nepal
sustain hard-won gains of its peace process by promoting
broad-based
development, improved governance and institutional ca
inclusive economic growth and social
pacity, as well as climate change adaptation and environmental sustainability. The country partnership strategy is
supporting the country’s peace and development aspirations by mainstreaming peace-building in all ADB interventions and is implementing disaster risk management

and climate change checklists, as well as governance risk
assessments. ADB has also been leading efforts to ensure
that education sector reforms address resilience to disasters, such as earthquakes and floods.

Joint initiatives by ADB and the World Bank helped
improve and modernize the country’s procurement systems,
policies, and practices. ADB and other development partners
also helped find practical ways of mainstreaming climate
resilience into core development planning and budgeting.
In 2010, ADB approved eight projects amounting to
$262.5 million in loans and grants. It also approved
18 technical assistance grants for $10.42 million. About
$19.52 million cofinancing was approved to support
projects on urban transport and the urban environment.

Impact of operations. ADB is one of nine partners that
have helped implement the government’s Education for All
program. The program has brought education to those who
have traditionally enjoyed fewer opportunities for schooling,
including girls, low-caste Dalit children, and members of
Nepal’s indigenous communities and religious minorities.80 Asian Development Bank

 

ADB’s support to the water supply and sanitation sector helped expand coverage of improved water supply and
sanitation facilities and raise health and hygiene practices
to eradicate waterborne and sanitation-related diseases.
The Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector
Project provided safe water to 510,000 people in 29 towns,
significantly reducing health risks.

Sri Lanka

Partnership priorities. In line with the Country Partnership Strategy for 2009-2011, ADB projects supported
improvements to fiscal management, roads and transport,

and water supplies. Most of ADB’s assistance in 2010 was
directed at the Northern Province, including $150 million
in emergency assistance for reconstruction. ADB also
provided $12.8 million in supplementary funding for the
North East Community Restoration and Development
Project Il.

ADB provided two loans to projects in the north:
$154 million for the Northern Road Connectivity Project
and $90 million for the Jaffna Water Supply and Sanitation
Project. A $50 million loan was approved in 2010 for the
Fiscal Management Efficiency Project, which will build on
earlier assistance to support fiscal management throughout
Sri Lanka.

Home Work Options Revolutionize

Women’s Lives

An ADB-supported project is giving villagers
in Sri Lanka’s eastern coastal communities
opportunities to move beyond a past ravaged
by war and calamity

hen Packeer Mohamed Khadeeja contemplatVAVE: returning for her eighth tour of duty as a

domestic worker in Qatar, a chance discussion
about cheap loans and skills training provided by a microcredit project changed her life.

“It's the best move | made,” says Khadeeja, 49,
of her decision to take a loan and stay at her home in
Kattankudy, in the Batticaloa district of Sri Lanka’s formerly war-affected east. “The project helped change my
plans. It’s a great opportunity.”

Microfinance and skills training provided by the ADBsupported North East Coastal Community Development
Project since 2005 have given women like Khadeeja more
choice to stay home. Of Sri Lanka’s 20 million people,
more than 1.5 million work in the Middle East. Some
50%-60% are women, mostly from rural communities,
employed in menial jobs.

“This microcredit program has brought major change
to our village,” says Jesmine Zubair, treasurer of a women’‘s rural development society that manages loans in
Batticaloa. Fewer women are now going abroad, she
says, because they are increasingly able to earn a living
at home.

The project caters to all Sri Lanka’s main communities—Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims—and is focused
on eastern districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and

Ampara, where decades of conflict and the 2004
tsunami destroyed infrastructure, reduced livelihoods to
a bare minimum, and resulted in many households being
headed by women. The community development project
aims to meet basic needs. Some of the funding is helping
to restore livelihoods in fishing and farming.

The $28.4 million project, which closed in November,
was run in tandem with another project that is continuing
the government's rehabilitation program in northern and
eastern provinces affected by the three decades of civil
conflict that ended in 2009.

Microcredit has helped transform many coastal
communities, with $2.4 million in loans distributed since
2005 to help Sri Lankans, particularly women who head
households, improve their livelihoods.

A Vital Conduit for Knowledge

ADB plays a growing role in South Asia as a
network for enabling knowledge generation
and disseminating research findings and
on-the-ground experiences that can be used
to solve development challenges

DB's network serves as a vital link for research
Ave and think tanks in South Asia, enabling

knowledge gained from experience in countryspecific and regional settings to be spread widely.

One example of such knowledge-sharing work is
Regional Technical Assistance (RETA) 6417: Supporting
Network of Research Institutes and Think Tanks in South
Asia. The RETA program aims to promote regional economic cooperation and integration by enabling knowledge
on contemporary policy issues to be generated and
shared.

This is done by creating strong networks among
research institutes in ADB’s developing member countries
in South Asia, and facilitating dynamic interaction
between them through studies, workshops, and the
dissemination of information. By encouraging the
exchange of information between academia and key
policy makers, the RETA supports faster transmission of
research to policy application.

Through two research networks, the South Asia
Center for Policy Studies and the South Asia Network of
Economic Research Institutes, research proposals are submitted by member institutes and evaluated by a steering

Impact of operations. ADB continued to provide assistance
in Sri Lanka’s road sector development. ADB also gave
livelihood grants to more than 30,000 resettled families
in the northern and eastern parts of the country. This was
administered through the North East Community Restoration
and Development Project I and financed by the Australian

committee, constituted under the RETA, that decides
whether they can be funded.

To date, 10 research institutes in four countries—
Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka—have participated in the RETA. Sixteen studies have been approved
for financing, covering one of three themes: (i) Trade and
Investment/Technology, (ii) Human Dimension of Regional
Cooperation, and (iii) Economic and Social Impact of the
Financial Crisis.

Seven studies reached the targeted audience when
they were presented to the Second and Third South Asia
Economic Summits, held in December of 2009 and 2010.

 

Research studies financed by ADB were discussed at the Second
South Asia Economic Summit

Agency for International Development. ADB’s assistance
in the installation of medium voltage and rural electrification schemes, expedited through the Conflict-Affected
Areas Rebuilding Project, benefited over 27,000 households.
Through a technical assistance, ADB helped draft the
National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy for Sri Lanka.CHAPTER 11

Transport and energy connectivity for inclusive growth, financial and capital
market integration, water supply and sanitation, improved education,

and environmental sustainability are areas of focus for ADB in Southeast Asia.
ADB provided significant inputs to an Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) master plan on connectivity launched in October, while preparations
began for anew memorandum of understanding for 2011-2015 with the
ASEAN Secretariat.Annual Report 2010 = 83

 

OVERVIEW

DB operations in Southeast Asia emphasized innovation, an intensified focus on achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
and implementation toward the greatest possible impact.
Lending through public sector nonsovereign operations
and public-private partnerships was innovative. The design
of a social protection project in the Philippines aimed at
helping the nation’s poorest families also broke new ground.
Assistance increasingly turned to core areas of operation under ADB’s Strategy 2020 and to the achievement of
country priorities that contributed to making progress on
MDGs. Partnership with non-borrowing and middle-income
countries in the subregion was strengthened, and a strengthening of relationships with development partners resulted in
the significant mobilization of cofinancing. ADB saw record
high financing for a single project amounting to $50 million,
contributed by the European Union and the Government of
Australia, to facilitate analytical work and capacity development toward modernizing the education system in Indonesia.
The portfolio continued to achieve satisfactory ratings
as a result of timely action on project implementation
issues, and efficiency measures, such as the use of readiness filters. Knowledge work at various stages of operations was systemized to promote learning and innovation.

REGIONAL COOPERATION

ADB and the ASEAN Secretariat started preparations for a
new memorandum of understanding for 2011-2015 on their
partnership framework, focusing on connectivity, the integration of financial and capital markets, and environmental
sustainability. ADB provided inputs to the Master Plan on
ASEAN Connectivity launched during the 17th ASEAN
Summit in October in Ha Noi, Viet Nam, and was featured
in the master plan as the main development institution
supporting subregional programs in Southeast Asia. ADB
accelerated consultations with ASEAN member states on
the establishment of an ASEAN Infrastructure Fund.

ADB continued supporting connectivity enhancement in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) through
projects to complete the transport base of economic
corridors and by developing the Strategic Framework for

 

HIGHLIGHTS

* Sovereign and nonsovereign and grants reached
$3.5 billion; technical assistance projects
amounted to $35.9 million, 55% of which
sought capacity development and provision
of policy and advisory services at the country
and regional levels; and cofinancing for loans,
grants, and technical assistance projects sharply
increased to $365 million.

* Country partnership strategies for Cambodia,
Indonesia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
the Philippines, and Viet Nam were under
preparation to further align the project pipeline
with Strategy 2020 and national priorities and
to better monitor contributions to ADB’s Results
Framework and the Millennium Development
Goals. A new partnership framework with Malaysia
and with the ASEAN Secretariat was under
preparation.

* Subregional cooperation and integration in the
Greater Mekong Subregion, Brunei Darussalam—
Indonesia—Malaysia—Philippines East ASEAN
Growth Area, and Indonesia—Malaysia—Thailand
Growth Triangle was further strengthened to
support connectivity and trade, making the
countries more competitive. ADB facilitated
project development and progress toward the
establishment of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund.

* Project processing and implementation
continued to be strengthened. The use of project
readiness filters increased to ensure quality at
entry, and an internal quality control system to
improve design and monitoring frameworks
and measures to improve institutional efficiency
were put in place. Portfolio performance was
monitored closely.

* Dissemination of knowledge products and
services generated from operations was
systemized—as was access to them—to allow
for effective use by ADB and its clients.

Progress of the MDGs in Southeast Asia

* Cambodia. ADB is helping achieve Cambodia's
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets in water
and sanitation to increase service coverage of the rural
population, where only 42% had an improved source
of drinking water and less than 23% had access to
latrines in 2008. The Tonle Sap Rural Water Supply
and Sanitation Sector Project has provided about
half a million people access to an improved source
of drinking water and nearly a quarter of a million
access to durable and hygienic latrines. Through the
second phase of the project approved in 2009, a
further 370,000 people will gain access to safe water
and 290,000 will have improved sanitation by 2015.
An integrated approach to water and sanitation will
positively impact on public health.

¢ Indonesia. ADB is supporting government efforts
to accelerate achievement of the MDGs through
several projects. Progress on the MDG on safe
drinking water and basic sanitation is being made
through (i) the Community Water Services and
Health Project, which is increasing access to safe
water supply in rural areas; (ii) the Metropolitan
Sanitation Management and Health Project, which
will improve city sewerage systems and hygiene in
poor neighborhoods of Medan and Yogyakarta; and
(iii) the Urban Sanitation and Rural Infrastructure
Support to the National Program for Community
Empowerment (PNPM) Mandiri Project, set for
approval in 2011, which will aim to bring better
access to sanitation facilities for the poor. The
Decentralized Health Services Project improved the
provision of mother and child health care.

* The Lao People’s Democratic Republic. ADB's
assistance contributed to reaching the MDG target
in primary education. The Basic Education (Girls)

 

Project increased enrollment rates, especially among
girls, through the building of classrooms, provision
of grants to school children, and the recruitment
and training of teachers who were deployed in
remote and ethnic areas, and by promoting parents’
awareness on the importance of education. The
Second Education Quality Improvement Project

also expanded access to education through the
establishment of more than 400 schools and school
cluster resource centers and by training more than
13,000 teachers.

* The Philippines. The Philippines’ midterm progress
on the MDGs shows a mixed picture. Substantial
ground was covered in promoting gender equality
but the target on poverty and hunger is unlikely to
be achieved by 2015. ADB approved a $400 million
loan to support expansion of the Philippines’
conditional cash transfer program. The project
provides direct financial support to 582,000 of the
poorest families on the condition that they keep
their children in school and ensure that children and
pregnant women get regular health checkups in
return for the cash grants.

* Viet Nam. The country’s success in reducing
poverty continues, from 58.1% of the population
in 1993 to 14.5% in 2008. It is an early achiever
in halving extreme poverty as measured by the
number of people living on $1.25 or less a day.
ADB has contributed to this progress through
lending and non-lending operations, policy advice,
and knowledge products that are improving
infrastructure, accelerating rural development,
providing better and more accessible education and
health services, reforming the finance sector, and
strengthening public administration.

 

 

also got under way. These strategic products were taken
up at the 16th GMS Ministerial Conference in August in
Ha Noi, Viet Nam. Initiatives to further improve coordination with development partners were also continued.

The Brunei Darussalam—Indonesia—Malaysia—Philippines
East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP—EAGA) made significant
progress on project development. With continued relevance of
the BIMP—EAGA Roadmap to Development, 2006-2010, the
countries agreed to formulate an implementation blueprint for
the next 5 years to realize the subregion’s strategic goals.

Leaders of the Indonesia—Malaysia—Thailand Growth
Triangle (IMT—GT) countries endorsed 10 priority connectivity projects worth $5.2 billion, which ADB helped

identify. A midterm review of the IMT—GT Roadmap
2007-2011 and its business processes was completed.

KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

ADB’s Southeast Asia Department (SERD) introduced
a knowledge management framework and action plan to
rationalize and systemize its knowledge work. The framework recognizes the significant development knowledge
work under way within its current cycle of operations. This
includes more detailed country and sector analyses required
to identify development needs and strategies; knowledgeAnnual Report 2010

Impact of operations. Following ADB’s first reimbursable technical assistance to support the establishment of
a strategy and action plan to develop the country’s capital
market, a follow-on technical assistance on public financial
management (also on a reimbursable basis) was approved
to enhance skills in fiscal management and improve the
efficiency of government spending.

Cambodia

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country operations business
plan, 2010-2013, was fully aligned with the government’s
National Strategic Development Plan Update 2009-2013.
The plan continued to support more inclusive and
diversified economic growth and greater poverty reduction
through more targeted interventions in agriculture and rural
development, the private sector, governance and capacity
development, and regional economic integration.

Impact of operations. The completed National Road No. 6
under the GMS Cambodia Road Improvement Project
reduced travel time from 6 hours to 2 hours between the
Thai border at Poipet to the tourism hub of Siem Reap.
This led to an almost tripling of the number of foreign
tourists traveling by this road. The Tonle Sap Rural Water
Supply and Sanitation Sector Project expanded access to
safe water and sanitation, resulting in better health and
greater convenience, especially for women and girls.

Indonesia
Partnership priorities. ADB’s strategic priorities were updat
ed for better alignment with the government’s medium-term
development plan for 2010-2014. Its partnership priorities

aimed to support poverty reduction through more rapid, more
sustainable, and more inclusive economic growth. It focused
on improved infrastructure, better management of natural
resources, enhanced access to education, improved public
financial management, and climate change mitigation and
adaptation. A nonsovereign operation was prepared to develop
energy efficiency financing.

Impact of operations. The Java—Bali Electricity Distribution
Performance Improvement Project sought to mitigate the
impact of climate change through raising energy efficiency.
The government’s National Program for Community
Empowerment (PNPM), initiated in 2007 and supported by
ADB, provided financing to more than 36,000 villages for
building or upgrading more than 40,000 kilometers of rural
roads and 9,000 bridges, 1,000 irrigation systems, 10,450
clean water supply units, and 4,822 sanitation units. ADB’s
support to upgrade urban slums assisted some 180,000 poor
urban households in 32 cities. The Metropolitan Sanitation
Management and Health Project will further provide
2.7 million people access to improved sanitation. The Sixth
Development Policy Support Program continued reforms to
improve the investment climate, strengthen public financial
management and governance, and improve the access of the
poor to public services.

The Lao People’s
Democratic Republic

Partnership priorities. The evaluation of ADB’s assistance
program for the Lao PDR for 2000 to 2009 concluded
that assistance was successful, relevant, and effective.
ADB’s strategy and program for 2007-2011 remained
relevant to the country’s development context. Country and88 Asian Development Bank

Impact of operations. The $1.2 billion Nam Theun 2
Hydropower Project started operation under a concession
arrangement, generating revenues for the government
amounting to $6 million in fiscal year (FY) 2009 and
$10 million in FY2010 that were invested in education,
health, environment, and rural infrastructure. The concession agreement stipulated that operations of the hydroelectric power plant will be turned over to the government,
free of charge, at the end of 25 years.

Malaysia

Partnership priorities. Malaysia continued to firm up its
partnership with ADB under the BIMP—EAGA and the
IMT-GT, contributing projects to the fast-track pipeline
of priority infrastructure projects in the subregion and
collaborating on trade facilitation initiatives. Malaysia
also worked closely with ADB to develop regional finance
markets, including support to the Islamic Financial
Services Board to foster international prudential standards
and liquidity management for Islamic financing systems,
and the ASEAN capital market integration implementation
plan. With progress in these areas and the launching of the
Tenth Malaysia Plan, Malaysia agreed to develop a country
partnership with ADB.

Environmental Knowledge Base Evolves

An ADB-supported information center
has become a valuable resource for
development planners

overnment ministers in the Greater Mekong
G Subregion (GMS) are now able to map the results

of a regional technical assistance program that
has evolved into an important information tool for investment decision makers seeking environmentally sustainable
growth.

In 2010, the first regional grant/loan program for
scaling up investment in conservation areas was prepared
using a user-friendly geographicinformation system-based
Map Tool anchored to information provided by an
Environment Operations Center (EOC) in Bangkok.

The EOC has its origins in the GMS Core Environment
Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative
(CEP-BCI), which began in 2006 as a technical assistance
project to reconcile development pressures with the need to
conserve the subregion’s biodiversity and critical ecosystems.

The EOC serves as the technical secretariat to the
Working Group on Environment. Over the years, it has
developed capacity as an information and knowledge
clearinghouse for environmental management in the GMS.

A range of CEP-BCI interventions has focused on
reducing the environmental impact of economic corridors
and enhancing positive impacts, such as the new livelihood

The Philippines

Partnership priorities. ADB and the government
continued to emphasize fiscal consolidation, an improved
investment climate, and the accelerated attainment of the
MDGs. ADB, in close coordination with government,
private sector, and civil society, initiated the preparation
of a new country partnership strategy for 2011 to 2016 that
will be aligned with the Philippine Development Plan for

2010 to 2016.

Impact of operations. ADB helped the government expand
its social protection program, the Pantawid Pamilyang
Pilipino Program, and associated sector reforms through
the $400 million Social Protection Support Project,
using experience from globally successful conditional
cash transfer programs. The program will benefit more

hubs with remote, impoverished areas.

The initiative has piloted innovative planning
approaches to maintaining and restoring ecosystems
affected by development. These have included involving
local communities in adopting good land management
regimes, piloting of revolving funds to improve rural
livelihoods, and improvements in both government and
civil society's ability to plan for sustainable development.

than half a million poor families. ADB also supported
reforms in financial market regulation and intermediation
encompassing the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Insurance Commission, and the central bank’s oversight
of the finance sector, through a $200 million loan. ADB
also supported the new government in improving the
institutional framework for public—private partnerships.

Thailand

Partnership priorities. The country partnership strategy
for 2007-2011 remained relevant despite the global
economic crisis and domestic developments, with emphasis
on infrastructure, capital market, and environmentally
sustainable developments. Policy dialogue focused on
capital market development, the promotion of public—
private partnerships, and inclusive growth.Annual Report 2010 91

 

Developing the Policy Makers of the Future

Established in 2002, the Phnom Penh Plan
has already helped train more than
1,600 GMS officials

(PPP), established in 2002, aims to develop leaders

and change agents in the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS) who are capable of shaping policies and implementing GMS programs and projects effectively.

Total funding for the PPP since 2003 amounts to
$9.7 million, from ADB and the governments of the People’s
Republic of China, France, the Republic of Korea, and
New Zealand. Thanks to this support, the PPP has become a
core program for the GMS.

Implemented by a network of partners that targets GMS
civil servants, the PPP has, to date, delivered 85 learning
programs to 1,668 junior, mid-level, and senior GMS officials
on development management, regional cooperation, and
public policy. It also supports learning resource centers
at the ADB resident missions in Cambodia and in the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic.

The PPP Fellowship Program is aimed at executive and
leadership development of senior and mid-career civil
servants, while its research program supports collaborative
applied and policy-oriented studies on emerging issues

T he Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management

Impact of operations. ADB’s Capital Market Development
Program supported reforms for an expanded, diversified,
inclusive, and stable capital market leading to increased
domestic financing of investments. An ADB technical
assistance helped the government to address the enabling
environment for mainstreaming public—private partnerships.
Viet Nam

Partnership priorities. ADB’s country partnership
strategy and operational programs continued to focus on
economic growth, social development, and environmental
management. ADB’s engagement achieved these priorities
by developing infrastructure, such as road transport
networks, urban mass transit systems, water management
and irrigation, and rural infrastructure. The promotion of
small and medium-sized enterprises, a strengthened financial system (including the capital market), improvements
to efficiency in public administration and governance, and
enhancements to technical and vocational training helped

 

among GMS institutions. PPP research grants are made to
partner research institutions, universities, and think tanks in
the subregion to enhance their capacity.

To promote the dissemination of knowledge, regular
GMS dialogue and alumni meetings are supplemented by
newsletters, websites, and networking events.

Preparing operational plans in Phnom Penh using a GANTT chart

achieve these goals, as did supporting policy reform in
health workforce management and financing, and fostering
regional cooperation and integration.

Impact of operations. ADB, in collaboration with
development partners, helped accelerate project startup
and implementation through harmonized feasibility study
requirements, guidelines for environmental assessment,
resettlement and cost norms, and monitoring tools. ADB’s
Third Financial Sector Program Cluster, approved in 2007,
contributed to creating a more diversified, deeper, and
resilient sector. The second subprogram loan under the
cluster expanded reforms in the finance sector by
developing the securities and bond markets. It also increased
transparency and strengthened legal, regulatory, and
enforcement frameworks. The program helped sustain
high economic growth during the financial crisis in 2008
and 2009, which averaged about 6% and had increased
to almost 7% in 2010. It also reduced the vulnerability of
families falling into poverty because of the financial crisis.0
NONSOVEREIGN

OPERATIONS

 

Private sector investment is a primary engine of economic growth. In 2010,
ADB’s private sector operations became increasingly active in promoting
environmentally sustainable growth through clean energy projects and funds.
By the end of the year, the value of the nonsovereign portfolio of loans,
equity investments, and guarantees had reached $5.3 billion.Annual Report 2010 93

 

y catalyzing private investments and lending, ADB

mobilizes substantial resources for development. Its

support for innovative and replicable private sector
projects aims to promote broad-based, inclusive growth,
maximizing development impact and enhancing the
transfer of knowledge.

ADB’s assistance to private sector entities and/or
state-owned enterprises is provided through several
channels: loans without sovereign guarantees, equity
investments, credit enhancement products, and B-loans

 

Support for the MDGs through
Private Sector Operations

¢ The development impact of ADB's private
sector operations emanates from the broader
links between infrastructure and finance sector
development, economic growth, and poverty
reduction. In this way, all of ADB’s assistance
to the private sector helps advance, directly or
indirectly, progress toward eradicating extreme
poverty and hunger (Millennium Development
Goal [MDG] 1).

¢ To ensure environmental sustainability
(MDG 7), ADB seeks to set high standards
on environmental and social practices in the
projects it finances. An environmental and
social management system is required for all
private equity funds and financial intermediaries
receiving ADB assistance. Compliance with
ADB environmental and social safeguards is
ensured for infrastructure projects. The private
sector portfolio also includes investments in
water and wastewater projects that directly
contribute to achieving MDG 7. For example,
the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution
Control and Management Project, approved in
2010, will provide basic sanitation services to
2 million households in the north of the People’s
Republic of China.

* The private sector is specifically mentioned in
developing global partnerships (MDG 8) by
making available the benefits of information
and communication technologies. ADB’s private
sector operations help achieve this target
by investing in various telecommunications
projects in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Papua
New Guinea. MDG 8 also has targets addressing
the needs of landlocked countries—to which
ADB's support for projects like the Zvartnots
Airport in Armenia contributes directly.

 

 

 

(see Glossary), where ADB acts as the arranger of a
complete financing package for a project in which local
and international commercial banks and other financial
institutions participate. Companies receiving assistance
benefit both from the funds and from the expertise and
guidance of the ADB team.

ADB’s nonsovereign operations are integral to
the objectives of Strategy 2020, which aim to scale up
private sector development and private sector operations
in all operational areas, targeting 50% of annual operations
by 2020.

The number of developing member countries which
were assisted with nonsovereign projects has more than
doubled in the last decade, from 10 in 2000 to 23 in 2010.

PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS

Private sector operations accounted for the largest
part of ADB’s nonsovereign operations, with loans of
$1,053 million, equity investments of $243 million,
guarantees of $300 million, $320 million in B-loans, and a
$2 million grant in 2010.

Private sector operations are fully aligned with
Strategy 2020’s three development agendas: inclusive
economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth,
and regional integration. In supporting inclusive economic
growth, ADB’s private sector operations are active in
infrastructure and financial and capital market operations
(involving banks, non-bank financial institutions, and
private equity funds).

To support environmentally sustainable growth, ADB
is increasingly active in assisting clean energy projects
and funds. Approvals in 2010 included six projects
related to renewable energy, amounting to $523 million
and representing 27% of the total. One example is ADB’s
growing role in regional clean energy funds, described
in more detail on page 96. ADB encourages regional
integration directly through the Trade Finance Program,
which supported 440 intra-regional transactions, with
88% of the deals backing trade between two developing
member countries (See page 97).

Recently, private sector operations have increasingly
focused on countries eligible for concessionary finance under
the Asian Development Fund, and on more challenging94 Asian Development Bank

 

First Private Loan in Pacific Broadens

Communications

An ADB project in Papua New Guinea is
making affordable phone services available
to a quarter of the population

$25 million loan to Digicel Ltd. in Papua New
Aeon approved in September 2009, marked

ADB's first private sector infrastructure project
in the Pacific, a frontier region that lags far behind
much of the rest of Asia for want of investment in key
sectors of the economy.

Digicel is using the loan to expand and improve its
mobile phone network, with the aim of making available
high quality, affordable mobile telecommunications
services to 25% of the 7 million strong population by
2011. By adding switches, upgrading its billing system,
and expanding its network coverage to 500 sites
from the previous 400, mostly in rural areas, Digicel is
connecting peoples and communities that have had no
access to telecommunications.

For an island nation like Papua New Guinea, phone
connections will contribute to more efficient delivery
of services; for instance, natural disaster alerts can be
disseminated faster, improving public safety. There will
also be more school days in the highlands as teachers
need not take time off to trek for days to banks to
confirm if their wages have been paid.

sectors across all developing member countries. For
example, ADB approved its first infrastructure investment
in Armenia, as well as a loan for the first commercial solar
power plant in Thailand, and implemented its first private
sector infrastructure project in the Pacific. (See story
above.)

ADB also introduced new programs partnering with
private financial institutions to extend its reach to microfinance borrowers and to homeowners. In 2010, ADB
produced its first development effectiveness report for
private sector operations. The report is the first of an annual
series evaluating how successfully ADB’s assistance to the
private sector has promoted its development agenda. (See
page 93 for more information about how private sector
operations contribute to achieving the MDGs.)

The project also provides employee training and
development, and offers business opportunities to
staff, dealers, and contractors in underdeveloped areas
in the country. By engaging ADB, Digicel is ensuring
best practice in corporate governance and social
responsibility, including the monitoring of social and
environmental safeguards. Meanwhile, ADB’s support
encourages similar good practices among other firms,
and catalyzes commercial lending to the broader
private sector.

Digicel’s expanded operations will yield about
$90 million in license fees and corporate income
taxes over 10 years, providing crucial revenue for the
government to engage in other development initiatives.

 

In Papua New Guinea, phones will contribute to more efficient
service delivery

By the end of 2010, the private sector portfolio reached
$5.3 billion, consisting of $2.9 billion in direct loans,
$1.3 billion in equity investments, and $1.0 billion in
guarantees. The average project size was $76 million
over 18 projects (excluding the Housing Finance Facility
and the Microfinance Risk Participation Program approved
in 2010).

Two main objectives of private sector operations are
to create projects that can be replicated in different settings
and to catalyze additional private investment. Both aims depend
on transfers of knowledge and information to investors. By
leveraging its experience in innovative projects, ADB reduces
uncertainties about new business practices, technologies,
geographies, or sectors. Accordingly, approvals in 2010
included two follow-on projects that leveraged knowledgeAnnual Report 2010 95

A Catalyst for Clean Energy Investment

ADB provides early equity support to funds

scant attention to clean energy companies and projects

combating the effects of climate change. Today, it is a
sector of great interest for private equity funds seeking
returns for investors, and ADB has played a part in
highlighting the opportunities it represents.

Recognizing its key role as a catalyst in a market with
potential for supporting environmentally sustainable
development, in 2007, ADB allocated $100 million
for investment in clean energy funds. It invited fund
managers to create funds with investment strategies
aligned with ADB's goal of promoting alternatives to
coal, oil, and gas to fuel Asian growth.

By the end of 2009, two funds were operational. ADB
put $20 million into the $228 million China Environment
Fund Ill, managed by Beijing-based Tsing Capital, and
invested in the $54 million Asia Clean Energy Fund
managed by the Republic of Korea’s GS Group. Like any
private equity investor, ADB takes cash returns from the
funds’ investments.

By the end of 2010, another ADB-supported fund,
the South Asia Clean Energy Fund, achieved first
closing, raising a total of $57.62 million in equity and
debt commitments.

As a development institution, ADB is in a unique
position to shine a light on markets, giving commercial investors encouragement to enter. It has also

gleaned from previous interventions. Knowledge transfers are
also promoted through advisory support. For example, each
of ADB’s investments in private equity funds (accounting for
5% of the value of total private sector approvals) incorporated
an environmental and social management system (ESMS).
Technical assistance of $250,000 was also approved
to increase the use of ESMS in private sector financial
institutions. Programmatic approaches for microfinance and
housing finance (29% of total approvals) will disseminate
good practices for credit analysis in these sectors.

In general, ADB’s private sector policy restricts direct
funding to a maximum of 25% of any project’s total cost.
Cofinancing is, therefore, a very important instrument for

established numerous other initiatives and created
funds to increase knowledge and investments that
will help countries achieve energy security and a lowcarbon growth path.

ADB committed $1.56 billion to clean energy
projects in 2010, up from $230 million in 2003. Its
target is for annual investments of $2 billion by 2013.

With $6 trillion of new energy infrastructure needed
to meet an expected doubling of energy demand in Asia
between 2006 and 2030, increasing investments that
make possible the aggressive adoption of renewable
energy and energy-efficient technologies across the
region—and mitigate the effect of higher fossil fuel
consumption—is crucial. By helping draw in private
equity capital, ADB plays a small but significant role.

ADB to maximize support to the private sector. ADB applied
its cofinancing instruments to mobilize cofinancing with
a variety of partners, catalyzing $320 million of B-loans
for three projects with an aggregate cost of $1.8 billion.

The total financing mobilized by ADB’s private
sector investments ranged from a factor of 1.6 to 17 times
the amount of its own funding. In infrastructure, the
total estimated project cost of private sector projects was
approximately four times ADB’s funded participation.
The total target size of equity funds was 8.7 times ADB’s
approved investment, and total trade supported by the
Trade Finance Program was 2.3 times the amount of loans
and guarantees provided under the program.Annual Report 2010 97

 

NONSOVEREIGN PUBLIC SECTOR
OPERATIONS

Since September 2005, ADB has provided lending without
sovereign guarantee to public sector entities that are structurally separate from the sovereign or central government.
These entities include state-owned enterprises, government agencies, municipalities, and local government units.

Such public nonsovereign operations continued to
expand in 2010, consistent with the region’s growing
opportunities for public-private partnerships and local
government financing.

ADB contributed $130 million (19% of total capital)
to establish the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility
(CGIF), a trust fund of ADB jointly owned with the governments of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic
of Korea (ASEAN+3).

The facility is expected to support the development of
the bond markets in ASEAN+3 and promote the resilience
of finance sectors in the region. ASEAN+3 and ADB have
collaborated and coordinated policy while preparing the
CGIF, promoting harmonization of standards and practices
for bond issuance within ASEAN+3 and paving the way
for regional financial market integration.

ADB’s ongoing Trade Finance Program (TFP) provides
guarantees and loans through banks in support of trade.
In 2010, the TFP supported almost $2.8 billion in trade,
$1.5 billion of which was cofinancing from commercial
banks in TFP transactions. The TFP supported 783 transactions
and over 270 SMEs in the year. Over 440 transactions
supported intraregional trade, 386 of which supported trade

The South Asia Department is also collaborating
closely with the Government of India on a number of
nonsovereign/public—private partnership-enabling projects
in various sectors, including transport, water, and power.
The Central and West Asia Department is exploring several
initiatives to establish legal and regulatory frameworks to
attract nonsovereign equity and debt financing for infrastructure, and on developing public-private partnerships.
The East Asia Department processed a nonsovereign
loan of $34 million to support a large-scale 100-megawatt
wind power project in the People’s Republic of China,
furthering the country’s efforts to develop renewable
energy and combat climate change. The Southeast Asia
Department negotiated nonsovereign loans with banks in
Viet Nam and Indonesia to help small and medium-sized
enterprises and exporters gain access to new financial
products, helping to increase export competitiveness and
create jobs. In Indonesia, the Southeast Asia Department
aims to assist the development of energy efficiency
financing, providing exporting manufacturers access to
technologies to reduce their carbon footprint. In the Pacific,
ADB is creating an enabling environment for microfinance,
rural finance institutions, and small and medium-sized
enterprises through the Pacific Department’s Private
Sector Development Initiative and technical assistance.

years (including the $850 million approval of 31 March 2009) represents the maximum exposure TFP can assume at any point in time. This limit has never been breached. Because
maturities under TFP transactions tend to be short—average maturity in 2010 was 127 days—TFP exposure can revolve (be re-used) within a year. This explains how TFP's exposure
in the course of 2010 was greater than its $1 billion limit without actually breaching the limit at any point in time.GENERATING AND

SHARING KNOWLEDGE

 

ADB's knowledge solutions made a real, practical contribution in 2010 to
inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional
integration in developing member countries. Through regional forums, an
expanded online presence, and other publications, ADB was able to spread
information and offer its expertise. Strategy 2020 committed ADB to playing
an even bigger role in disseminating knowledge in the future.Annual Report 2010 99

 

nowledge is a powerful catalyst for propelling

development forward and enhancing its effects.

Recognizing this, Strategy 2020 committed ADB
to playing a bigger part in putting knowledge solutions
to work for inclusive economic growth, environmentally
sustainable growth, and regional integration in the Asia
and Pacific region.

In 2010, to further Strategy 2020’s complementary
agendas, the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI),
the Economics and Research Department, the Office of
Regional Economic Integration, and the Regional and
Sustainable Development Department designed and
transferred knowledge solutions with immediate effects
and catalytic outcomes in ADB’s developing member
countries. They were joined by regional departments and
13 Communities of Practice.

INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH

Aiming for inclusive economic growth means fostering
sustainable opportunities while ensuring broader and
equitable access. To this end, ADB continued initiatives
to expand human capacity and mitigate extreme inequalities; for example, in education, health, and social protection. Likewise, it promoted infrastructure investments that
achieve sustainable economic progress, connect the poor
to markets, and increase their access to productive assets.

ADB’s flagship publication, Asian Development
Outlook 2010, tracked the resilience of developing Asia
through the recent economic crisis and forecast a strong
recovery in the next 2 years. It also discussed the region’s
challenge to adjust monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate
policies to foster macroeconomic stability and sustained
growth. The Asian Development Outlook 2010 Update
identified threats to the region’s otherwise sunny shortterm horizon. Combined, these publications were viewed
online over 133,000 times and cited by the media over
500 times, strengthening ADB’s reputation as a source of
information and policy analysis.

Another flagship publication, Key Indicators for Asia
and the Pacific 2010, went beyond providing the latest
statistics. A special chapter examined the impacts on growth
of a rapidly expanding middle class in the region, stressing
that many people in this category with incomes just above

poverty levels are still vulnerable to external shock-induced
relapses into poverty. The publication, viewed online over
73,000 times, asserted that policies encouraging the creation of more well-paid jobs and advanced education and
health care can prevent the return to poverty.

A major study, Rebalancing for Sustainable Growth:
Asia s Postcrisis Challenge, identified structural issues and
policies that can help Asian policy makers raise domestic
and regional demand, thereby reducing dependence on
exports to developed economies and creating a basis for
sustainable long-term growth. The recommendations
provided background for a report by the Asian Policy
Forum (with the support of ADBJ) entitled Policy Recommendations to Secure Balanced and Sustainable Growth
in Asia. Published in October, it was submitted to the
G20; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and the People’s Republic of
China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3);
and East Asia Summit meetings.

ADB also organized the Regional Forum on Impact
of the Global Economic and Financial Crisis series to
explore initiatives to address the crisis at the country,
subregional, and regional levels. The Third Forum, held in
Manila in November, gathered finance ministers, central
bank governors, and government officials, and concluded
that developing Asia and the Pacific should implement
macroeconomic and regulatory policies that sustain recovery
and make their economies more resilient to crises. Also
highlighted was the imperative for better policy coordination.

To promote inclusive education, the Focus on Education
series added four key publications. These discussed
the means to address various forms of exclusion from
education, explored ways to enhance the role of the private
sector, and showcased Sri Lanka’s success with technical
and vocational education and training.

To develop governments’ capacity to address the needs
of the poor and vulnerable, ADB implemented technical
assistance grants that expanded conditional cash transfers
to poor households in the Philippines; sustained essential

expenditures on social services and protection in Georgia;
and alleviated the impacts of the recent economic crisis on
vulnerable individuals in the Cook Islands, the Marshall
Islands, and Tonga. Work on improving capacities to
diagnose constraints to inclusive economic growth and
improve development planning also expanded to Bhutan,
Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. The report, /ndonesia:
Critical Development Constraints, was launched while
work in the two other countries is ongoing. The Government of Indonesia expects the report to be a key input in its
dialogue with development partners.

ENVIRONMENTALLY
SUSTAINABLE GROWTH

Given that many of the poor depend on natural resources
for livelihoods, only growth that is environmentally
sustainable can eliminate poverty. To make this happen,
ADB supported the use of environmentally friendly
technologies, the adoption of environmental safeguards,
and development of institutional capacities to strengthen
their enforcement.

A key publication, Preview of Green Growth,
Resources and Resilience, was presented at the Sixth
Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific. This publication identified
key priorities, policy bottlenecks, and quick wins, while
pinpointing issues on which the region can lead the quest
for greener, more inclusive, and resilient growth.

The year also saw ADB’s experts increasingly
tapped by global authorities to provide critical inputs. For
instance, members of the Energy Community of Practice
were asked by the International Energy Agency and World
Energy Council for inputs on key knowledge products,
such as the World Energy Outlook 2010.

The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) received
support from the Bangkok-based and ADB-supported
Environment Operations Center. The center has its origins
in the GMS Core Environment Program and Biodiversity
Conservation Corridors Initiative to reconcile development pressures with the need to conserve the subregion’s
biodiversity and critical ecosystems. Efforts to build inhouse capacity continued.

ADB pursued information dissemination and public
outreach for the climate change conference in Cancun,
Mexico. ADB raised awareness in the region about climate
change and the conference through media tours and an
interactive page on its website. At the conference, it
helped draw attention to the innovative work being done
in Asia and the Pacific, and ADB’s catalytic role. This
included presentations on mainstreaming climate change
considerations into national development strategies across
the region, support for renewable energy mapping and
climate resilience in Tajikistan and other Central and West
Asian countries, the promotion of sustainable transport,
and scaling up international climate finance.

REGIONAL INTEGRATION

Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) has vast potential for accelerating economic growth, reducing disparities,
raising productivity and employment, and strengthening
institutions.

To further integrate RCI into its operations, ADB
supported regional and subregional cooperation programs,
helped develop cross-border infrastructure, advanced
trade and investment, promoted monetary and financial
initiatives, and encouraged cooperation in regional public
goods. The Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management, established in 2002, continued to support the GMS
regional cooperation initiative by developing the capacity
of leaders and key change agents to shape policies
and implement GMS programs and projects.

An important knowledge product supporting these
efforts was the Institutions for Regional Integration:
Toward an Asian Economic Community. Serving as the
final installment in the trilogy of studies on Asian economic
integration, this identified gaps in the process of institution
building, drew lessons from regional comparisons, and
recommended steps to strengthen RCI toward creating
an Asian economic community. Consultations in Asia,
Europe, and the United States generated rich discussion
among key policy makers, think tanks, and civil society.

Online tools are supporting ADB's regional integration activities

and recommended actions to address them. It received
strong attention from senior policy makers, academics,
researchers, and media. Senior policy makers and
international institutes continue to quote this study’s
estimates on infrastructure needs. Examples in 2010 are
the APEC Finance Ministers’ Growth Strategy Report to
the Leaders, Kyoto; UNESCAP Chairperson’s Summary
of the High-level
from Asia and the Pacific on the G20 Seoul Summit,
Bangkok; the speech of the First Deputy Managing
Director, International Monetary Fund, Ha Noi; and
OECD Southeast Asian Economic Outlook. ADB is
working to put into place the recommendations from the

Consultation on Perspectives

study, such as the establishment of the Asia Infrastructure Fund and the Pan-Asia Infrastructure Forum.

RCI has been evolving slowly in the Pacific. Today,
regionalism is led by the Pacific Plan drafted by the
Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. In 2010, ADB analyses
helped implement the plan. ADB also helped expand more
cost-effective regional public services, such as the Pacific
Aviation Safety Office, the Private Sector Development
Initiative, the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility,
and more.

Online information and collaboration tools buttressed
ADB’s activities for regional integration, among them the
AsianBondsOnline (ABO) website and the Asia Regional
Integration Center (ARIC) website.

The ABO website—an initiative of ASEAN+3
Finance Ministers—evolved from an information site on
local-currency sovereign bonds to a one-stop facility for
bond market participants with data, analysis, and original
content on bond market developments in emerging
East Asia. In 2010, ABO expanded coverage to include
corporate bonds. The website’s popularity among investors
has soared in recent years.

The ARIC website continues to serve as a knowledge
and information portal on RCI. It contains databases
of integration indicators, free trade agreements, and climate
change commitments. It also offers economic and financial
data; economic reports, such as the Asia Economic
Monitor; policy research; and daily summaries of financial
markets.

ADMINISTRATION

 

ADB continued to reprioritize staff development programs and build its people’s
skills in 2010. A new employee grading system was approved. The addition of
more staffing resources will strengthen resident missions and project quality,

help to expand private sector operations, and enhance knowledge management.
ADB is also streamlining and upgrading its business processes, compensation
and benefits schemes, administrative services, and information technology (IT)
systems.Annual Report 2010 103

 

HUMAN RESOURCES

aving motivated and talented people working in

a supportive environment remains a prime goal

for ADB, as the approval in January of a new
people engagement strategy and other human resources
initiatives attest. Key themes in ADB’s human resources
initiatives continue to be diversity, gender equality, and
inclusiveness.

New staff grading system. A new staff grading system was
approved in 2010, placing staff into three categories: International Staff (levels 1-10), National Staff (levels 1-7),
and Administrative Staff (levels 1-7). The system appropriately recognizes and acknowledges differences in roles,
qualifications, and skills sets. Other key features of the
new grading are the level complement system and the job
band mechanism, which together were designed to support
career progression of national and administrative staff.
A new job title framework was also developed to align
titles according to core operational and functional areas of
Strategy 2020 and to reflect more succinctly the roles and
functions of staff positions.

Staff development. ADB continued to reprioritize staff
development programs and to collaborate with internal
and external partners to enable staff to acquire skills
needed to implement operational programs. Through these
partnerships, programs in four areas were revamped: ADBspecific business model and procedures; sector, thematic,
and country; management and leadership development;
and the values that ADB espouses as an institution. As a
result, staff members at headquarters and field offices were
offered 129 training programs with 2,661 staff members
participating in 671 learning sessions.

STAFFING

Additional staffing requirements in 2011. Validation
of the workforce plan in 2010 resulted in the approval of
160 new positions for 2011, including 46 international staff,
59 national staff, and 55 administrative positions. These
additional staffing resources were agreed to strengthen
ADB’s capacity in resident mission operations; enhance
project quality; promote private sector development,

private sector operations, and risk management; and
upgrade knowledge management.

2010 staffing. ADB’s staff as of 31 December 2010 totaled
2,833 from 59 of its 67 members: 6 members of Management, and 1,024 international and 1,803 national and administrative staff, of whom 565 (about 19.9%) were in field
offices. Appointments and departures numbered 148 and 51
among international staff and 210 and 77 among national
and administrative staff. There were no departures from
Management staff, but one vice-president joined in 2010.
Women accounted for 29.1% of the international staff.

ORGANIZATIONAL AND BUSINESS
PROCESS REVIEW

Creation of a new vice-president office for private sector
and cofinancing operations. A fifth vice-presidency was
created in 2010 to support expanding private sector operations and fund mobilization.

Optimization of internal organization and span of
control. Following significant staff increases in operations
departments, a review of the span of control of directors
and country directors across ADB in 2010 concluded
that, in some areas, directors were supervising too many
staff or weakly related sector or thematic boundaries. The
review resulted in the creation of four additional operations
divisions and the establishment of four new deputy country
directors, all of which will become effective in 2011.
The deputy country director positions will strengthen the
management structure and increase efficiency in the resident
missions in the People’s Republic of China, India, Pakistan,
and Viet Nam.

Strengthening resident mission operations. The institutional and management structure of resident missions
continued to be strengthened to support project quality
and an expansion in operations through (i) delineating
more clearly their three core functions—country economics,
strategy, and programming; country operations; and
finance and administration; (i1) establishing and/or formalizing deputy country director positions, particularly for
larger resident missions; and (iii) firming up the resident
mission management team concept.

Organization review of support departments. Independent
consultants conducted a review of the Controller and IT
departments to streamline processes, enhance efficiencies,
and strengthen governance. The consultants issued their
report in November 2010. Management is formulating plans
to address the recommendations and start implementing
them early in 2011.

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS

The Staff
Salaries and Benefits was undertaken, with recommenda
Comprehensive Review of International

tions submitted to the Board of Directors in November.
The Board approved the retention of the market-based
approach and adoption of changes to the international
staff compensation methodology, such as flexibility in
determining the overall average increase to achieve full
parity with the market by 2015 (prioritizing levels 1-6),
suspension of the bonus scheme until 2015, reallocation
of the bonus pool to salary increases to reward individual
performance with more differentiation, and introduction of
team rewards and spot awards.

A 1.7% weighted average increase in the salary structure and a 3.3% salary increase for international staff were
approved. With the reallocated bonus pool, the total average
salary increase is 4.3%. Based on the new grading system,
a 3.9% weighted average increase in salary structure and
a 7.6% salary increase were approved for national staff
and administrative staff at headquarters. A 10% average
salary increase for national and administrative staff in
field offices is being considered. The new grading system,
salary structures, and salary increases are effective from
1 January 2011.

With the endorsement of the Pension Committee,
Management approved ADB’s additional contribution
of $63.147 million to the Staff Retirement Plan for the
plan year | October 2009 to 30 September 2010. This is to
partially reduce the plan’s unfunded past service liability
and potentially reduce the revealed contribution rate for the
Staff Retirement Plan in future years.

INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE
EXPENSES

Internal administrative expenses totaled $430.57 million
including the administrative expenses for Independent
Evaluation Department (IED) of $8.22 million, compared
to the budget of $439.49 million (including the budget for
IED of $8.36 million). Of the total savings of $8.92 million,
about 1.82% of the 2010 internal administrative expenses
budget amounting to $8.0 million is being carried forward
to 2011. An overrun of $0.51 million under the Board
of Governors mainly to support the host government
(Uzbekistan) in providing logistics to the 43rd annual meeting
was met through reallocation from the general contingency,
while overruns in certain budget items in the operational
and administrative expenses budget categories were fully
met through inter-item transfers or reallocations within the
same budget categories. Savings in the operational expenses
budget category were mainly attributed to lower-thanbudgeted utilization for (i) benefits items such as medical
insurance, education assistance and severance pay, and
(ii) other expenses such as relocation, staff consultants, and
business travel. These savings were partly offset by overruns
in staff benefits, mainly because of additional contribution
to the staff retirement fund to meet increasing funding
requirements, rental subsidy, special allowances to staff in
field offices and increased staff development program. The
savings in the administrative expenses were realized due to
lower-than budgeted utilization for communications, office
supplies, equipment, maintenance and support, insurance,
and miscellaneous expenses. These savings were partly offset
by overruns in contractual services largely for information
technology services, and in depreciation, primarily because
of completion of various IT projects under the Information
System and Technology Strategy, Phase II, completion of
various subprojects under the rehabilitation of HQ buildingAnnual Report 2010 105

 

 

ADB has continued to reprioritize development programs to help staff acquire necessary skills

and enhancement of security, and technology and automation
systems, for which depreciation began in 2010.

The internal administrative expenses budget for 2011
is $496.35 million, including a general contingency of 1%
($4.99 million) and after deducting $7.21 million of service
charges estimated to be recoverable from administrating trust
funds of multilateral and bilateral institutions. The increase of
$56.90 million or 12.9% over the 2010 budget reflects a price
increase of 4.9% and a volume growth of 8%. The 2011 net
IAE budget of $496.35 million consists of $8.95 million for
IED and $487.40 million for ADB excluding IED.

In addition to internal administrative expenses, the
2011 budget also includes an annual capital budget of
$6.97 million, mainly to fund cyclical capital expenditures
for headquarters and field offices.

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES

During 2010, the Office of Administrative Services (OAS)
focused on meeting the needs of an expanding bank.
Additional office space was created in the headquarters
and Joy~Nostalg building, which now accommodates
112 staff. In addition, OAS renovated the cafeteria and
built a mezzanine floor, renovated the exterior of the building and fire management system, and began construction
of a multistory car park.

OAS initiated the green building (Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design) certification from
the US Green Building Council, introduced three hybrid
vehicles, built a rainwater harvesting facility, and laid the
groundwork to generate solar energy at headquarters.106 Asian Development Bank

 

OAS enhanced its information management role
through iLink products and information access to communities of practice through mobile and Google map-based
applications. The Library Services Steering Committee
(2010-2012) was reconvened to formulate user-driven
action plans. The function of the information coordinators
was expanded to include private sector research.

OAS launched the ADB EmergencyAlert communication tool and the community warden system to better
respond to emergencies; formed the interdepartmental
Security Advisory Group; supported field office security;
strengthened business continuity procedures; enhanced
its community relations program through equipment
donations; and continued the rollout of eTrip, the online
mission travel booking tool.

OAS also reviewed its internal business processes to
streamline critical processes and continued to automate
asset inventory and monitoring. Partnership with service
providers was enhanced through management workshops
and client orientation training to strengthen contract
management and improve service delivery.

INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AND TECHNOLOGY

In line with targeted completion of the Information
Systems and Technology Strategy (ISTS II) in December
2011, major projects were finished in 2010 on ADB operations and integrated services covering project and portfolio management for sovereign operations, internal travel,
consulting, and procurement systems. The ADB portal was
completed, and several departmental websites were given
a single look and feel.

Despite an increase in
disbursement transaction
volume of 16%, the average
disbursement processing
time was reduced by 5%

in 2010

Enterprise architecture was established to provide a solid
foundation for ADB’s IT systems. Several obsolete systems
were replaced with standard Oracle enterprise resource planning platforms, and in preparation for the integrated applications being rolled out for ISTS II, new telecommunications
technology was put in place to increase bandwidth connectivity with field offices, network security was strengthened,
and server capacity and data storage increased. ADB is also
expanding the use of videoconferencing.

The IT department participated to successfully obtain
SOX Attestation over internal controls by external auditors.
This exercise has been embedded into IT to sustain ADB’s
continuing commitment to standards and compliance. The
IT governance model was strengthened along with the
implementation of a comprehensive project management
framework to further align IT to business requirements,
following international IT standards.

Completion of several other infrastructure projects
took account of growing demand for access to IT and
requirements to expand services within cost constraints.
Upgrades were completed on office automation software
and e-mail services. Mobile computing made e-mail access
available for most staff regardless of location, while the
Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST)
extended services to a 12-hour window for headquarters
and field offices and will progress to 24/7 service and
support.

LOAN, GRANT, AND TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE DISBURSEMENTS,
AND ACCOUNTING

The Controller’s Department (CTL) continued to streamline its business processes in the area of loan, grant, and
technical
improving both its services to external and internal clients,

assistance disbursements, and accounting,
and its efficiency in carrying out its functions. It has
actively contributed to and implemented the recommendations and revisions from ADB’s Streamlined Business
Processes (SBP) 2010 initiative, in support of ADB’s goal
of Better and Faster Loan Delivery.

The implementation of the revisions has resulted in
increased coordination and interaction with the variousAnnual Report 2010 107

 

departments during the project processing stage to further
enhance one of CTL’s most critical functions: ensuring
higher quality project design in the areas of fiduciary
control, and use of the most efficient and effective financing
and disbursement arrangements for the project.

Enhancements and revisions to CTL’s Service Level
Standards (SLS) for Disbursement Processing (introduced
in 2009), along with a series of process streamlining
measures in its disbursement operations, has helped the
department to manage ADB’s continually expanding
portfolio efficiently. Despite an increase in disbursement
transaction volume of 16%, the average disbursement
processing time was reduced by 5% in 2010. The efficiency
gains can be attributed to these factors:

¢ The streamlining measures have resulted in further
empowerment of CTL’s national staff, resulting in
a flatter organizational structure within CTL, and
improved responsiveness to ADB’s clients.

* The initiation of delegation of disbursement processing
of grants to the disbursement units located in resident missions, further reducing the required processing
time, and increasing communication with developing
member country clients for these transactions.

The improvements and revisions to CTL’s SLS have
served as a valuable tool in enhancing the effectiveness of
its capacity development initiatives for developing member
country borrowers, executing agencies, implementing
agencies, and ADB staff, by allowing for the design of
more customized seminars and workshops tailored to
client-specific capacity needs.

In 2010, CTL provided 27 seminars and workshops
for over 1,000 participants in DMCs. Disbursement units
in resident missions have also played a critical role in this
area, by providing numerous capacity-building activities
to ADB’s clients in DMCs. The resident mission disbursement units’ contributions in this area are expected to
continue to expand, in an effort to boost CTL’s client
service and responsiveness further.

CTL is currently working with the Office of Information Systems and Technology to enhance its systems

for loan, grant, and technical assistance disbursements,
and accounting. A new loan accounting and servicing
website is under development and will be available for
external and internal clients in 2011, providing comprehensive loan-related data and tools for loan administration. When complete, the outcomes of this initiative
will significantly improve client service, efficiency, and
internal control.

FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Controller’s Department revised accounting policies
and strengthened financial reporting procedures in line with
the response of global accounting standards to the financial crisis. CTL conducted a preliminary study on international financial reporting standards (IFRS), considering
a possible future transition to IFRS from US generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP)-based standards.
CTL and the Staff Development Unit arranged training on
IFRS to strengthen staff capacity in this area.

CTL continued facilitating Management’s assertion
and the external auditor’s attestation on internal controls
for financial reporting, which ADB started in 2008 to
improve corporate governance. In 2010, the assertion and
attestation for OCR and Special Funds (except for ADBI)
was accomplished with an unqualified opinion from the
external auditor, Deloitte & Touche. In addition, Management expanded the testing to include trust funds in 2010.
This process strengthened staff awareness of internal
controls. Training on internal controls, risk assessments,
and testing skills was strengthened.

CTL provided accounting support for new trust
funds, including the Credit Guarantee and Investment
Facility, the ADB Climate Technology Fund, and the
ADB Strategic Climate Fund, to ensure ADB can meet its
fiduciary responsibility as custodian of the funds it administers. CTL, with the assistance of the Office of Information
Systems and Technology, implemented a new accounting
system for resident missions and offices. Together with the
Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department,
CTL also centralized payroll processing. These changes
have improved work efficiency, data reliability, and
internal controls of financial transactions in field offices.CHAPTER 15

GLOSSARY

B-loan. A tranche of a direct loan nominally advanced
by ADB, subject to eligible financial institutions’ taking
funded risk participations within such a tranche and
without recourse to ADB. It complements an A-loan
funded by ADB.

Cofinancing. The shared financing with a third party
(other than the project sponsors) on a transaction-specific
basis for a project (e.g., loan or technical assistance)
or program associated with ADB funds, risk taking, or
administrative involvement. It can be with or without a
formal coordination agreement among the financing
partners. The main sources of cofinancing are official and
commercial.

Direct value-added cofinancing. Cofinancing with active
coordination and formal agreements among financing
partners that bring about defined client benefits, including
contractual commitments by ADB (such as for credit
enhancement, syndication, or financial administration) to
facilitate mobilization, administration, or participation in
cofinancing.

Modality. Involves the specific application of instruments
(loan, equity investment, grant, project confinancing, and
guarantee) classified as investment support, policy-based
support, other budget support (countercylical support
facility), or technical and advisory support.

Multitranche financing facility. A debt-financing facility
to target discrete, sequential components of large standalone projects; slices (or tranches) of sector investment
programs over a longer time frame than the current norm;
financial intermediary credit lines; and guarantees.

Nonsovereign operations. Refer to an ADB-financed
transaction with a subsovereign, state-owned enterprise,
other public—private entity, or private sector entity as
obligor or investee, normally without direct sovereign
indemnity.

Public sector nonsovereign transactions. Refers to loans,
guarantees, and syndications to or for enterprises that are
majority owned by public parties (defined as entities with
more than 50% of their capital held publicly).

Sovereign, nonsovereign. ADB lending is classified as
sovereign or nonsovereign. A sovereign loan is guaranteed by
the national government, while a nonsovereign loan is not.
